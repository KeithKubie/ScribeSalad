00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.020
“Geez”

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.320
"Are you sure it has enough salt?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.900
I feel like it needs more salt,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.820
no? Okay, no.”

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.660
“How they do it on TV:

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.360
‘And now we’re whipping all the eggs together.’”

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.120
Hi, I’m Yara.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.380
And that’s me cooking Iranian food with my mom.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.120
In episodes 1 and 2,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.200
I spent some time with LA’s Iranian community,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.860
also known as Tehrangeles,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.860
to talk to other Iranian-Americans 
about living and growing up in the U.S.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.360
And now I’m going back home to figure 
out what being Iranian-American means to me,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.100
and how my family’s story plays into all of this.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.300
I’m one of the estimated one million 
Iranian-Americans who live in the U.S.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.680
I was born and raised in northern California,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.060
but like a lot of Americans with immigrant parents,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.040
I sort of have this dual identity.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.140
On the one hand, I’m very American.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.640
“Cheese.”
 
“Cheese.”

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.480
But I’m also very Iranian.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.140
Here in the States, both of my 
parents are small business owners.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.960
My mom runs a clothing 
boutique and lives in San Francisco.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.500
My dad owns a Subway and lives an hour south.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160
He came to the U.S. as a teenager to get an education

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.980
right before Iran’s 1979 revolution.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.920
A few years later,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.940
when Iran was in the middle of a war with Iraq,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.880
my dad went back and married my mom.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300
Together, they moved to the U.S. and eventually had …

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
me.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.640
“We’re here in my dad’s Subway.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.300
We’re gonna go inside and see what he’s up to.”

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.760
My dad’s owned this place for over 30 years.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.860
I practically grew up here.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.780
And I ate a lot of his sandwiches.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480
Especially on my birthdays.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.040
My dad’s been here so long that 
he’s really gotten to know his customers.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.140
And the pigeons outside.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.020
My dad’s definitely changed while living in America.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.740
Before, he wanted to move back to Iran,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.160
he almost always spoke Persian.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.400
And he hated having dogs in the house.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.860
Now ... he happily lives in the suburbs,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.900
mostly speaks English,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.220
“Happy holidays and happy new year,”

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.760
and loves dogs.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.680
“Yeah, good boy.”

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.540
But Iran is still very much a part of who he is.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.440
We even found this under his carpet.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.720
"It’s a map of Iran.”

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.780
Before my dad came to the U.S.,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.120
the Iranian revolution was picking up steam.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880
He was getting involved with the protests

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.600
and his parents were concerned for his safety.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.840
“In Iran, the thing was changing.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.140
You would see people come to the streets

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560
and going against the Shah of Iran.”

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.980
“All of a sudden

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920
my father came to the house and says,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.260
'It's time for Amir to go to United States.’ 
I was almost 17.”

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.320
“Why did he say that?”

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.900
“Oh, because they said if Amir stays here, 
he may be killed.”

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.780
Back then, in 1979,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.860
Iranians made up the largest 
group of foreign students in America.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820
There were over 50,000 of them.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.980
But then the hostage crisis happened.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.660
That’s when Iranian revolutionaries

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.040
determined to end U.S. influence in Iran, held dozens of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040
Americans captive for over a year.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.340
In response, president Carter 
cut diplomatic ties with Iran

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.020
and temporarily banned most 
Iranians from entering the country.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.580
And all the Iranian students already in the U.S.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.280
had to report to immigration 
authorities to prove they were legal.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.100
Several thousand were deported back to Iran as 
anti-Iranian protests took place across the country.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.440
In some cases, immigration 
officers showed up at people’s homes.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.780
“There was somebody knocking at the door.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.820
We were four guys in a three-bedroom apartment.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.180
and there were two gentlemen with a tie, blue shirt,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.680
‘Yes, sir?’

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.320
‘We are here from Immigration office 
and we’re going to check all the passports.’

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.940
All of us were shaking. Maybe they want to deport us.”

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.800
“You’ve never told me about this. 
I’ve never heard this from you.”

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.040
“Oh, it was so fearful.”

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.660
My dad earned a master’s degree in 
mechanical engineering here in California.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.440
But when he finally got his green card,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.400
he didn’t have much luck finding a job in his field,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.760
which is how he ended up getting involved with Subway.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.760
“I should take this.”

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.560
“So what you’re gonna have to do, you get some yogurt.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.860
And then I’m going to add a 
little bit of saffron to the yogurt.”

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.500
“Who taught you how to make these things?”

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.780
“My mom, she was and is an excellent cook.”

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.820
“Yeah, she is.”

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.860
“And my grandma.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.900
I used to watch them for like minutes, hours.”

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.400
“My mom is cutting herbs!”

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.940
“But you know, the smell of it makes me nostalgic.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.760
It still takes me back there.”

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.360
My mom grew up in Tehran.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.940
When she came to the U.S. with 
my dad after graduating high school,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.000
they thought they’d only be here for just a few years.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.820
But an eight-year war had 
broken out between Iran and Iraq.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.260
Moving back to Iran had to be put on hold.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.860
My mom did go back to visit during the war.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.180
What she saw of her country shocked her.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.980
“Everybody was mourning.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.500
Everything was black.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.360
The cemetery was full.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.900
People were sad.”

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.320
“You didn’t expect to stay in the United States.”

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.460
“Oh no. I had no desire.”

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.880
“I was homesick.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.880
I was missing my mom, simply my mom,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.780
my girlfriends from high school,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.720
my dad, my home.”

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.460
My parents got divorced about 20 years ago.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.480
But away from her family, and on her own,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.400
my mom started her own business.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.520
“The whole philosophy, the 
concept of operating this business

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.780
I think is more of the Persian

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.520
– or Middle Eastern – than western world.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.700
We sit down, we talk, we have tea 
together, we have sessions together.”

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.500
Iranian culture has also played a 
part in how my parents raised me.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.260
“When you were born, we – both of us – tried to raise you that, with Iranian culture.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.100
Always, me and your mom thought 
one day, we’re going to go back to Iran.”

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.500
“We were talking Farsi to you, yeah.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.780
We, me and your dad, we never spoke English to you.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.960
The only time you were getting exposed to 
English was when you were watching cartoon TV.”

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.800
“What was that like. What was I watching?”

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.700
“Barneys.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.100
That purple character every morning.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.060
Huge thing.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.060
Barneys, Barneys, Barneys.”

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.980
“Barney. Barney.”

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.980
Growing up, we’d go back to Iran when we could.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.240
I wasn’t too crazy about it as a kid,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.480
but developed a huge interest 
in going back as I got older.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.580
To the point that I moved there for two years to 
work as a journalist and translator after college.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.140
There was just something unbelievably 
wholesome about the unconditional love

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.700
I’d receive from my enormous family.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.260
Something about Iran just sucked me in.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.840
Maybe it was because I sometimes 
felt out of place in America –

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.640
and wanted to flesh out this other side of my identity.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.260
Even still, I didn’t feel fully Iranian in Iran.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.820
People told me I spoke 
Persian with an American accent,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.500
that my hand gestures totally
gave away my American identity,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.940
or that the way I thought about things was different.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.080
But growing up Iranian in America had its hurdles, too.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.840
“Did they ever bully you?”

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.380
“Well there was one instance,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.500
we were playing soccer,

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.780
and I remember this kid and he looked at me,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.080
and this was after 9/11.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.580
I think I'd maybe kicked the ball improperly,

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.780
and yeah he looked at me and he was like,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.520
‘Oh yeah? That terrorist?’

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.140
So, I know for me, like, the Iranian 
identity always came through, you know.”

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.780
“Yeah.”

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.320
“I am very obviously different 
looking and different maybe sounding,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.240
and maybe I have a funny name. Right. 
It’s Yara Elmjouie, like, what is that?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.920
Where is that from?”
“It’s a beautiful name."

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.200
“I like it now. I love it today,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.340
but back then, when you’re kind of 
trying to blend in, it’s different, right?”

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.580
“I remember you told me one day ‘I don’t like my name.’

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.780
And I said, ‘Everybody loves your name.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.200
Everybody thinks it is such a beautiful name.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.520
What should I have called you?’

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.480
You go, ‘David?’

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.760
I said, ‘Between all these names, David?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.520
Why David?’
‘David is cool.’

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.180
I said, ‘Well how about, “DAVEED” at least.’

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.820
“Or ‘Davood.’”

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.960
“Or ‘Davood!’"

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.600
My parents haven’t lost sight of their Iranianess.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.840
But they’ve now spent far more of their lives 
here in the U.S. than they ever did in Iran.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.000
My dad ended up getting 
remarried to a Salvadoran woman,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.200
and now I have two sisters.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.340
Here’s one of them.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.880
“Hey!”

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.820
“Hi! How are you? Good to see you!

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.620
I got mom’s birthday cake.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.020
Hi. Hello! Hello guys.”

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.180
“As you see, I am 58 years old almost, 17 years in Iran,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.960
almost 39 years in United States.”

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.380
“Now, today, I have a choice 
of packing and moving back there.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.260
I have a choice of living here.”

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.760
“What choice have you made?”

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.500
“This is home for me.”

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.300
“Here in California.”

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.880
“This is home for me.”

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.360
“Being Iranian-American, doesn’t matter if we live in LA

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.680
or we live in New York,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.640
we came here as a student.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.440
We didn’t want to stay here,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.740
but

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.900
this country made us love this country.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.820
And we love it here, all of us.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.220
Sorry.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.780
So, we are both Iranian-American,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.660
and nobody can separate us.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.060
Sorry.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.300
This is our identity.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.680
We are two arms.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.240
You want me to cut one?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.420
I can’t.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.780
You want me to cut this one, I can't.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.080
And this is my American. I am Iranian.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.980
I’ve talked a lot about feeling in between in this series

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.040
in some sort of limbo between 
one identity and the other.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.240
But talking to my mom and my dad, it got me thinking.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.680
Maybe I don’t need to live my 
life feeling divided and in-between.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.720
Maybe I can firmly, and confidently, 
embrace both identities simultaneously.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.180
I mean, in a sense, what’s more American than that?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.920
“Okay, so I just put my family on display for you guys,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.100
hope you enjoyed hearing about my story

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.240
as a child of immigrants.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.880
But now I’m going to turn it over to you.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.460
What is your family’s immigration story like,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.800
and how has it shaped who you are?

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.980
Don’t forget to subscribe

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.280

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.360
where we break down some myths 
about the Iranian-American community.”
