00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.680
Let's do some problems that
deal with equations and

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.405
inequalities.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:07.300
So let's start with this
problem 2 here.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.850
So it says define the variables
and translate the

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.430
following expressions
into inequalities.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.990
Let's see, part a: A bus can
seat 65 passengers or fewer.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:29.860
So in Part a, let's let x be
the number bus can seat.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.150
So the number of people you
can sit in the bus, we're

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.350
going to call that x.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.010
And they're saying that
the bus can fit

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.800
65 people or fewer.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.610
So x has to be less than
or equal to 65.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.740
And we put that equal there,
that less than or equal,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740
because it could be 65.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.810
It doesn't say definitely
less than 65.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.490
It could be 65 passengers
or fewer.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.150
So that's why it's less
than or equal to.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.770
b: the sum of two consecutive
integers is less than 54.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.800
So if you say x is first
integer, and then x

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.300
plus 1 is the next.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.280
They're saying the sum of these
two is less than 54.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.520
So x plus 1 is less than 54.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.330
And if you actually wanted to
figure out what x is, what the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.090
first integer is, you could just
solve this inequality.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.340
c: an amount of money is
invested at 5% annual

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:48.970
interest. Let x be the
amount of money.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.530
It's invested at 5% annual
interest. The interest earned

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
at the end of the year is
greater than or equal to $250.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.870
So what's the interest earned
at the end of the year?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.830
It's the amount of money you
invest times your annual

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.000
interest rate, times 5% or, if
you write this as a decimal ,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.700
it's 0.05 So 0.05 or 5% times
the amount of money invested,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.030
that is going to be greater than
or equal to-- this is the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.960
amount of interest earned --that
is going to be greater

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.340
than or equal to $250.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.460
So that's what we did.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.650
We set up the problem
into an inequality.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.900
And part d.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.700
You buy hamburgers at a
fast food restaurant.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.280
A hamburger costs $0.49.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.150
You have at most
$3.00 to spend.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.410
Write an inequality
for the number of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.130
hamburgers you can buy.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.280
So let's change the letters.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.235
Let h be equal to the number
of hamburgers.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.280
So the total I'm going to
spend is the number of

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.830
hamburgers times the amount
per hamburger, times 0.49.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.430
That's the total amount I'm
going to spend, and that can

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.050
at most be $3.00.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.520
So it has to be less than
or equal to $3.00.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.520
So that is our inequality.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.150
Let's do problem 4 here.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.280
Check that the given number
is a solution to the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670
corresponding inequality.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.030
All right.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.100
Part a here.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.840
So the inequality is 2 times
x plus 6 is less

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.700
than or equal to 8x.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.810
And they're saying that x is
equal to 12 is a solution.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.290
Let's verify that.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.835
So if you put a 12 here-- do it
in a different color --if

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.450
this is a 12 and then
this would be a 12.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.140
So you get 2 times 12 plus 6.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.860
So this is 2 times 18 is less
than or equal to 8 times 12.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.080
8 times 12 is 96.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.800
2 times 18 is 36.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.360
So 36 is definitely less
than or equal to 96.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.050
So this x is equal to
12 is a solution.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.300
Part b.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:38.990
We have 1.4 times z plus 5.2
is greater than 0.4z.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.550
For the solution, if z is equal
to minus 9-- negative 9

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.110
I should say.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.995
I always say minus 9.

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.580
The correct wording
is negative 9.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.910
So let's put a negative
9 here.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.590
So it's 1.4-- they're saying
that that's one of the

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.760
solutions --times negative 9
plus 5.2 is greater than 0.4

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.930
times negative 9.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.060
And I'm just going to use the
calculator on this one just

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.130
for the sake of time.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.480
You could do that in your
head if you like.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:27.940
So we have on the left-hand
side, 1.4 times negative 9.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.830
That's equal to minus 12.6.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:40.200
So this is minus is 12.6 plus
5.2 is equal to negative 7.4.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.770
So this left-hand side
is negative 7.4.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.990
Then they're claiming that that
is greater than-- This I

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.020
can do in my head.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.790
4 times 9 is 36.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.480
I'm going to have to put a
negative sign because it's a

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.860
positive times a negative.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.930
And I have one number behind
the decimal point.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:11.040
So this is saying negative 7.4
is greater than negative 3.6.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.510
This isn't true.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.910
If you draw a number
line right here.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.530
So if this is 0, this
is negative 3.6,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.520
this is negative 7.4.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.700
It's less than negative 3.6.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.820
So this is not true.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.480
I'll do it in a big red color.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.170
That is not true.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.840
z is equal to negative 9 is
not a solution of this

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.220
inequality right there.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.760
It does not satisfy
that inequality.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.010
Part c.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:57.220
They have minus 5/2 y plus 1/2
is less than negative 18.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.640
And they're claiming y is
equal 40 is a solution.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.670
Let's try that out.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.840
So minus 5/2-- instead of y I
can write 40 just to see if it

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.120
works --plus 1/2 is less
than minus 18.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.610
That's their claim.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.220
So 5/2 times 40-- Divide
the numerator and

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.950
denominator by 2.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.450
So 1 becomes a 20.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.740
So it becomes minus 5 times 20
is minus 100 plus 1/2 is less

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.110
than minus 18.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:33.580
Well, you could view this
as negative 99 and 1/2.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.160
You could do that in your head
if you like, or you could view

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.090
this as 99.5-- you're adding
0.5 to minus 100 --is less

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.290
than negative 18, which
is definitely true.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.630
This is more negative
than this is.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.620
So this is correct.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.720
And then finally part d.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.785
Let me scroll down or let me
clear some space for myself.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.810
Part d.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.000
They're saying 80 is greater
than or equal to 10

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.210
times 3t plus 2.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.770
And they're claiming that t is
equal to 0.4 as a solution.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.040
Let's try that out.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:31.860
80 is greater than or equal
to 3 times 0.4 plus 2.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.380
So that's saying that 80 is
greater than or equal to 10

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:41.210
times-- 3 times 0.4 is 1.2
--plus 2, or 80 is greater

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.540
than or equal to 10 times--
This is 3.2.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:54.040
Or that 80 is greater than
or equal to 32, which is

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.220
absolutely right.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.860
So d is also a valid solution.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.110
Problem 5.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.270
The cost of a Ford Focus
is 27% of the

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.880
price of a Lexus GS450H.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.650
If the price of a Ford is
$15,000-- So the Ford is equal

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.150
to $15,000, what is the
price of a Lexus?

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.690
So they tell us that the Ford
is equal to 27% of the price

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.260
of the Lexus.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:36.485
Is equal to 0.27, or 27%, times
the price of a Lexus.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.920
I could write F and L,
but I'll just write

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.430
out the words there.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.420
So the Ford we know
is $15,000.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:52.240
So we know that $15,000 is equal
to 27%, 0.27, times the

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.560
price of a Lexus.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.030
So to figure out the price of
a Lexus we just divide both

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:07.170
sides by 0.27, and divide
this side by 0.27.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.040
That just becomes a 1.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:15.220
And so you have the price of
your Lexus is equal to $15,000

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.990
divided by 0.27.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.020
See what we get.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.270
So let me clear it.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:30.370
We have 15-- 1, 2, 3, $15,000
divided by 0.27 is equal to

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.370
$55,555.55.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:39.000
So we'll say $55,556
just to round up.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.920
So this is equal to $55,556.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.800
So you're spending a lot more on
the Lexus than you would on

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.120
the Ford Focus.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.520
It better be a much
better car.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.860
Finally, number 6.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.520
On your new job you can be
paid in one of two ways.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.580
All right.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.130
You can either be paid--
So this is option one.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.930
And let's write option 2 here.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.350
You can either be paid $1,000
per month plus 6% commission

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.340
of total sales.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:28.050
So let's let s is equal
to total sales.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.410
So your first option you'll be
paid $1,000 per month plus 6%

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.230
of total sales.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.510
So on a monthly basis you'll
be paid $1,000 plus 6% of

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.320
total sales.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.100
So plus 6% times your
total sales.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.020
That's option 1.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.470
That's right there.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.290
You can either be paid $1,000
per month plus 6% commission

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.730
of total sales.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.185
And then option 2 is
$1,200 per month--

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:00.420
Let me switch colors.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:07.890
Option 2-- I'll do it in yellow
--paid $1,200 per month

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:14.135
plus 5% commission on
sales over $2,000.

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:17.120
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.090
Plus 5% of sales over $2,000.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:28.820
So if my sales are s, my sales
over $2,000 are going to be s

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.390
minus $2,000.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.720
If my sales are, let's say
they're $3,000 in a month.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.440
The sales over $2,000
are going to be

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.280
$3,000 minus $2,000.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.610
It's going to be $1,000
over $2,000.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.800
So these are our two options.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.040
Let me highlight that
right over there.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.950
And they say for what amount of
sales is the first option

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.040
better than the second option?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.490
And assume they're always
sales over $2,000.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.670
So they're essentially saying,
OK, this is always going to be

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.850
non-0 right here.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.570
So we want to know the situation
where the first

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.210
option is better.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.960
Better, probably meaning
for me, meaning that

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.910
I'll get more money.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.970
So when is option 1 going to
be, we could either say

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.690
greater than or greater than
or equal to, option 2.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.350
And then we could solve
this equation.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.600
So let's see what we can do.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.750
The first thing, let's subtract

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.300
$1,000 from both sides.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.280
If you subtract $1,000 from the
left-hand side you're just

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.420
left with 0.06s is greater than
or equal to-- So subtract

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.120
$1,000 from the left-hand
side.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.380
I'll take the $1,000
from here.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:47.740
You're left with 200 plus 0.05
times s minus 2,000.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.380
And then let's see, I probably
want to multiply that out.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:14:01.240
This is going to be 200 plus
0.05s minus-- This 0.05,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.400
that's the same 5%, that's
the same thing as 1/20.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.110
1/20 of 2,000, that's 100.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.600
So this is minus 100.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.920
That times that is 100.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.830
I'm just distributing this
5% or this 0.05.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.450
So that's the right-hand
side of the equation.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.810
On the left-hand side we have
0.06, and we just simplify the

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.890
right-hand side a little bit.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:35.680
We have 200 minus 100, so that
just becomes 200 minus 100, we

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.070
could just write as plus
100 right there.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.790
So our equation is 0.06 is
greater than or equal to

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:51.540
0.05-- Sorry, this is 0.06s is
greater than or equal to-- I

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:58.040
don't want to lose that s over
there --0.05s plus 100.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:04.640
Now let's subtract 0.05s from
both sides of the equation.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:12.250
So 0.06 minus 0.05s is going to
be 0.01s is greater than or

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.630
equal to-- I subtracted this
from both sides, so it's not

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:21.020
going to be here anymore --is
greater than or equal to 100.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.860
And now I just divide
both sides by 0.01.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.120
So 0.01, 0.01.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.800
That becomes a 1.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.670
And then we are left with s is
to going to be greater than or

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.910
equal to-- What's 100
divided by 0.01?

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.880
This is the same thing as 100
divided by 1 over 100, which

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.910
is the same thing as
100 times 100.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.220
100 times 100 is 10,000.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.680
So option 1 is definitely better
for you if your total

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.350
sales for the month,
if s is greater

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.370
than or equal to $10,000.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:10.250
If it's less than that you're
better with option 2.
