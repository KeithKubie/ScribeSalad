00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:03.125
The Tuileries is the only
commission we ever fulfilled.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.286
In fact, we've been offered,

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:07.833
not so much recently
but in the early days we were always

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.500
asked if we do something for
a particular project or something.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.000
We always said,
"We don't want to go to the studio

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.500
with some other information
in our head.

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.393
We want to go
empty headed, blank."

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.083
“Zonked,” we say.
With the eyes closed...

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.250
and closing the ears to be–
nothing and then we can...

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.958
fall into some truth
of some kind, hopefully.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.416
We never wanted to...

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.250
We never wanted
to go up to the studio

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:36.750
with the idea that
we have to satisfy somebody.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.291
But we did it for Art &amp; Project
as they were some of the first

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.041
people to be kindly to us.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:48.125
We were introduced to Art &amp; Project
by the late artist Ger van Elk

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.625
who wanted us
to join his Dutch gallery.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
He felt it would be good
for him as well and good for us.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:59.958
And we became very fond
of Ger and Adriaan, I recalled.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.500
Adriaan died quite recently

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.125
and they wanted something
that they would keep for themselves

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.081
and we said
we would do The Tuileries.

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.500
And it's very interesting
because then...

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.083
at that time, we used
to have a lot of shows in Paris.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.541
with Ileana Sonnabend

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.750
and the friends of...
what do you call...

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:22.708
We had a group of young people
taking us around

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.958
and we ended up in the Tuileries.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.250
And at that time, the Tuileries
was a kind of sex playground.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:30.541
Sex playground hiding
in the bushes or something.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.875
So it became a new way

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.375
of dealing with nature that it could
have a bit of sexual element.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.916
The trees are not only trees,

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.125
it could be something
behind the trees.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.833
So to make up...

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:45.500
The images in The Tuileries
are not of the Tuileries.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.566
We could've gone
to Paris and done that

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.165
but we didn't need to do that.

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.708
It just had to be the suggestion
of the sexuality

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.541
combined with nature.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:55.833
We were quite excited by that.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:59.416
And the chairs are based on,
what do you call?

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:03.083
In 1970, we had two green chairs

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:06.885
in the ground floor
of number 12 Fournier Street.

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.458
We only had the ground floor.

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.968
It had two rooms.
It had the kitchen and one room.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.708
And, for ten years
all the art was done there,

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.733
in the kitchen,
it was extraordinary.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.708
And only two chairs.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:21.250
All of the famous pieces,
like the Red Mornings,

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:24.750
or Cherry Blossom,
all were done in the kitchen.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:29.333
And we had these two green chairs
and we asked John

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.125
if he could copy
the two green chairs.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.083
And then we put this jungle,
what do you call?

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.416
-The Tuileries?
-On top of it.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:41.623
It was very exciting. There were
a pair of, I suppose they were...

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.041
some prototypes of chairs
that never actually got produced.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.041
And we liked them, because
they were similar but different.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.083
Whenever we had a visitor
we always used to say,

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:54.625
"It's a male and female pair
of chairs. Which is which?"

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.625
And half the world says, that's
the man, and the other half says...

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:02.041
We realized that even the furniture
had that very strong sexual element.

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:04.125
We were fascinated by that.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.625
Yeah, sexual...

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.375
To bring in
sexuality into the art...

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.531
was quite unusual
as well at that time.

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:15.916
It was one of the many taboos.
Color was taboo.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.041
Sentiment was taboo.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.500
-Sexuality was taboo.
-Being unhappy was taboo.

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.750
-And sexuality was totally...
-Sexuality was totally taboo.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:27.916
Using your hands was taboo.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.343
You talk about
being in a generation

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.583
that was largely
conceptual and minimal

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.875
in post-studio, and you were
very much an outpost-studio.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.625
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:41.333
And we were very lucky that we were
poor enough not to have a studio.

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.541
It didn't hurt us at all.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.791
It was very good because it became
abstract in some global way.

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.666
We didn't have a studio to go
back into it and start stretching.

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.375
We were able...
We only had to...

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.625
promoting our feelings
through other ways of thinking

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:01.830
and that's why we started
to become more involved

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.416
in the power of the negative.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.500
We saw that through that power

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.666
we could make our
pictures or sculptures

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.208
much more powerful,
much more direct,

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.833
and much more real.

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:20.416
We felt that everything
that has to do with artistic hand,

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:24.750
the artistic hand,
it tried to take away all of that...

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.166
That you end up
in front of powerful imagery.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.958
That's why we gave up
charcoal-on-paper sculptures

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:34.666
because we became...

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.000
-Disillusioned.
-We became very disillusioned with...

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:43.458
the reality that people came
to the charcoal-on-paper sculptures

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.291
and admired
their form and their texture.

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:49.041
And almost the sound
they made, their crinkliness.

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:51.625
And the edges, they liked
the edges and we thought,

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.486
"How awful.
They're not listening to us.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.470
We're not reaching,
speaking to them."

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.833
We are not able
to get our message across

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.961
so let's try something different,
we tried different ways.

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:03.875
Like even videos,
we tried videos.

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.333
The first video sculpture
that we saw

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.750
that's quite a good way
of doing it

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:12.666
and we only did three because at that
time we didn't want to make our films

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:15.083
because we did it
with Gerry Schum,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.625
from Gallery Schum in Dusseldorf
at that time: 1971, '72, '73.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.208
But after that, in 1980,

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.666
we did write
an extraordinary script

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.541
of the world of
Gilbert &amp; George.

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:31.041
And that we did storyboard
and every shot was designed by us

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:35.416
and we think that it's still
one of the best things we ever did.
