00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.630
My name is Michael
Downey and I'm

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.550
the Community
Manager for OpenMRS.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.260
We're a free and open source
medical record system,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.020
primarily for use in
the developing world,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.860
or anywhere people
have limited access

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.024
to IT and technical means.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:13.440
So our students
this summer worked

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.310
on some really amazing projects.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.410
We had everything going on from
redesigning the UI of OpenMRS

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.390
to be more accessible
and user friendly

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.290
for clinicians, people
working in hospitals.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.270
We had people integrating with
other systems, such as business

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.880
intelligence systems, and
other health IT systems.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.430
So people can take
health information

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.980
and share it freely among
many different free software

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.647
projects.

00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:36.230
One of the really
interesting projects

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.813
that our student
worked on this summer

00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:39.340
was building a
software development

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.080
kit, an SDK for OpenMRS,
which will really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.330
open the doors for
many more Summer

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.170
of Code students,
many more volunteers

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600
through the future
to get them up

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.570
and running as an
OpenMRS developer

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.390
literally in a
matter of minutes.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.760
In the past it took
hours or even days

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.810
to get a development
environment set up.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.531
And this student's
project has really

00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.780
made it possible for people
to get involved very, very

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.540
quickly.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.660
So OpenMRS got started
in the second year

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.670
of Google Summer of
Code back in 2006.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.080
And I got involved with
the project in 2009

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.780
and have been an Organization
Administrator since then.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.250
And basically that means
while I'm not a mentor myself,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.500
I help coordinate all the
mentors and all the students

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810
every year for the program.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.790
And quite frankly, it's been
a really, really rewarding

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120
experience to get to meet
students and mentors from all

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.745
over the world, and to make some
really awesome projects happen

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:26.990
each summer.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.340
For me as an Organization
Admin for OpenMRS,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.690
I really, really enjoy getting
to know all the students

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.450
and mentors from
around the world.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.500
We have as many as 20 students
and mentors each summer.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.840
And really am just energized
by the awesome projects

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.890
that they put together.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.870
And to see them do real
work that's rewarding

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.034
is really educational
for the students

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:49.950
and a really great
experience for our mentors.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.070
One of the most exciting
things about GSOC

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.650
is getting the
experience to meet

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.150
some of our students
and our mentors

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.030
and bringing them together.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.590
We have annual and regular
user events and conferences

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.700
throughout the year.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.740
And in more than
one instance, we've

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.990
had several generations
of mentors and students,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.520
and students who turned
into mentors get together.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.410
They've posed for
large group photos.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.380
Get to meet each other in
person after so many hours

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.360
spent communicating
online and virtually.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.300
To have them come together
really as a family

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.659
and get together has been
really touching to see.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.200
And it has really served as an
inspiration for those students

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.533
to go forward and recruit new
students into the program.

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.530
In our GSOC program
for OpenMRS, we

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.590
have a tagline that's called
Write Code, Save Lives.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.540
And that's really
meaningful to us

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.970
because the work that we do has
a direct impact on the quality

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.110
of health care people
receive in some

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.680
of the most neediest
areas of the world.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.360
People without
access to good health

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.600
care, without access to
even good IT systems.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.220
And so what that means is that
the students who work for us

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.900
have a direct opportunity to
improve the quality of life

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.990
of people sometimes in
their own countries,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.324
sometimes neighboring countries.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:02:59.740
But at the end of
the summer, they

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.790
know that they've done
something really concrete,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.000
and have been able to really
save lives around the world.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.620
So our goal is to save
the world essentially.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.190
And GSOC has really been able
to give us the opportunity

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.210
to do that and to help
our students do that.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.190
And so we're looking
forward to continuing

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.710
that mission in years to come.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.330
OpenMRS is an electronic
medical record system platform.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.590
And what that means is
we built an ecosystem

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.104
where people can add on
functionality to the system

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:25.520
and then pick and
choose what they

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.000
need for the type of health
care that they're doing.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.610
So it may be used by something
from a random doctor traveling

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.430
through the villages
in Western Africa,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.920
all the way up to a network of
connected hospitals and clinics

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.960
throughout the country.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.930
So we have really
an entire scale

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.160
of users from the very
simple to the very complex.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.880
And with Google Summer of Code,
it's possible for our students

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.909
to be involved in all of
those types of scenarios.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.700
So there are many
different ways for people

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.090
to get involved in OpenMRS.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.720
The easiest way is just
to go to openmrs.org,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.030
click on Get Involved.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.870
And you can choose
what type of interest

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.380
you have and we'll
help match you up

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.210
with mentors and projects
and tasks within our project

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.190
to really get
started right away.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.480
We need everyone from people
who can do development work,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.470
to project management or
infrastructure kind of work,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.212
to graphic designers,
to documentation people.

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.920
Really no matter what
your interests are,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.750
there's a place
for you in OpenMRS.
