00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
I'm going to show you a number sequence which is better than the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.680
I know, I always say something is 'better than the Fibonacci sequence' because I don't really like it,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.880
but, in this case, this is something that is similar, but uses a different rule.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
So, the Fibonacci, just to remind everyone, you add 1 + 1, and that gives you 2...

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.500
...you add 1 + 2, that gives you 3...

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.880
and each time, what you're doing is taking the previous two,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.580
and that gives you the next one, 5...

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.140
then you take the those two and that gives you the next one, 8

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.180
then that gives you the next one, 13,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.660
so I'm adding them in pairs.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.720
I'm going to do exactly the same thing, but instead of just adding them,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.860
I'm also going to copy the last one.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.400
So if I start with 1, 1, then I'm going to add 1 + 1, and that gives me 2.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.580
but then I'm going to copy the last one, which is a 1.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.560
The next pair is 1 and 2, you add them to get 3 and then copy the last one (above the bar), which is a 2.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.680
Okay, now we have 2 and 1, and if I add them, I get another 3, and the last one (below the bar) is a 1,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.880
and 1, 3, adding them gets you a 4, and the last one is a 3.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
and add 3, 2, I get a 5, and the last one is a 2.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.820
and if I carry on like this, there's another 5, last one is a 3... I keep going.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.460
- So this beast grows quicker 
than you can keep up with it.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.740
Which is amazing, right? Because with the Fibonacci, you're always at the end as you go along,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.240
but this one's great, because as you're copying it, the bit you're working on,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.200
the end of it is racing away from you.That's why I like that.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.420
It's got a syncopated kind of beat, I feel, because you're not always just adding.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.720
You're doing a bit of this and that, so it's not moving at a regular rate... but it 's writing one at the time, anyway

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.120
So I like it as a sequence. I think it's more interesting to generate.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.860
It requires a bit more concentration than copying out the Fibonacci numbers, and you get these unusual numbers

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.200
this is called the Stern-Brocot sequence, and the Stern-Brocot numbers.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.320
You might think, "well, what's so wonderful about this?"

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.240
and so what you do now is that you go back to the beginning of the Stern-Brocot numbers

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.300
and you take them in pairs to form a fraction. Let's mix it up with colours.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.660
Let's take the first one of fraction. That's 1/1.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.060
The next one as a fraction is 1/2,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.160
so I'm taking them, numerator-denominator, numerator-denominator, all the way down in pairs...

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.100
The next one's 2/1, and then 2/3, 3/2, 2/3, and 3/1, 1/4...

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.140
and what will happen, if I carry that on, this will list out every possible fraction.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.760
This will list every single ratio of whole numbers.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.160
And not only that, it will always list them in their most simplified form,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.640
and it will only ever list them once each.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.940
- That's cool!

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.500
So no fraction will appear twice, no fraction will appear not as simple as it can be.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.140
And none will be missed.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.860
So this sequence gives you every single rational number in existence.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.260
There are reasons why we'd want to list out and order all the rational numbers,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.040
and actually, in one of the other NumberPhile videos, "Infinity is Bigger than you Think",

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
by the fine Dr. James Grime,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.560
In GÃ¶del's proof that the rationals are the same size as the reals. It's a video worth watching.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.940
He uses a grid which is, unfortunately, is hugely inefficient,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.840
because numbers appear in there more than once.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.780
they appear and they're not in their simplest form, so you get 1/2--- you also get 2/4, and 4/8 and the rest,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.680
whereas here, there's 1/2: No other fraction will ever appear which equals 1/2.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.240
You get each one once and once only. 
This is really efficient.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
This came out in a paper called Recounting the Rationals.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.640
It's another way of counting the rationals.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.720
and they've come up with this fantastic sequence, which then generate those fractions.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.720
But that's not the only way to do it.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.380
There's another way to generate every possible fraction,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.860
without repeating them and they always appear in their most simplified form.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.500
Start with the most simple fraction known to humankind, which is 1/1,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.100
now two children are going to 'come off' this fraction.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.840
One of them is going to inherit the top, and one is going to inherit the bottom.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.380
And the missing number is going to be the sum of the numerator and denominator

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.280
so that's going to be 1/2, and that's going to be 2/1.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.040
Each of those are going to have kids,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.060
that one's going to inherit the top, that one's going to inherit the bottom.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.840
That is the sum, and that is the sum.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.600
In this one, the left one inherits the top and the right one inherits the bottom, the rest get the sums...

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.200
Here we go again.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.300
Let's do another row. This is getting a bit bunched up, so I'll try to even it out.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.700
That one gets the top, this one gets the bottom.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.720
...gets the top, gets the bottom...

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.000
and that one gets the top, this one gets the bottom,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.300
that is the sum there and there,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.020
that is the sum there and there,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.480
that is the sum there and there...

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.220
and then there and there.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.480
And in this process, as you work your way down,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.600
you will again list out every single fraction. 
It will list them all in the most simplified form

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.900
and it will not have any repeats.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.220
You might think 'well, how am I going to read them off?'

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.320
well if you take a spiral, starting at 1/1, and then we're going to go around to 1/2, then 2/1,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.380
and then we're going to go through these,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.980
and then we're going to go through those.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.140
and if you take the sequence along that spiral, it goes 1/1...

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.420
then it goes 1/2, then it goes 2/1, then it goes 1/3...

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.660
then goes 3/2, 2/3, 3/1, 1/4, and then it carries on

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.640
This is generating the exact same series of fractions that we got from the Stern-Brocot sequence.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.020
In fact, you could start with this, and then go back to those numbers.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.320
If you line up all the factions, 
you'd find they pair up all along,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.240
and if you just remove the doubles, 
you get back to the original sequence.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.700
- There are links to more from this interview and other videos on the topic here on the screen,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.520
If you want to know more things on that, you can also check out [Matt Parker's] book,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.460
"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension", which was recently released.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.660
In fact, it's only just out in the US as I upload this.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.400
I will put a bunch of links in the video's description.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.040
It's a really good book, plus a really good way to throw your support behind Matt.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.600
LEFT VIDEO: So, from this sequence I know there are three ways to write 6 in binary,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.560
if you're allowed to use 2s as well.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.600
And if you just love the way Matt looks, and why would you, he's also depicted on this new Numberphile poster.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.440
I'll also pop a link to that in the video's description.
