 [Electronic Music] 

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.100
 GENEL: I grew up with an 80% loss of hearing. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 This has not prevented me from doing many activities in my life. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.033
 Being an entrepreneur gives me so much freedom 

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.633
 In determining what I want to do. 

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.600
 So I saw that I could do something about accessibility 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.700
 In the field of communication for the benefit of hearing impaired. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.766
 RogerVoice is an application for deaf people 

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.166
 Make phone calls. 

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.400
 The idea of ​​the program is very simple. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800
 Voice recognition is used 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.566
 To record what the other party is talking about 

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.533
 And then you can read what he says. 

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.200
 The reason was not just the search for solutions. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 But I was looking for something to take advantage of personally. 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.366
 Then I realized there was a much easier solution. 

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.066
 I realized immediately that I had to do it in my favor 

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.033
 Lots of other users. 

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.933
 My goal was to provide as much access as possible 

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.200
 For everyone. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.233
 I know that Android has the broadest reach, 

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:54.366
 As it attracts today a billion users, a truly huge number. 

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.033
 As there are no obstacles in Android, 

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.566
 Which did not make me have to ask myself 

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.133
 Whether this is possible or not. 

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.233
 Then I decided to start it, 

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.000
 It was the beginning. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.133
 I had no skills, 

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.466
 I could not place code or designs. 

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.600
 I needed to find people and skills. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
 I knew then 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.633
 I can do a lot, 

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:15.766
 But I needed the support of everyone 

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.633
 To accomplish it. 

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.033
 CHILEO: When Oliver spoke to me, 

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.866
 We initially decided to rethink mobility, 

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.300
 Now we can design an application based on accessibility. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.166
 I wanted to make something clear 

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.400
 Easy in terms of use, has helped me multidimensional design a lot, 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.700
 Since all these guidelines were clear and easy. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.833
 Gryzbowski: We were able to update the versions of the application very easily, 

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:39.900
 Our oral application development took us three months. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.933
 GENEL: It was a wonderful moment when the application was designed. 

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.566
 You feel great happiness, I say 

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.333
 "Finally, I can call my mother." 

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.566
 I spent 24 hours after contacting all my friends 

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.166
 around the world. 

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.500
 Before launching the product, 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 I have been allowed the Google Play program and the demo program 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.533
 I invite people to experience the application. 

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.333
 There were people in Canada who were experimenting with this application. 

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.866
 And others in Kuwait as well. 

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.466
 There is a person in Japan. 

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:04.800
 Balka: The application is not like the game 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.866
 Which you can repair when it is malfunctioning. 

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:09.033
 It is supposed to provide an experience to change the meaning of life 

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.333
 In a person with an auditory impairment. 

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.833
 It would have been very frustrating if the result had not been satisfactory. 

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.100
 Therefore, thanks to the experimental use program, 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.933
 We have been able to adjust the track since the launch of the public offering. 

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.266
 Griesboski: The most important thing I could get 

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.433
 In the RogerVoice application on Android 

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.766
 That I can create something useful and great benefit 

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.833
 Users. 

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:31.133
 GENEL: I feel that when you create something, 

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.533
 You have completed the required. 

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.433
 But then I realized that when you rethink it, 

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.400
 You'll find it still 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.800
 There are many expected accomplishments. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.366
 I now see a big leap in accessibility 

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:47.566
 As an essential component of design and design. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.266
 I am also proud to be involved in this great progress.
