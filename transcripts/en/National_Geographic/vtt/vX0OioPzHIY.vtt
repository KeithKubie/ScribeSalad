with photography and
Peru are all intertwined.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.875 line:0%
All of Peru,

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.779 line:0%
unbelievable country
of mysteries and surprises.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.916 line:0%
This is definitely one of
the centers of civilization.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.218 line:0%
It's really
incredible to be able

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.189 line:0%
to look into the eyes
of an ancient ruler.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.025
This is the power
of archaeology.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.166
Hiebert: Thank you
all for being here.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.367
I want to talk to you

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.903 line:0%
a little bit about
being a representative

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.571 line:0%
of National
Geographic and working

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.340 line:0%
in these great civilizations

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.776 line:0%
and I like to
bring storytelling

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:20.713 line:0%
to these and I like to
tell stories about heroes.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.782
National Geographic's
relationship

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.352
with photography and
Peru are all intertwined.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.121
I want to tell you
that little story.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.790
I actually want to
start by telling you

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.024
a little bit about Peru.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.693
It's extraordinarily photogenic.

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.761
This is a photograph
by Hiram Bingham

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.131
who documented the
high mountains of Peru.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.900
This is really
what makes Peru

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.302
one of the great centers
of civilization,

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.303
is its geography.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.772
The high mountains,
the beautiful rich valleys

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.375
between the mountains
and the coast.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.312
The coastal deserts
which were once

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:56.415
described in the pages
of National Geographic

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.951
as being small Nile Deltas.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.722
And in fact unlike Egypt
that has 1 Nile River,

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.625
northern Peru has
20 of these deltas.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.160
It's unbelievable
you can have 1 foot

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.763
in the fertile delta
and 1 foot in the desert.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.765
This makes it an
extraordinary place

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.500
for preservation and creation

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.102
of ancient civilization.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.404
It's a place where
archaeological sites

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.407
tower above the countryside.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.777
This particular mound
that you see in the front

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.746
is actually a Peruvian pyramid.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.348
Here's an example
of what one could imagine

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.484
that looked like in the past.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.887
There are 20 such river
valleys in northern Peru.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.623
It's an outstanding,
unbelievable relationship

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.992
and much of it
has to do with the fact

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.496
that it is one of the largest,
most productive coasts

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.098
along the pacific
coast of the New World.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.767
Its unbelievable culture,
unbelievable country

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.869
and it's that
geographic relationship

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.672
that we like to
explain, helps explain

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:57.776
how Peru is a country
that can both be described

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:01.814
as having over
10,000 archaeological sites

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.484
or as I like to say,
"There's only 1 site in Peru,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.818
all of Peru."

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:08.421
It is really,
you walk the Inca Trail

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:09.889
and you really can't
tell when you're

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.491
on a site and off a site.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.292
The entire country
from the north coast

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:16.262
to the south coast,
from east to west,

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:20.532
It's unbelievable country
of mysteries and surprises.

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.601
Now I'm actually
going to start telling

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.270
this story a little bit before

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.406
the founding of
National Geographic

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.543
because so many
travelers and adventurers

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.611
have been attracted to Peru.

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.580
It's sort of mysterious
and wonderful.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.184
It's been attracting people
for hundreds of years.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:42.321
Its history goes back
more than 3,000 years.

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.358
It has separate cultural
traditions on the north coast,

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.526
the highlands,

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:47.660
and the south coast.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.862
It's really phenomenal.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.298
I have to take my
hat off to yet

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.801
another set of
incredible heroes.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:58.171
Julio Tello, the father of
Peruvian archaeologists.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.072
He was from the highlands.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.841
He really introduced the idea

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.943
of Andean civilization.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:07.613
He began to study the cultures
of ancient Peru.

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:09.281
He's one of the 1st researchers

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.917
to come up with that chronology.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.653
He had a partner, Rafael Larco.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:17.122
These 2 guys,
they kind of fought over

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:20.325
where the heart
and soul of Peru lay.

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:22.728
You had Tello, who was
from the highlands,

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:25.264
who argued for
temples and islands

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:28.300
and you had Larco,
who came from the coast

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.701
he said,
"Not, it is coast cultures"

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:31.638
and that debate
continues to this day.

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.474
We all were fascinated by
the mystery and culture

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.909
and we all thought
that this site

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.379
which Tello worked at,
that Larco worked at,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.582
the famous temple of
Chavín de Huántar.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:45.851
It was really the heart,

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.688
the essence of
Andean civilization.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.456
It was so important

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.192
and it was so mysterious
and so luxurious

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:56.729
that it actually became
my introduction to archeology

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.098
and my introduction
to South America.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.599
I had the chance to visit--

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.700
( laughter )

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.002
Well, okay, it wasn't last year.

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:06.805
All right so, you're
looking at this statue,

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.607
you see this statue, right?

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:12.745
It's carved and beautiful
3,500 years old.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.213
Oh, yeah, I was a hippie.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.747
Once, a little while ago.

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:17.583
But that's Chavín de Huántar.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.985
What an introduction
to South America.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:21.487
What an introduction to Peru,

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.854
to go visit a place.

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:24.756
What a way to get inaugurated

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:27.593
into the wonders of archaeology.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.396
It's great and I became
intrigued with the history

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:33.966
of all this exploration
and who went and where.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.569
We all sort of looked
even further back

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.838
into the pages,
"Who was exploring?"

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.307
"Who was caught
with this mystery

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:44.310
of wonder of the
archaeology and culture?"

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.046
I became enamored with
this particular fellow,

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.647
Ephraim Squier.

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:50.783
He was a wonderful explorer

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.251
for the U.S. government.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.021
He was sent as
the commissioner to Peru

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:59.091
by none other than
Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s.

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.727
This is how far the
history goes back in this

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:03.562
and the wonderful storytelling.

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:04.930
As commissioner, he wrote

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.765
this incredible book called,

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:08.433
"The Land of the Incas,"

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.402
illustrated with 500 woodcuts.

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.972
Really, I mean,
it was the artistry,

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.975
the magnificence,
the wonder of this country

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.075
that attracted people.

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:19.444
These woodcuts were
known and reproduced.

00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:21.213
This was a very
popular book

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.349
published in the 1877.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.717
People were so desirous.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:25.985
I became fascinated
because there was

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.553
this photograph
of Ephraim Squier

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.322
and being here at
National Geographic

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.091
we're, naturally,
very interested in photographs.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.892
But you know, Squier,

00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:36.161
he made these
incredible illustrations

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:37.796
that are woodcuts in his book

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.064
and we assumed that he must

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.900
have had a photographic memory.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.535
Look at this bridge,
unbelievable.

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:45.304
You had to go to Peru to imagine

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.874
that something
like that was real.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.242
It was so exciting
for me to see,

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:54.713
in a woodcut like
this of Alto Peru

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.948
which is today on the other side

00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:59.184
of Lake Titicaca but still part

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.719
of this greater Peruvian...

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.689
I became quite curious, being
here at National Geographic,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.226
"How did somebody record
something like this?"

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.194
It was only recently
and I was so excited

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:11.029
to be able to find
the photo archives

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.466
that were the basis
for the 500 woodcuts.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.268
It shows the
relationship between

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.604
photography and archaeology.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.339
We have one of the
great photographers

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.174
of National Geographic,
Kenny Garrett, who's here,

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.744
who can attest to the fact

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.578
that photographing in Peru

00:07:26.578 --> 00:07:29.348
is like photographing
a wonderland.

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.418
It was amazing to
see how beautifully

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:33.586
reproduced the photographs.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:37.656
Here's one of the
woodcuts from 1877.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.058
Here's one of the newly
discovered photographs

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:41.160
that Squier took.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.861
He was not only an explorer,

00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.230
he himself was a photographer.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.800
I became intrigued
with this aspect,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.668
this relationship between

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:51.904
photography and archaeology.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.206
I think it's critical to our
understanding of the past.

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:57.443
Not only in Peru
and Central America,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.646
in Egypt and Greece,
it's so exciting.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.681
I became attracted
to another one

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:06.519
of the greatest photographers
who ever crossed into Peru,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.987
Hiram Bingham.

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:10.922
Yes, Hiram Bingham
is known primarily

00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:13.893
for describing Machu
Picchu, but do people

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.528
realize that he was
an incredible photographer?

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:21.200
At that time, 1911 and 1912,
being director of an expedition

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.502
meant that you were also
the photographer.

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.573
He had this incredible camera
created by Kodak for him

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.040
and he took these pictures

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.276
that were not just documentation

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:34.146
but were art themselves.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:38.017
They were the 1st
rock star archaeology project

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.751
in National Geographic.

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:41.587
His photographs
really are incredible.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:44.356
We have about 2,000
of these photographs

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.159
here in the photo
archives and some day

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.494
we're going to do an exhibition

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:49.995
of the photo archives here.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:52.331
It's just an
incredible opportunity

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.400
to work with people
like Bill Bonner,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.202
here in the photo archives

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.638
and see exactly what the genius
of photography is.

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:01.206
If you look at this picture

00:09:01.206 --> 00:09:03.675
taken by Bingham of Machu Picchu

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:06.045
with the mountains and the cloud

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:09.615
and the local personality
on the right hand.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.550
It is such a story,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.387
such a photographic
essay in 1 picture.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.156
It's really very,
very inspirational.

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.691
He also documented
the people of Peru.

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:21.860
For me, this is the real gift

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.363
that Hiram Bingham gave to Peru,

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.865
which is a wonderful
photo record

00:09:26.865 --> 00:09:29.468
of Peru and ancient Peru

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:32.103
and the people of Peru
all living together.

00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:35.641
What an inspiration
for cultural heritage.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.176
This isn't the only time

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.011
that we've photographed
Peru and ancient Peru.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.579
We've been at the forefront

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:42.147
and if we fast forward
to really

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:45.550
one of the 1st color photos
of an archaeological picture

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.819
published in National
Geographic magazine,

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.021
it, of course, came from Peru.

00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:53.192
This is William Duncan Strong

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.727
who in 1946 came to Peru

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:58.197
and after seeing all
these wonderful artifacts,

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.332
came in hopes of finding

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:02.935
the 1st intact Moche burial.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.271
Moche is a northern
coast period in Peru

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.373
about 2,000 years
old, very mysterious,

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:09.741
only known from the artifacts

00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:11.443
and his intention was to come

00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:13.546
and document an intact burial,

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:16.147
almost an impossible feat.

00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:20.252
But, they found one on the coast

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:25.591
and to quote from
the 1947 issue of the magazine,

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.194
Strong and Evans
found this burial and everybody

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.362
was so excited.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.463
They'd never seen
an intact burial

00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:33.198
from 2,000 years ago.

00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:35.634
So, they opened it
up and Evans said,

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:37.402
"I'm hungry, let's have lunch."

00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:38.704
( laughter )

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:41.840
I tell you, I love reading
past National Geographics.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.242
It's really great.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.478
So, all of his workmen
were sitting there confused

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.779
because they just
found something

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.714
that had never
been found before.

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:49.915
The next picture
which was published

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.717
in the pages of
National Geographic,

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:54.119
is the 1st time you
are looking inside

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:56.621
of an intact Moche burial.

00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:58.924
I think that this is something

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.959
that National Geographic
has taken on

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.162
as a cachet in
terms of telling

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:06.031
the stories of the
ancient populations.

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.900
This is a unique picture,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.703
"12 pots that have never
been seen together in situ."

00:11:11.703 --> 00:11:13.506
This documentation
went around the world

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.574
in April 1947.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:18.310
These 2 people,
Strong and Evans,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.979
became a hero of mine
as we pursued this past.

00:11:20.979 --> 00:11:23.349
Here's one of
their color plates.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.917
Now, these plates
had to be specially

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.651
put into each one
of the millions

00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:30.088
of copies of National
Geographic magazine.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:33.092
We have even more
advances in photography,

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:36.228
archaeology and
the understanding
of ancient Peru.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:40.699
1988, another
intact Moche burial

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:43.835
from the north coast
of Peru was found.

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:47.105
They gave a call to Walter Alva

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:50.442
and to Chris Donnan,
2 researchers

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:52.377
who were funded by
National Geographic said,

00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:54.446
"Please, let's go. Let's go."

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:56.281
We started to document these

00:11:56.281 --> 00:11:58.616
in a way that I don't
think archaeology

00:11:58.616 --> 00:12:00.619
has ever been documented before

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:04.189
and this came out
in an 1988 issue of the magazine

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:06.558
which just happened
to be on the 100th anniversary

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:07.592
of National Geographic.

00:12:07.592 --> 00:12:10.028
I don't know how that came about

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:11.429
but it's really incredible.

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:13.899
The 1st time to be
able to look into

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.669
the eyes of
an ancient ruler of Peru

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:20.005
and see the archaeologist
at the same time.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.407
To come up with this new way

00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:24.910
to communicate, not only
through photographs,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.811
but through these
iconic drawings.

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:30.082
This instantly became
"the" classic model

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:32.184
for how archaeology
is presented,

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:34.586
not only on the pages
of National Geographic,

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:37.523
but in every textbook and
all the way around the world.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.124
I think it's really cool.

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:40.692
On the right-hand side,

00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:42.828
you see the different layers

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.764
from the original coffin box

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:48.033
to the way the textiles
were laid down

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:50.002
to the way the
artifacts were laid

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.704
and to the way
the body was put in.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.373
Everything done in
exquisite scientific

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:56.007
and artistic detail.

00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:58.009
It became one of the cachets

00:12:58.009 --> 00:13:00.779
of National Geographic and Peru.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:03.915
These large scale photographs,

00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:05.517
this is, I think, the first time

00:13:05.517 --> 00:13:08.086
we had a centerfold
in National Geographic.

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:11.924
This was a 3 page
picture of this burial.

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:15.560
I don't know how they
took this picture in 1988,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.297
but it is so detailed
and so incredible.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.832
What it is for us
who are looking

00:13:20.832 --> 00:13:23.268
at the beautiful
specimens in the museums

00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:25.871
and the pieces of Peru

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.006
and the pieces
you see on display,

00:13:28.006 --> 00:13:30.976
it really gives us a key,

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.312
it allows us to have
an, "Aha" moment.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.313
When you go back
to the exhibition

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:39.552
and you see things
like a nose piece.

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.087
You say, "Aha!

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.322
Now I understand
why it's there.

00:13:44.322 --> 00:13:46.391
Now I understand why it means

00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:47.993
something for ancient Peru."

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:51.763 line:0%
Or, we see this beautiful
turquoise pectoral

00:13:51.763 --> 00:13:53.932 line:0%
and we've just have seen it
in the picture

00:13:53.932 --> 00:13:55.667 line:0%
of the Lord of Sipán

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:57.202 line:0%
and we say, "Aha!"

00:13:57.202 --> 00:14:00.806
"Now I understand
were it comes from."

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:03.776
"Now I understand its
cultural significance."

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:06.111
This is the power
of archaeology

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.281
as presented in
National Geographic.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.184
I'll tell you one more story
about the history,

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.886
and it's both a good
and bad history.

00:14:14.886 --> 00:14:16.655
Is that this wealth of Peru

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.758
has invited looters to come.

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.826
This is where professor
Izumi Shimada works

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:23.929
and this is his
photograph which he uses

00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:27.565
to illustrate the fact that
the archaeological site

00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:28.834
where he works at

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.303
has somewhere, and he said
he counted himself personally,

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:34.973
over 100,000 looters pits.

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:36.641
It's unbelievable.

00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:39.344
It's from this site that we know

00:14:39.344 --> 00:14:41.913
that this famous mask,

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:44.249
we call it
the Italian mask at this point,

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:46.518
because it became known

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:49.254
that it was from Sicán.

00:14:49.254 --> 00:14:50.923
We knew where it was from

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.526
thanks to the work of
professor Izumi Shimada.

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:58.163
This piece, actually,
the back story of it is,

00:14:58.163 --> 00:15:01.233
as soon as it became known

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.768
that it came from
a certain site in Peru,

00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:07.072
it became a celebrity in Italy.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.074
It was as well known
as a movie star.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.543
It was neat to see,
archaeology, its portrait

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.945
was on the front
pages of magazines.

00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:17.115
Here's the president of Italy

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:20.219
with that handoff moment
to ambassador Forsyth.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.786
I think it's an
incredible moment

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:23.622
of cultures, ancient cultures,

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:27.025
understanding one another.

00:15:27.025 --> 00:15:29.628
It was Shimada's excavation,

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:31.629
Shimada and Carlos Elara,

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:33.699
director of the Sicán museum,

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:36.435
who really spent the time
to understand that context,

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.470
digging down, down, down,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.006
20, 30 feet deep
into the ground.

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.708
These are really heroic
excavations going down

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:46.678
in hopes of being able
to find the context

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:48.580
and telling the story.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.853
In 1991 that dream
for Izumi Shimada

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.255
started to come true.

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.423 line:0%
He looked down and
he saw something

00:15:58.423 --> 00:16:01.326 line:0%
that glittered,
something that really

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:03.295 line:0%
hadn't expected to see.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:06.097 line:0%
This is professor
Shimada and you can see

00:16:06.097 --> 00:16:08.901 line:0%
the 24 feet of earth above him.

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.668
I asked Izumi today,

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:12.337
"Weren't you a little worried?"

00:16:12.337 --> 00:16:13.938
He said, "No, we
checked everyday."

00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:15.473
"Not to worry, not to worry."

00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:18.910
It was really incredible
and there he found

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.579
this piece
with its photographs

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:25.817
showing exactly how
it was found in situ.

00:16:25.817 --> 00:16:29.621 line:0%
In a way, it reminds me so much

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:33.191 line:0%
of Strong and Evans description

00:16:33.191 --> 00:16:37.095
of the 1st Moche mask,
the 1st Moche intact burial

00:16:37.095 --> 00:16:40.799
written on the pages of
National Geographic in 1947.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:44.069
The thing about the Strong
and Evans article in 1947,

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:46.972
there was a description
but no photograph of the mask.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:50.876 line:0%
Here it is,
magnificent ornamental

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:54.946 line:0%
elaborate headdress
that really shows

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:57.215 line:0%
the power of the individual

00:16:57.215 --> 00:17:01.120 line:0%
and the power that gold exudes

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.256
and the importance
that this material is in Peru.

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:09.094
Don't forget, in Peru,
gold was never a commodity.

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:11.162
It was never traded
for its value,

00:17:11.162 --> 00:17:13.598
it was never stored as wealth.

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:17.202
It was always used
to symbolize power

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.271
and that connection
with the sun.

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:23.342
When you see it in its
original cultural context

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.477 line:0%
with the flames coming off

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:29.581 line:0%
and the bursts and
the incredible wolf-like animal

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:32.084 line:0%
who professor Shimada
has promised me,

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:34.853
whose tongue still
wags back and forth.

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.121
( laughter )

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.824
You understand that power.

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.592
Well, I'd just like to end

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:44.295
with a little bit about the way
that National Geographic

00:17:44.295 --> 00:17:47.999
and archaeologists continue
to work in Peru

00:17:47.999 --> 00:17:50.835
and continue to innovate
in archaeology

00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:53.705
but especially through the lens.

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:57.241
We're really happy to have
on staff at National Geographic

00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:58.910
some innovators in photography.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.312
This is Fabio Amador
who works

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.848
for the Waitt National
Geographic Grant Program,

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:05.050
and his camera there
is something really special

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.919
called the GigaPan
and he is taking a picture,

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.656
this is just a few months ago,

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:13.992
at the famous site
of Huaca de la Luna

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:16.394
and these murals, which
have never really been

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:17.762
thoroughly documented,

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:19.898
but these type of
advances in photography

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:21.667
and in the way we
visualize the past,

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:24.436
they mean so much
to archaeology,

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.872
to Peru, and to science.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.039
Thank you very much.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.475
