1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,660
Are we good? I think we are. Maybe
you have to get in closer. Yeah. Okay.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,550
All right. Yup. We should do the thing.
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,680
Radiolab, the podcast. Can you just
tell us who you are? Oh, uh, well,

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,060
I don't believe I'm going to reveal that
and we're gonna start today's podcast

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,140
with this international man of
mystery. Who are you reading? No. Uh,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,183
I'm Ian Frazier.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,310
Ian is a writer for the New Yorker
magazine and he's written a bunch of

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:30,300
wonderful books. I Wilson Siberia and
other books of nonfiction and humor.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,050
And we had Ian come to visit us because
we were working together on a show about

10
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,450
games, which we just aired in that show.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,400
We ended up talking about a baseball,
a football, basketball, checkers,

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,000
chess. But the says there was
a game that we totally ignored.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,363
Tic tacs.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,150
Tic-Tac-Toe. All right. So what's the
deal with you and Tic Tac toe? I mean,

15
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,850
you, you learned it at age
five, I'm assuming, like

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,470
buddy. Exactly. Like everybody
else. Yeah, of course. But I mean,

17
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,430
as you get older,

18
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,750
it's one of the first sort of levels of
sophistication that you reach is that

19
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:13,520
you know how to get a draw
on every tic-tac-toe game
and you learn that at about

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,350
age, maybe six I would say. And
after that it's just formality.

21
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:21,560
It's sort of a developmental
milestone. Gaming. It is. It is.

22
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:25,220
But when you realize you have to be
sophisticatedly bored the game, right.

23
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,970
And you go, Oh yes, I'm
very good at that. So you,

24
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:32,971
you each the mature age of six and
achieved a certain amount of tic-tac-toe.

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,300
Sophisticated. I would
say I was a grandmaster.

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,950
Yeah. But the problem is when you
get to that grand master point,

27
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:40,840
everybody else is a grandmaster too.

28
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:44,580
And so everything is a draw and
the game basically dies. Right.

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,950
And so like the rest of us, Ian
stopped playing tic-tac-toe.

30
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:52,840
But then when he was well into
his middle life, you might say,

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,570
oh, this would have been in, this
would have been about 10 years ago.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
He ran into something
that made him think, well,

33
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,940
maybe tic-tac-toe can
still do something for me.

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,960
Right, right. What happened?

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,830
Well, I went to Russia and I
traveled, uh, all over. And uh,

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,390
I was in, uh, Chikota,
which is the part of, uh,

37
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,160
the Russian Far East, opposite, uh,
Alaska. It's not a great distance,

38
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:21,860
but it's an enormous distance
in terms of culture. Uh,

39
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:25,650
and at that time my Russian language was
very weak and I was staying with this,

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,470
uh, a young couple who had a
six year old son named eager.

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,040
And because of the level of my language,

42
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:39,041
I got along very well with preschool
children and elementary school teachers.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,780
Hello. I am a student. Right.

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,250
And that didn't seem like
ridiculous to a six year old.

45
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:50,060
It seemed great. And he actually
could speak some English.

46
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:53,390
He had like about eight or 10 words.

47
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,490
And the first thing eager said to me was,

48
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,040
how do you do?

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,810
He was just incredibly cute and the
nice kid and his shirts, you know,

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,530
red Russian kids shirts are buttoned up
at the neck like that. And he was very,

51
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,180
very serious. And, and,

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,030
and so we were just hanging out
and I was able to talk to him.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,420
And then on a whim, really
he said, I said, well let's,

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,650
let's play tic Tac toe and why
did you get that idea? Yeah,

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,600
cause it was just something
to do with the kid.

56
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,310
I don't even remember
how we got that idea,

57
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:29,020
but we were just sitting around and I
explained the game to him and he had never

58
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,360
heard of it. Really? So you drew,

59
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,160
you drew the classic shape of the tick
tech to this boy and he stares it into,

60
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,380
so what's this like some
kind of cross or what he did,

61
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,260
he didn't know what it was.
He had no idea what it was.

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,390
And I just showed him by drawing
how you do this x's and o's.

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,870
And he picked it up. I mean
he understood what it was.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,820
And then we started playing and he
very quickly got the principal, but I,

65
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,350
to be honest, was
clobbering him with doing,

66
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,590
was there a certain kind
of joy? It's just like, ah,

67
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,000
that's not where the o goes.
And then three x's foul,

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,740
you're outta here and he would be
quite crushed. I'm like, oh no,

69
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,783
I lost it.

70
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,840
But it's really fun to play tic Tac
toe with someone who doesn't know how,

71
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,550
because you're just walking all over
him and just putting axes. And I was,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,660
it was okay. Technically it was not fair.

73
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,170
I think finally we're collaborating.
Are you talking like, oh,

74
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,750
I mean James or game after game.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,150
And it didn't take very
many moves for me to win.

76
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,510
So I stayed with them before we made
this trip into the Tundra and we went out

77
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,850
into the Tundra. We were there for
a week or 10 days or something.

78
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,650
And then I came back and
stayed with them again.

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,670
I do not believe he had been
playing tic TAC toe in my absence,

80
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,120
but somehow he had gotten better.

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,930
And so we had very, very ordinary
and frustrating games in my,

82
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,280
for my point of view as became back.
I didn't win as readily at all.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,590
I didn't lose well. But, uh,

84
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,790
you feel a slight urge to
go to the nearby school,

85
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,680
find new, find new weather. Uh,

86
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,520
Siberian tic-tac-toe Hustler
was how in elementary schools,

87
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,020
of course was how I, you know,

88
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,370
paid for for several years have
paid for my New York City apartment.

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,110
Uh, I later checked and, uh,

90
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,470
listeners may contradict
me, but as far as I know,

91
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:39,580
this game is unknown in Russia and
I've asked Russian friends, unknown,

92
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,180
completely unknown, complete
like years old and up and up.

93
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,070
I would send in eastern Russia on the
site in deep Siberian or I was in deep

94
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,550
Siberia. But, um, uh, in the cities,

95
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,050
I have not met anybody who knows
this. Moscow, you want a Straw skull?

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,280
Not a Moscow. I've

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,370
asked people, I didn't go around these
cities and say, do you know tic-tac-toe?

98
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,080
I mean, what if it didn't
get to a Minsk? Wha what is,

99
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,560
so finish that sentence. How,

100
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,660
how wide is the shadow
of non tictactoe dumb.

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,970
If we can establish this
in eastern Russia, maybe,

102
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,340
maybe you could go to Japan and
they wouldn't know how to play it.

103
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,300
I haven't even, I don't know. Well,

104
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:25,301
it would be interesting just to find out
where tictactoe is elsewhere and where

105
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,530
it isn't. Yeah. Not that I'm
going to do it myself. No, no, no.

106
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,010
It's to be one of these. This could be
one of these crowdsourcing opportunities.

107
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,940
Why is that? Well,

108
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,550
we can ask people to help map it for
us because like what if there are whole

109
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,360
corners of the globe that
are virginal territory.

110
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,080
So you could go to playgrounds and
you could like walk in and say, Hey,

111
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,640
kids wish them come here.

112
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,310
So we decided to test this
proposition. After we talked to Ian,

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,900
we put a call on our Facebook page asking
for you people to help us make map.

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,470
And we got [inaudible] bosses. Hello.

115
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,760
I am coming to you from
Kwangju, South Korea.

116
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,980
Actually lots in the north of Iran
near the Caspian Sea. Croatia hills,

117
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,820
not in Poland, Istanbul,
Turkey, Christchurch, New
Zealand. I'm here in Seattle,

118
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,560
Washington or Cedric ground.
The Netherlands, Argentina,
Caribbean, Namibia,

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,370
Japan, Dublin, Ireland. Gotcha.
In the fall, who's Denmark? Okay.

120
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,860
A typically hot day here in Dubai
and stretches are pretty simple.

121
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,430
Grab a cell phone or whatever you
got that can record. Go out. No,

122
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,740
let's get on with our
business. Take a survey.

123
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,810
So I think we found our first victim.

124
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,760
Who Nice people walking by in the full
show. Miss you. Principal Movie Paul. Oh,

125
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,620
hello sir. Have you heard of

126
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,950
[inaudible] a a game called tic-tac-toe
backhoe. We LMU moving their own doctor.

127
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,570
Who here has ever heard of the game?
Ticktack to tech toe kick tech.

128
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,440
So here are the results, which may
surprise you will go country by country.

129
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,030
Everybody interviewed a lot of people.

130
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,360
So what you will hear is representative
and we'll start with Japan.

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,800
Do you know Tic Tac toe? Tic Tac toe?

132
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,550
No. This game? No. No. No.

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,770
Japan? No. No. No. Argentina.
No. It doesn't. No.

134
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,780
No. Ireland. No.

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Do you know what it is or no one knows
how to play Tic Tac toe? No. Maybe. Yeah.

136
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,900
Yes sir. Nope. No. Switzerland. No.

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,980
Turkey. No. Croatia. No
New Zealand pick tags.

138
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,250
Is it a dance? Now it's again.

139
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,830
Have you so you've never played
tic-tac-toe. Heavens no. No.

140
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,860
You're on sir. It is

141
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,680
[inaudible] so amazingly, it seemed
like huge chunks of the globe.

142
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,390
Do not know tic-tac-toe.

143
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,050
Tictactoe hustler could clean
up the key or forget hustling.

144
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,930
Maybe you just want to believe there
are still some blank spots left in the

145
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:57,660
globe. We'll hear yard,
yes, but just to be safe,

146
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,740
we asked everybody to go out,
not just with their cell phones,

147
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,440
but with a pen and a paper
so that when someone says no,

148
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,660
they could draw them the grid just
to be certain. Let me show you. Okay.

149
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,650
We have x's and we have owes and
things like this, this or this.

150
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,390
So if I am ex and then that a stereotype,

151
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,580
try to stop me and you have to get three
in a row and this is when the answers

152
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,720
change. That's awesome.
Oh, so ex, Huh? Findex.

153
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well you know that, Huh?

154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,120
Once people saw the grid with the
x's and o's, they were like, oh yeah,

155
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,620
we know that game. Of course,

England, which one is it called?

162
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,780

call it in Ireland.

163
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,140
And we call it noughts and crosses New
Zealand now in Switzerland [inaudible]

And in Costa Rica. Gotcha. Gotcha.

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,540
Well let's take a little break and look
at our notes. See where we stand so far,

171
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,890
gentlemen, I'm beginning
to get this feeling.

172
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,260
Seven people interviewed seven
new, it had our dream was of glory.

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,750
I'll know what take the pill is.

174
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,270
Yeah. We were going to, you know,

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,400
we were going to be the Gingiss cons of
tic-tac-toe just may not be supported by

176
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,193
the data.

177
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,870
No. Yeah,

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,010
but we got Russia, right?

179
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,183
[inaudible]

180
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,560
well, um, hi, you infringer. Hi,
this is Soren and I work with rob.

181
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,900
I don't know if we have Russia actually,

182
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,040
because as we were conducting our
international tic-tac-toe survey,

183
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,690
I got a note from Ian. It was a, it was
a, it looked like an [inaudible] note.

184
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,690
So I called him up and he told me that
shortly after we talked to him that first

185
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:26,040
time,

186
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,690
it was maybe even the same day,

187
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,940
he was at a party and
there were some Russians.

188
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,150
And I just thought, okay, let
me just make sure about this.

189
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,300
And I asked and they said, yes,
of course there's tic-tac-toe.

190
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,640
And I said, wow, everybody told
me. And they said, yeah, sure,

191
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:46,390
everybody knows it. A friend even told
me the name of it, it's Kresky Norske,

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,220
which is like processes and zero.
And he said, yeah, it's well known.

193
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,670
And the entire thing fell to the
ground at that point. Um, my,

194
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,300
my dream of Tic Tac
toe conquest, so sorry,

195
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,760
I don't, I'm sorry. I base
this on insufficient data.

196
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,170
And a, I'd say completely
wrong, completely wrong,

197
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:11,830
because I did encounter, you
know, some people who didn't know,

198
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,750
and this one kid who I really,

199
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:18,460
I can promise you I just
beat the pants off of, uh,

200
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:23,140
in tic-tac-toe. He had
no idea, but that was my,

201
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,120
the limit of my contacts

202
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,960
last time. We got

203
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,230

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,770
