00:00:02.327 --> 00:00:04.277
- [Voiceover] In this video,
we're going to be talking about

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:06.924
how you can write electron configurations

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.455
using noble gas notation.

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:11.498
And to be more specific,

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:13.890
in this video we're also
going to be focusing

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.890
on examples using main group elements.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.781
So, we're doing that because
the transition metals,

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.453
right here, and the lanthanides,

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:26.776
are a little bit more complicated,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.002
so we won't be doing that
in this particular video.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.233
So the rule for writing

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.600
the noble gas notation for something

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.077
is pretty simple.

00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:40.638
It is,

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:44.005
you take the noble gas

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:48.899
immediately preceding your atom or ion,

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:52.224
so what do I mean by
immediately preceding?

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:54.732
That means we want the
noble gas that comes

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.636
right before it, so you go up a row,

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:59.817
and you go over to here,

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:03.898
where the noble gases live.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.431
And you put that in brackets
and then you write your other

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.589
electrons, and you write
your other electrons

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:14.050
using the same notation
that you normally write

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.931
electron configurations in.

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:17.417
If you don't remember what that is,

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:19.251
we'll go through a couple
examples right now.

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.945
So hopefully it will become more clear.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.895
So before we get started,

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:27.215
I'm just going to remind you
why we call the noble gases

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:28.260
noble,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.997
and that is because they have a full octet

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:34.994
of electrons.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.943
And so, since they have a
full octet, they're not very

00:01:37.943 --> 00:01:40.938
reactive, they have all of the electrons

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.911
they want,

00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:45.884
and as a result,

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:50.365
you will see in chemistry
that a lot of chemistry,

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:52.501
chemical reactions will be driven by other

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:57.501
non-noble gases trying
to get a full octet.

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:02.299
So the first example
we're going to talk about

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.107
and write the configuration
for is silicon.

00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:10.635
Silicon is right below
carbon in the Periodic Table,

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:15.635
and we can write its full
electron configuration,

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.508
just for comparison,

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:19.923
so if we start up here,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.591
with hydrogen, silicon has
the electron configuration

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:26.795
1s2

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.187
2s2

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:32.066
2p6,

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:34.736
so as a reminder, these
are our S electrons

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.478
because they're in S orbitals.

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:38.010
These are our P electrons

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.984
because they're in P orbitals,

00:02:39.984 --> 00:02:42.143
and then once we're

00:02:42.143 --> 00:02:43.861
through our 2p6 electrons,

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:47.623
we go to 3s2

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:49.550
and we have two more electrons,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.637
so it's 3p2.

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:58.637
So that's the electron
configuration for silicon.

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:02.785
Now, we can write it out
using noble gas notation.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.201
And compare, so,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.941
the noble gas immediately
preceding silicon,

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.890
if we go up a row and then move over,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.839
we see that it's neon.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.525
So we write neon in brackets.

00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:18.109
And then,

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.571
the other electrons

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:23.055
are the ones that come after neon.

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.122
So we go down,

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:28.929
and the electrons that
aren't included in neon

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.648
would be our

00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:33.805
3s2 electrons, right here,

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:38.165
and the 3p2 electrons.

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:41.700
So if we compare these two ways of writing

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.743
our electron configuration,

00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:46.413
you can see that

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:48.991
these electrons right here,

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:53.216
so everything up to 3s2 3p2,

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.978
that gives us the electron
configuration for neon.

00:03:56.978 --> 00:03:58.139
And so we don't have to write that,

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.253
we just write neon,

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:02.504
and assume that whoever's reading it

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:06.800
knows what the electron
configuration for neon is.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.841
The other thing you might notice is that

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:12.210
these other electrons here,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.042
that we wrote outside of the brackets,

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:18.966
these are our valence electrons.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.195
So, writing

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.983
your electron configuration this way,

00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:24.307
using noble gas notation,

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:27.325
makes it really obvious where
your valence electrons are

00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:28.347
and what kind they are,

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:31.522
so that's helpful.

00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:34.779
We are going to go
through one more example

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.354
and that will be calcium.

00:04:38.354 --> 00:04:42.348
So calcium is over here,

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.366
and so, we're not going
to write the full electron

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:46.388
configuration this time.

00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:49.290
We're just going to write
the noble gas notation.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.052
So calcium, the noble gas
immediately preceding it,

00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:55.977
we go up a row and then
over and we see that

00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:57.998
the noble gas is argon,

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:02.688
so we write argon in our brackets,

00:05:02.688 --> 00:05:06.449
and then, what electrons are not in argon?

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.166
So we move down and we
see that we have our

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:14.166
4s electrons, and we have two of them.

00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:19.121
So this is the noble gas
configuration for calcium.

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:24.932
So does calcium have a full octet?

00:05:24.932 --> 00:05:29.663
And we know that these
are the valence electrons

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:35.225
and we also know that if
it did have a full octet,

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.374
it would actually already have
a noble gas configuration,

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:43.205
so it would either have krypton or argon

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:46.665
and in this case, it
turns out that calcium

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:50.914
prefers to lose two electrons,

00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:54.466
as opposed to gaining a bunch.

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:57.554
It would be gaining 10 plus six.

00:05:57.554 --> 00:06:00.991
So, lose two electrons,
and when calcium loses two

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:05.449
electrons, it becomes the
calcium 2-plus cation.

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.817
And then we can write

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.069
the electron configuration really short,

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.579
or it'll be really short

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.993
because we know it's going
to lose these two valence

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:16.663
electrons and then,

00:06:16.663 --> 00:06:20.773
it will have the electron
configuration which is just

00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:22.236
the same as argon.

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:25.092
And we can tell, really
easily, looking at this,

00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:29.289
that calcium 2-plus has a full octet.

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.638
So, one of the

00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:35.262
many pros of writing things
in noble gas notation,

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:36.957
besides the fact that it, you know,

00:06:36.957 --> 00:06:38.141
makes your hand less tired,

00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.161
is that it makes it
really easy to see where

00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.647
your valence electrons are,

00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:45.891
and whether or not your ion
or atom has a full octet.
