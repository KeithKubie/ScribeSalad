00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:03.721
 One movie takes $ 10.50 for a ticket 

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.693
 and 5 dollars for a basket of popcorn. 

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:08.655
 You never buy popcorn because you think, 

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.756
 that they are too expensive. 

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:13.754
 Is the total price you pay just proportional to the number 

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:16.155
 of the tickets you buy? 

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.777
 This is interesting because we are told the price 

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:22.023
 a basket of popcorn, but we are also told, 

00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:23.927
 that we never buy popcorn. 

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:24.995
 I do not know why we've ever been told 

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:27.386
 what is the price; perhaps, to confuse us. 

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:29.256
 The total price you pay is straightforward 

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:30.985
 Is it the number of tickets you buy? 

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:32.309
 Okay, you only buy tickets; 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.155
 you will not buy any popcorn, 

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:38.091
 so you will spend $ 10.50 on each ticket. 

00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:39.519
 This should be straightforward. 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.551
 But to see it a little clearer, 

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.488
 let me draw a small table here. 

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.236
 So the number of tickets; 

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:52.394
 and then price, total price. 

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:54.461
 We assume that I never buy popcorn. 

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:58.617
 If I buy a ticket, the price will be 10.50. 

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:01.717
 If I buy 2 tickets, she will be 2 at 10.50 

00:01:01.717 --> 00:01:06.187
 or $ 21.00. 

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.660
 If I buy 3 tickets, we'll have 3 at 10.50. 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.322
 Which is how much? 

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.510
 31.50. 

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:16.712
 You see the relationship between the price 

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:19.528
 and the number of tickets 

00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:22.754
 will always be 10.50. 

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:23.892
 10.50 divided by 1; 

00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:25.320
 21 divided by 2; 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050
 31.50 divided by 3; 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.627
 always 10.50. 

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:32.356
 This is because the price, in other words, 

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.009
 the price will simply be 10.50 

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:38.341
 by the number of tickets. 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.506
 It is clear that we have a direct relationship.
