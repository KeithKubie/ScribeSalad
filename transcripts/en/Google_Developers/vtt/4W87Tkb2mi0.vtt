ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.930
We're back here, and
this is Francois.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.730
And we're talking today
about the Developer

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.759
Mode in Chrome and Chrome OS.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.300
Actually, there are
different things.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.940
So let's try to cover this and
straighten a few things out,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.910
if needed.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.977
So first of all, what
are we not talking about?

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:28.060
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: That's
an open topic, actually.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.790
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So we
mentioned the developer channel

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.330
in Chrome OS in a
previous episode.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.020
This is not--

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.560
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Nope.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.730
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: --what

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.730
we're talking about today, OK.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.690
This is not Chrome
DevTools, either.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.230
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Either, no.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.200
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Developer tools.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.330
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Completely different thing.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.871
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: If
you want to debug your web app,

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.800
go through the DOM, and look at
your CSS and network traffic,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.360
all that.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.170
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Not that.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.378
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Nope, not that either, OK.

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:56.660
It's more about power users,
and developers specifically.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.360
So first thing,
Chrome the browser.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.870
There's a Developer Mode in
every Chrome installation

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.470
that there is on every OS.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780
What does that help you do?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.071
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And that's
very confusing, actually.

00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:09.610
But if you go to
the extension page,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.660
like the internal extension
page, chrome://extensions,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.550
you can see a checkbox.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.830
And this Developer Mode checkbox
lets you, as an extension

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.460
developer, debug and load
some unpacked extension.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.500
That's pretty useful.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
You can also update
your extensions.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
Usually Chrome just tries
for two or three hours

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.350
to pull some Web
Store data, just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.110
to see if there is an update.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.200
And you can just click on
this button and trigger it.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260
So that's not what
we're talking, either.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.593
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, but it's worth knowing it

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:47.212
exists, probably, if you
are developing today--

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:47.580
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
You know that.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.990
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Applications or extensions.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.948
You know it exists,
because that's the only way

00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:53.890
to install an app
which is developed,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.350
and that sits and lives locally.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.230
And if you want to
share this with others

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.600
and have them try it
out, they probably

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.490
need to have that
mode enabled, as well.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.320
So let's talk about
the Developer Mode

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.060
in Chrome OS on Chrome devices.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.530
So one thing you
can do is actually--

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.850
first of all, for those
that are not aware,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.180
there is a command line
interface to Chrome OS.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.596
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Definitely yes.

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:21.110
If you just press Control Alt
T on a brand new Chrome device,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.400
you stumble upon a page which
is like the Chrome developer

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.740
shell.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.410
We've not many options
like, top, ping, SSH,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.350
some basic commands that
you may need at some point.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.000
But that's pretty much it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.220
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Right.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.595
So you're definitely-- you
don't have root privileges.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:38.590
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: No.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.548
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
But you do have SSH.

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.040
So this is built on Linux.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.620
So there are a
number of features

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.110
that are made available through
that command line interface.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.400
Now we can actually
root the machine,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.040
or gain root access
to that machine.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.180
And is that something
important for people

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.190
to be able to do that?

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.600
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Definitely.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.183
The Chromium team
believes in the fact

00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:01.290
that every Chrome
device on Earth

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.820
should be able to own
his or her own machine.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.670
So that means installing
another distribution, maybe.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.850
Or just becoming
[INAUDIBLE], basically.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.433
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, so just

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.290
taking ownership of the hardware
independently of the software.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.010
So if you want to install
something completely different,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.270
you're able to do that.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.350
OK.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.380
So tell me, what does it
take to actually enable that?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.214
Walk us through the steps here.

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.130
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: OK.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.210
You want to know
maybe before, why

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.865
you want to enable
the Developer Mode.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:33.885
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Sure.

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:34.885
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Sure.

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:36.290
So first of all,
like I said, you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.700
can install a
Chromium-based distribution.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.060
So let's say you compiled
your own Chromium OS.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.070
You can install it.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.970
That's pretty cool.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.700
You can install another
Linux distribution.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.440
You can also boot
from a USB key or SD

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.120
card, where you
install another OS.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.930
What can you do also?

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.230
My favorite thing is
actually to install Crouton.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.110
So Crouton is like a
Chroot environment,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.320
which lets you run, side by
side, Ubuntu or another Linux

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.450
distribution next to Chrome OS.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.825
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And when you say side by side,

00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:15.700
it's one kernel running
two distributions.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.120
So you get all of Chrome
OS, as you know, and--

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.649
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.200
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Like it and love it.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.730
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: It's so
easy to switch between the two.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.040
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Right,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.620
and what does it take to switch?

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.500
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Control Alt
and you can use the F keys.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.430
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, great.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.655
So what do you lose
in the process?

00:04:30.655 --> 00:04:32.620
You must be losing something.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.350
First of all, updates,
and Developer Mode

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.100
here is not the
developer channel.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.240
These are two
unrelated concepts.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.480
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yep.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.340
You can be on stable,
on beta, on dev channels

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.400
and still get your
updates, even though you

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.950
have activated the
developer mode.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.030
I'm always in developer mode,
and I always got the update.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.550
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, so updates keep coming in,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.490
whatever channel you have, when
you are in the Developer Mode

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.862
and when you've
rooted your machines.

00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:05.070
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: But you're
losing one thing, yes--

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.819
the verified boot.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.329
And that's really important.

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.120
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So verified boot

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.490
is clearly one of the
important features of Chrome OS

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.790
or Chromebooks.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.720
Tell us, for those who
don't know what it is.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.950
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So, in short,
when you have a Chromebook,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.890
you can only run Chrome OS.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.710
And you can't trick
your machine to try

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.620
to load another
distribution or another OS.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.250
It's just Chrome OS.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.680
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Right.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.640
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And
that's the verified boot.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.990
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.300
a security feature, really.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.290
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Of course.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.498
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, so can I disable that?

00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:40.450
I want to go back to what I
consider a safer environment.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.150
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So let me
show you how to enter it first.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.910
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Oh yeah, please.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.010
Yes, we didn't cover that.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.510
Go.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.780
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So it's
pretty easy, actually.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.890
So there is a page
on Chrome that

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.500
explains for each device
which are the steps.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.240
But the most common step
are the virtualized one.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.417
So you just press Escape, the
refresh button, and the power.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.250
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, power button.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.791
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So it reboots
the button, your Chromebook.

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:07.430
And then you just press Control
D, D like Developer, and Enter.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.680
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.150
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And then
for five to 10 minutes,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.870
depending on your device,
it will erase everything

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.591
on your machine.

00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:15.840
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.830
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And boom,
you are in Developer Mode.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.040
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So from there on, when

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.360
I start the Chromebook,
it will tell you

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.080
you're about to start this in
Developer Mode, are you sure?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.080
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: No,
there is no are you sure.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.427
But there is basically
a white screen

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:32.010
where you have to
wait for 30 seconds.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.800
And then you've got these
annoying [MIMICS SOUND].

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.020
So you have to-- if you press
Control D, you just keep that,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.340
and then you go through
the usual experience.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.770
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
And then you are rooted,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.350
and then you can do
anything you want.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.610
And you do have root privileges.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.050
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Exactly.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.900
So, like before you
just do Control Alt

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.150
T to open the developer shell.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.940
And now I've got a
new command shell.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.960
And now I can just do sudo su.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.460
Boom.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.460
I'm root.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.520
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.220
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: I can
do pretty much what I want.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.594
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:06:58.594 --> 00:06:59.571
So about--

00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:02.070
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And how do
you leave this Developer Mode?

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.070
Actually, you just need
to read the instructions

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.310
at the beginning.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.440
It tells you just press space.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.870
Space, Enter, and
now you are gone.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.260
And you don't need to wait.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.816
Just in 10 seconds, you
just left Developer Mode.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:15.190
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.510
So hopefully that's
clear for you.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.900
This was about the
Developer Modes.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.990
There are different ones.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.750
I think we focused
mostly on Chrome OS,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.230
but hopefully we talked
about the other things

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.060
that are named after developers.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.102
We'll be seeing you in
another episode real soon.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:33.934
Thank you, Francois.

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:35.440
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Hopefully, yes.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.990
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Cheers.
