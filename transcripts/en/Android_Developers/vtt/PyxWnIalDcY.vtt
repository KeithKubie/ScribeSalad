&gt;&gt; LEAK: Hi, I’m Bruce Leak. At Skypop,
we have a vision of a new class of mobile

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.540
experience, something that has never been
possible before, at least not before the Android

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.490
platform. I’m here with Timo Bruck, our
CTO, and he’s going to share with you what

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.589
it’s like being down and dirty day one on
the Android platform.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.449
&gt;&gt; BRUCK: So on day one, like most engineers,
I got that every platform started running

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.649
our little world, and I ended up with a pseudo
code game. I just bypassed our little world

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.069
all together, come out with a nice graphic
to all applications. I've never had anything

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.280
like that so fast on a mobile device. The
platform is just that easy to use. Day two

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.239
is like, okay, well, what am I going to do
with this platform? So I kind of took the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.359
location APIs and the view and map APIs put
them together and wrote a friend-finder application.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.670
You can see where all your friends are. You’d
get maps just like Google maps in the web,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.719
but it’s on your cell phone. You have a
little compass down here in the corners to

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.260
help you find them if you want to try to,
you know, navigate the maze. It’s kind of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.149
like, you know, the starship, it's your tri-quarter
but to find friends instead of finding aliens.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.470
So then I want to take it to the next step.
I was like let’s use kind of friend-finders

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.000
plus games. What can you do there? So then
I came up with an idea of just doing kind

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.630
of a team geocaching. You know, you already
know where your friends are and know where

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.430
your opponents are. You can draw a map that
has the location of the cache, it has your

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.170
friends. You can send little taunting messages,
you know, when you think your foes are not

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.390
really catching up to you. And again, I focus
to spend my time just working on the application,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.270
on the creative part I wanted to do. Everything
else was provided by the platform, so it was

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.960
a lot of fun, productive and you know, what
a joy to work with which was a pleasure from

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.820
a little device.
&gt;&gt; LEAK: We, at Skypop can't wait for the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
first Android devices to hit the market so
that you can see what we’re really up to,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.710
and so that we can see all the great things
that you're going to develop. See you soon.
