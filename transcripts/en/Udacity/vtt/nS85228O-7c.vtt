So, here is the Python Standard Library and if

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.830
I scroll down here, I can find a module named

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.710
urllib. Let me click on it and here it

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.800
says, this module provides a high-level interface for fetching data

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.100
across the World Wide Web, which is just a

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.410
fancy way of saying, this module helps us get data

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.400
from the Internet or websites. And if I scroll

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.030
down on this page. I can find the function urlopen.
