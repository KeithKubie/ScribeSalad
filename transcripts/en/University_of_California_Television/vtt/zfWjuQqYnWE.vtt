00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.130
(air whooshing)

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.070
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.213
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.611
(bright electronic music)

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:39.650
- Welcome to a Conversation
with History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.750
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.230
Our guest today is Jeremy Waldron,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.100
who is University Professor
at New York University

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.350
School of Law.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.560
He is the 2009 Tanner Lecturer

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.030
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.940
Jeremy, welcome to Berkeley,
welcome back to Berkeley.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.190
- Thank you very much Harry,
it's very good to be here.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.810
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.100
- I was born and raised in New Zealand

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.084
in a little city called Invercargill

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:09.768
at the very south of New
Zealand's South Island.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.823
- And looking back how
do you think your parents

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:14.670
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.950
- My father was a clergyman,
he was an Anglican minister

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.460
and I'm sure that made
an obvious difference

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.840
to my religion but he
was also philosophical

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.610
in his thinking and he had
qualifications in philosophy.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.110
I used to follow him 'round
when I was a little kid

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.050
and it made a huge impact on me.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.843
And my mother,

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:38.070
the debt is even greater

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.830
but it's harder to put into words.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.400
It's an understanding of vulnerability

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.650
and the importance of
passion in everything I do.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.800
- And around the dinner
table did these philosophical

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.090
discussions with your father continue?

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.230
- Well they did, there
were five of us children,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.960
so a family of seven, so
philosophical might be

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.770
a generous time to describe the bickering

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.070
that would go on around the dinner table.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.400
But I had an older brother
and an older sister,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.730
and two younger sisters, and
the conversations there were

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.660
anarchic and wild and philosophical
and non-philosophical:

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.430
rock and roll music, fashion, gossip.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.350
- And current events?

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.110
- [Jeremy] And current events.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.887
- And how were you affected
by teachers as a young person

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:23.573
before college then after college?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.220
- I had a number of very,
very strong male teachers

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.677
both at elementary school
and at high school.

00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:37.200
I mean very, very strong
father figures I guess.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.124
I went to an all boys high
school and loved it there.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:44.850
You know I was on the
debate team and surrounded

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.680
with a cohort of equally nerdy

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.570
but equally high-spirited

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.400
boys.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.080
And then at college

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.390
I had the benefit of one

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.290
of the loveliest philosophy departments

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.610
that you could possibly
imagine, small, intimate,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.210
with some very, very good people.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.020
There was one woman in
particular Gwen Taylor,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.330
Gwen is still alive and
lives in New Zealand,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.380
she's in her 90s now and I go and see her,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.080
but she it was that introduced
me to political philosophy.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.570
- And this was where now?

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.530
- This was the University of
Otago which is in Dunedin,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.360
which is a city maybe 100
miles north of where I grew up.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.040
- And then you went on to study the law?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.770
- Yes that's right, I
studied philosophy first

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.220
and then I took a law degree;
there was a kind of overlap

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.170
and you could do a little
bit cross-crediting

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.710
between the two of them
and so I did a law degree

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.720
in New Zealand and then I went on to do

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.883
a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.740
- And was it hard to
make the choice between

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.340
being a practitioner,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.640
being a legal philosopher,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.610
or being a political philosopher,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.150
or the latter two sort of overlap?

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.470
- The latter two overlap, they're

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.660
sort of areas that
overlap at their centers.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.270
You know they don't just
overlap like a Venn diagram

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.030
at their margins, they're
like a couple of saucers

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.000
pressed up against one another.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.040
So that choice wasn't hard
and actually the choice to do

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.560
legal theory rather than
legal practice wasn't hard.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.900
It should have been harder than it was.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.120
I should have thought more about it.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.620
I regret in many ways
I never practiced law.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.770
I would have like to have been a judge

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.610
as many people do

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.320
but it seemed natural to
go on into the area where

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.660
my talents were

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.950
useful and that really was

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.417
in legal and political philosophy.

00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:40.810
- And what were the first
problems you grappled with,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.280
basically, was there a
particular set of issues

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.030
that drew you from the beginning?

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.490
- Yes, there were two sets of problems.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.730
One was issues about private property

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.670
and the justification of private property.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.020
I began thinking about that quite early on

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.540
in my college days and then I
did a little bit of teaching

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.750
as a graduate student and my
doctoral work was on thinking

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.650
about John Locke, and
Hegel, and other people

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.730
about private property, and
then the other set of problems

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.650
that really invigorated
me, Harry, in my early days

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.660
in college were a set of
problems about the enforcement

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.700
of morality, a set of
philosophical problems about

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.120
the enforcement of morality
by the criminal law.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.509
Problems that had arisen
primarily in Britain

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.770
and in New Zealand at the time

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.410
people were decriminalizing homosexuality,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.333
decriminalizing prostitution,

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:41.790
in a variety of ways people
were asking should the law be

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.450
in the business of trying
to make us better people

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.840
or should the law be in the business

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.020
of simply protecting us from harm?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.120
So it was a whole set
of issues I guess raised

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.555
by John Stuart Mill 150 years ago

00:05:53.555 --> 00:05:58.555
but they were very live in
the late 60s and early 70s

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.020
and that was again an issue on which I cut

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.930
my teeth for political philosophy.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.860
- Which it leads to a
question that I wanted

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.239
to address and for our audience here,

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:12.510
namely what does a philosopher do?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.220
What is different from
a legal philosopher does

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.150
from what a political philosopher does?

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.250
You've already talked a little bit

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.521
about that but let's go on with that.

00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:27.700
- Yes, both legal philosophers
and political philosophers

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.270
are interested in the
structures of the state

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.190
and they're interested in the
way state and law operate,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.740
the way in which they constrain people,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.220
the opportunities they offer,
the dangers that they offer.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.968
Legal philosophers tend
to focus quite tightly

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:45.300
on how to read constitutions,
how to read statutes,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.040
what the responsibilities of judges are,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.110
how to think about the nature of law

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.050
and its relationship to
other normative systems.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.450
Political philosophers
tend to grapple more

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.912
with particular problems,
whether it's problems

00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.070
of social justice, or private property,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.620
or the enforcement of morality,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.570
or the prohibition on torture,

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.016
but also political
philosophers do think about

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:11.740
political institutions
like democracy and issues

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.150
about political institutions
that aren't strictly legal.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.920
So as I say there is a
very, very big overlap

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.480
between the two but there are a great many

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.260
legal philosophers who
really have no training

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.470
in political philosophy
and I think that's a pity.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.089
- It would seem to be a loss just

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:33.010
to the outside observer,
there's a natural synergy.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.843
- There's a natural synergy.

00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:37.050
It's exactly right and it ought
to be more common that it is

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.440
but an awful lot of people
who do legal philosophy,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.320
they see their main philosophical home

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.760
as being moral philosophy
rather than political philosophy

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.140
and that means that they
take institutions, political

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.250
institutions, a little less
seriously than they should.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.610
- Now what about the
skillset that is involved

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.950
in this kind of work, if
students were watching this,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.020
I mean what might you
tell them about how they

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.213
would prepare for a career in this?

00:08:05.213 --> 00:08:08.600
- Yes, I mean we do
philosophy by, we do it

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.900
on the shoulders of our predecessors.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.743
So reading into the history of the subject

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.080
is hugely important; it's not
just antiquarian interest.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.470
We do this in the company
of people like John Locke

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.170
and Thomas Hobbes, John
Stuart Mill, Aristotle,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.750
Emmanuel Kant, this whole
canon, this whole pantheon

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.584
of great philosophers,
so reading your way into

00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:33.690
their concerns, their
texts, their letters,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.570
that's the first skillset,
and the other skillset

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.900
is a degree of patience
and that involves having

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.110
enough patience to be able to consider

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.090
an argument that you don't agree with

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.150
but to persevere with
the argument long enough

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.040
to get inside it and find
out what it involves.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.330
That's one of the hardest things to do

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.720
but it's absolutely important
in political philosophy.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.440
- And is there,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.210
it seems, well first in terms

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.490
of the academic preparation, it seems

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.630
to be that one has to
have a sense of history.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.463
- [Jeremy] Yes.

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.410
- And of the evolution
of society, this came out

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.160
very clearly in your
lectures yesterday on dignity

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.810
which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.870
so it's a broad-base set of knowledge.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.520
So it's not just that you
know and can think about Locke

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.270
and Mill but also what they were coming

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.650
out of and how that has changed.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.400
- I believe that's right.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.167
Not everybody would say
that that was important

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:32.400
for political philosophy, I mean again,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.660
I think you and I would agree
that this is tremendously

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.430
important as you say not
just to read the texts

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.170
as though they were written yesterday

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.220
but to understand the
differences and the movements

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.000
of history that frame the
problems that we deal with.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.420
- Now, earlier when you were
talking about how you got

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.360
interested in morality
and the law you seemed

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.930
to be suggesting that
in a way the problems

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.080
that you focus on

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.400
you come to because of
times you're living in?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.332
- [Jeffery] Yes.

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:05.440
- And what's going on
and such, talk about that

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.590
because that's very important.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.296
Because in essence,

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:12.880
it's thinking about big problems

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:18.030
with reference to the past
but also very strongly

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.520
reference to the present and
clarifying what the thinking

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.330
should be, or might be, or alternatives.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.920
- That's right, you certainly
come to these issues

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.012
through the problems that
you read in the newspapers,

00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:31.440
the legislation that's being proposed,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.520
the cases that are going
through the courts,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.233
the controversies that are
flaring up in politics,

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:40.660
but you also, because you
come to it with your knowledge

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.810
of John Stuart Mill or
John Locke, you will

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.930
identify problems in a particular way,

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.070
you will see issues
that maybe the ordinary

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.210
newspaper reader won't see.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.220
You say, aha, this is part of the problem

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.670
of political obligation where you say this

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.700
is a problem of the harm principle,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.320
or this is an issue of
dignity and your reading

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.300
into the history of the
subject, it enables you

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.320
to identify, label, and relate issues

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.710
to one another in a distinctive way.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.350
- And it seems that we have a greater

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.810
vacuum in this regard.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.220
I don't mean in the academic
departments of philosophy

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.290
but we seem to have lost

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.240
the public intellectuals in
the way we had them before.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.190
Is that fair?

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.210
What I'm getting at is not
a critique of philosophy

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.210
but a critique of public
discourse as we respond to events.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.900
- Yes, I wouldn't have said that myself.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.150
I think we've always had some people

00:11:40.398 --> 00:11:41.590
who weren't purely within the academy

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.890
even in political philosophy, some people

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.800
who work more flamboyantly
outside the academy.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.617
So for example, a man to whom

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:50.290
I owe a great intellectual debt,

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.660
Ronald Dworkin, he was my
doctoral supervisor at Oxford

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.700
and is now my colleague at NYU.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.270
He's the sort of the essence
of a public intellectual.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.150
He writes books, and
articles, and law reviews

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.010
and for university presses,
but he also engages with

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.730
great issues, particularly
about the Supreme Court

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.890
and great issues of rights in
the New York Review of Books

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.140
and in the newspapers, and
there are a number of people

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.240
like that who have a major presence.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.560
So I don't think that we are
bereft of public intellectuals

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.570
in this way; it is certainly
true that there are a number

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.870
of people who are in political philosophy

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.980
and don't speak out on public issues.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.990
There's a division of labor.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.730
Everybody finds their comfort
level and their talents

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.423
take them to a particular
post in this division.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:41.500
- Well I guess what I was implying is the,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.170
I'm thinking about the cultural debasement

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.540
which seems to lead to a
situation where there isn't

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.813
sufficient recognition of
people who are out there.

00:12:52.636 --> 00:12:54.260
- That's probably right and what we call

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.000
public intellectuals are probably writing

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.990
for a very small audience
and in that sense

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.480
there is some cultural debasement.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.480
- What about creativity?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.480
You're dealing with a
problem, you're looking back,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.830
you're influenced by the present,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.203
you're trying to clarify,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.980
when does the light bulb go off?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.940
Is there a general statement
or does the light bulb go off

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.910
in different ways with different problems?

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.490
- The light bulb goes
off in different ways

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.940
with different problems,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.543
and you wait for it to go off and on

00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:32.505
and you hope it will continue
to come on in various ways.

00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:34.190
Again, it's a matter of patience.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.020
You work your way into a problem.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.730
You begin to make a little bit
of progress on various fronts

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.240
and then gradually you
can see the big picture

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.320
and you can begin to see
a distinctive, a new way

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.240
of stating the importance of an issue

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.850
or articulating some principle

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.350
that hadn't been clearly
articulated before

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.650
or giving an account of the trajectory

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.162
of some change that may not
have been there just before.

00:13:58.162 --> 00:14:01.820
- Your Tanner lectures
on the Berkeley campus

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.980
have focused on the problem of dignity.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.330
I thought it might be useful to talk about

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.877
what you said, walk you through that issue

00:14:11.877 --> 00:14:14.860
and then maybe refer back
to some of the things

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.440
that we've just talked about.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.590
So dignity, how do you come to that topic?

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.530
Why is it important?

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.363
- Right.

00:14:24.938 --> 00:14:25.771
There's two questions.

00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.790
One is why is it important

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.890
and why did I get interested in it?

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.447
It's important in the way that it figures

00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:36.030
in the great human rights
charges in the universal

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.840
declaration of human rights
and the international

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.450
covenant on civil and political rights

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.330
in the Geneva conventions.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.360
Dignity is all over the place.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.340
It's cited as a ground
of rights and it's cited

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.780
as something that we have a right to.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.060
So, it certainly is presenting itself,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.670
it certainly is presenting
itself as though it were,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.340
maybe not the be-all and end-all,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.123
but certainly a very, very
important principle or value.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.670
I came at it, Harry,
through some work I had done

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.530
on torture and on inhuman
and degrading treatment

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.760
of detainees which is an issue

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.850
that many of us found
to our shame that we had

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.793
to be working on over the
last five or six years.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.950
Although some of that work
was public, intellectual work

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.340
on things that mattered
greatly in this country,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.880
there was a need for a great
deal of background work

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.207
as well to try and get some
background intellectual

00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:39.730
understanding of the values
that might have to be

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.020
invoked if we were to talk
intelligently and properly

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.060
about abuses of this sort.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.570
- And it's interesting because
we're talking at a time

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.470
when the Torture Memos have come out,

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.960
made public that were written during

00:15:57.278 --> 00:16:00.543
the administration of President Bush.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.960
In focusing on this topic,
you're helping us clear

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.750
the brush in a way.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.970
To give us a grounding in

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.170
addressing this problem.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.611
- I think that's right.

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:23.420
What I haven't done in the Tanner lectures

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.613
is say very much about the torture issue.

00:16:25.613 --> 00:16:28.850
I try to speak in more
general terms and often

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.260
in more upbeat optimistic
terms about what dignity is

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.700
rather than dignity being taken away.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.420
But the concerns about the Torture Memos

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.690
are of course vividly
in my mind and I imagine

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.900
in the minds of many
people in the audience.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.010
The important thing is
exactly what you say.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.070
It's important to grapple
with the deep values

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.060
that are in the background here.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.650
We do think that one of
the things about torture

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.073
is that it is a staggering
denial of human dignity.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.100
We need to understand
that that's not rhetoric.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.520
That's not just rhetoric.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.630
It's attempting to communicate
a substantial idea.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.650
So what I'm trying to do
is to say in a reasonably

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.370
upbeat way what that
idea may be and how it's

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.980
related to other things we care about.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.600
- I'm gonna ask you
about that in one second

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.210
but I think it's worth
making the point that

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.800
when as the American
public has been reading

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.373
the memos this week,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.593
this interview is taking
place in late April,

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.800
in reading them you're repulsed.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.770
I mean you're just, you
don't have to have read

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.590
any philosophical treatises.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.460
Just as a human being, you
intuitively have a sense

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.690
of dignity and what it is
and what has happened here.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.410
But it's quite interesting
as I listen to your lectures

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.010
and want to talk about this now,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.920
where does that sense
of dignity come from?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.240
What is dignity as you begin this inquiry?

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.360
Help us, give us an
understanding of what it is

00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:06.260
just in a few words.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.630
- I think dignity, human
dignity, is a status

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.690
that we now accord to
every man, woman and child.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.040
Dignity used to be a status
reserved for high nobles,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.500
high functionaries of the state, bishops,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.720
professors, statesmen and so on.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.100
But it's now, it's still
a high-ranking status

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.170
but it's a high-ranking
status that we accord

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.113
to everybody.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.770
It indicates that the
person has certain rights

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.440
so they can stand up for themselves.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.960
That they are to be treated
as worthy of respect

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.140
and that they are to be given
deference and precedence.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.020
They are to be given
some degree of authority

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.060
in their life decisions and the account

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.930
that they give of what they're doing.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.930
So it's a way of insisting.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.890
Talk of human dignity
is a way of insisting

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.400
that each person is to be taken seriously.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.990
Each person is to be
taken seriously as though

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.440
they were a very important person.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.150
Not just a commoner who
can be brushed aside

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.400
or somebody of no consequence.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.200
So dignity is a way of
insisting that we all hold

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.570
a quite high rank in society
and we're entitled to respect

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.280
on that basis.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.098
It has to do with how we're treated.

00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:23.720
It also has to do with
how we bear ourselves,

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.253
how we stand up for ourselves.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.310
Ultimately, it has to do with how we

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.010
enjoy our rights and
exercise them responsibly.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.530
- Now, what you call a
transvaluation, I think.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.530
Namely, when we move from
seeing the king in this way

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.210
to seeing every man that way.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:52.160
These ideas in a way bubble
out over time through

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.870
changes of society, right?

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.870
I mean, what we're witnessing is

00:19:59.138 --> 00:20:03.040
the emergence of a concept that reflects

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.721
the changing power structure
and the changing nature

00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:09.290
of Western society over time.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.030
- Yes, that's very true.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.280
I mean, societies are obviously
become less aristocratic.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.250
Less hierarchical, more
democratic in their organization.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.280
Certainly true in the United States.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.740
I don't mean more equal economically,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.673
but more equal in terms of status.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.560
So there are changes of that
sort which are very important.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.109
But there are also changes,
Harry, in the moral imagination

00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.920
and in how people think
of themselves and how they

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.110
think of others.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.860
As my commentators, I've
had the good fortune

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.990
to have three very good commentators

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.110
for these Tanner lectures.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.120
As they have reminded
me, the moral imagination

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.700
does wonderfully
complicated, ambiguous things

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.480
with the idea of dignity.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.670
Sometimes, it makes fun
of the dignity of princes.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.640
Sometimes, it makes fun of the pretensions

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.020
of the common man to have the
dignity of a prince or a duke.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.020
Sometimes, it uses notes
of pathos and irony

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.090
to suggest that the
dignity of the common man

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.410
is actually higher than the
dignity of the noble lord.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.830
And so it's not just changes in power

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.180
and changes in hierarchy.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.970
It's also changes in
imagination, in literature,

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.480
in all the various ways
in which we think aloud

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.310
to each other about our
relations with one another.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.610
- So you can then look to things like

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:31.070
the Judeo-Christian culture as introducing

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.570
the idea, or the Romantic
poets I think you mentioned.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.400
- That's right, that's right yes.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.950
I mean, there always was a tension

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.140
between an idea of human
dignity that was associated

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.940
with simply our being
created in the image of God

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.860
in the Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.010
and the idea of dignitas
attaching to particular offices

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.940
and ranks for example
in the Roman Republic.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.740
And those two streams were in rather

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.430
uneasy relationship with one another.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.040
What I see happening by the
middle of the 20th century,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.660
is not that one of those prevailed

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.830
and the other withered
away, but rather the strand

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.395
that emphasized everybody being
created in the image of God

00:22:15.395 --> 00:22:20.395
also took on some of the
sense of rank and hierarchy,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.600
but only now generalized
rank and hierarchy.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.580
- As you do this exploration and tease out

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:32.580
this story, it's very
clear, or let me assert

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.590
and you question what I'm saying,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.430
that there is an element of
idealism in what you're doing.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:45.150
So one has to step back and
say well he's not saying

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.840
it's always that way,
you are merely saying

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.640
that it's an idea that
is emerging over time

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.470
and that actually may be touched on to see

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.590
where we could even get
better in the future.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.580
- That is certainly true.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.960
It's exploring an ideal,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.810
it's exploring the shape of an ideal.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.950
The only quibble I would have Harry

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.170
with this term ideal, is
that that can sometimes

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.010
simply keynote a vague aspiration.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.940
But many of the most important
dignitarian requirements

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.010
are presented as moral absolutes.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.077
Now that also doesn't mean to
say that they're necessarily

00:23:23.077 --> 00:23:26.020
reflected perfectly in what we do,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.880
but they're not just aspirations.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.660
They are strong, normative requirements.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.713
And so the principal for
example that even the lowest

00:23:33.713 --> 00:23:36.562
or the worst detainee is to be treated

00:23:36.562 --> 00:23:39.520
in a way that's commensurate
with human dignity,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.410
that's an ideal, but it's
not just an aspiration.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.730
It's supposed to be a
requirement that people

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.510
should be punished if
they do not live up to.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.390
- Now when you look for the foundations

00:23:52.977 --> 00:23:56.657
of this concept, you pose two choices.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.130
One, to look for it in morality

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:06.720
and the evolution of
morality as if it were given

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.180
down from on high as one of
the commandments or something,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.470
and you really reject that and see the law

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.470
as being more important in
creating the foundation for this.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.053
Talk a little about
that, 'cause it's a very,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.800
it's surprising but after
one hears the argument

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.720
it makes a lot of sense.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.470
- Yes, I mean I don't want
to disparage the sense

00:24:34.112 --> 00:24:35.750
of morality associated with dignity,

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.820
but I do think people really
underestimate the resources

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.050
and the nature of argumentation
that goes on within the law.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.830
Law isn't just about
rules or constitutions

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.360
or statutes or cases, law has deep

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.120
principles and policies
and values of its own.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.260
And a lot of what we see with dignity

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.950
is an evolution within the legal framework

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.200
of important legal values.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.080
Not values that the lawyers
had to abandon their own craft

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.821
and go over and talk to the theologians

00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:07.670
and the moralists about,
abut ideas that were

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.720
endogenous to law and whose development

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.340
and dynamic of change
was endogenous to law.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.340
- So it's an interlogic, partly
coming out of assumptions,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.490
partly coming out of procedures,

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.583
that in other words,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.650
it's suddenly, well no, I
don't want to say suddenly,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.699
but over time dignity is emerging.

00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:34.399
I think you used the word imminent

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.200
in legal processes and assumptions.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.830
- I think that's exactly right.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:44.360
I mean law changes, and the
very idea of a legal system

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.850
changes over time.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.663
But I think we are evolving,
we have evolved now,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.490
perhaps over the last three
or four hundred years,

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.360
we have evolved now to a situation where

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.936
distinctively legal processes,

00:25:55.936 --> 00:26:00.936
distinctively legal
institutions imminently convey

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.630
a multitude of ideas about human dignity.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.690
Not just by laying down
certain rules about dignity,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.390
but by insisting that
people must be heard,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.910
by allowing people to give
an account of themselves,

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.740
by allowing people to make
arguments on their own behalf,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.880
by again treating them seriously

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.273
and insisting that they must
not be dismissed with contempt.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.480
- And so through all of
this, it's almost as if

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.340
a recognition is there even
if you have to pull it out

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.770
in a sense of putting
these things together.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.080
- This is true, and I think this

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.560
happens in law all the time.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.400
We don't just argue
about the interpretation

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.210
of rules and constitutions and statutes,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.300
we also try to recognize
deeper principles,

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.290
see important normative
passions in the law

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.580
that may not be visible
to the first glance,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.430
but require you to dive
deep into the resources

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.440
of the legal system and make connections

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.110
that wouldn't be superficially evident.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.270
- Now in making your
argument you put on the table

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.680
what morality and moral
philosophy had to offer

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.680
and you show a movement there
from focusing on the noble

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.080
to common man, making it universal,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.410
and then you focus on the law

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.150
and we've just talked about this.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.228
Where is power in this?

00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:20.570
And the reason I raise this is because,

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.272
when we get to torture,

00:27:22.272 --> 00:27:27.220
it seems to be that
power enters the equation

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.280
and can move us forward and set us back.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.730
- Yes.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.160
We live in a world
where power is organized

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.940
and exercised in certain
ways and not in other ways.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.420
Power is organized and exercised
through political systems.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.390
And through the frameworks
of law, so we very rarely

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.750
see naked power being exercised.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.970
And even, Harry, in the
distressing business

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.840
of the Torture Memos, what
was striking was an attempt,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.240
a perverted attempt, but
an attempt nonetheless

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.990
was made to try and show
how torture could take

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.380
its place in a legally
justified set of responses.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.370
I think it was a
disastrously inept argument.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:16.241
And it was a grave problem
that law was being tainted

00:28:16.241 --> 00:28:19.520
with this business of torture,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.371
but what was remarkable was
that those who were engaged

00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:26.970
in abusive interrogation didn't just say

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.470
let's do this and worry
about the law later,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.910
they dragged the law into the
torture chamber with them.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.445
They sought, not just legal cover

00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:38.260
but they sought a legal framework
for what they were doing.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.580
And that was both distressing

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.030
but in a backhanded way, quite inspiring.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.450
It shows that even at its most abusive

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.310
and at its most extreme,
you never see naked power,

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.650
what you see in political
life is politicized,

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:54.080
legalized, institutionalized power.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.360
- And in fact you made the argument

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.810
that it's an argumentation

00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:04.990
and one of the processes in the law

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.700
that allows for this sense
of dignity to emerge.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.360
But of course the whole
process of creating these memos

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.740
was to make them secret where
they couldn't be argued about.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.310
So in a way, this is
another proof of your point,

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.210
that they felt the need to do it,

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.410
and maybe they sensed that these arguments

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.320
would be dismissed, so
they kept it secret.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.010
- Yes, I suppose that's true.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:35.100
As far as we know, the memos
were produced at a time

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.230
when a number of people, particularly

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.880
in the Central Intelligence Agency

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.254
had become very nervous
about their possible

00:29:42.254 --> 00:29:44.493
criminal and legal liability.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.420
Some people, some quite
high-ranking people

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.260
had been tortured to death,

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.040
and there were a number of operatives

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.380
who were very nervous about their position

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.620
and wanted to know what
their legal position was.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.970
So it was important to the agencies

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.910
to get some clarification.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.860
I thought they were entitled to better

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.388
and rather stricter
advice than they received,

00:30:09.388 --> 00:30:12.540
but the advice was circulated

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.190
to the agencies that needed it.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.860
It's just that the public was intended

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.910
to be cut out of the process.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.320
- Right, but in different
parts of the government

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.370
when it was circulated and criticized,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.390
they were removed from circulation.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.180
- This is true, but you have to remember,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.030
we had Torture Memos circulating in public

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.160
and same as that form
no doubt, on the web,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.170
really from 2003, 2004 onward.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.080
The memos that have been
produced and released

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.913
in the last

00:30:41.687 --> 00:30:45.321
three or four weeks were
a second wave of memos.

00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:47.593
But some of the most egregious work,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.463
the Bybee Memo drafted by
John Yoo of this university.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.380
Some of the other Torture
Memos were reasonably

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.440
common knowledge to those
who appeared to look for them

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.247
certainly by late 2004.

00:31:04.247 --> 00:31:07.440
- Now this raises an interesting question,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.260
you've worked a lot, you have
a book on liberal rights,

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.230
you've thought a great deal about

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.280
the rights that have
emerged from out tradition.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.980
You're obviously working now on dignity,

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.980
and it's this problem
that terrorism poses.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.850
Looking at the Torture Memos,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.390
we're looking at the mistaken
response to terrorism.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.960
But terrorism itself is a problem

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.960
because it seems to want to fight in a way

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.810
that undermines many
of the central features

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.200
of what has become this
tradition that we believe in.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.730
Talk a little about that,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.790
because it's a new kind of adversary

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:58.912
that challenges us in our commitment

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.490
to the values that have adopted.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.543
- So let's put it this way,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.620
in armed conflict, in
warfare, there is often

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.250
some falling short of
international law standards

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.410
by armies and armed forces of all sorts.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.630
But terrorism is a military doctrine

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.470
that holds the whole panoply of the laws

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.093
and customs of armed conflict in contempt.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:32.010
It's an explicit turning of one's back

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.840
of the norms that we have introduced,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.750
the fragile norms that we have introduced

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.160
to try and mitigate the
barbarity of conflict.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.589
Terrorism claims to
succeed or hopes to succeed

00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:47.560
by deliberately violating, denigrating,

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.150
and smashing the very rules
that we have introduced

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.060
to try and allow some sort of modicum

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.570
of compassion, mitigation,

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.743
in armed conflict.

00:32:59.915 --> 00:33:03.070
And terrorism is wrong primarily
because it is murderous

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.560
and it does hold people's
rights in contempt,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.100
but it's wrong also because
it holds this fragile

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.520
necessary enterprise of regulating

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.003
armed conflict in contempt.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.680
As I say, armies, whether
it's the British army

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.030
or the American armed forces
or the Israeli defense forces

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:25.590
or the security forces of
the Palestinian authority,

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:30.360
these organizations
sometimes break the laws

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.500
of armed conflict, but they
haven't turned their back

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.360
on the whole enterprise
in the way that terrorist

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.700
organizations have, and I think that needs

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.680
to be said very clearly.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.210
The other thing is that
terrorism involves the same

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:46.023
instrumentalization of
terror that torture involves.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.470
I'm not saying that
this means that torture

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.690
is an appropriate response
to terrorism, it's not.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.980
It's not an appropriate
response to anything.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.440
But nevertheless, part of the,
by understanding what's wrong

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.210
with torture, we can also understand

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.610
what's wrong with terrorism.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.403
- Now,

00:34:05.024 --> 00:34:06.763
I guess what then would be

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.460
the way we should look

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.110
at an appropriate response to terrorism?

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.590
I mean, clearly we're
learning the many mistakes

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.160
that were made, how in a way

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:27.210
the Bush memos suggest a course
that takes a liberal society

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.170
and makes it like the
other, whom you've just

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.430
described quite adequately.

00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:37.110
Where, how should we think about that?

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.373
Because I think one of the things,

00:34:41.282 --> 00:34:44.180
one agenda that President
Obama is trying to set

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.220
is to say well we don't do this.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.050
So help us understand what
is an appropriate response.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.640
- Right, I think the first
thing to do is to distinguish

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.550
the particular evil of
terrorism from some things

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.500
that are often confused with it,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.500
namely for example insurgent
movements, irregular forces.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.960
The Taliban for example is a strong,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.350
dangerous insurgent movement.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.830
It often engages in
terrorism, it certainly gives

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.950
shelter to terrorist organizations,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.620
but it's position in Afghanistan

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.520
and to a certain extent,
its position in Pakistan

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.330
is that of a particular
fanatical insurgent movement.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.910
So it's very important I
think to distinguish between

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.440
how we wage war against irregular forces

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.033
and that sort of struggle

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:37.190
and how we deal with the
suicide bombers, the Al Qaedas,

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:41.383
the 9/11 terrorists who
were engaged directly

00:35:41.383 --> 00:35:44.760
in terrorism properly so-called.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.644
I don't doubt that it is
necessary to fight both battles,

00:35:47.644 --> 00:35:51.334
but dealing with the people
who are going to plant bombs

00:35:51.334 --> 00:35:54.260
in public places is somewhat different

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:59.140
from just engaging in the
regular, irregular warfare

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.480
in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.120
- And what emerges as we
think back about the last

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.730
eight years is really a
lack of clarity on the part

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:12.190
of the Bush administration

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:16.630
as to who the adversary was,
confusing national liberation

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.906
movements with global terrorists

00:36:20.906 --> 00:36:25.670
who are the Al Qaeda brand.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.253
- Yes, I think that's right.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.900
And I think it comes
back to this ambiguity

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.570
between irregular warfare and terrorism.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.890
When I say that terrorism
turns its back on the laws

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.800
and customs of armed conflict,
I have in mind primarily

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.963
the norm that says you are
not to attack civilians.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.823
So when,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.380
resistance forces,
insurgent forces in Iraq

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.290
or Afghanistan attack a
platoon of American soldiers

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.940
its very bad and it's shameful
and it shouldn't be done,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.550
but that's not turning
one's back on the laws

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.390
of armed conflict,
that's attacking soldiers

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.470
in a neo-military situation.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.120
Terrorism, that's not terrorism.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.730
Terrorism is this other thing
of deliberately attacking

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.090
civilians in order to sew
a certain amount of panic.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.750
So these distinctions are important.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.510
It still doesn't tell you how to answer

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.320
the question that you pose
which is how do you deal

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.707
with terrorism?

00:37:23.707 --> 00:37:26.800
And I think you try to do
the law enforcement path

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.240
as far as you can.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.733
You try to avoid making things worse.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.453
Sometimes people think
something must be done,

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.700
even if it makes things
worse, we must respond.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.440
And it's the beginning
of wisdom to realize

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.113
that sometimes all you can do
is avoid making things worse.

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:50.430
- I think this might be useful

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:55.290
to talk a little again about
power, because the norms

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.823
we're talking about, especially dignity,

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.140
emerge both out of international covenants

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.170
and out of national laws, basically.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.870
And one of the interesting things about

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.380
the Bush administration was it starting

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.170
with the assumption that
all international law

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.610
could be put aside,
almost all international,

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.110
much of what had become
part of the international

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.513
law of covenants, treatment
of prisoners of war and so on.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.923
What I

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.980
want to ask about is the
fragility of the basis

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.060
of the concepts that should
guide us as we approach

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.220
this new problem.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:44.220
- Yes, I think that a
fragility in international law

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:49.620
has been exposed in this period.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.060
One of the interesting things is the way

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.240
in which international law operates.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.962
It very seldom tries to
do all the work by itself.

00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:59.410
What it usually does is
it works hand in hand

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.980
with national law, so for
example we have the convention

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.120
on torture to which this country

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.540
along with lots of other
countries is a signatory.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.510
That's a treaty, multi-lateral treaty

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.840
and has the status of international law.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.680
But that treaty requires those signatories

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.420
to pass anti-torture legislation.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.420
So we have an anti-torture statute,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.730
and that's American law, and so we work

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.610
with two layers, all the time.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.660
And international law
does that all the time,

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.505
not just on human rights treaties,

00:39:30.505 --> 00:39:33.370
but it does it on civil aviation treaties

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.410
and postal conventions and so on.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.160
You have one layer where you
have the international law

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.520
provisions and then you
have a layer below that

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.670
with the various national legal systems

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.450
try to echo each other and echo the

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.250
international law provision.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.020
And at its best that's how
international law works,

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.780
rather than, I mean
it's rather like we have

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.500
the human rights
conventions, but we also have

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.350
our own constitution.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.480
And our own constitution does in its way

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.040
much of what the international
human rights conventions

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.080
try to do in their way.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.300
So we have a phrase for
that, it's one of the ugliest

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.880
phrases in political philosophy,

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.960
but it's called dual positivization.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.460
Two levels of positivization.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.850
We positivize the law at
the international level,

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.000
and we try to positivize the
same law at the national level.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.040
- And its very clear
that there's a synergy

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.150
between the two as we
see threats of invoking

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:31.100
universal jurisdiction
to some of the former

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.090
Bush administration officials as a way

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.430
to push the national system

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.510
to undertake some sort of inquiry.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.780
- I think that's right, I mean I think

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.490
that's very unfortunate if that becomes

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:46.363
the primary way in which
these abuses are dealt with.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.830
The United States generally in its history

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.420
has had a creditable ability to be able

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.470
to remedy its own shortcomings.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.530
And we should expect that
of every national system,

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.570
and every well-disciplined set

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.890
of military and security forces.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.700
That they can use their own military law

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.840
and their own criminal law if
need be to deal with abuses.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.840
We shouldn't have to rely
on some Spanish judge

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.890
or the International Criminal
Court to do these things.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.620
And I think it's wrong for
scholars, however concerned

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.620
they are about torture and other things

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.060
to become too intoxicated
with universal jurisdiction.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.860
It's very exciting when it happens,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.510
as it was in the Pinochet
case for example.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.020
But it can't possibly be the
front line mode of enforcement.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:37.020
- What do you think should
be a path of inquiry

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.400
with regard to this matter?

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.160
I say path of inquiry,

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.100
something seems to be
done, in other words,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.710
to close the case on this
issue, to have a sense

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.200
that this was done and
it was wrong to do it

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.550
for these reasons.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.800
There has to be an inquiry, a tribunal,

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.890
a truth commission, whatever.

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:02.360
Do you have any thoughts about that?

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.460
Because obviously politics
interfaces with this

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.870
and if you go for criminal prosecution

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.850
within the country, it may undermine

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.050
other items on the agenda that
have nothing to do with this.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.480
- That's perfectly possible.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.160
And if you go for criminal prosecution,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.820
I'm not saying you
should or you shouldn't,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.320
but if you do go for criminal prosecution,

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.720
then the political
reasons for opposing that

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.290
may translate too quickly
into political reasons

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.593
for opposing the whole torture regime.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.320
In 1973,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.630
Great Britain was accused
of using of using torture

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:44.490
in northern Ireland, certain
methods of interrogation

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.460
remarkably similar to some
of the ones that were used

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.313
in Guantanamo Bay.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:54.380
And they were introduced
as a matter of policy,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.930
and the government of the United Kingdom

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.550
shortly after exception
was taken to these,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.830
made a public announcement
saying we have carefully

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.480
considered what we did, and
we will never do it again.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.250
And we give an undertaking
to the national community

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.830
that we will never do it again.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:13.960
I don't know that they
held any particular people

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.340
criminally responsible,
and it may or may not

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.510
be a good idea in certain
circumstances to do that.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.348
It's probably a good idea just to proceed

00:43:23.348 --> 00:43:27.030
in the way that we are
proceeding at the moment,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.593
which is that the office of
professional responsibility

00:43:29.593 --> 00:43:31.670
within the government is investigating

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:35.100
the low level of legal work done by people

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.060
in the Office of Legal
Counsel and elsewhere.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.150
And that's a matter of making
sure that the professional

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.000
standards remain high,
this was a great lapse

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.080
in professional standards.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.850
I don't know whether we particularly need

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.620
a truth and reconciliation commission

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.453
or anything like that.

00:43:49.453 --> 00:43:52.500
We need to know what
happened, but we actually do

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.950
have a reasonably clear
understanding of what happened.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.000
What we need primarily is to concentrate

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.864
on this announcement to the world

00:44:00.864 --> 00:44:01.970
and that in no circumstances

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.320
will we go down this path again.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.150
- What would you like to see,

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:11.150
the philosophical discourse
on issues like dignity

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.800
contribute to, this process of coming

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.192
to terms with what we've done,

00:44:20.192 --> 00:44:21.960
and how does that happen?

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.548
- Yes, the one thing that
I found very very hard

00:44:25.548 --> 00:44:30.548
in the philosophical discourse
was to get a clear sense

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.610
of a moral absolute, that
there were certain things

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.400
that were simply not to be
done in any circumstances

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.870
no matter what the advantages may accrue,

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.070
no matter what the
temptations and the anger

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.910
and the panic that was background to them.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.160
And it proved much much
harder than I thought

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:53.270
to convey the point within
modern philosophical vocabulary

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.610
and modern philosophical ideas

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.020
that there were certain absolute

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.310
prohibitions on certain conduct.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.920
The law can make sense of these partly

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.500
because we can simply announce
an absolute prohibition,

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.470
and torture is absolutely
prohibited as a matter

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.330
of national and international law,

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:11.351
there's no emergency exception, nothing.

00:45:11.351 --> 00:45:14.750
But philosophically,
it revealed that we are

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.644
a little bit bankrupt so far as the ideas

00:45:17.644 --> 00:45:22.120
that are necessary to make sense
of an absolute prohibition,

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.870
even in the face of
overwhelming temptation.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.570
I believe personally this is partly

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.200
because we've turned our back
on certain religious ideas

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.827
associated with morality,
but that's a separate one.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.540
- Now the

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.080
answer on the other
side is always the use,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.590
misuse of the ticking bomb scenario

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.270
and the extent to which that has been

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.563
embedded in the popular
culture is quite extraordinary.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.042
How do we get beyond that?

00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:57.380
At one level it's very easy to dismiss,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:02.380
but on another level it
really holds the imagination

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:07.450
even though what has
gone on here has moved

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.180
very much beyond the ticking bomb.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.071
The ticking bomb situation one might not

00:46:12.071 --> 00:46:16.660
want to have rules for,
and it's all just done

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.170
very quickly and then over.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.760
But here the process was bureaucratized.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.243
- Yes, it was.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.350
I don't want to subscribe that
we should just let it happen

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.280
but not bureaucratize it,
although that's attractive

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.960
to a number of people.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.890
The ticking bomb scenarios generally

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.400
just present arithmetic.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.580
They present a large
number of lives at stake

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.300
on the one hand and a
considerable amount of pain

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.720
for one person on the other hand.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.150
And if the argument is not accepted,

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.750
then they double the number
of lives on the one hand

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.100
to justify the pain on the other hand.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.040
The ticking bomb story is just

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.430
arithmetic with illustrations.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.110
The real point is to be able to understand

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.410
what might be at stake in torture

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.042
in a way that's not
revealed by consequential

00:47:05.042 --> 00:47:07.580
calculations of this sort.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.410
And that's where I think
dignity is very important,

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.690
that dignity is not
just a certain aesthetic

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.440
or a posture that somebody might value,

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.300
but that dignity has to
do with the fundamental

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.680
sacred status of each human being.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.623
And so we need to understand,
begin to understand,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.880
even in the ticking bomb scenario,

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.340
that the proposal is to
do something sacrilegious,

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.910
effectively, to a human being.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.293
Sometimes I find it useful to say,

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.963
in the debates I've had on this,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.960
that we all have some blocking point

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.850
or some stopping point which we would use

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.880
to resist even the
ticking bomb hypothetical.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.640
There are many people
who claim that they would

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.550
be prepared to support torture to stop

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.470
a ticking bomb from going off.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.450
Would they be prepared to support rape

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.230
to stop a ticking bomb going off?

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.290
Or the raping of a terrorist's children

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:07.550
to stop the ticking.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.520
Usually some people will, as it were,

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.130
draw the line somewhere.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.170
They will say no, this is too abhorrent,

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.553
this is too much of an abomination.

00:48:15.553 --> 00:48:18.700
My view is that we should draw that line

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.410
roughly where the law has always insisted

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.710
that it be drawn, at torture.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.900
But if people, it's almost as though now

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.120
I'm playing the game from the other side,

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.390
just as the ticking bomb
people multiply the number

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:34.260
of possible victims to try and
make their rhetorical point.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.730
I'm making my rhetorical
point by saying even

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.849
the most hard-nosed consequentialist

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:41.920
is gonna find some practice
that he will regard

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.210
as too abominable to be supported,

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.000
even with a million
people strapped to a bomb.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.240
- I hear you suggesting that

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:55.130
we're missing what
religion might have wrought

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.700
on some of these moral issues,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.110
that somehow a vacuum as been created.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.470
Am I correct in hearing that?

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.907
And what do we do about that?

00:49:05.907 --> 00:49:10.907
And how does a secular world
where law is so important

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:15.150
make note of what is lost there

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.410
and be informed by it?

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.810
- It has to acknowledge the loss,

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.750
I think is the first thing.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.180
You can't artificially recreate it

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.863
if people don't have religious faith,

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:30.330
then there's no way in which
you can force them back to it.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.350
But you try to give
some secular surrogates.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:37.240
I mean I believe myself
that torture is sort of

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.960
a way in which the demonic
enters human affairs.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.890
But you can give a sort of
a secular account of that.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.443
I believe that,

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:51.450
the security that might
be sustained by torture

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.510
is a security not worth having,

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.160
and that we should be
disgraced rather than enjoy it.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.380
And I think we can state that idea

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.480
in secular terms.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.870
I believe that there are some things worse

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.290
than death and the threat of death.

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.130
And that sometimes the response
to a ticking bomb scenario

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:15.610
is we should be prepared to
die rather than to do this.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.890
It's easier to say that from
a religious point of view,

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.990
but it's not wholly unimaginable

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.533
from a secular point of view.

00:50:22.449 --> 00:50:23.703
So,

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.310
the hardest thing to convey is the sense

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.660
that there is something
ontologically sacred

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.303
about the human individual,

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.440
and that no matter what the temptation

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.490
or no matter how bad the human individual,

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.830
there is some respect still owing.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:46.530
And this is not an argument
against punishing terrorists.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.640
It's not even argument
against executing terrorists.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.540
It's insisting nevertheless that you must

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.380
be prepared to proceed
with the recognition

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.670
that the person you are
proposing to try and punish,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.690
to apprehend and to stop,

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.900
to interdict and perhaps to kill,

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.133
is nevertheless a child of
God like everybody else.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.800
- Do you, one final question,

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:14.140
do you, as somebody who's worked on

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:18.380
thinking thorough the rights and liberties

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.672
that are part of our tradition,

00:51:20.672 --> 00:51:23.390
do you feel that we're gonna have to do

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.210
careful thinking in the future

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:30.470
as we respond to this security threat

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:31.770
that we've been talking about,

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:34.400
that we're gonna have to make adjustments?

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.010
And will we have to bring the
same kind of thought process

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.260
that we brought to this torture issue

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.480
to other issues such as
freedom of the press,

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.860
free speech and so on?

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.460
- It's conceivable Harry, I
don't think we can rule it out,

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.390
we shouldn't assume that
any given set of rights

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.810
or any given set of
the way in which rights

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.260
have been calibrated in the past

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.520
is guaranteed to be
suitable for the future,

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.840
or even that we have got a right.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.483
There are a number of
issues where we still argue.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.270
Should hate speech be prohibited

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:11.250
or does free speech protection
preclude that, for example?

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:14.340
And those are cases
where we are not yet sure

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.230
that we've got it right about rights.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.290
Some of those issues are
background and enduring,

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:19.860
some of them are circumstantial,

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.290
so I don't want to rule anything out.

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:25.370
But it matters enormously
that when we think about

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:28.660
adjusting rights or adjusting
our understanding of rights

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.770
in the light of new threats to security,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.740
that we must understand that it is rights

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.150
that we're adjusting, and
that's not a small thing.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:38.770
These are very very serious constraints

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:41.130
designed to do a very serous job,

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:44.260
and they're not supposed
to be simply responsive

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.483
to issues of social convenience.

00:52:46.483 --> 00:52:50.010
And they are supposed to
be informed by a logic

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:53.710
of equality and by these
ideas of dignity and respect.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.400
We must take care even when

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.710
we're juggling them and recalibrating them

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.270
for a more dangerous
world, that we bear in mind

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:01.820
that these are the primary ways

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.200
in which we protect human dignity.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.620
- Well on that note Jeremy,
I want to thank you very much

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.170
for coming on our program,
coming back to the campus

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.150
and delivering the Tanner
lectures, thank you.

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.210
- It's a delight to be here
Harry, thank you very much.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.010
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.173
for this Conversation with History.
