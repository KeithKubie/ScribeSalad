1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,610
The Joe Rogan experience.
Everything I did like, you know,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,270
that did, I did outside of music when I
tried it. Like for instance, paint ball,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,080
when it went into paint ball, there
was a price on my head. Every game,

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,050
every body wanted to give me extra shots.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,930
So like if I got hit well I'm walking out,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,850
I would get 10 20 extra paint
balls to my back. Oh. You know,

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:25,980
and we'd give it right back to them,
you know,

8
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,890
in the very next game when
we played them guys again,

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,360
we were making sure to give
them that right back. You
got deep into this. Oh yeah,

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,230
it was, man, it's addicting
that I got to tell you. Um,

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,380
if there's any physical
activity that is addicting,

12
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:45,381
it is painful because it's chest with
guns because it's so fast and so close and

13
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,590
you gotta think of a strategy, you
know, it's not all shooting straightway.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,000
It's all shooting angles and getting
your guys to positions to get those guys

15
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,290
out, to keep moving up, to get their flag,
wipe them out and bring the flag back.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,420
Now there restrictions on power. Like
the power of the guns. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,990
I believe you can't shoot above 300 PSI.
I think it's,

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,570
I think it's a,

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,120
the highest you can shoot us maybe
to 85 to 90 at least at the time.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,900
If you go balls out, if you wanted
to get the ultimate paintball gun,

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,420
what does that, oh man it's, it's,

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,370
it's hard because we were using
different guns at the time cause it's,

23
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:26,580
it's like a, each year a better gun
comes out, the technology gets better.

24
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,260
So you know, we were using it
first when we started these,

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,740
these guns called angels and then we went
over into uh, these other guns. Fuck,

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,680
I can't remember the name of them,
but they were light.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,950
I mean the best thing is
to have a light gun with,

28
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,290
with the trigger that you can fan see.

29
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:47,850
Cause that's the technique to get it
to shoot like a, like an Uzi. Right.

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,570
You're not supposed to be able to pull
the trigger and multiple balls come out

31
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,440
with one pool.

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,360
It's supposed to be that the gun
shoots as fast as your, your, your,

33
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,710
your two fingers or three can toggle.
So if you get a rhythm,

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,010
you could shoot that thing
like a fucking Uzi, you know,

35
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,620
and everybody has a different
position, you know, like mine,

36
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:11,130
I was like one of the quarterbacks,
which is the last three on the line.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,380
See it's like a football field,
right?

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,540
You got the 50 and there's obstacles at
the 50 and in between and it's mirrored

39
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,374
on the other side.

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,650
The quarterbacks play the back and they
shoot a whole bunch of paint so that the

41
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,020
other guys that are the front and
mid guys can get into these different

42
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,330
positions to shoot the other guys out.

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,300
So the guys in the back were
shooting the most paint.

44
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,250
So you have to use that fanning
um, style. So using three fingers,

45
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,200
three fingers, cause the trigger
where your, where the, the,

46
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:45,790
the base where you're pulling the trigger.
You can fit three fingers there. Yeah,

47
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,080
it's really for two. But you
could fit three. Yeah. This,

48
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,890
this was our team right here.
Still on assessments and disaster.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,760
And we were always pretty
stoned when we're playing.
Did that help? Yeah, the, the,

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,390
the furthest we went, we took third
place in one tournament. Wow. You guys.

51
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,230
So this is crazy.

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,590
Like you guys have these barriers in
shed and these are all blow up barriers

53
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,040
right here. It's like a football field.
Yeah. That's what they would replicate.

54
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,700
Like a football, soccer
field. And uh, you know,

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,640
you put all the, these,
these obstacles up,

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,760
these blow up obstacles and uh,
they're all just positions to,

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,730
to try to take, to um, get a
better angle on the other side.

58
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,930
And what's the, what's the ultimate
goal to take everybody out? It's uh,

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,110
you get points for taking
the other side out,

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,440
but you get the maximum points getting
their flag and bringing it back to

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,570
yourself.
And you know,

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
you get points for how many guys on
your side that are still alive. So,

63
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:45,880
you know, you would get 100% if
all seven of your guys were alive,

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:50,830
you killed all of them and brought their
flag. That ever happened? Oh yeah. Damn.

65
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:55,720
Who are you playing? Uh, you
know, crawling around the
shed to thing about painful,

66
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:00,130
right? Is it, let's just say there's
six tiers, right? There's the pros,

67
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:04,330
there's a semi-pros, there's the amateurs,
there's the novice, there's the rookie.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,480
And uh, each, each,

69
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,720
each tier had at least 200 teams
competing in this wow per tournament.

70
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,020
And these guys back in that time,
I don't know how, how it is now,

71
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,220
cause I haven't competed in a long time,

72
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,700
but they would do five tournaments a year.
One would be in Huntington beach,

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,570
the biggest one. And it was awesome.
They would throw it, you know,

74
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,370
right next to a surfing tournament.

75
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:30,400
So like it would just be
cross people crossing up,

76
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,800
watching the surfers and they
come and watch and the painful,

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,250
then it would hit to,
you know,

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,530
Boston and Florida and um,

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,190
Las Vegas and one other, one
other place. I can't remember.

80
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:46,210
But we would do these tournaments. I was
doing them for like four or five years.

81
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,980
And the guy before me that was
the, the ambassador was, uh,

82
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:51,814
one of the,

83
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,980
one of the BGS [inaudible]
the one who passed away first.

84
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,850
I'm very good. It was embarrassing. Now
he's the one that always wear the hat.

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,840
Um, he was the shorter
one. So he was a paintball.

86
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,190
He was a paintball feeling like myself.
He owned the store.

87
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,130
He had a team,
I think it was based out of Florida,

88
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:15,970
out of Miami and he would compete
up until when he passed away.

89
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:19,000
He was like the ambassador
and I kind of is. Yeah.

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,980
I came in and took his spot when
he's, yeah, Maurice. Maurice gift.

91
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:28,000
That's crazy. I had no idea. Yeah. Wow.
You guys are armored the Fuck Up, Huh?

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,550
These things want to sting.
Oh Man.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,200
I mean I'd leave with at
least 20 paintball bruises,

94
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,840
you know, Pr, you know in one
sitting and you know you're, you're,

95
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:41,830
you look like a leopard coming.
Wow. Coming off after that,

96
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:45,760
you know who else was a big paint ball
enthusiasts was William Shatner. Really?

97
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,620
Yeah. He would hold these
crazy tournaments like in
Trekkie style where it's a

98
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,460
scenario game. Meaning that,
okay, here's the castle.

99
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm going to be in the castle right
here. You guys got it? Siege the castle.

100
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,980
And if you guys can
come get me out of here,

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,850
you guys win this round and they
would see it through the three days.

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,590
They'd set up different scenarios.

103
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,360
Like there you go to William Shatner
play a pay phone. This is crazy.

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,820
I would've never guessed. But how does
he run? He can't run well no, he is old.

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,540
He doesn't run. They, they put him
in a central place and he'll shoot.

106
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,290
Sometimes he would go out there but
so he would just stay put. Yeah,

107
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,880
he would staple it. You would have
to protect him. Old Man paint ball.

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,840
He would fight too. He would fight
too, but he would, he would, you know,

109
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:37,010
they would be trying to protect
him. Oh, that's so crazy. Yeah. Wow.

110
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,800
And uh, I mean there's a
bunch of celebrities that,

111
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,970
that paint bald man will
Smith was paintballing before
he did I robot. Oh really?

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,220
He did that. He came down to the
park where we would practice that we,

113
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,590
we played with him and his team.
Um, but it was a scenario game.

114
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,730
Joaquin Phoenix,

115
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:57,731
we MCI Pfeiffer a made be surprised
how many it looks like fun.

116
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,740
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
You let off steam. Yeah.

117
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,940
And how many people on a team?
On on a con, a competition team.

118
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,080
You have a,
uh,

119
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,850
you have 11 for the roster and seven
play at a time and you can, you know,

120
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,190
switch guys out.
But now it's different.

121
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,040
Now they do like five
men in three men teams.

122
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,510
I don't know anything about the
new style, but you know, they,

123
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:23,210
they constantly call me back cause I'm
in better shape than I was when I played.

124
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,180
I was a little bit heavier than
that's why I was at quarterback.

125
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,960
You know, I wasn't running too fast then,
but you know that they always hit me,

126
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,410
man. I'll always get hit on my DM
on ige or Twitter. Like, hey man,

127
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:40,490
when you come back to the paypal
feeling like, ah, when I get time,

128
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:44,810
which is probably never, but it seems
like a a big time suck. Loved it man.

129
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:48,380
I loved playing the game.
It was so addicting. It was
hard to pull away from it.

130
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,860
I would even at times becoming home from,

131
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,820
from a tour straight into a tournament.
Like I'd get off the plane,

132
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,970
I'd have somebody have my paint balls,
shit ready and boom,

133
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:02,240
straight to the tournament. I can't tell
you how many times I was doing that.

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,160
Yeah. It's fucking crazy. It's, it's funny
when things get in your blood, right.

135
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,110
Getting your bones. Yeah. That got
in my blood, like martial arts did.

136
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,470
Cause I was always like an enthusiast,
like, you know, for, for a long time,

137
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,560
you know? And uh, when I
finally started training,

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
I was trained in like seven days a week.
Man.

139
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:25,610
I wouldn't give myself any
time off because I wanted
to learn fast and I wanted

140
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,180
to absorb it, you know? Yeah.
