00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
Okay, so let me look at the requirements and

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.150
it's something that I can see here that we didn't point out before is that

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.540
there seems to be clearly some concept of a due date. And I'm telling you why

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.610
I'm saying that because here, for example, I notice that it says when items are

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.580
due. We mention overdue several times, so is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.410
this something we need to keep track of?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah remember when we used to stamp them on the books? In the stamp pad?

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah yeah yeah! Oh course!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.600
&gt;&gt; Right? Yeah we definitely keep track of,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.390
the system has to keep track of when books are due.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.300
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it seems to me that one good way

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.660
of doing that is by basically adding an attribute to the, item.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.910
&gt;&gt; And I'll just call it due date.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.400
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.360
&gt;&gt; So basically for each item in case it's loaned

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.315
there will be this attribute that will contain the value of

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:48.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.710
&gt;&gt; Of when, when the item is due. And then, something else that I noticed

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.734
here is that down here, it seems like

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.900
the requirements are saying that an item can

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.190
be renewed only once. So, I guess, that's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.933
something we need to keep track of, right?

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:06.056
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:06.700
&gt;&gt; The system needs to know.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.360
&gt;&gt; We have to know whether they've renewed it or not.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.132
&gt;&gt; Okay so, I'll do a similar thing here. I think I want to go and add a an

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:19.140
attribute that we'd call number of times renewed, and add it to the item class.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.140
&gt;&gt; And this is kind of more generic

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.180
than what you need, because here it says only once, but

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.800
let's say that in the future you want to allow it to,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.690
kind of renew twice, you'll be able to use these attributes again

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.090
because, we can just count how many times it was renewed. Okay?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.680
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.980
&gt;&gt; Alright. And one last thing I want to point out.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.310
And this seems obvious but I'm going to check with

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.150
you anyways. And seems like there is a basically the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.090
need to keep track of whether an item is checked

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.210
out or not. If you look at the text here,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.080
the requirements here, I can see that check out and checked out are

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.070
mentioned five times. So, I'm assuming that that's something also

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.080
that we want to know about an item, whether it's checked out or not.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.970
&gt;&gt; We have to keep track of whether they're checked out.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.930
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll add an

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.340
additional attribute there. So I'm going to again go

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.480
back to the diagram and I'm

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.139
just going to write here also the checked out attribute.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.590
And, I think that's it as far as I'm

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.330
concerned. Is there anything that you think is missing?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.077
&gt;&gt; Well, I do have a question. Would checked out,

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:27.140
better not be the case that someone can check out a reference book.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see, I see.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.120
&gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, it's only the books and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.780
the audio visual material that can be checked out.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.790
&gt;&gt; Right, right, right. Okay, so I, I guess, well the way I will fix that is,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.300
I'll probably put yet another attribute in the item class, and I'll

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.860
call it loanable. And basically, this attribute is just telling us whether

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.580
an item is loanable or not. So, when it's not true and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.480
loanable is not on. Basically, that item can be checked out.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.174
&gt;&gt; Okay. And, the system would know this.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.450
&gt;&gt; The system will know that.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.160
&gt;&gt; And prevent it from happening.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.240
&gt;&gt; And prevent it from happening. Okay?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.750
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.918
&gt;&gt; Perfect. So, we're going to do that and, any other objections,

00:03:02.918 --> 00:03:04.035
any other?

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:05.730
&gt;&gt; No, that was my question.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, so what I'm going to do next, I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.130
mean, I haven't mentioned that yet, but you know classes right

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.890
now we just looked at the attributes right that give

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.140
you sort of the state of the class. And there's something

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.185
else, there's a second part of the class that is kind of

00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:22.520
an orthogonal aspect, which is what the class can do. And we

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.640
call those operations. So normally these kinds also have operations, I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.000
guess you know it would make sense to you as well.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.070
And one way, one very natural way to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.310
identify operations is to look at the requirements and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.850
look for verbs. Because verbs associated with an item

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.480
will tell you basically what the item can do.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.250
&gt;&gt; So I, I'd like to go back to the requirements and

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.110
start, the same way in which we underlined, nouns, we're going to underline

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.340
verbs and we're going to see which ones of those verbs actually represent

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.120
actions that we want to represent explicitly, we want to model explicitly in

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.950
our class diagram.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.750
&gt;&gt; Okay.
