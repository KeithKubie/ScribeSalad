Since we've been talking about points on these curves, let's graph them. Here's

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:08.957
the graph of f of x equals 10 to the x and here's the curve of g of x equals

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:14.290
log base 10 of x. Since these two functions are inverses, there's a link

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.620
between their domains and their ranges. Using interval notation, I'd like you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.220
to find the domain of f and the range of g and the range of f and the domain of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.949
g.
