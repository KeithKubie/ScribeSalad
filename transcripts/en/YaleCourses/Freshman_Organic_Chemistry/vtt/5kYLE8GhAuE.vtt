WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.450
Okay.
So we have the promise of the knowledge of everything,

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.510
at least everything within a certain category.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.970
And we saw how we could see quantized energy last time and structure and

4
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.430
structure related to dynamics,
how,

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.120
how nuclei vibrate and how it's different for a,

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
for a heavier Adams.
Uh,

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.030
today we're going to look again at a different kind of dynamics and also at

8
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:32.380
bonding.
So in the one dimensional world,
this is the payoff.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.970
We have to go to the three dimensional world.
Okay.

10
00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:41.920
So you did problem sets for today and you are now familiar with things like
this.

11
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.840
Uh,
what do you know about the blue curve and the red curve here?

12
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.170
Anybody got a suggestion of what to do or what they tell you about what the true

13
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:56.080
solution is?
Angela

14
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.040
can't hear very well.
Yeah,

15
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.460
the true solution should be between them there,
the red one is,

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.140
is too hot and a blue one is too cold,
right?

17
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.000
So they'll be in between them.

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.800
There'll be one that'll just come back down to the baseline for Hooke's law.
Now,

19
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:22.801
the problem is that this isn't Hooke's law because I didn't show you the whole

20
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:27.130
picture.
It's in fact the double minimum,
right?

21
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.920
And those are both true solutions.

22
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.890
So the,

23
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
the the correct single minimum energy would lie between those two,

24
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.880
but for the double minimum,
there's one,

25
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.660
there's a solution that's lower in energy and the solution that's higher in

26
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.880
energy.
Now,

27
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.600
what would happen if we moved the wells further apart here,

28
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.260
you see the separation to the two wells is 0.6 songs,
drums.

29
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.810
Suppose we moved that apart to be,
uh,
uh,

30
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.250
1.3 OnX drums.
Right?

31
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.040
Now we have blue and red solutions,
but now you notice the,

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.230
it's the blue solution or the red solution.

33
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.650
They're the same in the left and they're both the same as the single minimum.

34
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.630
So if you get the wells far enough apart,

35
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.380
why they look like single men about with respect to their wave function.
Okay?

36
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.060
Now,
closer wells,
if we moved the wells closer together,

37
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.920
we get a lower minimum energy than for the single well solution.

38
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.543
<v 1>Okay?</v>

39
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.110
<v 0>And we got a higher energy for the next higher one.</v>

40
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.580
But they both look like the single men that they both started when the wells

41
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.660
were far apart looking like the single minimum solution,

42
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:51.130
one with no nodes,
one with one note.
When the wells were far apart,

43
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.570
they had the same energy as the single minimum.
But when the wells come together,

44
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.990
the one with no,
no nodes has less curvature,

45
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.710
less kinetic energy in his lower energy than the single minimum.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.720
And the other one has one node more curvature that the single minimum and a

47
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.721
higher energy that is to say there's a splitting between the energy of these

48
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.100
too.
If the wells are far apart,
they are the same as the single minimum,

49
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.540
both of them,
the no,

50
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.680
no nodes and the one node solution or the same as the single minimum.

51
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.930
But if you bring them together,
the nodes is lower in energy and the,

52
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.060
and the one note is higher in energy.

53
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
So the energy is split about the original single minimum structure.

54
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.550
Now that's really important because that's what makes bonds,
right?

55
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.680
So if we have,
uh,

56
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.970
two Adams or one dimensional,
uh,
uh,

57
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.440
wells far apart,
say a and B,
right?

58
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.800
And we get a solution in a,
and a solution in B,

59
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.260
and if we want the solution for the whole thing,

60
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.410
we just put them together that way,
right?

61
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.370
No nodes or we could flip be upside down,

62
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.500
multiply it by minus one,
add them together then,
and we get one node,

63
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.190
but they have the same energy as the single ones would do,
right?

64
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.640
But if we bring them together,
the energy gets lower,

65
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.940
less curvature.
Right?

66
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.270
And that consists or gives rise to a stabilization of the particle.

67
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.970
The particle is more stable when the wells are closer together,
right?

68
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.480
What would you call that?
That's a bond.

69
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.910
The energy is lower when they're close together.

70
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.830
So that holds a and B together because the energy of the particle is lower when

71
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.300
the wells are close together.

72
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.890
So that's bonding and part and parcel of this.

73
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:55.360
The flip side of this is that you have this wave function,
which is higher,

74
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.220
what will we call that
antibody?

75
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.710
So you get combination of bonding and an anti-bonding combination because the

76
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.370
kinetic energy changes.
When the wells come closer together,

77
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.290
you get one that's less curved,
one that's more curved.
Okay,

78
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.010
now that's bonding.
How about dynamics?
Well,

79
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.660
I suppose we have this double minimum and suppose we put a particle in and stop

80
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:27.400
it there so it has zero.
That's our zero of energy.

81
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:31.510
And then we're going to let it go.
What will it do if it's classical,

82
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.260
it'll roll back and forth,
right?
Bingo.
Let it go.

83
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.650
Roll across to the same height and roll back again and then roll across again to

84
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:46.330
the same height
with no friction.
That goes on forever,
right?

85
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.060
But here's what happens.
Special in real quantum mechanical systems.

86
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.220
Oops,
that went too far

87
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.210
and now it's going to roll back and forth in the right.

88
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.950
But every once in awhile it goes across from one well to the other.

89
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.860
Now this is called tunneling for obvious reasons,

90
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.160
right?
But the word tunneling I hate,

91
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.740
it's one of my pet peeves.

92
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:32.210
It's misleading and mischievous because it suggests there's something weird

93
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.820
about the potential energy,
right?

94
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
That you can tunnel through and have a potential energy lower than is than you

95
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:44.270
would have guessed from the potential energy curve.
But that's not right.

96
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.760
What happens is when it's in the middle,
you have negative kinetic energy,

97
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.610
you have the potential energy that the curve shows,

98
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.010
but the kinetic energy is negative.

99
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.130
The potential energy can be higher than the total.

100
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.100
And this happens in every bonded wave function as you saw in your problem set

101
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.570
that the waves always go out into that forbidden region of negative kinetic

102
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.760
energy where they curve away from the baseline.

103
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.290
So there is the forbidden region out to the left,

104
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.280
to the right and also in the middle for that energy.
Right?

105
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.520
And what really happens is that you go to negative kinetic energy and high

106
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:33.791
positive energy to get over that Hump and then you get across to the other side.

107
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.320
Now how often does that happen?

108
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.540
It turns out that the time to get from one well to the other,

109
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.050
which I won't be able to prove to you because it requires time dependent quantum

110
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:51.560
mechanics and we're talking about time independent quantum mechanics.

111
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.880
But let me just tell you that the answer is if you know the energy difference

112
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:57.440
between the blue and the red,

113
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.640
that the rate of getting across is five times 10 to the minus 14th seconds

114
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.740
divided by whatever that energy is expressed in kilocalories per mole.

115
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.120
Right?

116
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.620
This is just an assertion and it's based on time dependent quantum mechanics.

117
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.210
It's true,
but I'm not telling you why.
So he won't be satisfied,
I hope.

118
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.550
Okay,
so the energy difference here is 1.4 kilocalories from all.

119
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:31.280
So how rapidly does a particle then get from bill if it started out in the left,

120
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.360
how long do you have to wait on average until it's in the right one,

121
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.110
you have to wait five times 10 to the minus 14th divided by 1.4 which means

122
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:47.321
about four times 10 to the minus 14th seconds it takes to quote tunnel,

123
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.540
although it really doesn't bore through,

124
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.440
it goes over with negative kinetic energy.
Okay?

125
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:57.870
So there's something else about dynamics and we're hoping soon to get to

126
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.810
reactivity will come after the exam.

127
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.270
After we talk about atoms and molecules.

128
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.140
So now it looks like we're in a pretty powerful position,

129
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.580
at least with respect to one dimension.
Because with this and program,

130
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:16.581
we can find satisfactory wave functions for any complicated potential.

131
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.700
We can make it anything we look like and just follow the recipe.

132
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.260
Find out allowed,
uh,
allowed energies,
shapes of wave functions,

133
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:29.250
probability density,
uh,
rates of tunneling,

134
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:30.450
all this kinds of stuff.

135
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.790
And we can rank all the wave functions by their energy or their curvature,

136
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.680
the number of nodes they have.
Uh,
here's,
here's a,

137
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.150
a unsatisfactory wave function.
What do you notice that's bad about it?

138
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.340
Is The show that you've learned something?
Yeah,
start at the baseline.

139
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.290
It doesn't start at the baseline on the left.
How about on the right?

140
00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.270
Does it look okay on the right
Lucas?

141
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.420
Odd Process,
the baseline in the forbidden region,

142
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.700
if it crosses the base line while curving away,

143
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.920
it's bound to go to negative infinity or positive infinity that crosses in the

144
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:23.610
other direction.
Right?
And on the,
on the,
uh,

145
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.130
on the left,
uh,

146
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.800
because it didn't get to the baseline when it became flat,

147
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.520
it's going to keep curving and go up to infinity.
So you've got,

148
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.980
you've internalized a lot of this stuff now.

149
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:42.840
Congratulations on doing well on the problem set.
Okay,
so that was a bad one.

150
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.110
Okay,
so it looks like we're in pretty good shape.

151
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.310
We even can handle multiple minima and understand tunneling and so on.

152
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.670
The unfortunate thing is this curve tracing recipe doesn't work if you have more

153
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:57.750
dimensions.
Remember,

154
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.920
the reason it would work is if you knew the potential and the kinetic energy

155
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.650
potential in the total energy,

156
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.580
then you knew the kinetic energy and you could assign it to curvature,

157
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.180
right?
But if you have two dimensions,

158
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.510
then there are two different curvatures you could divide.

159
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.850
You could assign it to it.
You don't know how much to put in each of them.

160
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.840
So it's no longer such a clear cut problem if you have more dimensions,

161
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.470
especially three n dimensions.
So when there are many curvatures,

162
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.020
it's not clear how to partition that kinetic energy.

163
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.990
But Schrodinger had no trouble.
These are the,

164
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:35.910
the shooting or equation is what's called a differential equation.

165
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.360
It involves derivatives,
right?
And you haven't,

166
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:41.430
how many people have had differential equations

167
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.730
and maybe a fifth w I guess,
or fewer,
right?

168
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:49.590
So the rest of you are feeling,
Gee,

169
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:52.500
I wish I knew differential equations cause then I could do this,

170
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.510
but shredding hurt.

171
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.720
But you don't have to because people already have done it.

172
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.020
You don't have to develop this from ground zero.
Right.

173
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.220
And Schrodinger didn't solve the differential equations either,
right?

174
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.780
He knew what the solutions were because people had been study on them forever.

175
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.640
And the reason they studied it with because of studying acoustic waves and light

176
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.474
also,

177
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.250
and Claude ne is the guy who originated this.

178
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.380
And here we have the book,
uh,
by Claude knee called acoustics.

179
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.340
I got it out of the live business.
In fact,
the,
the,
uh,
new,

180
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.470
uh,
uh,
unchanged addition from 1830,

181
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.680
the original additional with something like,
uh,
uh,

182
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.040
18 five or something like that actually will see it here.
I think

183
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.050
there is Claude knee,
Eric's Florence Friedrich Claude knee.
And there's,

184
00:12:48.051 --> 00:12:49.730
this is the title page of that book.

185
00:12:49.731 --> 00:12:53.330
Acoustics of the original one was 18 three RS is 1830.

186
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.910
Okay.
Now what he did was take plates of different,

187
00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:02.510
or he also did violin strings and Tiffany heads and things like that.

188
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:06.230
He was interested in all kinds of acoustics so that the particular experiment

189
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:11.231
were interested in was he would take a plate and suspended in the middle and

190
00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:16.100
touch it in different places while he was blowing it with a violin bow to make

191
00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:18.320
it vibrate.
Okay.

192
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.620
So you vote in different places and he'd put sand on the surface of this thing

193
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.880
to see what shit,
what patterns would be formed when the thing vibrated,
you know,

194
00:13:28.881 --> 00:13:33.620
this is why violins have the shape they have is so the bell vibrate in certain,

195
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.530
in certain ways,
when the,
when you make,

196
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.620
when your boat or make the vibrate and the sand collects where the plate isn't

197
00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:45.830
vibrating.
Cause when it's vibrating it shakes it away.
So you,
uh,

198
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.740
you get a picture of the pattern of vibration.
Now we're good.

199
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:51.260
I'm going to try to show this to you.

200
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.363
<v 1>Uh,</v>

201
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.140
but yeah.

202
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.600
<v 0>Hey,
it might not work.
And just in case I can go to the web.</v>

203
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.100
So what we have here is a,
I can't play a violin,
but as you know,

204
00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:11.810
I can play a bell.
In fact,
I can play a bell in several ways.

205
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.013
Not all.

206
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.890
I can do it this way too.

207
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.463
<v 1>Oops.</v>

208
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.633
Well Shit.

209
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.190
So

210
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.340
<v 0>that's not a very pleasing sound.
Why?</v>

211
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.833
Why is it,
what's,

212
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.220
I'm not very good at playing the bell.

213
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.753
<v 1>Yes.</v>

214
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.850
<v 0>Why does dry ice maker bell ring?</v>

215
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.780
This was discovered in London by an ice cream vendor who had a bell on his,

216
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.260
on his cart.
And he asked the physics teacher,

217
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.940
a woman in,

218
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.210
in London why his bell rang when the dry ice from his ice cream hit it.

219
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.510
<v 0>So you,
when,
when you,
when you touch metal like that,
it,
it uh,</v>

221
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:30.420
gives heat to the dry ice,
which causes it to give off a pressure of gas.

222
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.620
But what it gives off,
the pressure on the metal moves away,
then it's not,

223
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.810
then he's not being transferred so it stops.
So you get rapid pulses of co two,

224
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.990
which make the thing ring.
But depending on how you touch it,

225
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.530
you get noise because there are many different patterns of vibration at

226
00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:49.860
different frequencies that are being generated.
If I could do it just right,

227
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.340
I would generate just one pure tone and then you'd say,

228
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.240
what a great player of bells he is.
Okay.

229
00:15:57.241 --> 00:16:01.530
Now I'm going to try this and I may fail in the same way to do an experiment

230
00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:06.110
like Claude needs,
but instead of using a violin bow,
a,

231
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.710
I'm going to put sand on here.

232
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.750
Instead of using a violin bow,
I'm going to use this piece of dry ice.

233
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.080
<v 1>Let's see.</v>

234
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.730
<v 0>Okay,
and I have to,
if I just touch it,</v>

235
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.960
it won't do anything because I'll be touching sand and I won't get heat
transfer,

236
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.130
so I have to brush a little bit together.
Clean part of the brass,

237
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.650
and then let's see what happens here.

238
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.810
No,
I'm doing the same thing I did with the bell,
right?
It just noise,

239
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.860
but let me try some place else here.

240
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.820
This is an empirical science.

241
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.180
<v 0>All right.
Let's try some</v>

243
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.060
spread some around here.

244
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.660
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

245
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.040
<v 0>if you're lucky.
This is really great.</v>

246
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.050
<v 1>I</v>

247
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:50.883
<v 0>hear that pure one,</v>

248
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.070
maybe it's not sharp enough.
We don't want to spend too much time doing this.

249
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.560
I want to try one more and then we're gonna.

250
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.200
You can go to the website and see a much better one.
One side played.

251
00:18:19.201 --> 00:18:23.310
Just the lost chord,
you know,
are really beautiful tone and it's on,

252
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.390
you can see it on the web.

253
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.890
I'm trying to find where and how hard to touch so that I get a really pure tone.

254
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.360
Well,
you're can get patterns that way.
Okay.

255
00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:53.770
You can get much prettier patterns and pretty or tones than I'm able to coax out

256
00:18:53.771 --> 00:18:56.860
of the thing right now and you can look at it on the web to see it.

257
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.170
Uh,
okay.
Turn that off.
Oops.
Wrong one.

258
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.210
Uh,
okay.
That has to cool down,
but I'll put the lecture over there temporarily.

259
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.970
Uh,

260
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.840
yeah.
There we go.
Okay.
Once this cools down,
we'll get back there.
Sorry.

261
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.371
Okay.

262
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:27.900
So these are some crude clot clot and the figures that I've made in the past

263
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.010
three rains,
uh,

264
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.680
two rings with a line through the middle vertically.
Uh,

265
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:38.040
that's the one we just made.
Now I think,
isn't it?
Isn't it the same number?

266
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:44.270
A ring in three diameters and there's a circle in four diameters that I actually

267
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:48.870
made that in class last year.
Okay.

268
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:53.070
These are ones that Claude needed did back in the late 18th century.

269
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.020
<v 1>Taken from that book,
right?</v>

270
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.600
<v 0>And here,
the first ones are just diameters.</v>

271
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.560
And the next ones are rings together with a certain number of diameters are two

272
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:09.420
or more rings.
Now let's see what that picture means.
Uh,

273
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:14.510
below you'll see a vertical diameter and two rings on top.

274
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:19.851
You see color coded as to whether the plane at an instant of vibration,

275
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.370
whether it's toward you or away from you,
is it's vibrating.

276
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.850
That's the pattern of it.
Cause those lines don't move.

277
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.830
But either side of a line,
one side moves up,
the other side moves down.
Okay?

278
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.930
Or You could look at it this way.
The,
the dotted patterns,

279
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:40.660
the circles and the line.
Don't move as the rest of the thing deforms.

280
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.960
This would be like a drum head on a Timpani.

281
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.820
Got The idea.
So that's the pattern of,
of a,
a motion.

282
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.560
Now,
uh,
uh,
Claude knee was interested in,
in sound,

283
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.390
right?

284
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.390
So he found what pitch each of these different patterns corresponded to.

285
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.770
So this table shows the number of diameter that are nodes,

286
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.730
the number of circular nodes and what pitching corresponds to.
And the,

287
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.230
the little lines make me that's a little sharper,
a little flat,

288
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:19.090
something like that.
For example,

289
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:23.920
the one with two diameters and no rings is that pitch,

290
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:25.930
see out the idea.

291
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.220
So then he tried to figure out if there's a mathematical relationship among

292
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:34.330
these things.
He,
those were 47 patterns that he observed there.

293
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.600
So here he says the pitch relationships agree approximately with the squares of

294
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:43.900
the following numbers.
So how many diameters,
how many circles.

295
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.400
And what do you see is,

296
00:21:45.401 --> 00:21:50.401
is if the frequency is roughly the number of diameter diameter nodes plus twice

297
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.550
the number of circular nodes squared.

298
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.080
This is his empirical observation.
So for example,

299
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.100
you could have two diameters or one circle.

300
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:08.110
Both would give the number two,
which you then,
uh,

301
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.640
which you then square,
right,
to get something proportional to the frequency,

302
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.710
right?
So there are two different ways to get the same pitch,
okay?

303
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.700
That's what's crucial.

304
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:23.620
Either rings or lines or you can have a combination of rings in lines.

305
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:24.760
Uh,

306
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.470
so for higher frequencies you can get more and more combinations that give the

307
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:33.430
same pitch.
For example,
the number eight,
you can have four circles,

308
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:34.570
three circles and two lines,

309
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:37.780
two circles and four lines of circle in six lines or eight lines.

310
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.170
All of them give the number eight and all give the same pitch at least

311
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:45.460
approximately.
Okay?
So this is what he,

312
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.300
but the lesson we want to take is that there are different ways of getting the

313
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:54.220
same frequency by combinations of these nodes.
Okay?
Now,

314
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.260
uh,
Claude,

315
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.410
he didn't solve his problem mathematically about how plates or strings or

316
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.460
whatever vibrate,

317
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.470
but there were great mathematicians working on this like Bernoulli law garage

318
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.550
Euler,
who not only made a,
uh,
uh,
Communist,
uh,

319
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.120
Germany stamp.
He also made a Swiss 10 frank note,
okay?

320
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.390
Okay.
So the size for one electron atoms.

321
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:23.260
Now we're going from one dimension into three dimensions for a real Adam

322
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.650
electron in an atom.
So for one electron atom,

323
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.230
they're going to be three variables,
x,
y,
z.

324
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:31.960
For the electron and the solutions.

325
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.660
The waves were going to get our involve what are called spherical harmonics and

326
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.200
are three d analogs of Claude knees,
two d figures.

327
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:44.390
These mathematicians could work in three dimensions as well as to,

328
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.260
okay,
so a three dimensional h atom wave function,
sy,

329
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.890
uh,
is,

330
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.070
could be written as a product of three functions at our function,

331
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.780
a theta function at a fee function.

332
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.450
And these were available from other old time mathematicians.
Uh,
the,

333
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:10.451
our function is called the associated Laguerre function and his name for Ed Mole

334
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.580
Laoghaire and the a theta function is called the normalized associated Lashondra

335
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.270
polynomial.

336
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.240
After Adrienne Marvey Lashondra okay,

337
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.040
now here are the solutions.
Schrodinger didn't find these.

338
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.870
He just looked him up.

339
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.950
These guys had already done it from acoustics for three dimensional things

340
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:36.230
vibrating,
right?
So it was,

341
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.610
so here's a table that you could use the shade and same way Schrodinger would

342
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:45.611
have used it to find out what wave functions for electrons in one electron atoms

343
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.790
actually look like you.
And all your books,
you've seen pictures of these things,

344
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.750
but you've never seen.
My guess is you've never seen the real thing.

345
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.460
And you should wonder,
are these pictures that people have shown me,
right?

346
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.050
I'm going to get this center projector on again if I can.
Yeah.
Okay.

347
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.370
Now how,
how do you understand this looks pretty complicated.

348
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.430
This table in a sense it is,
but if you look at it the right way,

349
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:16.720
it's really pretty simple.

350
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.850
It relates to the position of an electron shown on the right there relative to

351
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:26.500
the nucleus and the cell.
There's only one electron.
It's a one electron atom.

352
00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:30.580
Otherwise we have more dimensions,
right?
And,
and,

353
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.510
but the nucleus could have any charge you want it to.
So it's a one electron,

354
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:37.930
Adam,
of any nuclear charge.
And we have the coordinates x,
Y,Z ,

355
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.320
and we have a,
a potential,
uh,
with the potential.

356
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.060
What is the,
what's the potential law that's given to us?
Whose law?

357
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.590
Cool.
Ohms law.

358
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.420
So what's one over r squared and how do you write r squared?

359
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.200
R squared is x squared plus y squared plus [inaudible] squared.
Right?

360
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:04.190
Everybody know that?
Everybody know that?
Good nod.

361
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.390
Yes.
Good.
Okay.
We're on the same page here.
Okay.

362
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.270
But that's pretty complicated function,
right?

363
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:15.560
So the equations that involve that are going to be really,
really complicated.

364
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.370
But there's a clever way to get around this.

365
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.500
Do you know what that way is?

366
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.040
What's the clever way of getting around this?

367
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.900
The clever way of getting around it is to change that.
The coordinates,

368
00:26:34.901 --> 00:26:39.040
the system that you're using to one that's more natural for the problem.

369
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.390
And the one that's natural for the problem is Sperry or po spherical polar

370
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:47.760
coordinates.
So the three dimensions are,

371
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.430
are the distance and theta.

372
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:55.110
The angled down from the Z axis and fee the angle rotated around from the x

373
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.730
axis.
Well,
you can define it any way you want to.

374
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.540
This is the way it's defined in for these purposes.
Okay?

375
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.110
Now,
uh,

376
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.970
so that simplifies the expression for potential enormously.

377
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.710
Instead of being one over the square root of x squared plus y squared overseas

378
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.700
square,
it's one over r or some constant over are.
Okay.

379
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.560
And what that means is,
and this is the mathematical,
a payoff,

380
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.950
that the wave function can be written as a product of three functions,

381
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.010
each of which is the function of only one variable.

382
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.070
Instead of having x squared,
y squared,
z squared,

383
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:46.020
all mixed together in this complicated function,
you have a function only of our,

384
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.370
a function only of theta and a function only of fee,

385
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.990
and you multiply them together and you get the solution to the Schrodinger

386
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:59.610
equation for one electron atom.
Now that,
uh,

387
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.890
that this table gives you those functions,
the,

388
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:07.260
our function,
the fate of function of the fee function.

389
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:10.500
It's like a restaurant where you get to choose one from column a,

390
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:13.110
one from column B,
one from Column C,
right?

391
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:17.880
Here's your appetizer main course and your dessert,
right?

392
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.870
So you choose one of these,
one of these,
one of these,

393
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:27.030
multiply them together and you have the true function right now they look very,

394
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:31.140
very complicated.
You can't choose any combination you want to,

395
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.980
once you've chosen one,
once you've chosen your appetizer,

396
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.960
you can only have certain main courses.
And once you've chosen that,

397
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:43.440
you can only have certain desserts to get solutions,
right?

398
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:47.250
This is what these mathematicians that all figured out.
Okay.

399
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.080
And uh,
so how do we go about,
uh,
doing it?

400
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.030
Well,
we can name the PSI.

401
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:59.031
We're going to get by a nickname like one s or two p x or something like that.

402
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:06.050
But you can also name it by the numbers that name these individual functions.

403
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.670
And those are in l and,
m,
which I think you've encountered before probably.

404
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.960
So let's,
uh,
let's make a try at it.
No,

405
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:19.260
we'll actually noticed something about the complicated form of the functions

406
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:23.880
first.
Every one of them has z over a zero to the three halves.

407
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:24.714
Power.

408
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.750
Zhi is the nuclear charge a zero as a unit of length of about half an angst from

409
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:34.830
about,
okay,
so to the three halves power,

410
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:38.190
that's pretty weird.
But remember what you're going to do with the wave function.

411
00:29:38.191 --> 00:29:40.800
What do you do with wave functions other than find energy?

412
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:48.370
Yep.
Probability density.
And what do you do to do that same square?
You're square.

413
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.000
So when you squared,
it's going to be z over a zero cubed,

414
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.540
right?
When you square it,
everybody with me on that?
Okay?

415
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.600
So what that means is you're going to get units that are CSI cubed per unit

416
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:10.270
volume,
because remember a zero is a distance.
So a zero cube does a volume.

417
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.970
So it's going to get a number.
The nuclear charge is a number Z.

418
00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:20.230
The atomic number is a number.
So it's got to get a number per unit volume,

419
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.180
which is the right units to have for probability density.

420
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.780
What is it per unit volume?
Okay?
So this is just the bit that,

421
00:30:29.781 --> 00:30:34.420
that scales that right?
So that you get the right density in the right units.

422
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.570
Okay?
So Z,
so you can drop that out.

423
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:41.680
That's not something very fundamentally interesting.
Okay,

424
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.430
let's try making up a one s orbital.
Where do you start?

425
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.720
Can somebody tell me where to choose?
It's not hard.
They're labeled with red,

426
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:57.160
right?
If you want one s you choose the top one,
okay?

427
00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.050
And uh,

428
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.030
now if you've done that and is one and uh,

429
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.170
uh,
l is zero.
So when you come to the next one,
uh,

430
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.870
l has to be zero.

431
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.260
Now am can be either zero a or one.

432
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:21.270
Oh No,
actually,
wait a second.
If it's one,
uh,

433
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.790
no.
If Al is zero,
then m has to be zero.

434
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:29.470
It says in the second column is everybody see that?
You see top,

435
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.630
it says if l is zero,

436
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.440
then m can be zero l m okay.

437
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.480
If l for ED,
for l for em,
hard me to be non zero

438
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:47.090
like here you have to have an l that's greater than than zero.

439
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.850
Okay,
so to get a solution,
if you,

440
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.900
if you chose a and one and l had to be zero,

441
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.610
because remember that's the only choice here you can't have a higher El,

442
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.730
then m is also going to be zero,

443
00:32:01.731 --> 00:32:05.280
so you've got to take this times this times this.
Okay.

444
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.970
Now how complicated are those functions?

445
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.760
K Square root of two over two.
That's just the constant.

446
00:32:16.761 --> 00:32:21.050
That's nothing function or one over the square root of two Pi.

447
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.820
Right?
Big Deal.
Why do you have these constants in there?

448
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.380
Why do you care what constant?
You multiply the wave function by

449
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:36.620
for what purpose?
Normalization for normalization,
right?
If you want to get abs,

450
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.010
but if all you want is the shape,
forget constants.

451
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.260
So what's the real working part of the one s wave function?

452
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:49.550
What's the part that varies?
We have here at the zoo for a zero to three halves.

453
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:53.240
Forget that to forget.
That's where two over to forget that.

454
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:56.680
In fact the twos when cancel square to to here would cancel that square to two.

455
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:00.380
So it's one over the square root of Pi Times this time.
Swat

456
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:06.830
either the minus row over to,
that's the real working part of it,

457
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.350
right?
When you square it,

458
00:33:09.351 --> 00:33:12.380
what are you going to get from e to the minus row over to

459
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.390
what's either the minus row over two squared?

460
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.470
Yeah,
Alex e to the minus row.
Okay.
So the,
the,

461
00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:28.400
the probability density is going to be either the minus row times of constant.

462
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.180
Okay.
So here we got it.
It's a constant times,

463
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:36.890
either the minus row over to when we square it,
it's e to the minus row.
Now,

464
00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.000
uh,
there's something interesting.
There are two things that are interesting here.

465
00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:45.680
One,
we wanted to get a function of r theta and fee,
but we don't have our in it,

466
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.700
right?
We have row instead.
Why does,

467
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:54.470
why do we substitute are by row.
There's a good reason for that.

468
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.360
Row is defined,

469
00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.710
which is indeed the Greek version of R is row.
Okay.

470
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.250
It's defined as our time's a constant.

471
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.430
The constant is twice the atomic number divided by n the quantum level n times

472
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:13.430
that distance a zero.
And why do you do it that way?

473
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.880
It's because if you do it that way,
then the same,

474
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:22.570
the same row works no matter what the nuclear charges and no matter what the ATO

475
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.770
what n is.
So you get the same.

476
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.700
So it makes the table very compact,
right?

477
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:35.840
Because he use the same thing no matter what Adam you're dealing with.
Right.

478
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:36.231
If you,

479
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:41.231
if you work in units of row rather than our that is scale are to take into

480
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.580
account the fact that you can have various nuclear charges.
Okay.

481
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:51.290
Allows using the same e to the minus row over to for any nuclear charge,Z and

482
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:56.240
any end.
And notice every one of these has either the minus row over to on it.

483
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.530
Now why does that make sense?

484
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.240
Why is it no surprise that these things have eaten the minus our,

485
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.210
have we ever seen that before?

486
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.810
Even the minus X is a as a wave function.

487
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.940
What kind of wave functions?
What wonder what does that mean?

488
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:18.530
When you have e to the minus R,

489
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.680
that's a constant negative potential.

490
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.920
Kinetic energy,
constant negative,
kinetic energy,

491
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.970
which is going to be the situation for any nucleus and an electron.

492
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.350
Once the electron gets pretty far away,
the energy stops changing,

493
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.790
right?
So the potential energy is constant.
The kinetic energy is constant,
right?

494
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.570
If the electron is bound to the nucleus,

495
00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.930
that means it can't just fly off to infinity,
right?

496
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.620
So it's below the the ultimate potential energy.

497
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860
Then you have constant negative kinetic energy when you're far from the nucleus,

498
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.380
right?
So either the minus row,

499
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.860
so it doesn't surprise you that every one of these has either the minus row in

500
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:08.550
it.
Okay?
Now,

501
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:11.730
let's just look at this scaling quickly.
Okay,

502
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:16.440
so here's either the minus row and row as a function of row,

503
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.550
okay?
Now suppose so.

504
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.920
So we can rearrange this are is is that if we want to try,

505
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.510
if we want to make a new plot,

506
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.460
which has the horizontal axis being are being distance instead of row,

507
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.870
okay?
Now,
so our effort for a hydrogen atom,

508
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.590
the one s orbital of a hydrogen atom is 0.53 on.

509
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.390
So n is one a zero is half an on strum,

510
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:47.850
Z is one.
So it's 0.53 over two times row.

511
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.330
So we could just put a new scale on there.
So here's,

512
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.470
here's half an Oxfam for a hydrogen.
Here's one oxygen for a hydrogen.

513
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.150
Everybody with me on this?
So far,
how I did that,
right?

514
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.420
I just went through and found out for any given row here that I already had one,

515
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:09.950
two,
three,
four,
five,
either the minus row for any given row.
What would the RB,

516
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.340
if I were talking about a hydrogen atom and I just put a new scale on there.

517
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.430
Now,
if I were talking about a carbon atom,

518
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.460
which as a nuclear charge of plus six,

519
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.980
right then,

520
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.790
then this numberZ is going to be much bigger.

521
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:30.450
It's going to be six times as big.
What effect will that have on the scale?

522
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.730
So suppose where,
suppose we're at,
uh,
at uh,
five four row,

523
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.730
right?
Instead of dividing by one for z here,

524
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:49.140
I'm going to be divided by six,
so I'm going to get much shorter distances.

525
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.200
Real distances rather than our rather than row,
I mean,
right.

526
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.640
Does that surprise you that the function is going to squash in if I have a plus

527
00:37:59.641 --> 00:38:04.080
six nuclear charge,
is it surprise you or not?

528
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:09.000
It's what you expect.
A bigger charge is going to suck the electrons in more.

529
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.820
Okay.
So if I do it for carbon,
I get 0.53 over 12 instead of 0.5,

530
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:19.500
three over two and the scale is going to look like that instead of this being

531
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:22.830
0.5 here for hydrogen,
it's 0.1,
right?

532
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.250
So then if I squash it in so that they're on the same scale,

533
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.280
those are different Ostrom scales for carbon and hydrogen.

534
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.110
If I make them the same scale,
the bigger nuclear charge sucks.

535
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:38.380
The one s function by a factor of six and it looks like that.

536
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.920
But now of course,
if I want the real,
the normalized function,

537
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:46.030
it's got to be higher,
right?
So the,
the total area is the same.

538
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.970
I have the squared function here,
either the minus row,

539
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.230
I remember it was the way functional needs in my eyes.

540
00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:56.231
Roll rover to the density is e to the minus row to get the same thing.

541
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.530
I'm going to have to multiply that by six.
So it's going to look like that.

542
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:05.490
So that's how the radial distribution probability density distribution looks

543
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:07.450
different for a one electron.

544
00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:12.451
Adam with a plus with a plus one or a plus six nuclear charge carbon holds its

545
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:17.380
core electrons in much more tightly than hydrogen does.
No big surprise there.

546
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:23.890
Okay.
Uh,
so here's something to think about.
Uh,

547
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:24.730
what,
what would,

548
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.590
how would it differ if instead of talking about the one s orbital of carbon,

549
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.800
I was talking about the two s orbital of carbon.

550
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.020
Right now roe is going to be different and here instead of one is going to be

551
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:42.720
too.
So it's going to change the scale by a factor of two.
So that two,

552
00:39:42.721 --> 00:39:47.410
it two s are further out.
Okay.
So for Wednesday,

553
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.700
I want you to do these problems.
You can do them in groups if you want to,

554
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.850
uh,
some,
some about Claude knee figures and then some things about,
uh,

555
00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.200
energy and some atomic orbital problems.

556
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:05.260
Now we already looked at the,
at the one s let's,
let's look at some other,
uh,

557
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:10.090
atomic orbitals.
Incidentally,
this function,

558
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.420
the culotte big function is simpler in three dimensions than it is in one

559
00:40:15.551 --> 00:40:18.210
dimension.
It was that complicated thing in one dimension,

560
00:40:18.211 --> 00:40:23.050
you remember that had the cusp on it.
It was a really complicated function,

561
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:27.400
but it's really simple in three dimensions.
It's just exponential in our,
uh,

562
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.840
how does it vary with Theta as you come down from the access?

563
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.370
How does the wave function?
Very the one s what does it say?

564
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.840
How does it depend on theta?
Does it?
How does it depend on fee?

565
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.650
It doesn't.
So what shape does it have?
It sparingly symmetric.

566
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.700
It depends only on r and the s and the dependence on our is as easy as pie.

567
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:54.670
It's just either the minus R or road.

568
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:58.690
Depends on what units you measure are in.
Okay,
now let's look at two s.

569
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.680
Now tell me what to do.
How do I write a two s functions from this table?

570
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.670
First I have to choose the appetizer.
Where do I go?

571
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.750
Second one down is two s okay,

572
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.640
so I take this one and now two s that means l is zero,

573
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.220
right?
So where do I go?

574
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.810
What direction do I go here?
Right?

575
00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:26.950
And then what direction do I go straight across to as m is zero.

576
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.780
Okay,
so here's there's two s,
multiply those together.

577
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.100
Now what's interesting,

578
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.160
there are a bunch of constants that are going to get me it make it normalized.

579
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.690
So that's a constant,
that's a constant,
just like they were before.

580
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.880
This is a constant,
that's a constant.

581
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.020
But this part is interesting to minus row

582
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:57.350
times e to the minus row over two.
That's the function that we're interested in.

583
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:02.210
Two minus row times e to the minus row over to that has an interesting thing.

584
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.830
What happens when row has the value to
it has the,

585
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.210
even the minus row over two that's just decay.
All of them have that,

586
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.180
but how about the two minus row?
That gives an interesting thing.
What happened?

587
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:22.040
What is,
what's its value when row is to zero?
So there's a node.

588
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.530
What shape is the node?
Is it a point?
Is it alive?

589
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:32.720
Is it a wiggly thing?
It's a sphere.
It's fairly symmetric.
Again,

590
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:36.200
so there's a spherical node,
so inside at a node,

591
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.850
the wave function changes sign.
So inside it's one side outside,

592
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:43.220
it's the opposite side.
Okay.

593
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.980
Now how about a two PZ orbital.

594
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.580
So where are we going to go to p?

595
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:57.581
We'll start with this and for Pz we do this one and fuzzy.

596
00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:01.220
We do this one.
So it's this times,
this times this.

597
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:05.780
I think I have that circled here.
Let's see.
Yeah,
this is this one.
Interesting.

598
00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.640
Now is this one interesting?
What part of it's interesting.

599
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.050
Coast Theta is interesting,
right?
That's real variation.

600
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.060
And what part's interesting here?

601
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.450
It's row times e to the minus row over to,
okay,

602
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:28.250
so it's some constant times,
row times the cosine theta types,

603
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:31.340
e to the minus row over to you always have the minus rover to forget.

604
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:33.950
That just means that decays as you go out.

605
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.850
Now row times co-signed a theta.
What does that mean?

606
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.523
Row,

607
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.810
which is this distance times the coast sine of theta.
What is that

608
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.800
Russel?
It's z.

609
00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.280
So why can simplify this a lot?

610
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:55.970
If I mix my metaphors between polar and and uh,

611
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.680
and Cartesian coordinates,
it's z times either the minus row over two,

612
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.930
that's the two p orbital.

613
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.100
Now can you guess what the two Px in the two P y look like?

614
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.890
Can somebody guess the two p?
Why Josh

615
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:22.220
or replace what
replaced Z with x?

616
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:25.370
You get the two px orbital that replaces Z with why you get the two p.

617
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:29.000
Why orbital?
Pretty straightforward functions.

618
00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.700
Now how about you've seen pictures of P orbitals?
What?

619
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:38.850
It's interesting now that you know what the functions look like.

620
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.920
It's interesting to go back to the pictures you've seen and see what they mean.

621
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.850
How do they relate to the,
to the actual formula.

622
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.200
So you could plot the member.
It's,
it's,

623
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.060
it's three parts and our function of Theta function,
a family function.

624
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.140
We could look at each of those functions separately if we wanted to.
Okay.

625
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:01.140
We've been talking about the r function,
how it would behave,

626
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.770
but how would the theta function behave in this co-signed data?

627
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.920
So we'll do a polar plot that shows the value of cosine theta as a function of

628
00:45:10.281 --> 00:45:13.650
Feta.
Everybody with me?
Okay,

629
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:16.530
so what is it when Theta is zero,

630
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.600
what's Co sine of Theta One?
Okay,
so there it is and we'll put a point there.

631
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.490
Okay,
now let's go to the plus and minus 30 degrees.

632
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.780
Co-Sign is 0.86 and we'll put points there.

633
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.070
And let's go to 45 degrees.
It's the square root of 2.7 squared.

634
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.150
Square root of a half 0.71 put points there.
Uh,

635
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.890
at 60 degrees,
it's a half put points there.
What is it?

636
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:48.690
If it's zero,
if it's a 90 degrees,
pardon me,
it was 90 degrees.

637
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.900
Coastline is zero.
So we got a point at the origin,
right?

638
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:56.400
So you can see what the shape is,
what if you go the other direction,

639
00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.270
what if you go beyond 90 degrees?
What does happens to co sign

640
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.820
changes side?
So you've got another circle that's negative on the other side.

641
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.380
So there's a p orbital,
but I'm not showing the whole p orbital,
right?

642
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.640
I'm just showing the and how the angular part varies.

643
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.020
So you've seen pictures like that of p orbitals,
which is the theta function.

644
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.350
Or I could square it in order to look at probability density as a function of

645
00:46:24.871 --> 00:46:27.750
theta,
right?
And it would look like that.

646
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.300
So you've seen pictures more or less like that?

647
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.540
Or I could make a picture like that,

648
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.120
which is uh,

649
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:41.660
a contour plot showing how big it is on a slice through the nucleus,

650
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.930
right?
So it's road times,
either the minus row over two times,
cosine theta.

651
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.980
That multiplied by a constant is the wave function.
Okay?

652
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:53.580
So you can see it's positive up the top negative at the bottom.

653
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.280
And let's look at,
look at it a little bit.

654
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:01.050
So and notice it doesn't depend on fee,
the angle of rotation around here.

655
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.710
So we can take that picture and rotate it to give a three dimensional dumbbell.

656
00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.203
Okay,

657
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:11.700
we're just looking at one slice here in order to be explicit,
okay?

658
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:11.971
Now,

659
00:47:11.971 --> 00:47:16.110
so there's a certain point there that has a certain row and a certain theta and

660
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:17.610
therefore it has a certain value.

661
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.070
Now let's find the maximum from that of that function.

662
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.640
Okay,
so first it depends on cosigned theta,

663
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.240
what we'll say to be in order for this to be maximum
zero.

664
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.990
So it has to be along the axis.
Okay?
Now,

665
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:37.450
so theta has to be equal to zero.
Okay?

666
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.260
Now how do we find where it's going to be maximum?
With respect to row,

667
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.470
we take the derivative with respect to row,
set it equal to zero.

668
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.190
So that's this or simplified that or simplified that roe equals two.

669
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.530
So there's the maximum and we could find what the problem,

670
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.190
if we put the constants in,

671
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.860
we could find the true probability density anywhere,
right?
Just plug in theta,

672
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:06.940
plug in row and square it,
multiply it by the constant.

673
00:48:06.941 --> 00:48:11.941
That's the electron density at any given at the point you're talking about now.

674
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.290
Or You could have a computer do it for you.

675
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.240
And that's where we're indebted to Dean Dowager,
who's a physicist.

676
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.260
You went to Occidental College and actually wrote this program.
Volley was there,

677
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:28.060
but then he got a phd at Ucla in physics and he wrote this for physicists,

678
00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:31.900
but we'll use it.
Okay,
here's a picture of Dean Dowager.

679
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:36.901
He also juggles and here's a picture of him at an apple developer conference and

680
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:41.200
he's juggling the guy on the left there.
He also drops one of the pins.

681
00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:45.880
He's not perfect.
Okay.
So this is his program.

682
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.260
He's at the apple developer conference.
It's all works only on an apple.

683
00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.680
So if you don't have an apple borrow somebodies apple to look at the program

684
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:58.390
because it's really fun.
This is the screen of the program.
And,
uh,

685
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.740
I don't have time to take you through it now,
but you should try it.

686
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.370
So look at the PowerPoint at this and the next few slides,

687
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:10.300
the learn what all the different information is that's being given here and the

688
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:15.040
kinds of questions you can ask.
There's a one s orbital,
right?

689
00:49:15.041 --> 00:49:17.830
And it's as if the thing were really the electron.

690
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:22.060
We're really colored and it's a picture of how it would actually look if you

691
00:49:22.061 --> 00:49:23.740
could see electron density,

692
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:29.170
but all of course he's done is use fancy computer graphics to plot the square of

693
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:32.860
the wave function.
Right.
And it's a really nice program.

694
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.660
We'll talk about this a little more next time.
