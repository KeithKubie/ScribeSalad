00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.330
How does soap work?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.789
For well over a century, public health officials
have been pushing regular hand washing with

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.759
soap as one of the most effective methods
of inhibiting the spread of disease and infection.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.750
The result of physical, as opposed to biological
processes, proper hand washing with regular

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.150
soap will thoroughly remove bacteria.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.290
Yes, contrary to popular belief, soap just
helps remove microbes, it doesn’t kill them.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.840
Throughout the day, your hands pick up bacteria
and viruses from a (surprisingly) wide variety

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840
of objects.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.990
Keyboards, especially at public stations,
are widely acknowledged to be filthier than

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.150
toilets square inch for square inch, as are
most smartphones and tablets.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.930
That’s not to mention door handles, cash
and credit cards, or the common practice of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.220
shaking hands when greeting someone you don’t
see often or have never previously met.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.510
Even the paper towels in public restrooms
that you dry your hands with after washing

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.120
are commonly riddled with microbes spread
about from people flushing and the like.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.810
Yes, microbes are quite literally everywhere,
though thankfully most are harmless to humans,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.310
and some are even essential for our lives,
as well as certain types of tasty foods (see:

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.310
Humans and Our Love of Spoiled Foods).

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.790
Whatever the source, once picked up, both
harmless and harmful microbes stick to the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.810
oil your hands naturally produce, and, absent
removal, willingly hitch a ride until they

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.000
reach their ultimate destination (inside of
you or somebody else) where they can in some

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
cases wreak havoc.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.800
So how does the soap actually work to remove
the offending microbes if it doesn’t kill

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
them?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.960
When you wash your hands with regular (as
opposed to antibacterial) soap and water,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.440
the soap chemically works to break down the
oil, while the friction from rubbing does

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
it mechanically.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.690
Thus, the more soap and the longer the hands
are rubbed together, once rinsed away with

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.260
water, the less oil and microbes left on your
hands.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.420
Public health officials generally agree that
this method of hand washing, for at least

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.850
20 or more seconds at a time, is a highly
effective way of removing bacteria despite

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.450
the fact that the bacteria doesn’t die,
but is simply flushed away when you rinse

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.349
(or wiped off on a towel).

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.680
Those who prefer to kill the germs may turn
to antibacterial soap; however, it is only

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.189
marginally more effective than regular soap
(since the antibiotics in the soap only work

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.870
on a limited range of germs), and public health
experts, including the FDA, recommend against

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.239
antibacterial soap due to the likelihood that
its widespread use is contributing to the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.579
increase in antimicrobial resistance.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.430
Of course, even regular soap will be ineffective
if it’s contaminated, which is what often

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.010
happens with refillable dispensers; in a recent
study conducted in an elementary school, it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.800
was discovered that more bacteria was found
on the hands of staff and students after they

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:09.039
washed with soap from contaminated dispensers
than before they ever touched them.
