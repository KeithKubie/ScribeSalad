00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:12.386
4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians
made a surprising discovery.

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:15.727
If they scraped the bark 
off a particular kind of tree

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:16.887
and ate it,

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:19.186
their pain disappeared.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.187
Little did they know that why they'd found

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.626
was destined to influence 
the future course of medicine.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.827
What the Sumerians had discovered was
a precursor to the medicine known today

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:32.028
as aspirin.

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:35.647
Aspirin's active ingredient is found
commonly in willow trees

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:37.827
and other wild plants,

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:40.527
which is how it came to infuse
the medical traditions

00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:41.576
of Sumer,

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:42.638
ancient Egypt,

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:43.766
ancient Greece,

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.677
and other cultures.

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:52.129
Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought 
of as the father of modern medicine,

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.198
first recommended chewing willow bark
for pain relief

00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:00.828
and making willow leaf tea
to ease the pain of childbirth.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:07.698
But it took over 2,000 years for us to
comprehensively investigate its potential.

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:09.589
In the mid-18th century,

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:14.209
an Englishman named Edward Stone
ran five years of experiments,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:17.868
showing that willow bark crushed
into a powder and eaten

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:20.328
could cure a fever.

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:25.667
It took nearly another 70 years
for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:31.628
to finally identify and purify
the substance that made all this possible,

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:35.658
a compound called salicin.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.674
By then, doctors were routinely
using willow bark

00:01:38.674 --> 00:01:42.879
and other salicin-rich plants,
like the herb meadowsweet,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:46.719
to ease pain, fever, and inflammation.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.671
But identifying the exact compound
suddenly opened up the possibility

00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:53.930
of manipulating its form.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.811
In 1853, a French chemist managed
to chemically synthesize the compound,

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:03.200
creating a substance called
acetylsalicylic acid.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.669
Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company
Bayer found a new method

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.841
and began marketing the compound
as a pain reliever called aspirin.

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:19.121
This was widely recognized as one of
the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs.

00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:22.356
Originally, aspirin was 
just Bayer's brand name:

00:02:22.356 --> 00:02:23.612
A for acetyl,

00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:25.873
and spir for meadowsweet,

00:02:25.873 --> 00:02:30.261
whose botanical name is
Spiraea ulmaria.

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:35.811
Soon, aspirin became synonymous with
acetylsalicylic acid.

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.082
As its influence grew, aspirin was found
to ease not just pain,

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:43.162
but also many 
inflammation-related problems,

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.732
like rheumatoid arthritis,

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:49.053
pericarditis, which enflames 
the fluid-filled sack around the heart,

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:51.213
and Kawasaki disease,

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:54.913
where blood vessels become inflamed.

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:58.173
Yet, despite aspirin's medical value,

00:02:58.173 --> 00:03:03.913
at this point, scientists still didn't
actually know how it worked.

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:09.713
In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish 
and British scientists changed that.

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:13.393
They showed that the drug interrupts
the production of certain chemicals

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.384
called prostaglandins,

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:20.333
which control the transmission 
of pain sensations and inflammation.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:26.883
In 1982, that discovery won 
the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine.

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:31.334
Over time, research has also uncovered
aspirin's risks.

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:35.675
Overconsumption can cause bleeding
in the intestines and the brain.

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.366
It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome,

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:42.295
a rare but often fatal illness
that affects the brain and liver

00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:45.475
in children with an infection.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.204
And in the late 20th century,

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:51.165
aspirin's success had been overshadowed
by newer pain killers

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:53.144
with fewer side effects,

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:56.512
like acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

00:03:56.512 --> 00:04:00.335
But in the 1980s, further discoveries
about aspirin's benefits

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:02.857
revived interest in it.

00:04:02.857 --> 00:04:06.827
In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners 
also demonstrated

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:10.306
that aspirin slows production 
of thromboxanes,

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:13.806
chemicals that cause clumping
of platelets,

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:16.426
which in turn form blood clots.

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:22.966
A landmark clinical trial showed that
aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44%

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:25.816
in participants who took the drug.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:29.607
Today, we prescribe it to people
at risk of heart attack or stroke

00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:33.407
because it cuts the likelihood of clots
forming in the arteries

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:36.658
that supply the heart and brain.

00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:38.326
Even more intriguingly,

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:40.616
there's a growing body of research
that suggests

00:04:40.616 --> 00:04:45.607
aspirin reduces the risk of getting
and dying from cancer,

00:04:45.607 --> 00:04:48.266
especially colorectal cancer.

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:52.787
This might be due to aspirin's 
anti-platelet effects.

00:04:52.787 --> 00:04:58.488
By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may
decrease the levels of a certain protein

00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:00.943
that helps cancer cells spread.

00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:04.869
These discoveries have transformed aspirin
from a mere pain reliever

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:08.138
to a potentially life-saving treatment.

00:05:08.138 --> 00:05:12.247
Today, we consume about 100 billion
aspirin tablets each year,

00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:17.218
and researchers continue searching
for new applications.

00:05:17.218 --> 00:05:21.529
Already, aspirin's versatility 
has transformed modern medicine,

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.589
which is astounding considering
its humble beginnings

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.418
in a scraping of willow bark.
