00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:02.875
- [Mark] That has to be one of
the coolest bowls of noodles

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:06.217
that I've ever seen being made, ever.

00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:08.800
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.746
This entire bowl, is all just one noodle.

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:22.617
That is one single noodle.

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:25.200
(upbeat music)

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:29.094
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day,

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:30.237
it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.938
We just arrived to Weishan,

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:36.002
which is in Dali in
Yunnan Province, China.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.011
And today is gonna be
another incredible day,

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:42.962
but a very diverse day of food in Yunnan.

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:44.188
We're starting here in the village,

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.956
we're gonna enjoy a few bowls of noodles.

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:50.047
And then after that we'll
be visiting an authentic

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:52.735
very well preserved Muslim village.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.382
But first, oh I think we've just arrived.

00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:57.136
This is the spot for breakfast.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:59.128
Breakfast bowl of noodles number one.

00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:00.148
Hello!

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:01.981
We're gonna try to get
a look into the kitchen,

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:05.898
where they are assembling
the bowls of noodles.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.987
And as soon as you step in here,

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:28.868
this is, this is a meat sauna.

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:31.973
You can smell the, these are pork noodles.

00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:34.623
And you can smell the
porky aromas back here.

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:37.432
This is a special type
of rice noodle that is

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.366
common in this part of Yunnan.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.261
But it's rare to find elsewhere,

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:45.338
and it's a rice noodle
that they make with,

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:49.301
it's not with raw rice
powder, but it's made with

00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:52.600
pre-cooked, rice that's
cooked, and then ground,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.850
and then made into noodles.

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:01.195
It comes with two components,

00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:04.938
one is the bowl of noodles, with soup.

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:07.136
And the other is the bowl of pork

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:08.643
with all the seasonings, spices.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:09.705
So what you do is you
take some of the noodles

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:11.376
and you dip them into the soup

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:13.252
with the pork and all the spices

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:14.085
before you eat it.

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:16.637
And then it comes with some
pickles, there's some peanuts,

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:19.647
there's some just
wonderful looking things.

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:21.441
The soup is a pork bone soup,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.193
you can see how it's
almost milky in color,

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:24.780
how it's been boiled for so long.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.280
I just have to taste the plain soup first.

00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:30.130
Mmm, mmm.

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:34.026
Really, really rich.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.941
A little bit, not too oily.

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:37.489
And it's not salty yet.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.725
And then this is the soup
that's full of flavor.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.639
You can see the pork, there's skin,

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.185
oh, look at that.

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:46.703
Oh, it's like pulled pork and
then just a chunk of skin,

00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:48.249
and then she added in a few scoops,

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:49.685
she asked me if I wanted it spicy,

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.820
which, of course I had to say yes.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.428
So look at that soup, it's just,

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:57.346
oh there's chili oil in there, it's,

00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:58.409
okay, lemme just taste this.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.576
There's sesame seeds in there as well.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.933
Oh, oh that is superb.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.802
It's not sweet at all, it's just

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:11.607
you can really taste the
sesame seeds in there.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:13.443
That has a nice chili burn to it,

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.397
and then it's porky.

00:03:15.397 --> 00:03:17.064
Okay, into the soup.

00:03:18.783 --> 00:03:21.034
I mix it in with some of that pork.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.117
Oh that looks incredible.

00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:29.555
Oh, that is sensational.

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:31.111
It's really nice and spicy.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:35.278
The sesame seed oil flavor
in there really stands out.

00:03:36.522 --> 00:03:38.234
And then the pork is just,

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.348
just fall apart like shredded tender.

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:42.383
The noodles are very nice and soft.

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:43.564
They're not like mushy,

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:48.047
and they're just a tiny
bit gummy in texture.

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:50.700
The noodles and the soup broth,
are very plain on their own,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.430
but all the flavor is coming in that pork,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.999
and that seasoning, and
all those spices in there.

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.749
And that is extraordinary flavor.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:04.273
Okay, now I'm gonna try to
fish out that piece of skin.

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:06.157
Oh, mmm.

00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:10.704
Oh that just,

00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:13.266
that literally just
disintegrates in your mouth.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.773
Oh you don't need to chew that.

00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:17.215
It's just completely soft.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:20.263
And it tastes like it's been
boiled and rendered down

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:24.096
so it's mostly skin and
like collagen I think.

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:29.832
Mmm. That one has a little
bit of a sweet taste.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:30.832
And peanuts.

00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:38.301
But this broth, is next level.

00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:40.884
(upbeat music)

00:04:43.223 --> 00:04:46.156
Oh, what a way to start this morning.

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:47.785
And it's even better because

00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:50.146
it's kind of cold and rainy outside.

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:52.269
That is, that hits the spot.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:55.283
Most of the buildings in
this ancient town of Weishan

00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:57.322
date back to the 1400's.

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:59.926
And this was one of the strongholds

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:02.451
of the kingdom in Yunnan.

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:05.338
And it's so well preserved,
it's so beautiful.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.902
I love how it's quiet,
and it's so charming.

00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:09.408
So we're just gonna walk
around for a little bit,

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:12.265
and then after that we're gonna
eat another bowl of noodles.

00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:14.848
(upbeat music)

00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:30.070
Okay, we're just stopping
at a street food stall here.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.933
- Yeah, this is like Dali's specialty,

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:36.445
so this is basically the
rice cake's same texture

00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:39.435
with the rice noodle we just had.

00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:42.203
- [Mark] It's like a sheet
of the noodles that we just,

00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:43.842
okay hold on for this.

00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:46.675
(engine starting)

00:05:49.507 --> 00:05:50.728
What's the name of it again?

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:54.395
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:58.104 --> 00:05:59.202
- And then the noodle is

00:05:59.202 --> 00:06:00.360
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.193
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:02.026
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:02.859
- Means strips

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:03.692
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:04.646
- Means something bigger.

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:06.063
- [Mark] Alright.

00:06:15.228 --> 00:06:18.895
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:27.479
- [Mark] Oh she puts that inside of it?

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:28.660
- [Female] Yeah, yeah.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.493
- [Mark] Oh wow.

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:31.743
- [Female] Something extra.

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.278
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:34.278 --> 00:06:35.195
[Mark] Yep.

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.099
Oh yeah but we'll try it here.

00:06:41.162 --> 00:06:42.713
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:42.713 --> 00:06:44.593
- [Mark] Kind of like burrito style.

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:47.676
Yeah this looks and smells fantastic.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.287
Mmm.

00:06:55.287 --> 00:06:56.836
(laughs)

00:06:56.836 --> 00:06:58.992
Oh, oh that is very very tasty.

00:06:58.992 --> 00:07:02.291
Kind of dense, because
you've got that rice,

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.245
that rice tortilla.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:08.233
And then you've got the crispy
fluffy donut on the inside,

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:09.847
but you've got all that flavoring.

00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:12.748
The chili sauce, the pickles
go in there very nicely.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:13.748
The peanuts.

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:17.430
Okay.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.009
And this is a snack we can eat
while walking around I think.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.676
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.749
- That was great walking
around the old town

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.541
and we are walking down an alley now

00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:34.458
to go eat our next bowl of noodles.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.166
Oh so this is the one noodle here.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.963
(upbeat music)

00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:03.469
Wow, that's amazing.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.627
And we're here to eat
what is called One Noodle,

00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:21.127
because it really is one strand of noodle.

00:08:25.157 --> 00:08:28.824
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:36.599
- [Female] This is things you
put on top of the noodle soup

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.067
in the end.

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:40.650
(upbeat music)

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:46.333
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:51.960
(laughs)

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.281
- [Female] Yeah, you forget every time.

00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:55.868
(laughs)

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.396
- [Mark] That has to be one of
the coolest bowls of noodles

00:08:58.396 --> 00:09:01.408
that I have ever seen being made, ever.

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:04.176
It's just, it's just a
beautiful work of art

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:05.890
how she prepares that bowl of noodles.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.396
And it really, in your bowl,
you have one single noodle.

00:09:09.396 --> 00:09:10.943
And from what Lucy was telling me about

00:09:10.943 --> 00:09:13.467
this particular restaurant,
this is the original place

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:15.419
to eat this One Noodle.

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.172
And they won the World Record,

00:09:17.172 --> 00:09:21.941
the China record for the
longest noodle in all of China.

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.205
I think they had a noodle competition,

00:09:23.205 --> 00:09:24.303
oh yeah you can see on the walls,

00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:27.120
some of the photos that
they have on display.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.316
They made a noodle that was a
couple kilometers in length.

00:09:31.316 --> 00:09:34.984
So they can make, you get one noodle here,

00:09:34.984 --> 00:09:36.656
that's all you eat is one noodle.

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:38.287
In order to eat this bowl
of noodles you have to

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.158
eat it all in one bite.

00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:41.298
No, I'm just joking.

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:42.194
(laughs)

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:44.148
You can break the noodle,

00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:46.262
it's acceptable to break the noodle.

00:09:46.262 --> 00:09:48.306
But look at that, it's just coiled around

00:09:48.306 --> 00:09:52.620
a million times, that's
all just a single blob.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.044
This entire bowl, is all just one noodle.

00:09:56.044 --> 00:09:58.083
That is one single noodle.

00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:02.250
I guess I definitely have
to try the one noodle first.

00:10:04.863 --> 00:10:06.983
(chuckling)

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:07.816
Mmm. Oh.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:15.821
Not only is it one noodle, but
that one noodle is amazing.

00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:19.285
It's gummy, it's not overcooked,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.206
it's a little bit al dente.

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:24.094
It is like a perfect thickness.

00:10:24.094 --> 00:10:26.087
Mmm, and that's like chili oil soup,

00:10:26.087 --> 00:10:27.918
you can taste the
schezwan pepper in there.

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:31.262
And then this is some
kind of garlic and water.

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:33.189
Oh, excellent.

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:36.772
Okay, I think that's
good for my seasoning.

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.212
I forgot a little bit of vinegar in there.

00:10:43.212 --> 00:10:45.545
That's a really good noodle.

00:10:48.016 --> 00:10:49.280
Now lemme taste some of that broth.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.400
On the top is kind of some chili oil.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.252
But the it is a, kind of a meaty,

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.085
kind of a thick broth.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:58.057
Mmm, mmm.

00:10:59.832 --> 00:11:01.742
Oh with that garlic in there,

00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:03.045
I love that garlic in there.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:04.187
That fresh garlic.

00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:08.140
Oh that adds such a little
thing that adds so much.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.383
The most impressive thing
about that bowl of noodle

00:11:10.383 --> 00:11:13.311
was watching her make
it and bowl the noodle.

00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:15.305
That was, that was a sight to see.

00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:17.996
We're just exiting out the old gate.

00:11:17.996 --> 00:11:21.344
That was, it's a really nice
place that you can visit.

00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:24.761
And I'm pretty full of noodles right now.

00:11:25.872 --> 00:11:29.010
From here we are driving
to a well-preserved

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.371
traditional Muslim village.

00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:33.326
And they are known for their food as well,

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:36.668
so we're gonna discover and
eat some more delicious food

00:11:36.668 --> 00:11:38.501
and just walk around that village next.

00:11:38.501 --> 00:11:41.084
(upbeat music)

00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:01.770
We have just arrived to Donglianhua,

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.418
and in Chinese that translates to:

00:12:04.418 --> 00:12:07.310
the Eastern lotus pond village.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.766
And so you come into this
village, its absolutely beautiful.

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:13.582
At the entrance, there is a lotus pond.

00:12:13.582 --> 00:12:16.229
And then it's surrounded by rice fields.

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:19.573
It's an ancient Muslim village.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.610
And from what Lucy was telling me,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.447
it's not a touristy village at all,

00:12:23.447 --> 00:12:25.241
so there's not like souvenir shops.

00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:27.686
It's not like an attraction village.

00:12:27.686 --> 00:12:30.302
But it's one of the most well-preserved

00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:33.601
Muslim villages in this entire area.

00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:36.329
And so we're gonna have a chance to eat,

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:37.388
and then we're gonna have a chance

00:12:37.388 --> 00:12:38.858
just to walk around and see.

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:42.196
There's also some very
well-preserved mosques as well.

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:44.613
(horn honks)

00:12:45.576 --> 00:12:48.230
We are on our way to go
to one of the courtyards

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.289
where there is a lady
who, she has a courtyard,

00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:54.787
she has a house, she has
restaurant, she cooks.

00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:56.339
It's gonna be some delicious food.

00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:58.950
Look at this grand entrance, this gate.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.120
And the decoration, the painting.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120
And step inside of here.

00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:10.695
There's paintings, there's
artwork, it's so quiet,

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:14.805
it's so peaceful, and this is
where we're gonna eat lunch.

00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:16.680
Something that's very interesting to me,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.493
because my wife is Thai
and we're based in Bangkok,

00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:20.635
we're based in Thailand.

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:23.400
Is that the family who owns this property,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.090
and this courtyard, she
was just explaining to us

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.061
that their family had to flee to Thailand

00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:32.071
and so they lived in
Chiang Mai for many years.

00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:35.779
And so they have roots
both here in Yunnan,

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:38.696
and Chiang Mai as well in Thailand.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:44.765
(speaking foreign language)

00:13:44.765 --> 00:13:45.619
- [Mark] We're in the kitchen now,

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:47.739
and she's gonna be making a
couple of different dishes.

00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:49.986
The first thing that she's making is

00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:52.714
a Muslim Yunnanese style noodle.

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:55.355
And the important ingredients
that she mentioned

00:13:55.355 --> 00:13:59.626
are especially the green
pumpkin, as well as potato.

00:13:59.626 --> 00:14:03.945
And now she just finished
chopping up some cured goose,

00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:06.564
which she got out of the freezer,

00:14:06.564 --> 00:14:08.358
and that's gonna also flavor the noodles.

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:11.204
And she's gonna, we'll
see what else she makes.

00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:13.478
(meat sizzling)

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.529
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:18.157
- [Female] That's the ginger.

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:19.013
- [Mark] The beef, beef and ginger?

00:14:19.013 --> 00:14:20.075
- [Female] Yeah.

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:22.742
(meat sizzling)

00:14:23.782 --> 00:14:25.048
- [Mark] This one is
still for the noodles?

00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:26.557
- [Female] Yeah, yeah.

00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:27.426
(meat sizzling)

00:14:27.426 --> 00:14:28.322
- [Mark] She added quite a generous

00:14:28.322 --> 00:14:29.591
amount of oil to the wok,

00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:31.179
and then she added in some of the beef

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:32.641
which is already cut into little pieces.

00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:34.797
And then she added in a bunch of onions,

00:14:34.797 --> 00:14:36.346
and then in goes the tomatoes.

00:14:36.346 --> 00:14:40.513
But wow, that aroma is
already smelling incredible.

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:46.815
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:53.411 --> 00:14:55.134
- [Mark] All the
ingredients that she cooked

00:14:55.134 --> 00:14:57.008
are for the soup of the noodles,

00:14:57.008 --> 00:14:59.821
but now she's actually making
the noodles from scratch

00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:02.676
with flour and mixing in some water,

00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:06.593
and just slightly kneading
it and massaging it.

00:15:08.012 --> 00:15:10.741
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:10.741 --> 00:15:11.680
- [Mark] It's a lot of effort,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.732
and it's a lot of work,
but I can guarantee you

00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:18.815
that the result is gonna
be more than impressive.

00:15:21.363 --> 00:15:25.030
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:27.388 --> 00:15:28.651
- [Mark] The dough is resting and rising.

00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:32.818
She's gonna get started on a
beef salad that she's making.

00:15:33.864 --> 00:15:37.531
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:43.073
- [Mark] She has already
precooked the beef,

00:15:43.073 --> 00:15:46.332
because the beef takes, it
actually takes days to prepare.

00:15:46.332 --> 00:15:48.041
But she's showed us some of the raw beef.

00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:50.036
She massages it in salt,

00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:52.765
and then let's that rest for two days.

00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:56.015
And then the beef is braised in a broth

00:15:57.777 --> 00:16:00.179
and liquid that contains
many different spices.

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:02.214
There's black cardamom, and
there's schezwan peppers,

00:16:02.214 --> 00:16:05.105
there's dry chili, there's caramel,

00:16:05.105 --> 00:16:07.962
which is what makes the broth really dark.

00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:12.045
And then that's braised
for a few hours at least.

00:16:23.408 --> 00:16:25.572
I actually had no clue
as to how she was gonna

00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:29.277
assemble a salad, but
she is just spiraling it.

00:16:29.277 --> 00:16:31.440
Like spokes on a wheel.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.404
Oh, that's gorgeous.

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:37.071
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:11.882
- [Mark] She's just hand ripping them

00:17:11.882 --> 00:17:14.159
into the boiling water.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.242
Oh I love this style of noodle.

00:17:16.242 --> 00:17:19.824
And just like, rough homestyle noodles.

00:17:19.824 --> 00:17:22.407
(upbeat music)

00:17:30.422 --> 00:17:32.089
The noodles back in.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.472
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:37.472 --> 00:17:40.055
(upbeat music)

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.229
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:46.229 --> 00:17:47.697
- It keeps getting more and more complex,

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:48.795
she keeps adding things.

00:17:48.795 --> 00:17:51.159
She had a separate pan of the soup broth,

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:54.261
which is beef bones broth she then boiled.

00:17:54.261 --> 00:17:56.582
And then she drained the
water out of the noodles

00:17:56.582 --> 00:17:58.656
and put the noodles back
into the beef broth.

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:01.995
Then she added the goose, cured goose fat.

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:05.251
And goose, then she, oh
and she's dishing it out.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.046
Then she added the pumpkin mixture,

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:09.612
she added the onions beef mixture,

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:10.797
and it is ready.

00:18:10.797 --> 00:18:12.714
Wow, that looks hearty.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.902
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:18.902 --> 00:18:21.485
(upbeat music)

00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:26.882
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:31.566 --> 00:18:34.378
- I'm walking out of
the kitchen just amazed,

00:18:34.378 --> 00:18:36.128
just flabbergasted.

00:18:36.128 --> 00:18:38.961
What a meal, she is a master chef.

00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:44.234
Okay, so we're in the courtyard,

00:18:44.234 --> 00:18:46.397
we're sitting down for lunch now.

00:18:46.397 --> 00:18:50.508
This is a picture perfect
setting, it's gorgeous.

00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:54.675
The courtyard, the scenery,
and her cooking on top of that.

00:18:56.374 --> 00:18:58.535
I am like overwhelmed right here.

00:18:58.535 --> 00:19:00.376
The food looks unbelievable.

00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:04.247
The beef salad is not
only one of the prettiest

00:19:04.247 --> 00:19:06.079
beef salads I've ever seen in my life,

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:08.039
it might be one of the prettiest dishes

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:09.550
I've ever seen in my life.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.686
On the bottom you will see
it's all shredded radish

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:14.682
as well as more of that same dressing.

00:19:14.682 --> 00:19:16.800
And it's just, it's just filled.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.185
So I think you can kind of get

00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:21.685
a little bit of everything with that beef.

00:19:25.635 --> 00:19:26.898
Oh, wow.

00:19:26.898 --> 00:19:28.565
That is sensational.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.583
Oh, that's stunning.

00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:32.416
Mmm.

00:19:33.335 --> 00:19:35.287
Oh that beef is so tender.

00:19:35.287 --> 00:19:37.490
And the flavor is just embedded

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.857
within the veins of that beef.

00:19:39.857 --> 00:19:43.034
And it's, oh that's extreme flavor.

00:19:43.034 --> 00:19:44.910
And then you've got that really crisp,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.132
really refreshing radish
shreds on the bottom there.

00:19:48.132 --> 00:19:50.858
You've got that dressing, you
can taste all that chili oil.

00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:52.526
You can really taste the sesame oil,

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:54.116
and the sesame seeds in there.

00:19:54.116 --> 00:19:55.420
And next up for the noodles,

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.284
which she made completely
from scratch, by hand.

00:19:59.284 --> 00:20:02.339
Sheets of noodles, there's onion in here.

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:06.506
Oh man, this looks, it
doesn't get fresher than this.

00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:11.162
Mmm.

00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:16.258
Oh, oh wow that's stunning.

00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:19.091
Those noodles are so silky smooth.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:23.966
They're not like delicate,
like thin noodles,

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:27.186
these are hearty, slightly thick,

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:29.424
a little bit gummy.

00:20:29.424 --> 00:20:33.591
But you can taste the difference
in how they're handmade.

00:20:38.635 --> 00:20:41.119
It's absolutely stunning.

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:42.202
Unbelievable.

00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:51.182
That is one of those dishes
that will change your life.

00:20:51.182 --> 00:20:54.569
The final dish we got here
is pumpkin, steamed pumpkin.

00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:56.733
And she made this with some ginger,

00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:59.900
and this just looks delicious as well.

00:21:01.294 --> 00:21:04.211
Oh, even the pumpkin's outstanding.

00:21:05.489 --> 00:21:08.218
It's like melt in your mouth.

00:21:08.218 --> 00:21:09.684
Oh, that texture.

00:21:09.684 --> 00:21:11.228
It's really really fragrant.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.949
It's a little bit sweet.

00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:17.116
It's, mmm, it's not starchy
at all, but more silky.

00:21:17.998 --> 00:21:21.665
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:23.213 --> 00:21:24.960
(laughs)

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.543
(upbeat music)

00:21:32.963 --> 00:21:33.939
- [Mark] This is one of those dishes

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:35.569
that I never want to end.

00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:38.503
I just want it to be an everlasting dish.

00:21:38.503 --> 00:21:40.501
It's absolutely insane.

00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:43.084
(upbeat music)

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.471
(sighs)

00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:53.010
- Every single bite of this
salad, has just blown me away.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.593
(upbeat music)

00:21:57.976 --> 00:21:59.767
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:00.600
- Okay.

00:22:06.938 --> 00:22:08.860
I had no idea what to expect

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.061
when we first entered this gate,

00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:13.715
but now I can safely
say that you will find

00:22:13.715 --> 00:22:18.151
one of the world's greatest
beef salads behind this door.

00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:20.839
And those are really recipes

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.650
and dishes that have been
preserved through her family

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.606
and they're really hard to find.

00:22:25.606 --> 00:22:27.116
She made it with love.

00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:28.577
That was an honor to have such

00:22:28.577 --> 00:22:31.627
a culinary experience like that.

00:22:31.627 --> 00:22:33.009
Chickens for sale.

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:35.951
(chickens clucking)

00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:37.472
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:37.472 --> 00:22:40.055
(upbeat music)

00:22:46.882 --> 00:22:49.243
- [Mark] We've just arrived
to the village mosque,

00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:53.858
and it's an extremely
well-preserved wooden mosque.

00:22:53.858 --> 00:22:55.853
Which dates back to the Ch'ing Dynasty,

00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:58.103
sometime around the 1700's.

00:22:59.434 --> 00:23:01.851
And up here there's a school.

00:23:03.704 --> 00:23:06.621
Wow, this is gorgeous architecture.

00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:11.348
A few flights of steps and
we made it to the very top.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:12.938
Wow, the views are spectacular.

00:23:12.938 --> 00:23:14.119
And you can see over the entire

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:17.255
courtyard of the mosque on this side,

00:23:17.255 --> 00:23:19.248
and then over here on this side,

00:23:19.248 --> 00:23:20.838
you've got a nice view of the valley,

00:23:20.838 --> 00:23:22.182
and the mountains in the background.

00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:24.954
And rice fields outside of the village.

00:23:24.954 --> 00:23:27.537
(upbeat music)

00:23:48.073 --> 00:23:51.740
(speaking foreign language)

00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.682
- We're in Dali new town here.

00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:01.799
And we're at a restaurant tonight,

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:05.462
to eat an ethnic Chinese type of food

00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:07.212
which is Jingpo food.

00:24:09.786 --> 00:24:13.453
(speaking foreign language)

00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:22.486
- [Mark] There's just a
rainbow full of ingredients

00:24:22.486 --> 00:24:25.541
that's so many ingredients
on the table, and seasonings.

00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:27.046
I saw some grasshoppers that we're gonna

00:24:27.046 --> 00:24:29.629
try as well for dinner tonight.

00:24:41.419 --> 00:24:43.267
All of the dishes are ready.

00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:46.609
We've got a little bit of a
feast here for dinner tonight.

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:48.034
There's so many dishes on the table,

00:24:48.034 --> 00:24:50.230
I think we have at least
10 different dishes.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.157
It's really interesting for
me in watching them cook.

00:24:53.157 --> 00:24:54.829
This food, the Jingpo food,

00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.602
it comes from the region
of China which is near

00:24:57.602 --> 00:24:59.443
to the border of Myanmar.

00:24:59.443 --> 00:25:02.664
And that's sort of the area where China,

00:25:02.664 --> 00:25:04.947
as well as Myanmar,
and Thailand, and Laos,

00:25:04.947 --> 00:25:08.570
that area where the
cultures all come together.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.813
And that's the, so the food you can see

00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:13.498
many similarities of ingredients.

00:25:13.498 --> 00:25:15.494
It's colorful, there's chilies,

00:25:15.494 --> 00:25:17.772
there's lots of fresh herbs.

00:25:17.772 --> 00:25:20.991
And just a colorful spectrum
of different dishes.

00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:23.315
Since the grasshoppers happen
to be right in front of me,

00:25:23.315 --> 00:25:24.940
I'm gonna begin with the grasshoppers.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.325
She deep fried them,

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.870
and then just seasoned them with

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.340
a little bit of powdery seasoning.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.295
So these should be crispy and beautiful.

00:25:32.295 --> 00:25:34.962
Oh, look at how golden they are.

00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:37.831
Oh yeah, those are good.

00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:42.382
They have a little bit
of a sausagey flavor,

00:25:42.382 --> 00:25:43.658
and nice and crispy.

00:25:43.658 --> 00:25:45.778
A wonderful snack.

00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:47.939
Next up I'm gonna try
some of the chicken salad.

00:25:47.939 --> 00:25:49.660
This is one of their signature dishes.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.493
It's shredded chicken,

00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:51.947
and then she mixed it with minced chili.

00:25:51.947 --> 00:25:53.458
There's some herbs in there,

00:25:53.458 --> 00:25:56.470
and there's some chilies on the side too.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.637
You can taste a little bit
of the chilies in there.

00:26:03.737 --> 00:26:07.904
Oh, oh, that chili's pretty
sweet, and a little bit spicy.

00:26:10.087 --> 00:26:12.083
Okay, over here is one of
their signature dishes,

00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:14.645
which is fried ribs, with lemongrass.

00:26:14.645 --> 00:26:16.478
And I love how rough cut it is,

00:26:16.478 --> 00:26:20.645
just like a stack of lemongrass
on the top of this dish.

00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:26.059
Mmm hmm.

00:26:28.043 --> 00:26:30.161
Oh those are awesomely good.

00:26:30.161 --> 00:26:32.970
The pork is nice and crispy
from being deep fried.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.576
This one is a minced pork salad,

00:26:35.576 --> 00:26:36.925
and again it's very finely chopped

00:26:36.925 --> 00:26:37.943
with lots of herbs in there.

00:26:37.943 --> 00:26:40.060
There are peanuts in here, and chilies.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.410
And this looks very very Thai or Burmese.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.840
- [Female] White celery.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.042
- [Mark] Oh, it's white
celery in there too.

00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:49.875
Mmm.

00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:54.281
Oh that one is, that one is awesome.

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:57.146
It's extremely refreshing.

00:26:57.146 --> 00:27:00.411
To me it almost tastes like Tabbouleh,

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:03.311
like parsley that's been
chopped up like that.

00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:05.998
This one is ferns and I think
she just blanched the ferns,

00:27:05.998 --> 00:27:07.262
and then it's served with this sauce.

00:27:07.262 --> 00:27:09.512
This sauce looks fantastic.

00:27:18.807 --> 00:27:21.088
Mmm. Oh that sauce is wonderful.

00:27:21.088 --> 00:27:24.916
And it's a yellow pea
paste kind of like block,

00:27:24.916 --> 00:27:28.094
and then she kind of mixed it
up with some spices as well.

00:27:28.094 --> 00:27:29.483
There's some chilies, and there's both

00:27:29.483 --> 00:27:32.900
fresh chilies and dried chilies in there.

00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:35.284
Mmm. Oh.

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:43.536
You know that's not the most
attractive looking dish,

00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:45.369
but it's really tasty.

00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:50.900
It has this incredible smokey flavor,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.817
and then it's a little bit starchy,

00:27:55.218 --> 00:27:58.476
a little bit goopy, but
the flavor's amazing.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:01.407
This one is an omelet that he made with

00:28:01.407 --> 00:28:03.159
climbing wattle shoots.

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:06.909
And this is very popular
in Thailand as well.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.511
Mmm. Okay, it's a little
bit of an oil sponge.

00:28:13.511 --> 00:28:14.896
But it is pretty tasty.

00:28:14.896 --> 00:28:16.648
The climbing wattle has a nice like

00:28:16.648 --> 00:28:18.199
kind of green taste to it.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:22.366
I think the last dish is the
banana blossom salad, or mix.

00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:32.822
Mmm. Oh that's really good,
it's really really juicy.

00:28:32.822 --> 00:28:34.367
(speaking foreign language)

00:28:34.367 --> 00:28:35.305
(laughs)

00:28:35.305 --> 00:28:36.933
- [Mark] It almost has
a cheesy taste to it.

00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:39.516
(upbeat music)

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.843
(laughs)

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:55.030
Okay, we just made it back to the hotel.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.070
Definitely the highlight
for me today though,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:01.470
was that Muslim Yunnanese
beef salad that aunty made.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:05.051
That was one of the dishes
that I'll never forget, ever.

00:29:05.051 --> 00:29:06.479
I wanna say a big thank you to Lucy,

00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:08.968
she was our guide today and
she brought us everywhere.

00:29:08.968 --> 00:29:11.692
And also to Frank from Zouba Tours

00:29:11.692 --> 00:29:14.830

he set everything up.
