00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.970
&gt;&gt; James Wintle: Okay, so
my name is James Wintle.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.940
I am a reference librarian here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.330
And what I, I had a bit of
a change of heart recently

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.900
about what exactly I was
going to do in this program.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.350
Initially, I was going to
give a moderately interesting,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.450
but possibly boring lecture
about persil [phonetic].

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.440 position:56%
And as I was researching the history
of early music at the Library

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.730
of Congress and the performances
of early music at the Library

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.090
of Congress, I came
across something of a gem.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
And that particular gem
happened on, yes you guessed it,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.430
November 29th and 30th in 1962.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.770 position:56%
And what happened on that particular
day, or evening as it were,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.200
is that the actor Basil Rathbone,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.650
yes the perplexed looks are
appropriate, came to the library,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.590
and with an Elizabethan broken
consort, gave a performance

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.200
in which he read Elizabethan
poetry and monologues

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.650 position:56%
from Shakespeare's plays,
interspersed with Elizabethan music.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.320
And it's quite stunning and quite
interesting, and not the sort

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.640
of thing that one hears
these days at all.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.620
So I decided to cast off
my delusions of grandeur

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.970 position:56%
about giving a personal lecture, and
let everyone hear this thing that is

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.820
so unique and so interesting
and something

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.010
that really just would
not happen were it not

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.860
for the Library of Congress.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.790
The concert series here is a bit of
a unique animal in and of itself,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.110
and every once in a while, we have
these performances that really,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.390
you just couldn't, you just
couldn't get anywhere else

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.020
because no other concert series
is also associated with the Center

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.020
for Poetry that can co-sponsor
such a thing and put it on.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.710
So I wanted to give
everyone a unique experience

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.160
that you really just couldn't get
everywhere else, or anywhere else.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.770
And encourage you to go read
more about persil [phonetic]

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.220
and you'll probably hear all
the boring stuff I was going

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.720
to say anyway.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.970
So, that being said, just a little
bit about the concert series,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.520
for those of you who don't know,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.940
we're celebrating the 90th
anniversary of concert series.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:04.550
It was founded in 1925 by
the, under the patronage

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.930
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge who
had had a chamber music festival

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.530
in the Berkshires, and wanted her
work as a chamber music patron

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.050
to live on after her death.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.780
And decided that in order to
do that, she needed to partner

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.010
with a cultural institution
that had the longevity

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.180
that a person obviously
doesn't have.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.480
So she picked the Library
of Congress, she was friends

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.280
with the person who was the
head of the music division

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.980
at that time, Carl Engel.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.280
And many of you have
heard this before,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.340
but I'll just give this little
overview for those you who haven't.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.290 position:56%
She was friends with Carl Engel and
her partnership with him enabled her

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.160
to work out the details, to donate
money to build the auditorium

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.410
in which you're going to hear
the concert this evening.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.580
And there was famously an act of
Congress that had to be passed

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.750
in order for that to happen
because it was unprecedented

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.000
that someone would donate a large
amount of money to the government

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.220
for a building project just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.470
because they felt it was
the right thing to do.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.640
That sort of thing just
didn't really happen,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.390
and still doesn't really happen.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.260
And so we have this beautiful
chamber music auditorium thanks

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.590
to the generosity of
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.780 position:56%
And she is someone that we like to
remember often in the music division

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.900
because she sponsored so
many wonderful commissions.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.240
Especially mid 20th century, she
was commissioning great works

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.920
from Aaron Copland, from Bela
Bartok, from Arnold Schoenberg,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.520
from basically any
composer that you can think

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.780
of that really made an impact.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.630
Prokofiev, you know, just everyone
was writing music to be performed

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.770
in this hall and we continue
that tradition today.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.060
This season I think there are six
new premiers, it's in the booklet.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.650
You can check my facts on that.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.270
But it's a wonderful series,
and giving a little history

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.290
of that series I thought
was important,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.410
particularly as it
regards early music.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.040
Because there have been
so many commissions

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.580
and so many important commissions
that have been premiered here,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.250
and new works that have
been premiered here.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.840
It is often forgotten that
even from the beginning,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.640
the beginning of this
concert series,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.250
early music was very
much a part of it.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.750
And there have been
concerts, a number of concerts

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.490
over the years by, for
insistence, the New York Pro Musica

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.710
with Noah Greenberg
has done medieval

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.450
and renaissance music
here a number of times.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.140
Alfred Deller famously gave a
recital here in the late fifties.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.500
And Mrs. Coolidge not only
commissioned new works,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.780
but also commissioned
modernizations of early music.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.560
And these are things that we,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.090
I mean I've never actually
heard them performed,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.310
but if they could be
performed sometime,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.250
they will be performed here,
not anyplace else, I'm sure.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.620
But there are, there are these
little corners of the collection

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.200
of manuscripts that she
donated to the library.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.350
Like for example, orchestrations of
the luli arias [assumed spelling],

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.300 position:56%
by the American composer Roy Harris.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.300
Who she commissioned to orchestrate
these luli arias [assumed spelling]

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.270
for a performance in
the Coolidge auditorium.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.490
And so the co-mingling of early
and modern music is something

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.670
that has a strong history here.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.250
And it's the early part of it
that we will enjoy this evening,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.590
first in this concert,
and then of course

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.720
with [inaudible] singing a
beautiful, beautiful program.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.960
So what we will deal with
today crosses over a bit

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.310
with the earliest part
of her program.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.580
And we're going to be listening to,
in particular, Elizabethan music.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.650
And many of you, I'm sure,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.610
know Elizabeth the first was
quite an active lover and patron

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.400
of music herself, and
was quite a good dancer.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.520
And the idea of, or the corpus
of dance music that came

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:38.190
out of her reign was quite
spectacular, as well as wonderful,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.440
you know, sacred music and
all the other things that we,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.610
that we hear from that time.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.930
One of the great composers
of the day, who we're going

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.190
to hear later this
evening, was John Dowland.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.090
And he is featured on the
program we're going here

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.190
in just a moment as well.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:02.220
He was not, he was a very, he
was a very well-known composer

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.950
particularly in England,
particularly in Europe,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:11.240
but never was able to get a
position at the Elizabethan court.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.930
So he was constantly
striving to gain the attention

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.340
of Elizabeth and of the court.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.330
And so when you hear pieces on
the program tonight like the Earl

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.830
of Essex Galliard, it's turned
into a song and different pieces

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.770
by Dowland that have a little
bit of a political bench to them.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.720
It's because he is trying
to gain that attention.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.630
And he worked actually in
Denmark for Christian the fourth,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.190
but published all of
his music in London.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.990
And that is the real telling
element of his career,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.510
that even though he was
working in Europe, he made the,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.790
he made the trip, he made
the effort to come to England

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.110
and publish his works there

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.770
so they would be disseminated
amongst the people

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.720
and become the popular music
of the day that it really was.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.910
And people talk about John
Dowland as being a kind

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.050
of folk musician of his day.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.140
And it really is true, even though
he was writing very sophisticated

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.330 position:56%
music, he was writing popular music.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.170
And that's something that
a lot of people, I think,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.270
have lost because we today, think
of concert music as one thing

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.050
and popular music as another.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.020
When in fact, that's only something
that has happened in the past,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:34.790 position:56%
you know, hundred years, hundred and
fifty years really, that the music

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.580
that important composers were
writing was not really thought

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.050
of as popular, but in
the Elizabethan era,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.740
it's very much that way.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.590
And so, if you look at your
program and you think, oh well,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.090
why is there, why are
there these pieces by Simon

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.880
and Garfunkel at the end, right?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.660
It is in fact because that
is the modern equivalent

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.350
of what John Downland was
doing in the Elizabethan era,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.740
much more so then songs
by, you know,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.430
John Adams, or something like that.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.620
It's, it really is that, that one,
that side of what Dowland was doing

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.500
that is important to represent
and important to remember.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.320
So that will happen
later, that being said.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.260
The pieces on this program
are for broken consort.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.090
And that is not a reference to the
fact that the lute was very easy

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.990
to break, when in fact it was.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.530
But, a broken consort is
a group of instruments

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.860
that are not all of the same kind.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.860
A consort of instruments,
in the Elizabethan parlance,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.130
is a group of different size
instruments of the same kind.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.060
For instance, a consort of
recorders, a consort of lutes.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.190
There were treble lutes, there
were bass lutes, and in between.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:11:00.120
But a broken consort which became
a standard instrumentation was a

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.120
little bit of a few things.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.110
It was a treble viol,
and a bass viol.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:10.960
A treble viol, bass viol,
lute, this is the dulcian

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.300
which could be doubled as a flute.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.620
This is actually a, no it's not
a dulcian, it's a bass recorder.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.180
So it could be either
one of those recorders.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.600
This is a bandora which
was also called pandora.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.190
If anybody listens to an app called
Pandora, you have your music on it,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.250
you can think of bass
string instruments

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.640
from the Elizabethan era the
next time you turn it on.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.670
But the pandora or bandora,
and this was basically a bass

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.160
lute-like instrument.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.680
The cittern, which looks
quite a lot like a mandolin,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.750
except it has this
curved head on it.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:52.840
And the cittern is interesting
because it had steel strings.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.790
And it was one of the few of these
older Elizabethan instruments

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.880
that did not have gut strings.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.000
So it had a really bright, sort
of a cutting tone in the ensemble.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.780
And then of course you
have the standard lute.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.090
So two viols, treble
and bass, flute,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.220
and then three plucked
instruments, the bandora,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.520
he cittern, and the lute.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.260
And this became a fairly
standard consort.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.570 position:56%
Within Elizabethan times, there were
of course many variations on that.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.350
Any number of instruments could
be a part of a broken consort,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.490
as long as they weren't
just all the same thing.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.630
There were often virginals or
other keyboard instruments,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.000
and you'll hear some virginal music
in the program that is put on,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.580
that we're going to listen to.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.230
But this particular core group
of instruments is what is thought

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.810
of as that particular consort.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.360
And this comes, it's
sort of solidified

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.420
in syntagma musicum of Praetorius.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.780
This is the standard for modern,
modern players who are looking back

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.040
and trying to figure out what, how
these instruments work together

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.190
and how music was performed.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.700
This particular treatise, which is

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.450
in three volumes, is
critical for that.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.930 position:56%
Another place in which the broken
consort appears, and you get a sense

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.750
of what exactly it was for, is in
an anonymous painting from 1596,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.580
called the birth and
death of Sir Henry Unton.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:27.860
And this is a strange
painting that is

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.590
in the portrait gallery in Britain.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.300
And after Henry Unton
died in the 1590s,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.890
his wife commissioned an unknown
artist to paint this piece

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:45.400
that depicted him, death, and an
angel on either side of his head

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.130
and he's writing because he
was a scholar and a statesman.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.110
And then within the painting are
ten different themes from his life,

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.510
important things that
happened to him.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.970
So it's kind of a biography
of this person.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:11.030
And one of these scenes, which is
here, depicts a group of musicians

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.450
at an Elizabethan banquet.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.270
And you see people eating
here, there's a room

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.390
with people playing cards
and they have [inaudible],

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.040
and they're sitting
around this table

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.750
with a little kid who's
doing something,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.780
I'm not sure why he's there.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.540
Then down here, you have another
group as similar to this group,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.580
but obviously they're people,
and they're in the main sort

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.320
of dinning hall where
this is happening.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.510
And there are these weird sort
of red-faced people walking next

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.890
to each other, and I'm not
sure what that's about.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.090
There's a whole procession of these
guys, some candles, these guys,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.050
some candles, and then some
more oddly-dressed folks

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.870
who I assume are a theater troop
because they're going up here

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:57.580 position:56%
by the table to, I assume, entertain
people, and be much smaller

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.160
in scale than the actual table.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.580
So, that's a [laughing]
just something that happens

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.900
in paintings at that time.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.850
But anyway, so you have this
particular view of a broken consort

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:17.170 position:56%
in action, and you have the flute,
the two viols, the cittern, Pandora,

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.930
and lute in a circle, there
and then again, up at the top.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:29.380
So there is that, and then there is
the first book of consort lessons

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:35.160
of Thomas Morley, which was
a very important publication

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:42.540
for consort songs, and
consort music in the time.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.780
And this publication, which says,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.660
if you probably can't read
it, if you're very far back.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.260
But it says the first book
of consort lessons made

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.360
by diverse exquisite authors for
six instruments to play together,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.560
the treble lute, the pandora,
the cittern, the bass voile,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.530
the flute, and the treble voile.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:00.860
And it goes on to say things

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.700
about how gentlemanly they'll
be when they play them.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:10.840
But this particular publication
is what inspired the consort group

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.300
to put on the concert
that we are going to hear.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:21.120
There was a copy of this
book from 1599 that had come

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.270
into the library's possession, and
they were inspired by that to put

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.620
on a concert of Elizabethan music.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.000
And as I said, Basil Rathbone who
did not play violin in the concert,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.970
but rather as Sherlock
Holmes, which is great.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.540
He was the person who they
picked to come and be the actor

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.710
in that particular, in that
particular presentation.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:54.940
And this is the program
of the concert,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.910
as you see it was the
Whittall Foundation

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.320
and the Whittall Poetry
Foundation and Literature Fund

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.120
which sponsored the concert.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:13.270
So what we're going to do, we're
going to listen to a bit of this,

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.990
in the twenty-fiveish sort
of minutes we have left.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:24.680
And we're going to
start with, let's see,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.540
if music and sweet poetry agree.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.720
So we're going to skip
a bit of the first part,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.600
and be about halfway
down on the second page.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.490
But I'm going to go to
the text, so you can hear.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:41.770
Yeah, so at the bottom
here is where we'll start.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.930
It says if music and sweet
poetry agree, as they must,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.090
needs the sister and the brother.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.310
Then must the love be
great towards thee and me.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.480
Because thou loves the
one, and I the other.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.570
Dowland, to thee is dear,

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.740
whose heavenly touch upon the
lute doth ravish human sense.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.410
And you'll hear what happens
when he mentions John Dowland.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.370 position:56%
Since I'm probably not giving too
much away, but slight spoiler alert,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.090
some music is played by the
many other people on stage.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.570 position:56%
So Mike, Mike if you could start the
festivities, I would appreciate it.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.870
Thanks.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:25.480
&gt;&gt; If music and sweet poetry
agree, as they must meet,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.670
the sister and the brother.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:33.620
Then must the love be
great, twixt thee and me.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:39.350
Because thou loves the
one and I the other .

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:45.950
Dowland [string instrument playing
in background] to thee is dear,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:58.190
whose heavenly touch, upon the
lute doth ravish human sense.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:06.130
Spenser to me, whose
deep conceit is such.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:13.850
As passing all conceit,
needs no defence.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:22.110
Thou lov'st to hear the sweet
melodious sound of Phoebus' lute,

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:29.470
the queen of music makes.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.690
And I in deep delight,
am tearfully drowned.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:39.420
When as himself to
singing he betakes.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.620
One god is god of both,
as poets feign.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:51.510
One knight loves both,
and both in thee remain.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:20:28.540
[ Music ]

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.220
If music and sweet poetry agree,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.270
as they must needs the
sister and the brother.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.650
Then must the love be
great, twixt thee and me.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:53.510
Because thou loves the
one, and I the other

[ Music ]

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:48.890
[ Applause ]

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.840
&gt;&gt; Music from the Elizabethan era.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.410
We heard soprano Helen Boatwright

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.020
in "Where Griping Griefs"
by Richard Edwards.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.610
And Basil Rathbone reading
Richard Barnfield's, "If Music

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.740
and Sweet Poetry Agree", to
the music of John Dowland.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.410
Concluding this group was an
instrumental mask by Thomas Morley,

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:14.160
from his "First Book of Consort
Lessons" published in 1699.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.600
Morley's book was the original
inspiration for this concert,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.670
which was devised and
directed by Sydney Beck.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.580
For many years, the music
editor and research librarian

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.080
at the New York Public Library.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.390
Mr. Beck made a critical edition
of Morley's anthology as part

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.480
of his research into
Elizabethan consort literature,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.140
and organized the consort
players to perform it.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.850
His interest in the
relationship of this concert music

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:43.020
to Elizabethan poetry and drama
was shared by Basil Rathbone,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.540
who collaborated with the consort
players for about two years.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.850
Basil Rathbone begins this next
group of selections with a poem

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:55.400
by Ben Johnson, "Have You
Seen but a White Lily Grow."

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.460
Immediately following, you'll
hear an anonymous musical setting

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.740
of the same text for tenor and
flute, sung by Robert White.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.700
&gt;&gt; Have you seen but
a white lily grow,

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.670
before rude hands have touched it?

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:19.850
Have you marked the fall of snow
before the earth has smutched it?

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.970
Have you felt the wool of
beaver or swan's down ever?

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:30.600
Or have smelt of the bud of the
brier, or the nard in the fire?

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.030
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:44.030
Oh so white, oh so soft,
oh so sweet is she!

00:24:50.510 --> 00:26:54.380
[ Singing "Have You Seen
but a White Lily Grow" ]

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tenor Robert White, and
lutenist James Tyler, "Have You Seen

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.820 position:56%
but a White Lily Grow", an anonymous
setting of Ben Johnson's poem.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.650
Basil Rathbone continues now with
a sonnet by William Shakespeare,

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.610
"How Oft When Thou My
Music", recited to a Fantasia

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.420
for virginals by Orlando Gibbons.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.630
Blanche Winnigran [assumed
spelling] is the virginal's player

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.910
in this selection, and the
Scotch jig which follows.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:43.040
[ Music ]

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:50.190
&gt;&gt; How oft when thou, my
music, music play'st. Upon

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:56.770
that blessed wood whose motion
sounds with thy sweet fingers

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:04.360
when thou gently sway'st. The wiry
concord that mine ear confounds.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.440
Do I envy those jacks
that nimble leap,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.280
to kiss the tender
inward of thy hand.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.610
While my poor lips which
should that harvest reap,

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:26.170
at the wood's boldness
by thee blushing stand!

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:32.060
To be tickled, they would
change their state and situation

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.530
with those dancing chips.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:39.920
O'er whom thy fingers
walk with gentle gait,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:45.170
making dead wood more
bless'd than living lips.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:53.790
Since saucy jacks so
happy are in this,

00:28:53.790 --> 00:29:00.510
give them thy fingers,
me thy lips to kiss.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:19.200
[ Applause ]

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.020
&gt;&gt; I often wonder how
Henry the eighth, you know,

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.320
[inaudible] [audience laughing],
ever managed to play one

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.030 position:56%
of those things [audience laughing].

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:31.800
Well, it's so true that
his daughter Elizabeth,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.280
played and played them very well.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.130
Also her rival, Mary,
Queen of Scotts.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.630
Can you hear her playing
the Scotch jig?

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.780
Most fitting as Will Shakespeare
says, "wooing, wedding,

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:55.380
and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
a measure, and a cinque-pace."

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.240
The first suit is hot and hasty

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.220
like a Scotch jig, and
full as fantastical.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.510
The wedding, mannerly
modest, as a measure,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.110
full of state and ancientry.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:20.270
And then comes repentance,
and with his bad legs,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.640
falls into the cinque-pace,
faster and faster,

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.880
till he sinks into his grave.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.510

A Scottish jig by an

and earlier a fantasia

Our program turns now to Elizabethan
attitudes on the subject of love.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.140 position:56%
In these selections by John Dowland,
Thomas Campion, and Thomas Ford,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.040
the scene is pastoral,
arcadian, and lighthearted.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.030
First is Dowland's "The
Shepherds' Delight."

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.400
Followed by Robert Greene's
"Sweet Are The Thoughts That Savor

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.890
Of Content, the Quiet Mind
Is Richer Than A Crown."

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.380
Campion's "It fell
on a Summer's Day",

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.390
is followed by Christopher
Marlowe's famous poem,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.850
"The Passionate Shepherd
To His Love",

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:46.930
and Sir Walter Raleigh's
"The Nymph's Reply."

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.180

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:40.240
&gt;&gt; Sweet are the thoughts
that savour of content.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.320
The quiet mind is richer
than a crown.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.000
Sweet are the nights in
careless slumber spent.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.980
The poor estate scorns
fortune's angry frown.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:01.090
Such sweet content, such
minds, such sleep, such bliss.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:06.790

princes oft do miss.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.890
The homely house that
harbors quiet rest,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.960
the cottage that affords
no pride nor care.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.650
The mean that 'grees
with country music best.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.260
The sweet consort of
mirth and music's fare.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:26.060
Obscured life sets
down a type of bliss.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:33.510

And we will sit upon the rocks,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.850
seeing the Shepherds feed
their flocks, by shallow rivers

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.920
to whose falls, melodious
birds sing madrigals.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.600
And I will make thee beds of roses,
and a thousand fragrant posies.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.420

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.620

Basil Rathbone is remembered
today as a film actor.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.780

in films like David Copperfield,

Anna Karenina, A Tale Of Two Cities,
and Captain Blood with Errol Flynn.

And for many people, he is still
unforgettable as Sherlock Holmes.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.730
But years before the film era,
Rathbone was already famous

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.160
for his roles on the London stage.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.380
He was a very fine
Shakespearean actor,

whose early stage career
included performances

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.550
of fifty-three Shakespeare roles.

Stratford on Avon Festival.

So you see in this program, I think,
the, really the link that was poetry

is inseparable in this culture.

of the program tonight.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.350
I hope that you are, that
you appreciate that and think

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.820
about it not only in the context
of what's happening on stage,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.500 position:56%
but also in the context of the plays
that you've read and the poetry

that you've heard and
the other experiences

of that culture that you've had.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:27.870

larger context for the music

hearing, and I hope you did too.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:40.990
And thank you all for coming.

It'll be about 10 minutes
until they open the house.

which we don't need to discuss.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:58.510
And, so you'll have a little
time to get together and talk

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.120
about Elizabethan poetry
or whatever you need to do.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.700

the great film credits
of Basil Rathbone,

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.580
he did leave out my two
favorite Basil Rathbone movies.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.270
So I feel compelled
by pure hubris and ego

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:30.460
to tell you what my favorite
ones are, like you care.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:35.680 position:56%
And the first is, of course Robin
Hood, and his performance as Sir Guy

great sword fight at the end

And the other that many of you may
not have seen, and this is specially

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.780
for the kids in the audience,
Universal Pictures made a number

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:54.230
of monster movies in
the, in the fifties.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.120
And the Boris Karloff
Frankenstein was one the best,

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.420
one of my favorites.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.040
The sequel to that everyone knows,
was the Bride of Frankenstein.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.980
However, the third movie in that
series was the Son of Frankenstein.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.140
And the Son of Frankenstein was the
last the one that had Boris Karloff

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.250
as the monster, and it
starred Basil Rathbone

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:18.890
as Victor Von Frankenstein's
son, Wolf von Frankenstein

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.260
and it is a brilliant film.

&gt;&gt; Just to be absolutely
sure about the dates,

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.160
it's 1599 because the
narrator said 1699.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.460
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat that?

00:52:54.680 --> 00:53:01.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, the narrator on your
recording said 1699, but your slide

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.470
and your reference was 1599.

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Wintle: The Morley consort
lessons absolutely came out in 1599,

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.280
it's definitely not 1699.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.830 position:56%
That was, I know it's hard to
believe, but a mistake on the radio.

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.050
No, but I know, know what you mean.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:23.900
But yes, 1599 absolutely
true, 1699 just misread it.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.320
Anything else?

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:32.090
&gt;&gt; That only really seems to
work with the British accent.

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:34.090
&gt;&gt; James Wintle:[laughing]
There is a certain manner

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.370 position:56%
of speech I think we're all used to.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:41.900
I think, I think the
words are powerful enough

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.210
to really withstand any accent.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:50.380
I could be proven wrong by that
fairly, with that fairly easily,

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.670
but I think of Shakespeare
especially

00:53:52.670 --> 00:54:00.080
as a kind of unshakable genius.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.110
In the same way that I think
of Johann Sebastian Bach,

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.380
I hear Johann Sebastian Bach
played on all sorts of instruments

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.130
that he never would have heard of.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:14.850
And you can hear a Bach prelude
played on almost anything,

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.990
and it's still a brilliant
piece of music.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:21.050
And I think that with this, you
can hear it spoken with any accent,

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:22.760
as long as the person
knows what it means.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.670
And again, with the Bach, as long
as the person knows what it means.

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.180
But I don't think so, I don't think
it has to have a British accent,

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.880
I think we're just
used to it that way.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.940
But I do see your point,
it works better that way

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.210
because it's more, it
seems more authentic.

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.950
And the, speaking of
authenticity in this program,

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:44.220
you heard the 1962
version of early music.

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:48.700
They were in fact playing on
replicas of early instruments,

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:55.860 position:56%
but the singers, as none of us have
replicas of Elizabethan vocal cords,

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.990
they were going full bore
with the vibrato and all that.

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:03.050
And very much in, you know,
in the style of that time,

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:07.170
and these early music
recordings from that period,

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:11.400
you hear a very different
sound from the singers.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.040
And in a certain way, they dig
into the music a little more

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.810
because they give it
more voice, you know?

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:23.600
And so there's a lot to
be learned from this.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:27.860
I think as a singer, listening to
these, to these earlier recordings

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.940
where they're just really
discovering this music,

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.300
I think can be educational.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.870
But a lot of the people, I was in
an early music program in college

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:44.010
and a lot of the people in that
program did not listen to this era

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.340
of early music recordings.

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:50.160
And didn't, you know, they, it was
wrong, and so they didn't do it.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.980
But I think there's a lot to be
learned and I think that listening

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:58.110
to these early tries at, you
know, this music is, it is,

00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.410
there's a lot to be said for it.

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.150
So I'm all for it.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.510
Anyone else have questions?

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:22.470
[ Inaudible question ]

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; James Wintle: Yeah and if you
had, in the 19, the tale of scholars

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:28.510
in 1973 is very different than
the tale of scholars today.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:33.950
And that whole sort of English,
English church coral sound

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.980
that influence what we think of
as what early music is supposed

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.130
to sound like is, to
a certain extent,

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.740
a twentieth century invention.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.770
So you have to sort of
keep these things in mind.

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:49.420
Yeah, but that's, that's a
great group, I love those guys.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.590
Questions, anyone else
have questions?

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:52.890
Yes.

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.500
&gt;&gt; Did they use a different print,

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.650 position:56%
so we're used to the notes having
certain frequencies and scale today.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.850
Back then were they
using a modulator

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.840
or somewhat different scale?

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.040
&gt;&gt; James Wintle: They were
using a different scale,

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.800
they were also using a
different pitch standard.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:16.850
So what we think of as A440,
it was lower than that, and,

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:20.730
in England it was lower than that.

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:24.170
In parts of Italy, it was higher.

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:27.060
See people think about, I'm
glad we've left a little time

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.700
for questions because, and I'll
try not to go on about this,

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.550
but the idea of pitch standard
was a completely variable idea

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.250
until the 19th century.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:41.860
And especially in the 17th
century, you've got pitch standards

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:46.950 position:56%
at widely different ranges depending
on where you were in Europe.

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:49.870
So parts of Italy, it was
higher than we think of as A440,

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:54.460
it was like A460, other
places in Italy it was lower,

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.600
and Germany it was lower.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:05.710
And because Bach's pitch standard
was A415, we think of A415 now

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:10.260 position:56%
as baroque pitch, when in fact there
is no such thing as baroque pitch.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.910
There's German baroque pitch,
which is A415, and that's what,

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.390
that's how we talk about that.

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:21.290 position:56%
So and you, and we know that from
measuring the lengths of instruments

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:23.620
of organ pipes that still exist,

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.800
that sort of thing you can tell
what the pitch standard was

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.820
in any given time, from wind
instruments, that kind of stuff.

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.620
So there is that part of it,

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.270
and then there is also the
pitch standard is one thing,

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.360
and the temperament is another.

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.220
And the temperament means the
distance between the whole steps

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.220
and half steps in the scale.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:47.830
So the actual frequency
difference, in today's standard,

00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:50.200
is called equal temperament tuning,

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.500
which means in between every
half step is the same number

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.120
of frequencies, in
between each half step.

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.410
In the seventeenth century,

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:03.340
and in most times before
the nineteenth century,

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.950
that idea of temperament
was variable.

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:13.110
And so you had varying, because now
in equal temperament, as they say,

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:15.450
everything is equally out of tune.

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:20.070
There, and we're just used to
it so that's, it sounds fine,

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:23.410
but as far as how the frequencies
actually line up mathematically

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:26.430
to each other, pretty much
everything is out of tune.

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:29.380
And what they would do in
the seventeenth century

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.510
and in earlier times, they
would change the distances,

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.230
it was variable between
different half steps in the scale

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:41.040
so that particular keys, you could
play on a keyboard instrument,

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.270
particular keys were exactly
mathematically in tune.

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:49.010
And as you got further afield
from one or 2 sharps or, you know,

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:54.460
what have you, then it became
more and more dissonant.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:56.010
And so the idea of dissonance

00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.290
in this early music is actually
something that, unless you're sort

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.890
of in the early music scene, you
don't really tend to understand

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:07.460
because it's not only a half step
next to each other being dissonant,

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:12.180
but a half step that
is tuned differently.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.990
Being closer together
possibly or further away,

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:18.690
in frequency that sounds
much more dissonant

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.620
than if you just play two notes
next to each other on a piano.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.030
So it's a whole different way
of hearing music, and there's a,

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:30.300
this is a great time to dispel
a myth that is perpetuated

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.620
by music history that
sort of gets on my nerves.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.850
Which is the idea that Bach
wrote the Well-Tempered Clavier

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:41.340
for a keyboard instrument that
was in equal temperament tuning,

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.500
that is in fact not true.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.810
And he wrote preludes and fugues
in all of the keys to experiment

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:54.420
with a new type of tuning that
was in fact not equal temperament.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.810
It was well-tempered and it
was some sort of variation

01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:00.210
on what they call sixth
comma meantone.

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:03.790
And certain keys were in tune
and certain keys were not.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.790
And the further afield
you get from C major,

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:09.750
the less in tune the actual key is.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:14.120
And so when you play, for instance,
the B major prelude in fugue

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.610
in the well-tempered clavier,

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:19.290
it is purposely an
extremely dissonant piece.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:23.130
They're much, there are
many more accidentals

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:26.830
and it's much more harmonically
adventurous because the key in

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.540
and of itself was going
to be dissonant.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.840
And so those pieces
are written differently

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.140
if you really look at it.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.550 position:56%
Those pieces are written differently
than the, than the earlier ones

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:39.130
in the book because he was dealing
with this different tuning system.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:44.360
So anyway, that is a whole
other lecture, but is something,

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.240
something that's interesting to
think about when you're listening

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.060
to this music because some people
go hear baroque orchestras,

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.370
and they think everything's
out of tune.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.300
Because it's not what you're
used to, and as, you know,

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.550
people used to say, they're people,
you know, who have perfect pitch.

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.290
And then they get into early
music ensembles and they have

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:05.040
to develop different
perfect pitches, you know?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.620
So they can sort of think in
A415 and that sort of thing.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.880
But every you know, everyone says
that your perfect pitch is tuned

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.490
to your grandmother's piano.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:14.870
So the whole idea of temperament
is variable, is what that means.

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:18.210
So anyway, other questions
about stuff in general,

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:21.390
or other things, music
related hopefully.

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.920
I tend to be able to answer
those questions more efficiently

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.390
than other subjects.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:28.220
I don't know a lot about
plants, that sort of thing

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.520
for instance [audience laughter].

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.820
Yes.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:36.400
&gt;&gt; I've never heard of a bandora
before, is there any difference

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.730
between it and a theorbo?

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.030
&gt;&gt; James Wintle: Yes,
there is a difference.

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:43.460
A theorbo is basically,
a slightly, well,

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.380
it depends on which theorbo you're
talking about, but it's basically,

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.550
a theorbo is basically a
lute with extra strings.

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.770
And so the lute is fairly standard,

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:57.870
and then there are extra bass
strings that are not fretted.

01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:59.770
So you basically play
the bass strings

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:02.280
at whatever pitch you tuned
the string to like a harp,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.970
and then play the lute like a lute.

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:13.070
A bandora is a fully
bass instrument, and the,

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:17.960
the, I'll just get to this.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:25.270 position:56%
As you see, the body of the bandora,
you can't really see it from here.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:28.910 position:56%
But the lute is rounded in the back,
which gives it a different sort

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:31.480
of resonance, the bandora is flat.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.380
And so it's about that thick,
but flat on either side,

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:41.260
and then shaped [inaudible] with
a little curlicue at the top.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:46.860
And it has double course
strings, like the lute does,

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:52.020
but is pitched much lower, and
has a different resonance quality.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.620
Yes it's lower.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.660
And it has the, it has a resonance
quality that's slightly more flat

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.480
than the lute because, because
of the shape of the instrument.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.970
But the bandora that that we think

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:06.360
about as the bandora
is the bass bandora.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.160
And that's what you hear
in the broken consort,

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.880
there were actually treble bandoras

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.680
in the Elizabethan era,
there were all sizes.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.810
And in one of the treatise,
I don't remember which one,

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.450
but there's a treatise that talks
about different sizes of bandoras

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:25.680
and says that there is one
small enough to fit your pocket.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.750
So I assume it's some sort of
large pocket, but it would be

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.460
like something like this.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.610
So a soprano bandora is
something that existed,

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.840
I've never actually seen one,
I've only ever seen a bass,

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.920 position:56%
but that's the essential difference.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.630
Anyone else?

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.110
We're, time, alright.

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.320
Thank you all for coming,
I appreciate it very much,

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.590
for indulging my love of
Basil Rathbone [applause].

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.000
Thanks a lot.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.630

of the Library of Congress.
