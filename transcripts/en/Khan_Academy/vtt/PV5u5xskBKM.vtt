00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.634
SAL KHAN: This is
Sal here again.

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.800
And I'm still here with my
good friend Dr. Mahadevan

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.390
from Stanford University.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.670
And in the last video, we had
looked at adequacy of x-rays,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.822
for the neck, which is,
is the x-ray good enough.

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:13.530
But now let's assume
we have good x-rays.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.530
Now, what do we look at?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.010
DR. MAHADEVAN: The next step
is to look at the alignment.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.600
So we talk about the ABCs of
reading a cervical spine film.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.410
And A starts with adequacy,
that we went over.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.450
And the second part
of A is alignment.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.120
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.769
So we're still in A.
So now it's alignment.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.143
I was expecting something with
a B. All right, alignment.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.454
All right.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.245
So this looks like this
is about alignment.

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.870
DR. MAHADEVAN: This
is about alignment.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.120
And there's four
lines that we look at.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.560
The first is the anterior
vertebral body line.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.330
SAL KHAN: OK, AVBL,
right over there.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.940
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.440
And basically, what
you're doing is,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.180
you're trying to draw a smooth
line that connects the anterior

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.200
aspect, the front of all
the vertebral bodies.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.750
It should be nice and smooth.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.270
It's usually curved.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.230
And all the points should
sort of fit on that line.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.087
Nothing should be
off of that line.

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:07.170
That would suggest that
there was a problem there.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.957
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:09.790
And anterior, as you
just said, means front.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.360
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.410
SAL KHAN: Right, OK.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.860
DR. MAHADEVAN: The
next line is going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.709
to the back of the
vertebral body.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.125
It's the posterior
vertebral body.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.940
SAL KHAN: So not the back
of the entire vertebrae,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.682
the vertebral body, which is
this boxy part right in front.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.640
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.100
And so same thing,
connecting a line up and down

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.460
should be nice and smooth,
as you've drawn it.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.940
And nothing should
fall off that line.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.730
No piece of that vertebral
body should fall off

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.730
of the line you've draw.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.880
SAL KHAN: All
right, sounds good.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.379
And then?

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.540
DR. MAHADEVAN: The next is, we
connect all the spinolaminar

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.200
junctions.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.570
So this is the
spinolaminar line.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.080
And it's where the
lamina connects

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.746
to the spinous process.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:52.310
SAL KHAN: Spinous
process, it sounds

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.290
like we could make a
whole video about that.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.310
DR. MAHADEVAN: Spinous
process, if you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.810
look at the back
of somebody's neck,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.502
are those little bumps
that you can see.

00:01:58.502 --> 00:01:59.710
And that's the very back end.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.440
SAL KHAN: And that's these
triangular things right here.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.398
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:03.530
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.369
So you're just
connecting that line.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.910
Kind of the front
of these triangles,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.419
the base of these
triangles, so to speak.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.090
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.360
SAL KHAN: And then the last one?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.901
DR. MAHADEVAN: And the last line
is the spinous process tips.

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.770
And again, we're just
connecting the top,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.050
the tip of all these
spinous processes,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.080
the little bony
projections you can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.370
see if you look at the
back of somebody's neck.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.180
And these two should generally
fall in a nice, smooth curve.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540
SAL KHAN: And so the general
rule-- if any of these

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.510
aren't aligned the way
that we've drawn here,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.135
it's a problem.

00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:32.468
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:37.080
We call it subluxation or
malalignment or misalignment.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.499
And these all suggest that
there is a problem there.

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.790
SAL KHAN: Which is a big
deal, because your spinal cord

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.450
is running through there.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.150
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.900
If you look between the two,
the green and the blue line,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.764
that's actually where your
actual spinal cord runs.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:50.430
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.139
Right down there.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.096
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:52.770
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.610
So you don't want
that to get messed up.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.110
All right.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.010
So let's look at a
few of these x-rays

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.240
and see if, one,
anything's wrong.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.645
Or if there's something,
if we can spot it.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:03.020
DR. MAHADEVAN:
Actually, Sal, now

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.120
that you know how to read
cervical spine x-rays.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.036
I'm going to have you
look at the first x-ray.

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:08.337
SAL KHAN: OK, let's see.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.920
I'm going to get
sued for malpractice.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.910
Let's see.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.910
All right.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.712
So this one over here.

00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:15.045
So let me just do the first one.

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.836
Let me just go with
what you told me to do.

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:20.374
So I'm going to do the anterior
side of this vertebral body.

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:21.332
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:23.123
SAL KHAN: Look, I'm
learning the words too,

00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:24.430
talking like a doctor.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.430
So I'm going to
draw a line here.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.490
That looks pretty good.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.260
That looks decent.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.140
What is it?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900
I'm kind of-- let me see.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.770
This still looks decent.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.152
And that doesn't look great.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:40.860
Would this count?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.570
I mean, this looks like it
got shifted over a little bit.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.670
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.420
SAL KHAN: It's not
a huge shifting.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.930
But it's enough that it's
not easy to draw a line.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.820
So I was right?

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.445
DR. MAHADEVAN: You're
absolutely right.

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:54.020
And in fact, sometimes
it's very subtle.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.930
And you picked up a
very subtle abnormality.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.285
But again, even though
it's subtle on the x-ray,

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:00.080
it could be serious
for the patient.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.174
So you potentially saved their
spinal cord and their lives,

00:04:03.174 --> 00:04:04.590
by picking up an
injury like this.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.420
SAL KHAN: OK, good.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.070
You're making me
feel-- very good.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.720
So that's-- it's literally
something as subtle as that is

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720
what you're looking for.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.180
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.000
Again, it should be
a nice, smooth line

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.300
or a nice, smooth curve.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.754
And as you can see,
at that junction,

00:04:16.754 --> 00:04:17.670
it's no longer smooth.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.564
SAL KHAN: And you
don't even have

00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:20.070
to look at the other lines.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.650
Any one of these that you don't
align, that's enough to say,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.632
hey, do something else.

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:24.590
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.340
And that's a great,
important teaching

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.230
point, which is, if you see
any abnormality on a plane film

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.350
on an x-ray like this, you stop.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.330
And you protect
their cervical spine.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.110
And then you get a
more important study

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.044
or a better quality
study, like a CT scan.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:37.960
SAL KHAN: Fascinating.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.418
Although if I do
look here, it does

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:41.030
look like we could
have done the PVBL.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.497
And it looks like that
also is a little off too.

00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:44.580
DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.140
SAL KHAN: That one and-- OK,
well, let's get a few more.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.015
DR. MAHADEVAN: Great.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.990
SAL KHAN: I don't want to focus
too much on my first victory.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.490
All right.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.450
So it's clear this person
is facing this way.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.710
I can see their teeth.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.790
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.090
Can I give it a shot again?

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.340
DR. MAHADEVAN: Please, please.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.050
SAL KHAN: So let's-- the
AVBL, it looks pretty good.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.360
This is-- well,
that looks close.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.190
DR. MAHADEVAN: It
looks close, I agree.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.920
And potentially, again,
you've got a very keen eye

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.120
and might have picked it up.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.200
But most people might--

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.850
SAL KHAN: A gift, you might say.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.683
DR. MAHADEVAN: --might
have overlooked that.

00:05:21.683 --> 00:05:24.480
SAL KHAN: So let's try
the other lines here.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.100
OK.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.830
So this one is more obvious.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.397
This one is more
obvious that there's

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.230
kind of that disconnection
right over there.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.188
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:37.160
And this is the PVBL, or the
posterior vertebral body line.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.210
You can see clearly,
that line is not smooth.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.112
It doesn't connect, and
so there is a problem

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:44.320
right there at that junction.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.770
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.740
All right, and so now we have
this last one right over here.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.800
Let me see what I can do.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.410
Let me see, don't want
to lose my streak.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.910
All right.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.677
So interior side-- this actually
looks pretty perfect actually.

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.510
DR. MAHADEVAN: And in
fact, it is a perfect.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.400
SAL KHAN: OK.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.780
Let me try the next lines here.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.650
This is the posterior
vertebral body.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.608
Let me do that in a color
that's easier to see.

00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:10.690
I already used orange.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.140
I'll do magenta.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.640
All right.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.280
So this is looking OK.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.770
It looks OK.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.942
I mean, nothing
obvious on that line.

00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:27.400
DR. MAHADEVAN: I would say,
again, you've got the keen eye.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.220
But in this particular
case, I'd say, it's fine.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.270
It's within the normal
range, as we say.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.640
SAL KHAN: And so let me do
the base of those triangles.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.784
Let me do-- so this is a
triangle right over here.

00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:42.330
DR. MAHADEVAN: Again, you want
it to be a nice, smooth curve.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.290
Everything should
fall on that curve.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.790
SAL KHAN: So this-- I would
have to be a little bit generous

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.870
with my curve to make it
go to these guys down here.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.090
DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.540
And this is the
spinal laminar line.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.380
This is the third
line of alignment.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.820
As you can see, to try to
get those to work, you could.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.680
But they're not smooth
like the other lines.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.471
And this is, again,
another subtle finding.

00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.775
But missing this finding because
the first two lines are normal

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:12.695
could again be devastating
for the patient.

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:13.644
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:15.560
You always want to err
on the side of caution.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.290
I mean, if anything looks
even a little bit suspicious,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.296
maybe another x-ray.

00:07:19.296 --> 00:07:21.670
DR. MAHADEVAN: Yeah, another
x-ray, another view, like we

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.560
talked about before.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.130
Or the definitive study is a CT
scan, or Computed Tomography.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.044
SAL KHAN: I see, very cool.

00:07:28.044 --> 00:07:28.960
Well, thanks for this.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.590
This is useful.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.560
DR. MAHADEVAN: My pleasure.
