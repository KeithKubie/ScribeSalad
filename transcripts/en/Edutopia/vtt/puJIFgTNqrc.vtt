00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I want to quickly
just recap this school year.

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.986
Can anyone think of some of
the things that we had to deal

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:15.286
with as a trailblazer
family this school year?

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:16.006
&gt;&gt;Student: Ike.

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:17.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hurricane Ike.

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.606
Blew the-- came and blew the
roof off of our building.

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:22.876
On top of Ike, anything else happen?

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:23.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Swine flu.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:25.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Swine flu, yes.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:30.366
And I know a lot of you have had
some tough stuff go on personally.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.506
Who's gone through personal stuff
this year that's been really tough

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:34.556
for them.

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:35.596
Almost all of us.

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.456
It's been a challenging year, and
while we could have made excuses,

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.526
day in and day out, no one did.

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:48.186
And the good news is that our
scores came back stronger than ever,

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.056
and so for the sixth year in a row,

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:53.486
we will be an exemplary
campus next year

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.126
&gt;&gt;All: [cheering]

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:57.846
&gt;&gt;Craig: Our students are here
because they're on a mission.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.746
They know their ultimate goal,
at the end of the day, is,

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:03.096
they need to be better
preparing themselves for college,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:06.196
and not just going to college,
but completing college as well.

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:09.926
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Romeo has not received
the letter yet from Friar Lawrence.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:11.726
Talk about that with your table.

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:11.966
What are the--

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.876
&gt;&gt;Chris: You've got to have a
great teacher in every classroom,

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:17.696
and the rest of the stuff is great,
you know, computers and stuff,

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.516
and things, that's all dandy, but
if you don't have a great teacher

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.266
in the classroom, it
doesn't really matter.

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:25.086
&gt;&gt;Erick: So the pressure
launches this out.

00:01:26.036 --> 00:01:28.886
By changing the angle in the
equation, before we shoot it,

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:30.646
we're able to calculate
how far it's going to go.

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:33.616
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We're a project based
school, so the students are asked

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:37.426
to do things that are going to really
challenge them to think critically.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:41.336
It excites them, so they
always talk about projects,

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:42.926
and they're really
excited to do them,

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.876
because of those relevant
connections.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.266
&gt;&gt;Katie: So if the moon
is going to be right here,

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.326
remember that we're going
to look in a straight line.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.156
&gt;&gt;I think we've learned that
kids love it when we integrate.

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:54.576
They see the connections
a lot more quickly

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:56.046
than I think we ever
thought they would.

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.536
And they sort of latch
onto that information.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:03.646
&gt;&gt;Mark: We want to be preparing
students to be highly successful,

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:06.516
and part of the way we do that is
introducing them to long hours.

00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:10.936
So our school day is from 7:30
until 4:30, Monday through Friday.

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.946
That's a 45 hour work week.

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:18.116
You know, just getting more time in
front of the students, teaching them,

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:21.576
having them work on projects,
more time, we believe,

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:23.976
is positively correlated
with better results.

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:27.006
&gt;&gt;Philip: This is a small
example of what's going to happen

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:27.666
for the rest of your life.

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:29.596
If you make poor decisions,
you're going to miss

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.416
out on the great opportunities.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.956
&gt;&gt;I think, kind of the approach
with the students is that, look,

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.586
I care about you tremendously, I
really want you to be successful,

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:37.746
I'm not giving up on you.

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.966
But you've let me down, and
you've let your classmates down,

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:43.996
you've let your teachers down,
but each day is a new day

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.676
to hold themselves responsible for
their behaviors, and that they,

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.786
with their actions, can get
back into the community,

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.506
and be a part of the family again.

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:55.556
&gt;&gt;Man: Oh, come in, please, Sir.

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.956
&gt;&gt;Bryan: I think the home
visit does a number of things.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:03:01.276
At first, it's that direct personal
contact we can have with the parents,

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:04.276
and I think it's a nice personal
touch that kind of sets the mood

00:03:04.346 --> 00:03:06.646
for the fact that we are
a family oriented school.

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.036
We're not only willing to say
it, but we're willing to kind

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.646
of put our money where our mouth is.

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:12.826
&gt;&gt;Chris: The contract, I
think is, it's symbolic,

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.406
but what we want parents
to understand is

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:15.936
that this has got to
be a team effort.

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:17.676
You know, this is a
three legged stool.

00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:21.296
It's us, it's your kid, and it's
you, and if we work together

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:23.366
for the next seven years, your
kid is going to be able to go

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:24.516
to any college they want to.

00:03:24.786 --> 00:03:26.496
&gt;&gt;Bryan: Sign under the
Student Signature, please?

00:03:27.096 --> 00:03:30.786
&gt;&gt;Rachel: The students know the
expectations, and they recognize

00:03:30.786 --> 00:03:34.546
that they need this education to get
to the place that they want to go to.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.946
They love being in an environment
where they have teachers who care

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:39.756
about them and care about their
success, and they feed off of that.

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:42.646
So when you walk into a classroom,
you will see students, you know,

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:45.746
engaged, and participating
and whatnot, because they know

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.646
that this is their
ticket to something great.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:51.356
&gt;&gt;Nelson: Good afternoon, my name
is Nelson Mendoza, and this fall,

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:56.966
I will be attending, Yale University.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:57.046
&gt;&gt;All: [cheering, applause]

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:57.886
