00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.299
People spend enormous amounts of time devoting themselves to completely made up

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.050
stories. That is almost all popular movies, popular books, television shows — they’re just made up.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.710
And I became curious about what it is about fictional narratives…what attracts people?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.890
So one aspect about fiction that lots of people speculated about is this

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.369
resolution of suspense. That what you want is to not know the outcome and you read

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.189
the story to find the outcome and that's
why people are very concerned about

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.510
spoilers. A huge majority of people think spoilers spoil things.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.140
And you just don’t in the end have the data from your own life to answer that question. That is, you

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.170
never see a movie twice for the first time – once spoiled and once not spoiled.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.930
And it essentially takes someone stepping back and constructing the proper experiment

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.070
to discover what it is the people actually like. So what we were curious about is does giving away the ending, ruin the experience?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.750
We brought undergraduates into the lab and we gave them

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.430
short stories from various genres. For some we didn’t spoil them, we just said,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.629
"Here’s a story, read it and at the end we’ll tell you how much you liked it." And for

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.390
others we spoiled it and we spoiled it as if inadvertently. We don’t want to say, “here’s a spoiler!”

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.939
because that already suggests
that we spoiled something. So we have

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.540
we have them read a tiny paragraph about the story that sort of accidentally gave away

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.530
You know…”In this the classic story where a wife kills her husband with

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.610
a leg of lamb.” And so you read it and don’t even realize quite that it’s spoiled but then

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.369
as you're reading the story, of course,  you know exactly what the ending is. And what we found

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.500
remarkably was that if you spoil stories, they actually enjoy them more.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.840
Spoilers actually were enhancers. And lots of people, when this finding came out,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.869
expressed skepticism (even sometimes
hostile skepticism) about it telling us

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.990
why we were wrong in all sorts of ways.
But really, if you think about it, when people who go see

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.619
"Romeo and Juliet" don't think, "don't tell
me how it ends!" That is almost everything

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.490
going seeing "Romeo and Juliet" knows that Romeo will dies and Juliet will die, it's a tragedy. In fact,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.369
the prologue to the play largely tells
you this. And also as I point out the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.149
skeptics, people watch these movies more than once happily and often with

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.890
increasing pleasure. So even a movie like "The Usual Suspects" where you think

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.420
that movie will be ruined if you know the
ending and I ask people, so the second

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.720
time you watched it did you like it? "Oh I

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.600
loved it the second time! Every time I
watch it I I like it more!" You think, like

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.100
but you know exactly what the ending
is. The point is really we're not

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.690
watching these things for the ending. If that were the case, you could save yourself a lot

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.740
of time, right, you would just say, "Oh it was the butler!" Wow, thanks, I don't have to read the novel.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.790
Really you read fiction for the beauty
of the prose and the cleverness of the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.580
construction and insights into human
nature. And maybe even knowing the ending

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.800
is useful because it allows you to focus
on these other parts. The same way if

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.670
you're driving up Highway 1 through Big
Sur. If you know the road really well you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.710
can now go round and admire the view and the otters frolicking in the surf.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.230
Whereas if you don't know what the road
is, you have to be focusing on that mundane

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.160
detail. The argument isn't that stories
shouldn't have plots. And in fact we tried

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.110
a variation where we put the spoiler
into the stories. We actually modified

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.070
these stories.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.670
A little bit of hubris, going in and fixing
what John Updike wrote. And it turns out that we

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.200
didn't make them better. So if you write
a first paragraph as if it's part of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.470
the story that gives away the plot,
people don't like the story more.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.620
wWt they really want is to have the
story complete but then this extra

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.390
knowledge about it. And there's lots of
evidence that this fluent processing of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.520
information is pleasurable. That some
familiarity with a work of art

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.640
enables you to enjoy it more.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.840
