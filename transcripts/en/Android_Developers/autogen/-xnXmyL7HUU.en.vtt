00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.000
 Lady's Voice: Spreading in new markets around the world 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.266
 A great way to find new users and increase revenue. 

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.933
 So we're happy to offer ten tips that developers have been able to do 

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.966
 Making use of local success despite their international reach 

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.966
 In search of opportunities for success. 

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.300
 Many of these tips apply to apps as well. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.000
 International deployment begins with the design of the game code 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 It coordinates its screens. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400
 You should allow for diversity in terms of language and composition of sentences and letters 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.533
 Numbers and figures representation 

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.233
 Because you will be exposed during translation. 

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:33.533
 For example, leaving a space of 30% of the additional space blank helps in 

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.600
 User interface elements avoid problems in other languages. 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.433
 Be sure to store all the content you change when you translate 

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:39.733
 In a file of resource files 

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.966
 So you do not have to re-type the code when translating. 

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.700
 Use the formats available in the system with date, time, and numbers 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.166
 The currency even corresponds 

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.100
 Your application automatically with what the user chooses. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.400
 Not yet available to all users 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.100
 Data connection is cheap and reliable. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 The game that can be played offline will still be verified 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.133
 A record increase in attracting a new audience. 

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.500
 Make sure the game installation package is as small as possible. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.366
 Users sometimes skip installing large games because of 

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.733
 Concerns about device memory or data transfer rate. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.900
 Understand the audience's request and preferences. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.133
 Look for large cultural differences and use symbols 

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.066
 Levels as well as scenarios in the game that you may raise 

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.933
 Sensitivity of local users. 

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.800
 Look for local interests in game colors, 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.333
 Simple games with nice icons 

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.500
 Representing importance in Japan and Korea for example, as for games 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.766
 War strategies are important in Germany and Russia. 

00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.433
 Find out how local users pay for 

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:40.300
 Get games and content within apps. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.333
 If your carrier billing is common, 

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.933
 Monthly restrictions may affect the number and intensity 

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.166
 In-app purchases. 

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.766
 There are many common expectations among 

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.500
 Western markets. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.633
 Users in these markets are very excited 

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.800
 For game icons based on simple characters without words, 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.466
 As well as for screen shots that show the actual playing mode, 

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.900
 Also like to start quickly and explore new features gradually, 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.666
 Games drawn from the reality can be attracted to a lot of frequency on the game, 

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.833
 As they attract prices that do not exceed 99. of the currency 

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.933
 There are also many common expectations 

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.433
 Between the Eastern markets. 

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:22.400
 For example, in Japan users prefer simplified games 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 The use of symbols includes glamorous characters 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.633
 On cartoon style and manga, 

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:28.433
 However, the most explicit game codes 

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.200
 Must reflect the theme of the game, 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.866
 They also prefer color screen shots 

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.433
 Which refers to the content and theme of the game world, 

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:37.533
 They also prefer to interact with simplified games that include a high learning curve, 

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.800
 And expect prices for the application does not exceed zero, 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.100
 Preferring to pre-register for elements within the game as a reward. 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.966
 Keep this in mind as a starting point for your search. 

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.400
 You must engage a professional third party 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.966
 It offers you a translation service as you can use 

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.466
 With your local audience for a high-resolution translation of the app. 

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.400
 You can use the translation service at 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.766
 Application Developer Console. 

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.866
 You only need to send the original text in resource files. 

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.466
 You will not need to modify your development 

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.233
 So that it fits in with the translator. 

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.066
 You'll also need to add the text of your Play Store listing 

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.800
 Until it is translated as well. 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.566
 The test is also an essential element 

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.866
 Since small translation errors can be very embarrassing 

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:26.100
 Regardless of the great effort I have made in preparing the text for translation, 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.566
 Some text may be left truncated or in a format 

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.000
 Not safe. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.966
 Use local users to test. 

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.133
 Continue with User Forum. 

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.833
 Through this forum you can take advantage of language skills 

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.800
 And a great local experience. 

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.600
 The translated app needs to market an interpreter. 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.133
 Local marketing can include a localized data card, 

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.633
 Or support from members of the local user forum, 

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.900
 Or to publish the application in the local language on global social networks 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.500
 And local channels as well, 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 Or a collection of press articles that are sent to important media and blogs 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.333
 As well as translated advertising campaigns 

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:03.100
 To launch local installations and enhance local offerings. 

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.400
 Users prefer to have a good idea of ​​how the game is played 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 Before you install them. 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 Adding a promotional clip to a Play Store listing can help 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 In encouraging users to make a decision. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.866
 When you create a promotion, 

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.933
 Do not forget to create market-specific versions. 

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:22.533
 Light highlights the features that make 

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.500
 The game attracts the attention of local users, 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.300
 Add voice translation service, 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.100
 Or use an accompanying translation if you can not. 

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:36.000
 The developer console offers a mechanism for revisions 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.400
 Google Play 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.266
 You can then see reviews from users around the world. 

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.800
 Be sure to send a response to these users. 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.633
 Tell them you care a lot about their opinion 

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.833
 And that you want to take advantage of their comments. 

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.800
 Users will be very happy 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.700
 If you send them a response in their own language. 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.866
 You can also take advantage of the experimental use of the test 

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:54.200
