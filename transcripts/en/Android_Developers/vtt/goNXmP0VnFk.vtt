00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.001
Hello.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Daniel Pham
and welcome to "This Week

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.800
in Android Development" on
Monday, November 25, 2013.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.421
All of our Retos
seem to be missing,

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:17.920
so I'm back again
this week to share

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.800
what's been going
on around here.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.680
Last week, "Game On!"
returned from hiatus

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.150
to celebrate the half
birthday of "Play Games."

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.050
In app update news,
"HBO Go" has been

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.680
updated to include both
support for the latest wafery,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.620
chocolatey version
of Android, as well

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.570
as Chromecast integration.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.510
While ESPN Sports Center has
been revamped with a fresh new

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.010
look.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.285
The app looks great, but
upon closer inspection,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:40.160
it looks like they're
showing the wrong score

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.760
from last season's Superbowl.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.350
We all know the
Ravens were shut out,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.540
and the Niners put up a
thousand unanswered points--

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.000
just like they're going to
do today to the Redskins.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.025
This week, be sure to
check out another episode

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.426
of "Android Design in Action."

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.675
The gang will be sharing
their favorite design details

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:55.610
in an exciting new format.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.420
For those of you in
the US, hope you're

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.780
ready to eat way too
much this Thursday.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.927
So Happy Thanksgiving,
and safe travels.

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.010
That's all for this week
in "Android Development."

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.810
Be sure to check out
this week's shows.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.720
I'm Daniel Pham.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.890
And remember-- "It
means no worries

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.170
for the rest of your days.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.180
It's our problem free
philosophy-- Hakuna Matata."
