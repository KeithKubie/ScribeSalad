00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
During normal breast tissue development and maintenance, cells

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.740
grow and divide as they do in any

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.362
tissue. And as we learned about in lesson

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.914
six with many other cell divisions, mutations occur all

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:14.352
the time. Every time the DNA is copied

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:17.924
to go into new daughter cells, there's an opportunity

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.920
for new mutations to become introduced. Typically most

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.230
all of these mutations are repaired or fixed so

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.140
that the cells can go on performing their

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.490
normal functions. And providing structure and function to an

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.750
overall tissue in the breast. But if enough mutations

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.780
in critical genes go unrepaired, then there's a high

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.420
likelihood that cells will start growing out of control.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.450
And form the beginning of a tumor that you

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.190
can see here. Now remember, mutations are going on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.780
all the time. And so your body is really

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.430
constantly fighting a, a losing struggle in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.090
some sense because mutations will keep happening. And

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.800
at some point, if your body isn't able to repair them all, one or two

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.379
or possibly more are going to disrupt normal

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.530
function. And likely lead to the initiation of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.040
tumor formation. Now, obviously there are many important

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.800
proteins responsible for repairing mutations when they happen.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.480
But two that are really relevant for breast

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.670
cancer are the genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.440
We might call them BRCA1 and BRCA2. Carol

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.080
has a mutation in BRCA2. Other women had mutations

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.400
in BRCA1. Either way, mutations in either of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.120
these genes disrupt this process of mutation repair

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.260
and can lead to a much higher breast

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.900
cancer risk. Let's chat a bit more about BRCA1

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.520
which has been pretty well studied. The BRCA1

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.240
gene can be found on chromosome 17 in

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.300
the human genome and chromosome 17 has about

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.030
81 million base pairs. And BRCA1 can be

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.650
found about halfway down the link of the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.347
chromosome. The gene itself has 23 axons spanning

00:01:57.347 --> 00:02:01.180
80,000 base pairs of DNA. After transcription and

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.910
splicing, the resulting mRNA has 5,592 nucleotides of coding

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.590
region between the start and stop codons. This

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.869
results in a protein that has 1,863 amino

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:16.080
acids. Now there are multiple alleles of BRCA1

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.400
that are associated with the high risk of

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.024
early onset breast cancer. But one allele in

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:24.132
particular has an insertion of a cytosine at

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:27.660
position 5,382 of the coding region as shown

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.940
right here. Using the genetic code that we learned

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.370
about in lesson three, and that you can find about in the instructor's notes

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.200
on this page, I want you to determine the expected change in amino acid

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.910
sequence. And then select the type of mutation that you think this is best

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.160
categorized as. Again, if you have trouble

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.830
answering this, review mutations from lesson six.
