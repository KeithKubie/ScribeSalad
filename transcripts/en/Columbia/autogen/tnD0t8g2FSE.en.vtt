a log last night with this spring about
 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.540
a log last night with this spring about
the establishment since I mean january

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550
the establishment since I mean january
 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.930
the establishment since I mean january
or februari next year of the new new

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940
or februari next year of the new new
 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.110
or februari next year of the new new
institution originally it had been

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120
institution originally it had been
 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.149
institution originally it had been
called institute of national remembrance

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:23.159
called institute of national remembrance
 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.149
called institute of national remembrance
but then after some discussions they

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159
but then after some discussions they
 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:28.700
but then after some discussions they
changed the name into the institute for

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.589
the study of totalitarian regimes or
something like that so basically i think

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599
something like that so basically i think
 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.959
something like that so basically i think
it delivers with the polish example so

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:35.969
it delivers with the polish example so
 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.070
it delivers with the polish example so

a commemoration of Germany's history I

00:25:26.249 --> 00:25:26.259
a commemoration of Germany's history I
 

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:29.019
a commemoration of Germany's history I
mean it was part of Germany at some

00:25:29.019 --> 00:25:29.029
mean it was part of Germany at some
 

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.899
mean it was part of Germany at some
point and you cannot ignore that pass I

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:31.909
point and you cannot ignore that pass I
 

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:34.960
point and you cannot ignore that pass I
mean you know I'm in history I mean we

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:34.970
mean you know I'm in history I mean we
 

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.450
mean you know I'm in history I mean we
we need to look at all aspects of

we need to look at all aspects of
 

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.999
we need to look at all aspects of
history and we cannot just exclude

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:40.009
history and we cannot just exclude
 

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:42.099
history and we cannot just exclude
certain parts of it because they are

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:42.109
certain parts of it because they are
 

00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:46.419
certain parts of it because they are
politically not correct or advantageous

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:46.429
politically not correct or advantageous
 

00:25:46.429 --> 00:25:49.419
politically not correct or advantageous
I mean I think it's it's about how you

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:49.429
I mean I think it's it's about how you
 

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:52.239
I mean I think it's it's about how you
do it I think it's at least as important

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:52.249
do it I think it's at least as important
 

00:25:52.249 --> 00:25:54.249
do it I think it's at least as important
and I think you know that's again part

00:25:54.249 --> 00:25:54.259
and I think you know that's again part
 

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:56.529
and I think you know that's again part
of however you want to call it about the

00:25:56.529 --> 00:25:56.539
of however you want to call it about the
 

00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:59.049
of however you want to call it about the
normalization to history or broadening

00:25:59.049 --> 00:25:59.059
normalization to history or broadening
 

00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:04.629
normalization to history or broadening
of history in Germany that that you know

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:04.639
of history in Germany that that you know
 

00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:07.719
of history in Germany that that you know
that that everybody of course in Germany

00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:07.729
that that everybody of course in Germany
 

00:26:07.729 --> 00:26:10.329
that that everybody of course in Germany
was a maybe not everybody but people who

00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:10.339
was a maybe not everybody but people who
 

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:12.219
was a maybe not everybody but people who
are aware that certain parts of the

00:26:12.219 --> 00:26:12.229
are aware that certain parts of the
 

00:26:12.229 --> 00:26:14.079
are aware that certain parts of the
history were not discussed you know

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:14.089
history were not discussed you know
 

00:26:14.089 --> 00:26:16.690
history were not discussed you know
initially it was the Nazi past and then

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:16.700
initially it was the Nazi past and then
 

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.299
initially it was the Nazi past and then
later there were other parts because it

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:19.309
later there were other parts because it
 

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.819
later there were other parts because it
was not politically correct and I think

00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:21.829
was not politically correct and I think
 

00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:25.079
was not politically correct and I think
