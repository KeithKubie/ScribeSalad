00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 align:start position:0%
forward to that um and then it kind of
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.289 align:start position:0%
forward to that um and then it kind of
takes<00:03:44.380><c> a</c><00:03:44.590><c> different</c><00:03:44.829><c> turn</c><00:03:45.280><c> in</c><00:03:45.489><c> a</c><00:03:45.610><c> sense</c><00:03:45.880><c> it's</c>

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 align:start position:0%
takes a different turn in a sense it's
 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%

my guess is to take over the United
 

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
my guess is to take over the United
Republic<00:09:52.050><c> because</c><00:09:52.650><c> she</c><00:09:52.830><c> seemed</c><00:09:53.040><c> pissed</c><00:09:53.400><c> that</c>

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:53.610 align:start position:0%
