00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Hi everyone. Oh, that's cool, the
music kind of stopped and everybody got quiet.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.250
That's great. My name is Mano Marks. I know
a lot of you out here and so this is really

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.789
great. It's really great to be here to see
lot of familiar faces and also a lot of new

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:21.290
ones. Now, this is Pamela Fox, here. She has
flown here from Sydney for this so; we are

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.300
really, really privileged to have this. So
this is our--our talk is, What You Don't Know

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.780
About GeoAPIs Can't Hurt You. And really it's
a grab bag session, right? Were--were going

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.999
to show you a lot of really cool stuff. Some
of it new, some of it has been around for

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.570
a little while, but not a lot of people are
using yet, or we just think is really, really

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.609
kind of cool. So we're going to go through
it. I'm about halfway through, we're going

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.399
to switch computers and at that point we will
take a couple of questions and then we'll

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.819
have questions at the end. I'm not going to
do--if you miss any of my preventions usually,

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.460
I like to have a lot more sort of give and
take this format, probably not, not the best

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.979
for that. So, anyway, I'm going to go ahead
and get started. All right. So, the World

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.479
of GeoAPIs. So, you know, we've got--we've
got a ton of APIs here at Google. We've got

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.950
Mapplets, the JavaScript Maps APIs, Maps API
for Flash, Panoramio, Maps Data API, Static

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:32.130
Maps, KML, Earth API, and SketchUP API. And
I'm sure we're forgetting some like visualization

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.579
stuff and there's a bunch of other things.
And we're not obviously going to cover every

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.340
piece of that. Here otherwise, it would just
be one slide per, per thing. What I'm going

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.500
to do, I'm going to talk mostly about Earth
and SketchUp related things. And, so, I've

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.679
got--I'm going to talk about Google Earth
Touring and the HTML support and I'm going

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.539
to talk a little bit about SketchUp and then
we're going to switch over to, to Pamela.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:07.009
Okay. So, how many of you played around with
Google Earth 5.0? All right. So, then you

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.349
probably know that we added Touring support.
A Touring got out something that that developers

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.500
have been asking for, for quite sometime which
was much more complete control over the camera

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.720
experience. And also added in a couple other
interesting things like, like control over

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.430
the time slider, control over, control over
sound and the ability to do--well, there's

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.370
a bunch of things here; move the camera, move
the, move models, animate polygons, change

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.670
where your placemarks are and show the new
historical imagery that we have in, in Google

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.360
Earth which allows you to look back in time
at different, at different satellite imagery.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.360
So, this your, your basic Tour, here. You
see it's got a Tour element. I'm little hampered

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.769
by this because usually I jumped up and down
and point of things and I can't quite do that

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:16.120
here. It's got your tour elements, playlist
which is just, you know, play all the points

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.830
that are--the things that are going to happen.
And then a FlyTo which shows you a camera

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.390
which has, you know, all the things that normally
associate with camera. So, what this does

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.189
is it flies you to this particular location
when the tour is loaded. So there's something

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.540
you may notice here, you'll see there's a
prefix on some of these elements, the gx prefix.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.879
This is part of the extension name space,
the Google extension name space to KML. If

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.209
I had a full tour here which I might have
later, you'd see the actual name space declaration.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.340
So this is part of the KML's standard process
like, the Open Geospatial Consortium which

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.829
adopted KML as a, as a standard last year,
built in an extension mechanism which allows

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:14.500
people to innovate within KML 2.2. And, and
add in things that are, that are interesting

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.769
for their application and that they hope will
eventually become part of the KML standard.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.910
So that's what we've done. We're--we're trying,
we're innovating and trying to show you new

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.139
and fun things. Okay. So, here's a, here's
the sound queue. Pamela wanted me to make

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.520
this actually much bigger, but I just wanted
to show how easy it was to add sounds by having

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.820
a lot of wide space around it. Three lines,
you know, two el--one element in a child,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.070
put in a sound queue, it plays that when,
when that part of the tour is triggered. Here's

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.990
how you change the imagery, you'll see here,
you've got the camera just like we have before,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.830
the FlyTo, but I added in a timestamp. And
what that does is it tells Earth when this

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:11.940
thing takes place so that it can then go through
and change the imagery to the historical imagery

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.690
to that, to whatever most matches that timestamp.
I'm going to give a little demo of touring

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.720
later that will show you a little bit more
about these things. And here's quickly how

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.889
you move a model that uses updates. So many
of--how many of you would consider yourself

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.500
KML developers? Okay, that's, that's more
than usual for Google I/O. How many of you

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.940
have actually played around with the update
tags before? All right that's good. Okay.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.720
So, that's a good number. Update is one of
those things that's kind of hard to get right

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.150
and it's basically how do you add a little
bit of dynamism to a scripting language--to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.810
a scripting dynamism rather to a declarative
language. And it basically allows you to do

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:08.080
incremental updates, changes, deletions, additions
to your, to whatever place marks have already

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.990
been loaded. Well, we've adopted that also
for, for touring and you'll see that all,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.050
that all the standard KML names base except
for the animated update and the duration.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.430
And this basically just allows you to change
the position of a 3D model. So no more do

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.599
you have to create multiple model elements
with lots of timestamps at slightly different

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:38.580
locations to achieve an animation effect.
What you get instead is changing the location

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:50.979
this way, so. Okay. So we can add it very
easily into, into the Google Earth API. So,

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.960
you can load a tour using the Earth Browser
Plug-in. And you'll see here some very simple

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:05.479
JavaScript. You do FetchKML, check and see
if it's actually a KMl object and then it

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:11.690
appends--append the KML object to your DOM
and then you walk through and you look for

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:20.229
KML tours end and add in. This is based on
Romeo Nurik's touring samples which I'm going

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:33.139
to show you in just a minute. So, that's--there's
a page on earth.google.com--one thing I don't

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:40.000
like about Chrome is it graze out the depth
in the URL, but put that URL into the slides

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.169
so that'd be available later. These are--these
are basic tours and this is where we'll get--if

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:54.169
we can have the sound turned on, I'll play
you the Jimmy Buffet Tour, it's already actually

00:07:54.169 --> 00:08:03.860
starting. So, Jimmy Buffet is a fan of Google
Earth and he helped with our launch. And you'll

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.310
see here the nice, one of the nice fun features
is, I think, yes, we're going to actually

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:17.139
go underwater right now. So, those of you
who haven't played yet with the Google Earth

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:24.970
5.0, ocean feature is you can actually go
under the water and see what's happening there.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:32.720
Okay. And I'm going to next show you another
interesting one. This will still require some

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.780
sound. This is...
&gt;&gt; Historical imagery dating back to the early

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:46.200
1960's tells a story of change. Lake Chad
was once the sixth largest lake in the world.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.460
Persistent droughts and increased diversion
of water for irrigation have reduced it to

00:08:51.460 --> 00:09:01.330
roughly one tent its size forty years ago.
&gt;&gt; MARKS: So, in the past, what you--to achieve

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:07.560
this kind of effects--I'm sorry, if you want
to see more of this is--these are all in the

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.020
website. And to achieve his kind of effect
you would have had to get Google Earth, create

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.710
the KML's around it, play through, do a screen
capture using either movie maker which is

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:25.850
part of Google Earth Pro or some other screen
capture software. And then scrip through record

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:34.350
the, record it using a recording and using
microphone as a separate recording of the

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.030
audio and then just--and then sink them up
together. And it was, it would have been a

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:44.320
lot more cumbersome experience. And now, instead
of that, instead of watching what looks actually

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.510
to me like a video, you're actually watching
Google Earth in action here. So play this

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:58.160
tour, continue playing the tour, will see
it, it makes changes and I can actually move

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.410
around within the environment there in ways
in which the original tour author may not

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:11.200
have intended but that's okay because your--the
user, in your own control. So I think touring

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.830
is one of the most exciting aspects of the
Google Earth 5.0 launch and also the fact

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:24.230
that we can incorporate it now within the
Google Earth Plug-in and load them using the

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:32.260
Earth API it just--it gives you the tremendous
amount of power. Okay. So I wanted to talk

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:43.020
to you, in--in the latest version of Google
Earth, we added HTML support. So what that

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:50.240
means is--what that means is you basically
can run a browser within your description

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.390
bullets. It's not, it's not a hundred percent,
it's not full, it's very close to that and

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.640
the documentation it tells you where the little
bits of limitations are. One of the key and

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:08.720
the key points of limitations is you can't
do cookies. So not yet do we allow advertising

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.670
using, using Google ads, but I think you can
see where this is going. But you get Java

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:20.880
Script support. You get iFrames. You can have
a full rich experience within your description

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:31.240
balloon, within Google Earth 5.0. And we started
supporting--doing limited support for HTML

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.580
5. And you know, we talk about--we've talk
about that a lot in this conference so you

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.710
can see that where we're going to go with
that is probably is much more complete HTML

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:52.010
5 support. Right now, we, we use QtWebKit
4.5 and that's--and so you can look and see

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:58.050
what that supports and that's what we support
on the PC. I'm not sure--I forget the backend

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:03.640
whether we're using the HTML 5, but then actually
we have a video and audio support within the

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:11.640
description balloon just using the tags from
HTML 5. Okay, so here all I have is--show

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.180
example and Pamela looked at me and just said,
"Really? That's just what you wanted to do?"

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:23.860
I always find it kind of cumbersome to put
like a full range of KML in, into a slide.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:31.150
Slides are messy--I don't--they're like this
data sink and I have, I have a little bit

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:37.070
of a problem having to actually use them 'cause
I like Google Earth as, as my presentation

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:46.020
platform. But I know people like them so--anyway,
but I much prefer text set. So you'll see

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.360
here I've got KML and this is where I'd want
to jump up and points the name space. You'll

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:58.660
see right--let's see if I can just highlight
it right here. Let's see here, this line is

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:07.950
the extension name space for, for Google Earth.
Google Earth 5.0 using our extension features.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:14.450
And you'll see in here that I've created a
fairly simple form. So you got a place mark

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:22.580
with a name and a description and within that
I've got my HTML and you'll see form gives

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:29.240
a method that gets an action which is just
something that's running on a local host.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.710
And it just--this is very simple, it'll just
ask you to input a name and what, what it

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:41.000
does on the back end is it puts that name
into a MySQL database. So I'm going to actually

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.710
show you this in action--it's not exciting
obviously, but I think it's exciting for what

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:54.210
it can actually, it can actually do. You'll
see here, form in balloon. And then name,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:14:01.680
I'm going to put name Pamela because I put
in Mano before and I submit. And you'll see--actually,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.600
it takes me to the next page within the description
balloon and so--and it gives me back, you

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.430
know, gives me back an HTML page. That's all
just running off my local host 'cause, you

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.980
know, when I'm presenting at conference I'd
never want to run things off the Web if I

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:24.190
can help it. Okay, so that's, that's a fairly
simple example there. I wanted to show you

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:32.300
another one. This is, this just takes the
basic Google Maps API sample. I kind of love

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.010
this sort of--I know I love things that are
kind of meta and putting a map inside the

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:49.020
description balloon that runs in Google Earth.
Fairly, fairly simple but just takes the standard

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:56.410
map--basic map sample. I'll load this up and
I get a map, a slippy map within a balloon

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:05.940
in Google Earth. Now, for those of you who
struggled through Earth, you know, up to 4.2,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.310
4.3 and had to, you know, struggle within
the restrictions of rich text with no dynamic

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:16.260
forms involved, I think that at that point--at
this point, you might be really excited to

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:31.820
see the range of support that we have. Okay.
And I think given the amount of time, I'm

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:39.120
going to move on to the HTML5 supports--here
I am flipping between my browsers. Okay. So--oh,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:48.700
just a quick note on the limitations. The
full HTML support is not, not yet available

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.690
in maps. So if you'll load a KML file into
Google maps, you will, you will--it'll skip

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.800
out all the JavaScript and all that. And we
have some differences in a way it's implemented

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:07.450
in the Earth Plug-in. You can talk to myself
or Romeo about that more later at office hours.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:14.170
And those are--those issues--both maps and
the Earth Plug-in is done for reasons of security.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:26.040
So I wanted to quickly show you an HTML5 sample.
Okay. So what I've done here is I've created

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:33.330
a Webpage HTML5 test. You'll see in here,
it's got a function, draw Canvas. It's--this

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:38.210
is just--to be honest a sample I took off
the Web, somebody was, was demonstrating capabilities

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:47.630
of Canvas. It just draws a yellow box inside
Canvas elements and that's it. And then it'll

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:53.790
say, "Your browser does not support the Canvas
tag," if in fact, it does not. And we can

00:16:53.790 --> 00:17:04.540
then load this up--so I created that Webpage
and then I load it using an iFrame on, on--in

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:16.329
the actual KML and it will show some of the,
the tags that we have here. So you'll see

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.530
there through the yellow box. It gives you
a little, you know, a little statement as

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:28.250
to what, what browsers support it. You'll
see here, sort of--I think it's a little idiosyncratic

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:34.800
so far what QtWebKit is supporting. They decided
to support the dialogue tag, so dialogue basically

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.120
takes a bunch of form--of things that you
put in in dialogue format and then creates

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:50.070
a default dialogue. So I can show you what
that looks like in the HTML. That's this part

00:17:50.070 --> 00:18:01.020
right here. So this, it creates a dialogue
style for you. And--so this is one of the

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.500
new HTML5 tags and I'm kind of curious why
they choose to implement that instead of say,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:16.490
video but it's, it's probably 'cause it was
fairly easy to do and video is a little bit

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:21.520
harder. So that's, that's where we are with
that. And as I said if you, if you loaded

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.930
this on to a Mac, you'd have some--you'd have
audio support directly in the description

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:39.530
balloon and video as well. Okay. So the next
thing I want to mention is the Sketchup API.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.260
This will actually be the last thing before,
before I switch over to Pamela and she'll

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:53.380
be talking about 2D maps. And you can see
her getting all excited there. And so Google

00:18:53.380 --> 00:19:04.860
Sketchup runs a--has a Ruby API, so basically,
it allows you to do really interesting things

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:12.760
within sketchup like move models around, attach
metadata to them, change their shape, change

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.610
their sizes and all that sort of thing--that's
sort of fun goodness. I don't have time to

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:24.940
go too deeply into, into what it can do but
I--instead I want to show you a demo. And

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.060
the demo that I'm going to show you is SketchyPhysics
and this is available for free. You can download

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:37.970
this online. It does some really fun stuff--it
basically is a physics engine within Google

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:45.170
Sketchup. And if I played play right here,
you'll see these things dropped and kind of

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:51.900
fall around but even more fun, I can pick
it up and move it around, I can--it'll bash

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:59.850
into things. I don't know. That's my--that's
what I--I just spend time go--you know, moving

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.170
things around and bashing them into things
'cause maybe I didn't get to do enough of

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:11.900
that when I was a child, I don't know. And
this--so that I think is a really fun, fun

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:19.770
start. This is even more fun I think. This
is--shows doing rag-doll Physics within Google

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:25.040
Sketchup and so far, you know, handsfree here,
you'll just see it. It's--it flopping about

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.490
in this rag-doll fashion and then I can pick
it up and drag it around and do all sorts

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:39.150
of fun, interesting stuff for this. So, you
know, aside from all the--you know, the fun

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.530
that I can show you with bashing things around,
people are using this for really serious applications

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:51.420
basically for doing data presentation, of
things like molecular physics and, you know,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:57.260
to show car crashes and lots of other interesting
things that's--that are really meaningful

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.940
but you all are developers, I want to show
you the fun stuff, right? Okay. So I think

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.620
I am done. I'm going to switch over to Pamela
and while we're doing that switch over, we

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.300
could have some--if there are any questions
on anything we talked about or going to talk

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:19.440
about, there's some microphones up there.
No questions? Ah, Mike. I can always count

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:27.790
on Mike. Yes.
&gt;&gt; MIKE: Hey, Mano, it doesn't seem like the--when

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.590
I--the JavaScript works in a KML file in the
balloon but if I try to load it from the Earth

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.640
API and if I got JavaScript in it there, it
doesn't seem to go through, is that...

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:41.170
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Yes. That's--we're still working
out some of the security things on that. And

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.660
you can talk to Romeo and I at office hours
about some of the details on that.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.880
&gt;&gt; MIKE: Okay, later.
&gt;&gt; MARKS: And we do hope to have a full HTML

00:21:49.880 --> 00:22:00.340
support within the description balloons and
the Plug-in. [INDISTINCT] like--I think I

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.280
just announced something, I don't know. Van?
&gt;&gt; VAN: Could you just repeat the office hours?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:07.370
I was getting...
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Oh, we--I think they're on the office

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:12.610
hours list on your card but I think we'll
be doing 2:00 and 3:00 o'clock, so KML and

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:18.030
your API. And there's stuff going--there's
people there are all day so even if we're

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.220
not there. Any other questions? No? Pamela,
are you about ready?

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:54.420
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Excellent. I'll put this down so

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.820
they can see you.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Sweet. All right. Do you guys all

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.780
remember this? All right, sweet. Good. All
right, so enough of that boring 3D flashy

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:08.420
stuff. Let's talk about 2D maps APIs 'cause
that's where it's at; 3D is too hard to use.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:14.630
You have to use multiple fingers. It's too
hard. Everything I do in life I have to do

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:22.210
while I'm eating food, so I can't possibly
use Earth while I'm also eating food. So you

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:28.670
should see my keyboard, it's covered in lunch
and alcohol and disgusting things. All right,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.200
I'm going to start with some old stuff, starting
going way back with driving directions which

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.040
we had to launch--I think like the 2nd month
that I was an official employee, like two

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.540
years ago. So most of you, you know, probably
know we have driving directions in pretty

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.350
standard--you know, you can load from here
to there. You can also load up to 25 different

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.500
waypoints if you want to do it, you know,
massive road trip. We added the ability to

00:23:50.500 --> 00:24:00.090
avoid highways since I hate highways. We added
the ability to walk since I can't actually

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:07.970
drive. And so once we've catered everything
that I need, we have a pretty nice API. And

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.820
there's some stuff that people have done that
I just want to point out. It's kind of different

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:19.750
uses of the directions API. So first of all,
you guys know on Google Maps there's draggable

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.970
driving directions and people really love
this 'cause they can customize their route.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:29.390
We didn't offer this natively in the API,
but people figured out that really you can

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:38.250
just do it yourself. And so here we go, I
made my start and end. And so this is purely

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:44.370
just using the API. So really you can get
the same experience that you get with Google

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:50.000
Maps with using API and you can use this sample
code for your own app. Another thing, this

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.570
is really cool demo here from one of our gurus.
So let's say that I'm doing a massive rode

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.720
trip and I am obsessed. Actually, I'm really
obsessed with Taco Bell right now. So I've

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.240
been in Australia for the last six months
and Australia is fantastic and has wonderful

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.150
kangaroo meat but they have no Taco Bell.
So I have like a massive craving for Taco

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:16.720
Bell right now. It's the best burritos in
the world. So let's see. So I can do a driving

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.480
directions route here and then this demo queries
against this guy server to see what Taco Bells

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.690
are along that route. And I can say, you know,
I want it within ten miles or more. I'm not

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.980
willing to really go that far so I'd probably
do less. Let's say there's not really enough

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.180
Taco Bell so I'm going to open myself up and
also go for some McDonald's and some Burger

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.530
King's. And now you see that there so many
results that it has chosen to cluster them.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:48.720
So this is a really nice thing to do. And
clustering is like a new hot thing this year.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:56.050
So here, he's using some cluster markers and
say, "All right. So there's 61 results there."

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:04.900
I can zoom in and there the clusters break
out and I can actually see the individual

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:12.809
McDonald's and Taco Bell. So now on my road
trip I'm going to be all set with, you know,

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:17.500
ridiculous junk food that I get to eat. But
it's a very, this is a very good experience

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.400
for the user to actually see things POIs along
the route that they're planning. All right.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.430
Another thing here along the lines of a road
trip, let's say you've got six different places

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.710
you want to hit up and you want to figure
out the best way to head up those places.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.610
So this is a classic problem in computer science
is the traveling-salesman problem, right?

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.500
Now the cool thing is you can actually kind
of solve this in JavaScript. I know it's like

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:40.040
OpenMP, it's really hard and stuff like that.
But if you're going to do less than--assuming

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:46.110
you have less than like 23 places to go to,
it's actually reasonable to solve this in

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:52.990
JavaScript with the help of our directions
API? So let's say I've got these six places

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:58.130
and then I'm going to say, all right, calculate
the fastest roundtrip. It goes and tries a

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.200
couple of things and then finds the correct
results from here. So I'm pretty impressed

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:11.920
by the fact that this is so fast and feasible
purely in the client. And this was written

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:18.080
by a developer which we later hired. So if
you can solve OpenMP things in JavaScript,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:25.300
we'll hire you. Yes. So here we have standard
driving directions and I wanted them to be

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:30.250
printable 'cause people often want to print
their directions. So I'm using the Static

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:36.100
Maps API, which we offered last year. And
really just showing, here's the whole route,

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.390
here's the start, and here's the end. So that's
something else to do with your directions.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:46.020
Let's make them so they work better when printed
or maybe from a mobile device. So the Static

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:51.500
Maps API does support markers and poly lines
and labelings. So for the most part up to

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.770
a certain number of vertices you will able
to do directions in it as well. All right.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.840
So that's directions. So hopefully I've shown
you that there's something different you could

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.370
be doing with the directions on your site.
Or if you don't have directions at all yet,

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:08.500
you should certainly integrate them. So it's
good to actually know how to get places. I

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:15.760
usually just wander around and ask homeless
people but that doesn't work out so well.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.340
So something else that we did this last year
was we came up with the new terms of use.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.270
And some of the parts of the new terms were
happy for people and some parts--other people

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:32.340
didn't like as much but I'll talk about the
happy part. So one thing that we didn't enable

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:38.820
before that we now enable is actually using
the Maps API for desktop applications and

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:45.309
we enable this because we specifically wanted
to encourage people creating AIR Applications.

00:28:45.309 --> 00:28:50.010
Anyone here use developed in AIR? And does
anyone use TweetDeck? Yeah. So that's one

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:59.620
of the more popular AIR apps. But basically
AIR is a plug-in or a run-time that works

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.400
with both Flash and JavaScript and Adobe created
it 'cause they wanted to enable rich Internet

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.150
applications on the desktop, so having the
capabilities of the desktop like clipboard

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.230
and dragging and dropping from the desktop
and doing local storage and offline and all

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.690
that kind of things that you expect from a
desktop application. So we wanted to make

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:24.860
it so that people could create map applications
for the desktop. And I'll show you actually

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:32.960
from my flex folder, one of those. So here's
our ActionScript API and I'm going to use

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:42.520
the clipboard, so I have this little demo
here, which is a map. Oh, I'll just paste

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.250
it in here. So what is does is it takes something
from the clipboard. So let's say that this

00:29:46.250 --> 00:30:00.600
is in my clipboard, San Francisco. I don't
think it really loaded. Let me reload that

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:10.160
one. So I'm actually building it from here
'cause I'm not assigned a publisher so it's

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.750
not available online. All right. So here's
my map. Now I can just control V and what

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.760
that did was it grabbed from the clipboard
and it sent it to the geocoder and then created

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.720
a point where it thought that address was.
There's other demos that, you know, read in

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.080
the CSV from the desktop or update, do a little
Flickr updates and notify you in the panel

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.010
when there's new Flickr photo in the screen
that you're listening to. So that's the kind

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:41.650
of things that you can do with desktop map
applications. All right. So reverse geocoding,

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.410
we just have four geocoding in that demo.
Now we will reverse geocoding. So reverse

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.910
geocoding is an opposite of forward; so instead
of doing from address to latitude/longitude,

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:55.370
you go from latitude/longitude to an address.
Now the thing is you can also go to multiple

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.160
addresses. So usually, when you reverse geocode
there's lots of different things that that

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.530
point might represent. It might represent
a street address. It might represent a state.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:09.190
It might represent a park, a nearby POI. So
the cool thing about reverse geocoding is

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.470
that you can use it for so many different
things. It's not really straightforward as

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.330
normal geocoding. So there's a couple of different
examples here. So we can look at the standard

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:25.309
example, which is just, you know, you click
on the map and here, that's the address of

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:30.860
the things that point us. And you can use
this if you're doing a tool to let people

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.920
create maps, this is a good thing to use because
usually when you're creating a map-making

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.500
tool, you want to give them a couple of options
like one, if they already know the address,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.870
they can enter their address, you geocode
it, maybe let them drag the marker around.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.570
If they don't know the address but they geographically
know where it is on the map, then you give

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:53.090
them a little marker tool and let them click
on the map. So here, this is just reverse

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:58.570
geocoding as I click. So this is great because
I can build up all these addresses just by

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:05.580
clicking on the map. So here's a game that
I created based on the reverse geocoder. So

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.990
what this does is it randomly queries for
a point in the viewport and gets the address

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:15.240
for it and then quizzes you on it. So here
we have South Dakota. I don't really know

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:25.830
anything about America. Oh, I'm doing good.
N.D. Oh, North Dakota. L.A., it's Los Angeles,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:33.980
is it? Nevada, Nevada. Unorganized. There's
a city called unorganized. That's amazing.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:47.480
I feel like they don't have a very good reputation.
Kentucky. I don't remember if there's a timer

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:54.240
on this game. Yeah, yeah, there is, okay.
Missouri, Louisiana, Idaho. Awesome. So this

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:01.040
is cool 'cause I can just generate all these
addresses without, you know, me having to

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.090
build up this database myself. And if I was
going to build it myself, it would not look

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:07.750
like this 'cause I really don't know that
South Dakota is a state. All right. Let's

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.809
see and there's one more--there's also--there's
a cool site and there's a couple sites like

00:33:09.809 --> 00:33:16.500
this called MeetWays. So this is to help you
meet your friends halfway. So actually you'll

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.040
put in the start point and you'll put in their
point and then it will figure out geographically

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.470
what point is in the middle and then it will
reverse geocode that and then find other information

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:33.090
about that place. And here's something cool
is a control that we added to the API after

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.910
we release the reverse geocoder. And what
that does is just puts a little thing at the

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:42.440
top that says what the viewport is that you're
currently looking at. So it's nice 'cause

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.490
you can just go around and kind of learn;
Orange, Morris, New Jersey, Bucks. So it's

00:33:46.490 --> 00:34:01.250
good just to see what kind of random city
names that we have in the world. All right.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.510
So there's something else that you can do
which is becoming more frequent lately is

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.700
actually tell the user where they are when
they're looking at that map. So this is nice

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.750
'cause when you go to a map site, there's
usually some default viewport that that company

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.070
picks or that website picks when you go to
it. And it's really annoying 'cause usually

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.510
you have to go in putting your address and
say, "No, no. This is actually where I am."

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.119
And that takes you extra time every time you
go to the site. Like, when I'm in Australia,

00:34:24.119 --> 00:34:29.169
I go to maps@google.com 'cause I always go
to everything at dot com and it's always showing

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:32.690
me the United States and then I'm like, "It's
hard, why do I want to see United States,

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:36.800
I'm not in United States. Show me where I
am." So unfortunately Google Maps doesn't

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:43.100
do that yet but you guys can all do it for
your applications. So you can use this client

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:52.230
location API and it will just use the IP of
the user to get a rough guess of where that

00:34:52.230 --> 00:35:01.380
user is, so it will tell you the latitude
and the longitude, the city, the state, the

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:08.369
county, and then you can roughly send to the
viewport around that area so that the user

00:35:08.369 --> 00:35:21.940
doesn't have to do as much work to get to
what they're interested in on your site. And

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:37.290
one of my favorite examples of that is a site
that has unfortunately been taken down. I

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.290
don't know why. It's called HookUpMaps and
it was a Craigslist exotic services' Mashups.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:41.880
And it's fantastic because as soon as you
go to it, it would show you everything in

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.130
the local area, right? So you can get--you
got a popsicle? Sorry. So it would show you,

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:42.350
you know, what you need. And the great thing
is when I visited it 'cause I originally used

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.800
this example in China, when I visited in China,
it immediately told me that it had no data

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:49.840
for China 'cause apparently China doesn't
like exotic services. I don't know. And it

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.820
would tell me, "Look, this is where we do
have the data and you can go and choose that

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.990
region and go there." And so this was fantastic
user experience for me 'cause I didn't have

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:01.570
to like keep searching to try and figure out
if there's any data for my region, I knew

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.700
instantly. So it's an amazing site and it
even had little heart icons, because that's

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:11.470
what exotic means. And, what unfortunately
it's down now, so we have to petition to get

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.740
it back up. All right, so do you guys all
like money?

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:22.100
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, me neither, that's fine. So

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.250
some people do, so we'll talk about it anyway.
So one thing that--actually, you know, John

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.820
was--has been asking this last--he ask originally
like two years ago when we launched directions,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.400
like, when are you going to make it easier
to monetize the API and have really good AdSense

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:43.300
for the API? So this year we actually announced
two different new ways of monetizing the API.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.130
So one of them is with the Google bar. So
Google bar is basically a little search box,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.280
you can put on your map, it will turn your
logo into shiny search box and then people

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.570
can search for local businesses, and they
can search for addresses using that. And we

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:02.300
added AdSense to it so that you can go and
actually supply your AdSense publisher ID,

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.930
and when some people do a search, you'll get
a result and then you can get money if they

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:07.609
click on that result. So I'll show you that.
So here, I've searched for [INDISTINCT] in

00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:12.480
San Francisco. Presumably I got tired of Taco
Bell. And you can see there's an ad up there

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:24.310
and I can click on the ad and then the guys
who made this website will make money of off

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:31.780
that. So this is basically AdSense for search.
Now, we just launched something even more

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.320
recently, called the maps ad unit, and John
actually was our trusted tester of this, he

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.609
was the--pretty much the sole trusted tester,
but he's a really good tester, so thank you.

00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:48.540
And, so we'll go and look at it on his site.
You have a 100 percent since they're harder

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:55.020
to see. So what this does, is that it puts
a little ad blank on the map and you can have

00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.070
one or two ads, and it will actually update
that ad block with relevant ads whenever the

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.619
user moves a view port. So we have some magic
secret sauce, whatever, to try and figure

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:08.880
out what the best ads are for a particular
viewport and then we'll update it as it goes

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.070
along. So right now I'm in Los Angeles and
then best ad here Ruth's Chris Steak House,

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:22.250
because everyone knows that's the best steak
in Los Angeles, and anyone going to Los Angeles

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:46.260
would want to go there. So it does a pretty
good job at guessing what will be good, clickable

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:53.850
ads for that view port, and we've seen really
good results with it so far, and hopefully

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.430
you guys try it out and let us know how it
works for you. You hear that, I didn't say

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.650
anything, is that it? So yeah, so there we
go and hopefully next year we'll have more

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:56.850
stats about that. So if you guys have more
questions about monetization of the site and

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.050
about the stuff we just showed, there's actually
office hours for maps monetization going on

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:02.760
right now from one to two. So you can leave
now and go ask if you're just really, really

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.470
curious or just wait 'til after the talk and
you can head to the office hours, I think

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:14.560
they're just way down there and talk to Mike
Pegg from Google Maps Mania. All right. So

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.560
this is something really cool. I haven't talk
about the Flash API much yet, with the Flash

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.580
API something we launch a year ago and it's
actually really cool because there's some

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.290
stuff you can do in Flash that you simply
can't do in JavaScript. So when I talk about

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.400
one of those things that we've been seeing
a lot of in the last few weeks, so this is

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:36.340
re-coloring the tiles and you can do this
in Flash because of how easy it is to apply

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:44.500
transforms to anything in Flash. So here's
this demo here and you can see--I can go and

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:51.380
change this stuff here. I'll make it--no,
it's not very pretty. All right, so here we

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:58.580
go. Now I've got a pink map, this is obviously
really pink. So it's something I should mention

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:04.359
is that you can do this re-coloring but you
do have to send us some email and let us know

00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:08.680
what the re-coloring looks like so we can
approve it. Because we don't actually want

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.010
anyone making maps that are this pink because
it simply a bad experience for the users out

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.500
there, right, and we want to encourage good
user experience. So this pink is bad, right,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.990
but they're definitely some things you can
do that are really good. So let me show you

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:31.760
some of those. So here's an example, this
is a--an interactive slide show of people--900

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:38.690
people in Japan wearing a parka. I don't know,
it's somewhat addictive to watch. But you

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.210
can see the map down there, they've really
kind of desiderated and gave a bit of a blue

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:48.869
tint. So that the things that stand out are--are
the icons and it's a nice visual effect for

00:40:48.869 --> 00:40:56.790
what they're trying to achieve here. So more
practical example is here, this is for routes

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.990
and other things that I can't read of German.
And you see, they've basically, they've grayed

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:06.599
out the tiles behind so that the routes really
stand out on top. And so then I can go and

00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:16.630
plan my little trip here. And I think, personally
I think this looks really, really slick. Yeah,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.580
so those are the ones wanted to show. This
is what the code looks like, you're just creating

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.960
a color matrix filter and then applying that
to the map. And one other example of how you

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.810
can use it is somebody uses it so that when
the map is loading they actually gray out

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:35.750
the map, so that people kind of don't pay
attention to the map because it's a side part

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.960
of their site. And then they only re-color
the map once the map has entirely loaded in.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.900
So that--that was a really nice visual effect
as well. All right, and so now let's talk

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:50.599
about something that we haven't actually release
yet, and that's 3D Flash. So let me just show

00:41:50.599 --> 00:42:01.990
you what this looks like. All right, so here's
a standard map in Flash, right? Now we decided

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:11.590
to see what would happen if we made it 3D,
and then we made a new control, looks about

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:16.340
like Earth. And now, so we can pan and zoom,
so this isn't full 3D with a terrain, right.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.880
But if you want full 3D with a terrain, you
should go to the Earth API and use all their

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.550
fancy shiny things. But this is a--what we
call a 3D perspective, so we can go and add

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:33.930
stuff to it and then we go zoom in here. It's
pretty cool because this stuff actually like

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:39.300
stands up, you can see as I move, and you
can see the shadows lengthening as if they're

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:53.109
in 3D. And we put on a little info window,
here we go. So it's pretty nifty and we managed

00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:57.200
to do this both in Flash 9 and 10. So Flash
ten actually has Native 3D so it wasn't too

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.800
difficult to do it there. Well, too difficult--the
engineer is here and he doesn't really think

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.109
that was the accurate description. But in
Flash nine, we kind of had to create our own

00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:09.840
technique for doing it and you can talk with
Mike if you're curious about the crazy math

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:17.590
that he employed to do that. But for you as
a developer it's really, really easy to use,

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:21.760
all you have to do is say that you want this
perspective view of your map and if you want

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.160
to let them, actually, navigate around, you
can go and add that new 3D navigation control

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.300
to it. And I don't really know how people
are going to use it, we just kind of thought

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.609
it would be a really cool thing, and we'll
put it out there and hopefully you see some

00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:40.599
different uses of it because it's--it's kind
of--it's in between this 2D and this 3D thing,

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:45.410
so there should be some things that it'll
be good for that maybe the Earth is over [INDISTINCT]

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.820
for but the 2D isn't quite good enough for.
So that would be pretty interesting and we're

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.700
going to release it--when Mike?
&gt;&gt; MIKE: I am thinking it would be...

00:43:53.700 --> 00:44:06.590
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, tomorrow? Okay great, thanks.
All right. So that was basically our grab

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.070
bag of things with the GeoAPIs, I mean the
point is, there's a lot of APIs out there,

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.190
and when you're making this slide, I kept
forgetting about other ones that I hadn't

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:18.460
added to it yet. And there's a lot of different
features that this--this APIs have and a lot

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:24.130
of different ways you can use them. And so
hopefully you guys will take a little bit

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:30.450
from this talk and integrate it into your
apps. For those of you that are, are already

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:35.240
Geo developers, we are launching today, I
guess, this developer qualification program.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:42.710
And this is because for a long time there's
been a lot of Geo developers that were really

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:48.750
strongly qualified and we would get request
for developers and say, "Well yeah, you can

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.990
go and post it in the forum." And there's
a couple of people we know. But we had no

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:57.400
formal way of recognizing those qualified
developers and of recommending them and pointing

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.720
people to, you know, like an official list
of qualified developers. So we've done this

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.099
developer qualification program and what you
can do is, you can sign up and get qualified,

00:45:07.099 --> 00:45:14.869
and you prove yourself by doing a test, you
guys, you know, if you miss Uni, university,

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:18.520
you do references, right, so people you've
worked with, you do community persuasions.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.630
So, if you're very active in the forums, your
community persuasion will help you, and, I

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:28.099
think, one other aspect. So using all that
information about you combined, we use that

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:33.340
to decide, "Okay, this person is qualified,
let's badge them and, you know, put them in

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:40.200
our gallery of qualified developers." So for
those of you that are Geo developers and maybe

00:45:40.200 --> 00:46:01.640
our freelancers or somebody that wants to
say, "Hey, I'm available," then
you should get certified, get qualified and

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:34.410
you'll get a badge and you'll get in the gallery,
and then we'll get to recommend you to everyone.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:52.840
And you can get a shirt too or a sticker.
Yey! So that's it and now we have time for

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.460
questions. So if you have questions, you can
come up to the mike.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:05.150
&gt;&gt; MARKS: All right.
&gt;&gt; We're also looking--we have questions on

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:10.650
moderator too, right?
&gt;&gt; FOX: Oh yeah, maybe.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:20.000
&gt;&gt; MARKS: How do we get there?
&gt;&gt; Okay. I've got a question on reverse Geo

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.300
coding.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:31.240
&gt;&gt; What happens to the IP and copyright when
you do the reverse Geo coding?

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.650
&gt;&gt; MARKS: IP and copyrights?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:42.430
&gt;&gt; FOX: Of the data?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the data that you get, you know,

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:54.010
when you put your own data base, what are
the rights and the restrictions are?

00:47:54.010 --> 00:48:01.480
&gt;&gt; FOX: So with our Geo--with both our forward
and our reverse Geo coder, our terms and service

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:12.140
say that the results must eventually be used
with the map. So you can't use a reverse Geo

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:18.160
coder if you're never going to display the
results on the map. So the thing is, when

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:30.460
you display the results in the map, we have
the attribution on the map, so that takes

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.690
care of it.
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Specifically on our Google Map.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:43.099
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, the Google Map, yeah.
&gt;&gt; But are you also allowed to store more

00:48:43.099 --> 00:48:48.070
database and use them in other purposes as
long as you also display them on the map?

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:52.099
&gt;&gt; FOX: For other purposes? That gets a bit
trickier. What other purposes?

00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:56.460
&gt;&gt; Well, that might be historic record of
places that somebody has been used to for

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.849
instance.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Ah.

00:48:58.849 --> 00:49:05.010
&gt;&gt; MARKS: As long as those places will then
be displayed on the map. All right?

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:09.200
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah. So that's been tricky. You can
talk with--Mickey has volunteered himself

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.820
to be spoken to. That's Mickey our--so I should
mention that basically like half our engineering

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:20.800
team is in the audience right now. So Mickey's
right there. He's the product manager. He

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:31.890
loves legal questions, terms of use, his favorite.
He's always like, "Man, we should just talk

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:42.230
about laws up all day."
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Yeah, that's true.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:50.820
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; MARK: He proposed the whole session on

00:49:50.820 --> 00:50:02.900
it but, I mean, we have conference on it.
We turned him down.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:11.320
&gt;&gt; Hi there. I brought my laptop because I
got three questions if that's all right?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.890
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The first one is, the Static Maps API,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:23.430
any news or updates on the idea of having
polyline coding for the static maps?

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:43.400
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, we're working on it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. The second one was that reverse geocoding,

00:50:43.400 --> 00:51:00.180
is that--is there a REST interface for that
or is it all JavaScript?

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:19.240
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yep. It's just the same like a URL
pattern, but you would send a latitude, longitude

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:36.099
into certain address. So we upgraded the geocoding
documentation because it wasn't that clear

00:51:36.099 --> 00:51:54.890
for awhile. So if you look at the documentation
now, you will see a whole... Basically, geocoding

00:51:54.890 --> 00:52:03.820
service is a standalone now, although you
do need to use it with the map. But you see

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:09.820
a section here at reverse geocoding, you can
see the results.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:19.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. The last one was, as far as the ad
monetization you were just talking about,

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:28.380
are there any plans to incorporate standard
IAB advertising sizes, like if you're going

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:39.930
to buy 250 for instance as the best monetized
ad unit that I've ever seen in my site. And

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:47.119
given that it just puts two there right now
I was thinking about, is there a way that

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:57.520
people are going to be able to tag image ads
into that slot that are thrown in by 250 as

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:10.200
opposed to just the two stat text ads?
&gt;&gt; FOX: So right now they're all text stamps.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:23.170
We're not serving up any image ads. And we
did play it. We played around the sizes for

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:34.020
a bit, but we decided to just to go with the
simple one and two for now. I just say with

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:42.619
monetization, it's kind of, we're constantly
experimenting. So we've announced these two

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:53.530
things but we're--we keep experimenting with
other things as well, stuff like size and

00:53:53.530 --> 00:54:01.380
different types of ads. I don't really see
us doing image ads any time soon, probably.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.160
You'll never know. So monetization in maps,
it's a really interesting problem to figuring

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.810
out like what somebody looking at the map
is actually there for, right, because everyone

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:14.619
using the map is there for different reasons.
So, we're always experimenting, and we'll--I'm

00:54:14.619 --> 00:54:18.119
sure we'll keep the map with different options
for you.

00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:25.250
&gt;&gt; MARKS: We're also trying to keep--I'm sorry.
We're also trying to keep in mind both, you

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.550
know, the publisher's needs but also the user
experience. So, if we're serving image ads

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:45.609
on the map, it might block part of the map,
and that's a bad user experience. So there's

00:54:45.609 --> 00:54:55.839
a lot of fun. We're going to it. John, were
you about to say something? If you want to

00:54:55.839 --> 00:55:08.349
say it at the mike so that...
&gt;&gt; Just a comment about the [INDISTINCT]

00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:12.230
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yes.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:22.060
&gt;&gt; FOX: So that's something to experiment
with, is like how can we do similar ads but

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.960
maybe not be as intrusive for some users.
That's something we keep working on.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.460
&gt;&gt; I work on a close environment while using
the Enterprise server, the [INDISTINCT] Enterprise

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:36.349
server. My impression right now is that Google
Maps API that's involve for the, you know,

00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:39.720
Enterprise servers are not as robust as for
the public Google Maps. Can you comment on

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.070
this and can you offer suggestions, because
we want to go to the vast applications, but,

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.390
you know, we can't use your public services
at this point?

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:47.810
&gt;&gt; MARKS: All right, the Enterprise server,
the development on that moves are on a little

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:57.190
bit more slowly because it's hard to deploy,
to redeploy changes as things are going. We

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.300
have to be really careful because it's, you
know, the server itself is a downloadable

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.599
application. We are going to have some Enterprise
people around at the conference. They might

00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:09.599
be talking--do you know about that?
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah. So with the... Oh, Tory. Hi,

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:13.160
Tory.
&gt;&gt; MARKS: Oh, Tory. Sorry, I didn't see you.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.839
&gt;&gt; FOX: Tory is the enterprise version of
me.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:20.500
&gt;&gt; MARX: Yeah, so, go talk to Tory.
&gt;&gt; So, when someone searches for like a large

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.230
region on Google Maps, it knows where to zoom
it to. Like, if you typed in "Russia," it

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:26.970
would, like, show the whole of Russia.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:38.859
&gt;&gt; But I didn't see a way that you can actually
get the bounding box on a region in the public

00:56:38.859 --> 00:56:44.089
API. Is there any way that you can get that
information?

00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:49.270
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yep. So, apparently, we--yeah, so
that's not in the docs. So, a few months ago

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.589
or six months ago, we started adding bounds
information to the Geo [INDISTINCT] applet,

00:56:53.589 --> 00:57:00.839
and that's the recommended view port grounds.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's just in the applet when you deal

00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:04.849
with that?
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, it is. I don't know if it's

00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:06.869
in the darks. It's in the extended data for
the [INDISTINCT] applet extended.

00:57:06.869 --> 00:57:12.000
&gt;&gt; And you get that with the JavaScript API?
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yep, you can. Just use the, because

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.130
there's one function that gives you the full
JSON, so just do the function and it gives

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:21.200
you the full JSON, and then you can parse
out the bounds from that JSON.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.
&gt;&gt; MARX: And if you're using a [INDISTINCT]

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.060
network blank on maps or it can send back
the bounding box to the server, and then you

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:36.490
can decide what to return.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was curious what you thought, you

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.950
might think of an HTML 6 element for maps.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we just had work camp, and that

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:44.599
was one of the things we discussed at work
camp was there's a video element in HTML 5.

00:57:44.599 --> 00:57:48.310
Why isn't there a map element? I think that's
a really good idea. And I actually couldn't--no,

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.750
here's the problem. There already is a map
element in HTML, image maps, so we're going

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.470
to have to come up... I was thinking we could
call it like Geomap or real map or something

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.030
like that. So I think that's a great idea
that it doesn't technically affect us. It

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.650
would probably mean--if there was a map element
in HTML, I would imagine that would mean each

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:02.390
browser would implement it themselves, each
browser would probably pick a provider or,

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:03.980
you know, maybe use the open data. And then
for--so that would be for people who wanted

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.030
really, really simple maps. I think it's a
great idea there, right? You say like maps,

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.720
center, equals this, equals this. Yeah?
&gt;&gt; But, you know, like could we--the image

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.839
element allows you to put your image into
it or, you know, whatever you decide, a video

00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:15.130
element, same--same idea I guess. Right? So
maybe a map could have Google on the one hand,

00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:16.180
and my OGC server on the other.
&gt;&gt; MARX: The model with the video element

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.050
is that you link to a particular video and
then the browser decides what application,

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:24.690
what plug-in to use to display it.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, so you could--you could visibly

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:31.180
have a map element or do a KML file. I could
see that. I don't know that it would go, because

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:43.030
I mean HTML target is the simplest case, so
I don't if that would go as far as like enabling

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.890
custom map types. So, I think that--so it
would be really I think cool for developers

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:53.900
if there's was an HTML 5 map element. But
I think that we'll always need the Maps APIs

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.770
in order to really do the full power.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, absolutely. But, you know, you

00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:58.950
can see something simple like, because HTML
is kind of meant to be simple for people to

00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:59.020
just, like, cut and paste something.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Right. So there is WHATWG mailing

00:58:59.020 --> 00:58:59.089
list, it accepts suggestions, and I think
we should email the suggestions to them.

00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.160
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Speak it out, make it happen.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.970
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in doing something that
currently I think is not allowed by the license

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:03.040
agreement, which is to print maps onto thin
slices of dead trees, meaning, paper. People

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.950
here may not use that anymore, but I was sending
out invoices, and what I wanted to do was

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.490
create an invoice for a customer and on the
flipside have a map centered on their locations,

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:13.089
showing our locations nearby. In this case,
it was for a car-sharing application. And

00:59:13.089 --> 00:59:17.040
that's not allowed right now, printing. Can
you comment on whether that will be?

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.079
&gt;&gt; So, we came out with this set of printing
permissions guidelines, which applies generally

00:59:17.079 --> 00:59:18.050
to all of our Geo products, because people
ask a lot of screenshots and stuff. So this

00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:19.560
maybe came out last year. And so printing
has actually, there's--it's gone a bit more

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.130
relaxed. So you can read through the rules.
But one of the basic ones is that if you're

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:20.530
doing less than 5000 copies that a screenshot
of the maps is okay. So that's a very simple

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:20.630
version of the rule. But if you look through
the guidelines, I think you'll see it's a

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.710
bit more permissive now.
&gt;&gt; If I wanted to do more than a screenshot,

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.800
meaning, a slightly high resolution version
for print, what would I do in terms of using

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:20.869
the API to get more bits for my high resolution
printer?

00:59:20.869 --> 00:59:20.980
&gt;&gt; FOX: So right now the APIs are all designed
for the web. So, you'll see that the outfits

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.460
we have are JPEG, PNG, GIF, and they're all
resolutions designed for the web. So we have

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.680
not optimized the APIs to be printable. And
it's certainly a feature request that we could

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.060
consider as offering high resolution. But
I don't think it would be our immediate thing

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:25.380
that we want to do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's the kind of thing that I would

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:25.650
be willing to pay some per thin slice of dead
tree for.

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:25.890
&gt;&gt; FOX: Okay. That's a good idea. Maybe we'll
charge you for it.

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:26.050
&gt;&gt; MARX: Some people use static maps because
there you--because there are images there

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:26.190
that tend to be...
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah. It's just the resolution.

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.339
&gt;&gt; MARX: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. Well, what I've done is I've

00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:28.320
tiled them up in, you know, larger sizes than
they should be and then squash them back down.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.530
And that works, but it's really a hack.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Sshh.

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:30.079
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I'll be happy to pay for that.
Did you get that part?

00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:30.119
&gt;&gt; MARX: Sorry, I didn't.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, yeah. You know, that's good.

00:59:30.119 --> 00:59:30.150
That's a really great idea. We'll totally
charge you for it.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.210
&gt;&gt; MARX: You can pay me. Just see me afterwards.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Five dollars. I'll give you 500 DPI.

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:30.250
One dollar for a hundred.
&gt;&gt; MARX: Okay, and we got time for a couple

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:30.280
more question.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Oh, there is [INDISTINCT] question.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:30.320
Oh, so there are... Okay. So, will there be
a mobile version of your client APIs, Blackberries

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:30.359
[INDISTINCT], et cetera? So, with mobile,
there is--for iPhone, there is a framer called

00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:30.780
Mapkit, so you can do Google Maps in your
native maps. For Android, there is an API

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.060
called MapView. So, you can embed that in
your apps. For the other ones, there's nothing

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:31.349
in particular. Our current story is to use
the Static Maps APIs since that's like kind

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:32.430
of the lowest common denominator in a browser
control windows. But there is an entire session

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.470
tomorrow about Maps API and mobile. And you
never know what they might talk about there,

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.940
so you should probably get out. And the other
question was, "Any plans to integrate zip

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.510
plus 4 data into Google Maps? Yahoo has done
it. Well, so should probably do everything

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.540
that Yahoo does because they're...
&gt;&gt; MARX: [INDISTINCT] Sorry. Are these on?

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:33.570
Are these on?
&gt;&gt; FOX: I think we've looked at it, but I

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:33.599
don't think we have any immediate plans for
that, no.

00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:33.630
&gt;&gt; One thing about Zip [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; FOX: That's true. Yes, so you answered

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.660
the question, because somebody asked about
that earlier. So, yeah, I guess there probably

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:33.700
isn't a great source of data for that right
now that's really complete. And I don't know

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:33.740
how many people know there's a plus 4. I don't
know mine. If it doesn't help me, then we

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:33.760
don't do it.
&gt;&gt; MARX: You're looking [INDISTINCT].

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:33.790
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; FOX: Three hundred changes per month.

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:33.829
&gt;&gt; MARX: Okay. I think we have officially
run out of time. If you want, we will be in--you

00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.869
can come up and ask us questions during the
transition. And also I'll be hanging out in

00:59:33.869 --> 00:59:34.480
the office hours much of the day. There are
other talks. So, thanks a lot, everybody.
