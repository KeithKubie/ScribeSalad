00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Fernando has a question about the DH key distribution.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He thinks the sets A and B should have primes less than p. Is that true?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In Diffie-Hellman we have the exponents a and b that are picked.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They don't have to be related to p other than if p is very small there is no point picking

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
really large values for a and b.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If p is really big, it's silly to pick small values of a.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The exponents are usually recommended to be at least 256 bits.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's because there is an attacker where the work is related to the square root

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of the size of the exponent rather than to the actual exponent.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If you want 128 bits of security, you need a 256-bit value.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You need to select a as a random value up to 256 bits.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That means if p is too small your attacker will go after p instead of focusing the attacker on a.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There is no particular relationship between the size of a and the size of p.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
He also asks another question about Diffie-Hellman.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He wonders why in practice it is less accepted than RSA.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is a good question.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
They're both actually widely used in practice.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
RSA is more widely used and more talked about.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They do different things. It's not a question of one being thought of as being more secure than the other.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The security of both depends on quite similar problems--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Diffie-Hellman depending on the discrete log problem,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
RSA depending on factoring.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There is no reason to believe one of those is easier or harder than the other.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The property that Diffie-Hellman gives you is just this key agreement property.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
RSA can do more things like digital signatures and encrypting messages.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's a more versatile cipher. You can do more things with RSA.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
All you can do with Diffie-Hellman is agree on a key,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but there are ciphers built on top of the same ideas that Diffie-Hellman

00:01:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that can provide the same properties as RSA.
