00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.010
Our economic system in its current form is
simply not advanced enough to comprehend the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.370
consequences of its own actions. It is like
a blind giant lumbering from continent to

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.520
continent leaving incalculable ruin in its
wake. I propose that we give this giant a

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.070
set of eyes so that it might tread more gently,
and maybe some day even look upon itself.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt;The lead of today will be judge not only
by how well we change our industries, but

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.840
also how well we lead our companies to make
positive influence on the world.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.770
&gt;&gt;When choosing a leader, you choose a lead
who to show a good example to the others.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.079
&gt;&gt;The way in which we are growing things,
the way in which we are making products, providing

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.469
services, is having an unexpected and disastrous
impact on the planet that we live on.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.679
&gt;&gt;You need to change in attitudes and new
institutions to set the right incentives so

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.639
that water use becomes more efficient across
the world.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:17.450
&gt;&gt;Everybody who takes action actually has
an effect on at least somebody. And obviously

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.439
the more powerful you are, the more influential
you are, the bigger the impact there can be

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.439
across the world.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.240
&gt;&gt;It's not just in working together. It's
new ideas. It's creating new concepts. And

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.340
it's happening while we speak. It will challenge
the way we think. It will challenge the way

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520
we work. And it will challenge the way we
work with others.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.259
&gt;&gt;There needs to be a more equal division
between the company owner and the employee.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.630
&gt;&gt;Just take all responsibility for your actions
and your inactions, and leave a nice legacy

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.829
for out children and our grandchildren.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:00.450
&gt;&gt;Extend hands and over come obstacles to
make open trades and exchange of ideas, and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.009
exchange of cultures, and exchange of people
easier. And with that we will have certainly

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.310
make the planet a better place.
