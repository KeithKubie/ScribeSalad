00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600
dynamic features we've identified two
 

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.680
dynamic features we've identified two
broad categories the first category is

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:39.690
broad categories the first category is
 

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.289
broad categories the first category is
what we call distinct features these

00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299
what we call distinct features these
 

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:44.239
what we call distinct features these
features are logically separate from the

features are logically separate from the
 

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:47.359
features are logically separate from the
main flow of your app for example in the

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:47.369
main flow of your app for example in the
 

00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:48.950

candidate for a dynamic feature the

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.450
candidate for a dynamic feature the
 

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.970
candidate for a dynamic feature the
second category is what we call

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980
second category is what we call
 

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.789
second category is what we call
interrupting features those features pop

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799
interrupting features those features pop
 

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.970
interrupting features those features pop
up during a normal user flow in your app

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:06.980
up during a normal user flow in your app
 

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.830

additional filters during the editing
process this is what we call an

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:15.779
process this is what we call an
 

00:25:15.779 --> 00:25:17.690
process this is what we call an
interrupting feature and for those

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700
interrupting feature and for those
 

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.090
interrupting feature and for those
features it is typically better to use

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100

about Android app bundle we talked about
 

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.220
about Android app bundle we talked about
in synapse and now you're worried that

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.230
in synapse and now you're worried that
 

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.110
in synapse and now you're worried that
you're gonna have double the work you're

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120
you're gonna have double the work you're
 

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.580
you're gonna have double the work you're
gonna go home and have to work on both

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:38.590
gonna go home and have to work on both
 

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.320
gonna go home and have to work on both
things or you're gonna have to choose

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:40.330
things or you're gonna have to choose
 

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.390

Android app bundle so what I'm gonna do

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:50.230
Android app bundle so what I'm gonna do
 

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.560
Android app bundle so what I'm gonna do
is take you from an Android app bundle

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:52.570
is take you from an Android app bundle
 

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.500
is take you from an Android app bundle
and migrate it to an instant enabled

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:55.510
and migrate it to an instant enabled
 

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.900
and migrate it to an instant enabled
Android app bundle and then I'm also

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:57.910
Android app bundle and then I'm also
 

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.980
Android app bundle and then I'm also
going to start with it

00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:58.990
going to start with it
 

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.510
going to start with it
and show you how you get to the Android

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:00.520
and show you how you get to the Android
 

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.210
and show you how you get to the Android
app bundle all right so Kobe came up

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:06.220
app bundle all right so Kobe came up
 

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.560
app bundle all right so Kobe came up
here and said you take your apk and you

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:07.570
here and said you take your apk and you
 

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.990
here and said you take your apk and you
get to an Android app bundle and then he

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000
get to an Android app bundle and then he
 

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.220
get to an Android app bundle and then he
also mentioned that you're gonna start

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.230
also mentioned that you're gonna start
 

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.500
also mentioned that you're gonna start
carving out code and start modularizing

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:13.510
carving out code and start modularizing
 

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.480
carving out code and start modularizing
your app so as you go through this

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:15.490
your app so as you go through this
 

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.090
your app so as you go through this
process you might notice that one of

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.100
process you might notice that one of
 

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.950
process you might notice that one of
your features makes a great entry point

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960
your features makes a great entry point
 

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.780
your features makes a great entry point
and you would love that your users

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:21.790
and you would love that your users
 

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.210
and you would love that your users
actually instantly jump into your app

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:24.220
actually instantly jump into your app
 

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.060
actually instantly jump into your app
that way so if your base module and your

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:27.070
that way so if your base module and your
 

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.940
that way so if your base module and your
dynamic feature module are small enough

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:28.950
dynamic feature module are small enough
 

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.330
dynamic feature module are small enough
you can just make those instant enabled

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340
you can just make those instant enabled
 

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:36.810
you can just make those instant enabled
and for all that code that is your

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:36.820
and for all that code that is your
 

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.310
and for all that code that is your
installed app that you're not ready to

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320
installed app that you're not ready to
 

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.900
installed app that you're not ready to
have part of your instant app you're

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:39.910
have part of your instant app you're
 

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.400
have part of your instant app you're
gonna wrap that as a dynamic feature

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.410
gonna wrap that as a dynamic feature
 

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.140
gonna wrap that as a dynamic feature
module and you're just gonna make it

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:43.150
module and you're just gonna make it
 

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.350
module and you're just gonna make it
available at install time and there you

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360
available at install time and there you
 

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.690
available at install time and there you
have it one binary that is both an

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:48.700
have it one binary that is both an
 

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.780
have it one binary that is both an
instant app and an install valve now

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:51.790
instant app and an install valve now
 

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.790
instant app and an install valve now
let's see what this looks like if you're

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:53.800
let's see what this looks like if you're
 

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.070
let's see what this looks like if you're
one of the instant app developers then I

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080
one of the instant app developers then I
 

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.960
one of the instant app developers then I
see in the audience today so you

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:57.970
see in the audience today so you
 

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.130
see in the audience today so you
probably have something that looks like

00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.140
probably have something that looks like
 

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.430
probably have something that looks like
this you have a zip file it has both a

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440
this you have a zip file it has both a
 

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.070
this you have a zip file it has both a
base feature module potentially another

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080
base feature module potentially another
 

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.129
base feature module potentially another
feature module and you're going to take

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:08.139
feature module and you're going to take
 

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.510
feature module and you're going to take
and you did all this hard work to

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520
and you did all this hard work to
 

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.419
and you did all this hard work to
decrease the binary to modularize

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:11.429
decrease the binary to modularize
 

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.530
decrease the binary to modularize
network is not wasted you're just going

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:13.540
network is not wasted you're just going
 

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.510
network is not wasted you're just going
to take that same code and you're just

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520
to take that same code and you're just
 

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.580
to take that same code and you're just
going to make it part of the Android app

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:17.590
going to make it part of the Android app
 

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.389
going to make it part of the Android app
bundle and for all that code that's in

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399
bundle and for all that code that's in
 

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:22.859
bundle and for all that code that's in
your installed app that's not in your

00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:22.869
your installed app that's not in your
 

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:24.659
your installed app that's not in your
instant app again you're gonna wrap it

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:24.669
instant app again you're gonna wrap it
 

00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:26.760
instant app again you're gonna wrap it
as a dynamic feature module and just

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:26.770
as a dynamic feature module and just
 

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.020
as a dynamic feature module and just
make sure it's available and install

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.030
make sure it's available and install
 

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.649
make sure it's available and install
time there you are again you have one

00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:31.659
time there you are again you have one
 

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:33.300
time there you are again you have one
binary that's both an instant app and

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:33.310
