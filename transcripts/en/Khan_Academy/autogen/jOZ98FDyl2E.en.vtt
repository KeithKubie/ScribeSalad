00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:01.843
 Let's get some experience in comparing 

00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:03.862
 and the calculation of ratios. 

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:06.997
 It is said that in one pet shop there are three aquariums, 

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:09.667
 each containing a different volume of water 

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.735
 and a different number of fish. 

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:16.495
 So, Aquarium A has 5 fish and contains 40 liters of water, 

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.791
 aquarium B - 12 fish and 100 liters of water, 

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.914
 and an aquarium C - 23 fish and contains 180 liters of water. 

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.035
 Sort the aquariums according to the volume of water per 1 number of fish 

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.033
 from the smallest to the largest. 

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:33.537
 Let us think of what a volume of fish means, 

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:36.834
 as we can see it as the volume divided into fish. 

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.901
 Volume of one fish count. 

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.897
 Okay, here for Aquarium A 

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:45.031
 we will have 40 liters 

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:46.935
 for all 5 fish. 

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.558
 40 for all 5 fish and see, 

00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:52.458
 40 on 5 is 8, 

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.818
 so you got 8 liters of water for each fish. 

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.638
 This is the rate at which water should be added to each fish 

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.247
 for aquarium A. 

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:05.146
 In aquarium B you have 100 liters 

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:08.166
 for 12 fish, 

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.574
 so how much will it be? 

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:12.964
 This will be, 12 is contained in 100 eight times, 

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:16.748
 8 at 12 is 96 and then you stay 4. 

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:20.393
 We will have 8 and 4/12 

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:25.385
 or 8 and 1/3 liters of fish. 

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.846
 I just turned this irregular liver, 

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:31.679
 100 on 12, in mixed number and simplified it. 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.442
 12 is contained in 100 eight times with residue 4, 

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:35.812
 so we have 8 and 4/12, 

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.109
 which is the same as 8 and 1/3. 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.618
 And finally in the C aquarium 

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.892
 I have 180 liters 

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:47.482
 for 23 fish. 

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:48.546
 How much will it be? 

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:52.875
 23 is contained in 180 - let me try to calculate it. 

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:57.286
 23 is contained in 180 - it seems it will 

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:58.378
 be less than 9 times. 

00:01:58.378 --> 00:01:59.817
 Eight times? 

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:01.628
 8, no, it's not eight times. 

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:03.230
 Let's see, 7 times. 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.085
 7 in 3 is 21, 7 in 2 is 14, 

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.592
 plus 2 is 16. 

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:12.216
 When you pull out, you get a 19. 

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.119
 So this will be 7 with a remainder of 19 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.818
 or you can say it is 7 

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:21.188
 and 19/23 liters 

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:22.898
 of a fish. 

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:24.291
 So which one of them ... 

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.751
 We will arrange the aquariums by volume of a number of fish, 

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.377
 from the smallest to the largest. 

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.511
 Aquarium B has the largest volume of water for fish, 

00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.460
 there are 8 and 1/3 liters of a fish, 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.295
 so he's first. 

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.687
 Then Aquarium A is second. 

00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:40.753
 Aquarium A is second. 

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:45.188
 And then Aquarium C is in third place. 

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.250
 Oh, we really want to sort them from the smallest to the biggest, 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.268
 so it will be - let me write it this way. 

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.678
 Aquarium C is the smallest, 

00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:55.628
 but tank A has the largest volume. 

00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:57.749
 In fact, we need to reverse this order. 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.305
 I just copied this 

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:00.513
 from an exercise by the Cannes Academy. 

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.020
 Let's open up the actual exercise 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.436
 and we can arrange them. 

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:06.154
 C was the smallest, 

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:09.804
 and B was the largest, 

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:11.564
 we check our answer and we get it right.
