00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:03.877
- Hi, this is Sal Khan
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:05.562
and I just wanted to let all of you know

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:08.307
about a really exciting
challenge that's going on.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.895
It applies to any student
that is between the ages

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:14.547
of 13 and 18 years old,
anywhere in the world.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.671
And so if you're one of them,

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.525
you should definitely listen to this.

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.621
But, if you know anyone
between the ages of 13 and 18,

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.066
this could be life-changing for them,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.385
so you should also listen
and then tell them about it.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:25.718
So, what I'm talking about is the

00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:27.168
Breakthrough Junior Challenge,

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:28.266
and you can learn more about it at

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.496
BreakthroughJuniorChallenge.org

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:33.338
But, it's a partnership that we have

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:34.518
with the Breakthrough Prize.

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:36.277
The Breakthrough Prize
is, essentially like

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:40.061
a new Nobel prize for
people making breakthroughs

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:43.896
in Math, Science, major
contributions to humanity.

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:47.121
And, as part of this, the
Breakthrough Junior Challenge

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.040
is all about young people
between the ages of 13 and 18

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.255
creating videos that explain
something about the universe

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.204
that we didn't, either we
didn't appreciate before

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:00.348
or know before, or
something that we did know

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:02.333
but explaining it in a pretty cool,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.140
profound, approachable, maybe funny way.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.723
And, this is a really big deal.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.670
The winner of this prize is going to get

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.587
a $250,000 scholarship.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.605
Yes, that is four zeros after the 25.

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:22.659
$250,000 scholarship, so it'll pretty much

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.393
pay for any college out there.

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:27.612
The winner of last year's
prize, Ryan Chester,

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:31.779
he is now able to go to college
on this $250,000 scholarship

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.302
and he got into Harvard,
and I could imagine

00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:39.469
that winning this prize was a
good part of his application.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.561
But, that's not where it ends.

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:46.215
There's going to be a
$100,000 lab for your school,

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:49.763
a $100,000 science lab, and
$50,000 for your teacher.

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:53.659
So, all in, we're talking
about $400,000 for a video

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.661
that's going to be five minutes or less

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.914
that explains something
in an interesting way.

00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:01.083
And, I really want to point
out, this doesn't have to be

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:04.241
something with fancy
special effects or graphics,

00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:06.282
you could look at some of
the finalists from last year,

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:08.232
look at Ryan Chester's videos,

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:12.969
we really care about how it's
explained, and the content.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.325
It could be a video, like a
Khan Academy style of video,

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.545
or it could be just a
background and some writing

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:22.488
with maybe a few visuals, it
could be you at a chalkboard,

00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:24.406
or it could be a little bit more produced,

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:26.483
it could be some live
action, whatever else.

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:29.750
But, the key is, is it explains
something in Math or Science

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.873
in a novel way, in an interesting way.

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:35.719
And, someone out there
listening is going to win this.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.809
And it's going to be
a life-changing event,

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.956
and more than just the
money and the opportunities

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:41.611
that are going to open up,

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.674
it's really the chance to help the world.

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:45.845
Cause the whole reason
why this prize exists,

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.373
is because we think that young people

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:50.352
can look at the world in a different way,

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:53.068
in a way that maybe people
who have been in a field

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:55.568
for a long time, won't see it.

00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:58.381
And, by looking at it in a different way

00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:02.000
and explaining concepts, it'll
open up all of our minds,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.613
and potentially even
move the field forward.

00:03:05.613 --> 00:03:08.321
And, above and beyond
that, outside of the money,

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.315
outside of helping the world,
which is a really big deal,

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:13.756
the winners of the prize are going

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.731
to come to Silicon Valley,

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.630
come out here for the
Breakthrough Prize ceremony.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.144
They're gonna get their
prize on-stage alongside

00:03:23.144 --> 00:03:25.018
leaders in their field,

00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:26.705
it's going to be nationally televised,

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.792
there's all sorts of celebrities
from the Silicon Valley,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.405
and Hollywood that are going to be there.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.112
You should look at some of
the videos from previous

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.181
Breakthrough prizes,
it's really a big deal.

00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.086
I bought a tuxedo just for this event.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.256
So, you could imagine, I don't
own a lot of formal wear.

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:44.613
So, once again, if you're interested

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:45.956
and you really should be,

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:47.320
because it's not about production value,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.148
it's about ideas, creativity, humor,

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.483
and you're between ages 13 and 18,

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.192
the deadline is October 10th.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:56.136
So, it's about three weeks

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:58.017
from when I'm making this video right now,

00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:00.401
go to BreakthroughJuniorChallenge.org,

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.057
I think you'd be surprised,

00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:05.057
this could be life-changing for you.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.448
And, remember, five
minutes max for the video.
