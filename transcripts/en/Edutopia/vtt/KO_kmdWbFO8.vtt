00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:01.416
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: You ready?

00:00:02.316 --> 00:00:02.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:07.516
[drum playing]

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.000
[students clapping]

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:12.636
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Jets!

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:14.056
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Was
that our best one?

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:14.266
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Yes!

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:14.496
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Really?

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.026
Okay, I thought it
was pretty good.

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:17.976
Seven easy steps.

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.106
Step by step goes
the marching band.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:22.886
Dang it, I keep putting
that down.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:23.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Here.

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:24.086
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Here.

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.556
Step one, you already know it.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.056
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Write
what you know.

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:28.896
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn:
Write what you know.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.786
The student body
definitely is low income.

00:00:32.146 --> 00:00:34.096
Ninety five percent of
the students here qualify

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:35.126
for free or reduced lunch.

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.436
They represent what the
world is really like,

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.476
the diversity of the world.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.376
Not only the world, but
the future of the world.

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.396
The world is mixing together.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.546
&gt;&gt;Carl Munn: What do we
do with the variable?

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:44.696
&gt;&gt;Students: [inaudible]

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:47.266
&gt;&gt;Carl Munn: So is this
gonna be x squared?

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:47.766
&gt;&gt;Everybody: No.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:48.276
&gt;&gt;Carl Munn: No.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.926
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: I got involved
in this school a few years ago

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.426
because I noticed some
really powerful instruction

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:54.776
that was happening
in the algebra class.

00:00:54.776 --> 00:00:56.176
&gt;&gt;Carl Munn: This
is where students,

00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:00.216
they either get this stuff
right now and they get confident

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.586
with it, or they
don't really spend--

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:04.306
take the time to get
really good at this,

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:05.776
and then they don't like math.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:06.956
They get frustrated.

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:07.976
They stop coming to school.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:08.716
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Yeah,

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:10.626
I basically copied
everything Mr. Munn does

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:13.136
from his curriculum planning
to his instructional strategies

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.426
and infuse some of my own
things and took some things

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.556
from a number of other great
teachers that I had encountered

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.336
and observed, and
I'm just using them.

00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:20.436
They're just things that work.

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:22.126
&gt;&gt;Carl Munn: We're gonna
spend a lotta time with this

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.626
and make sure that everyone
really gets this before you...

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.986
&gt;&gt;You know, what used to happen
here was my kids would get a

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.006
pretty experience in my
class and then they'd move

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.806
on to the next coupla
classes and it just--

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.996
it was like they just went
right back off the cliff.

00:01:35.296 --> 00:01:37.206
&gt;&gt;Perfect, perfect, perfect.

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:40.296
&gt;&gt;And having John here now, it's
like I know, once they're done

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:41.936
in this room, you know,
they're going to end

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:44.316
up in his intermediate
and pre cal class.

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.256
And we have this now
Capstone calculus course

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.736
which is just generating
so much excitement,

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:51.166
and it's the most popular class.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.266
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: It's
a big old fraction.

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.876
Okay, so you're gonna
start with a quotient--

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:59.436
&gt;&gt;What you see up here on
the stage is just a mix

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:02.346
of techniques, all
proven techniques.

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:04.856
&gt;&gt;How's that one go?

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:05.046
&gt;&gt;Everybody: [inaudible].

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:07.076
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: No, no, no, no.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:09.616
&gt;&gt;I want them yelling things
out loud and I wanna go outside

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:11.296
and hear it, so that other
people on campus can hear it,

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:13.486
just get it shaken
up a little bit.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:19.456
&gt;&gt;How's that one go

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:20.216
&gt;&gt;Everybody: [inaudible].

00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:20.606
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Thank you.

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:24.446
&gt;&gt;When it comes to specific
techniques to meet the needs

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.696
of let's say English learners,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.046
there's some specific
things that, you know,

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:29.986
color coordination,
that type of thing.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.706
&gt;&gt;First is F. Oh, wrong color.

00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:33.736
F doesn't change.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.966
&gt;&gt;There's this girl, Sokna
and she said to me 'Mr. Winn,

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:40.206
I don't understand anything
you're saying in class,

00:02:40.206 --> 00:02:41.856
but I watch what's
going on on the board,

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:43.626
and that's how I learn it.'

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:44.486
And she's a top student.

00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:45.786
&gt;&gt;So now we know what it is.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:47.696
Now let's make sure
we can use it.

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:50.996
&gt;&gt;Sokna: Mr. Winn, he is easy
for me to understand what he try

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:56.066
to tell, but actually, I didn't
really pay attention to him,

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.836
but I just look at how
he did on the problem

00:02:58.836 --> 00:03:04.606
and then I just copy it and then
I try to do it and I get right.

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:06.826
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: It's kind of
like a little calculus jingle,

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.976
low di high minus high
di low, all over low low.

00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:14.686
&gt;&gt;The stuff that we do in
here, whether it's a skit,

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:15.856
whether it's a marching
band problem,

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:17.776
whether it's some kinda
interactive thing or hands

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:20.376
on thing, it may or
may not help that much

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:23.476
with understanding the topic,
but I think it makes class fun.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:24.846
&gt;&gt;Woman: Gottfried.

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:29.726
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,
where are you, son?

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:30.596
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: All over H.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.156
&gt;&gt;I saw this little
thing about Leibniz

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.036
in 1675 on vacation in Paris.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:37.166
I thought it was hilarious that
he was doing calculus in Paris,

00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:41.976
on vacation, which is, strangely
enough, I've done that plenty

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:44.056
of times on vacation,
doing calculus.

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:47.066
And so I called Becky
up, say, 'You got a wig?

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:48.486
You got a puffy shirt?

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:48.956
Let's do this.'

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:51.476
&gt;&gt;Woman: You, ever since your
father died when you were six,

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.836
you doing the things with
the numbers all the time

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.176
on the pieces of paper.

00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:59.896
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Oh
mother, be quiet.

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:00.416
&gt;&gt;Woman: Oh, please, please--

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:01.976
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: For a
student to come to a class

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.766
and to always feel
like something

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:04.606
like that could happen.

00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:05.606
I feel like that's
the type of thing

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.626
that may encourage a
student to sort of be

00:04:07.626 --> 00:04:08.276
on the edge of their seat.

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:09.466
And that's how I want them.

00:04:10.026 --> 00:04:12.366
I want them, the second
they walk in, ready to go.

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:14.486
On the edge of their
seat the whole time.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.886
Bell rings, that's
when you stop working.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:19.476
&gt;&gt;When a group of people,
100 people out there, you,

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.916
are all doing something, it
doesn't even matter what,

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:23.176
but if we're doing
it at the same time,

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.946
like reading off low di high
minus high di low over low, low,

00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:29.676
saying that together is a way
to practice our strengths.

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.896
&gt;&gt;Erica: My definition
of a teacher is just,

00:04:33.846 --> 00:04:36.036
teaching the lesson
and making sure

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:39.286
that your students understand
the materials that are taught.

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:43.296
But sometime he stayed here with
us until seven or eight o'clock

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:47.386
at night, doing math, and I
think that's an amazing thing.

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:51.786
[drum playing] [students
clapping]

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:52.926
&gt;&gt;Everybody: Crawford!

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:55.966
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Nice.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:01.606
&gt;&gt;In a lotta ways, I use the
ocean as kinda like a way

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:03.856
to like just wash off
the day, you know,

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:05.556
like wash off the costume.

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:06.516
I take off my tie.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:07.936
You know, I'm taking
off the hat.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.866
Mr. Winn hat is being
hung up for the day.

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:11.306
Put that costume
in the closet and,

00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:13.566
you know, it's back to John.

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:15.616
And so for me, it's
really important

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:19.446
to have some little ritual
that gets performed at the end

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:20.446
of every professional day.

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.386
Being out in the water tends to
be a really important experience

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.286
for me on a regular basis.

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:30.706
Being on the edge of that wave,
being on the edge of, you know,

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:32.326
potentially falling off
and getting crunched--

00:05:32.326 --> 00:05:35.076
and I've been out there where
I've taken a bad fall and being

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:37.746
in a really tough situation,
underwater and having

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.806
to basically figure it out in
that moment, and almost like a--

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:42.246
kind of like a life
or death situation.

00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:45.486
And I don't think calculus is
life or death for the students,

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:46.916
but I do think that
when you're faced

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:49.656
with a really tough problem,
you either have the skills

00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:52.306
and the capacity to
rise up, or you don't.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:55.746
And I believe that the
key is self belief.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:56.816
&gt;&gt;What do we know?

00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:57.156
[cross talk]

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.926
&gt;&gt;Jonathan Winn: Okay, we
know a whole bunch of stuff.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.076
We'd better do them
one at a time.

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:01.526
Just put up a hand.

00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:02.976
Right there, what's
something you know?

00:06:03.056 --> 00:06:05.236
&gt;&gt; For me, it's really
important to have consistency,

00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:07.226
and really setting the tone

00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:09.936
that instructional minutes are
valuable, and we're not going

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.696
to waste a single one.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:13.146
This is serious business.

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:15.006
And they're getting
that homework done

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:16.186
and they're working
hard in class

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.506
and they're asking questions.

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:19.366
Why? Because this
is serious business,

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:23.046
and it makes the
teaching day wonderful.

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:25.216
&gt;&gt;Finish solving this
system with substitution

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.636
and take a look up
here at what I have

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.076
and make sure you
have the same thing.

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:30.256
Go. [bell rings]
