JEREMY SILVER: Have
you ever wondered

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.590
what happens when you click
Run in Android Studio?

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.860
The Gradle build tool
swings into action,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.260
fetching dependencies, compiling
code, and packaging resources.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.610
Experts at Gradle and
Udacity have teamed up

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.732
to create "Gradle for
Android and Java,"

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.250
a course designed to
help everyday developers

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.370
and experts alike
demystify Gradle

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.870
and what it can do
for you and your apps.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.240
In this course, you'll learn
the Gradle build language,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.010
create and integrate libraries,
write tests, and create an app

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.020
with free and paid versions.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
Gradle is a key tool in the
Android developer's tool belt.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.670
And once you learn
the ins and outs,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.280
you'll wonder how you
ever got by without it.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.460
Get started now.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.350
