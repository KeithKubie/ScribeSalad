00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:01.361
- [Voiceover] So let's say that we've got

00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:05.367
the polynomial 16x to the third

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.556
plus 24x squared

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.576
plus nine x.

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:13.097
Now what I'd like you to do is pause

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:14.246
the video and see if you could

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.346
factor this polynomial completely.

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:19.847
Now let's work through it together.

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:21.288
So the first thing that you might notice

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.224
is that all of the
terms are divisible by x

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.544
so we can actually factor out an x.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:28.925
So let's do that, and
actually, if we look at

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.642
these coefficients, it
looks like, let's see,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:32.745
it looks like they don't have any

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:34.708
common factors other than one.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.598
So it looks like the
largest monomial that we can

00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:39.722
factor out is just going to be an x.

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:41.719
So let's do that. Let's factor out an x.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.843
So then this is gonna be x times.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.560
When you factor out an
x from 16x to the third

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.046
you're gonna be left with 16x squared,

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:55.046
and then plus 24x and then plus nine.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.549
Now this is starting to look interesting

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.640
so let me just rewrite it.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.706
It's gonna be x times.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:01.647
This part over here looks interesting

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:04.259
because when I see the 16x squared,

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.348
this looks like a perfect square.

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:09.879
Let me write it out. 16x squared.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:13.883
That's the same thing as four x squared,

00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:17.098
and then we have a nine over there,

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:18.643
which is clearly a perfect square.

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:22.322
That is three squared. Three squared.

00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:25.445
And when we look at this 24x, we see

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:29.300
that it is four times three times two,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.086
and so we can write it as,
let me write it this way.

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:35.991
So this is going to be plus two times

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:39.277
four times three x.

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:44.277
So let me make it, so two times four

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:49.330
times three times three x.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.455
Now why did I take the trouble,

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:55.355
why did I take the trouble of
writing everything like this?

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:56.795
Because we see that it fits the

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.175
pattern for a perfect square.

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.057
What do I mean by that?

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.193
Well in previous videos, we saw that

00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:03.807
if you have something of the form

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:07.150
Ax plus B, and you were to square it,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.204
you're going to get Ax squared

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:15.033
plus two ABx

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.346
plus B squared, and we have
that form right over here.

00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:22.432
This is the Ax squared.
Let me do the same color.

00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:25.866
The Ax squared. Ax squared.

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:30.731
We have the B squared.
You have the B squared.

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:34.522
And then you have the two ABx.

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:38.144
Two ABx right over there.

00:02:38.144 --> 00:02:42.578
So this section, this entire
section, we can rewrite

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:44.762
as being we know it, what A and B are.

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:49.696
A is four and B is three
so this is going to be

00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:54.349
Ax, so four x plus

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.111
four x plus b, which we know to be three.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:02.455
That whole thing, that whole
thing squared, and now we

00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:06.274
can't forget this x out front
so we have that x out front.

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:08.119
And we're done. We have
just factored this.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.919
We have just factored this completely.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.113
We could write it as x
times four x plus three

00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:13.832
and then write out and then say times

00:03:13.832 --> 00:03:15.713
four x plus three or we could just write

00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:20.055
x times the quantity four
x plus three squared.

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:21.888
And so we've just factored it completely,

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:23.293
and the key realizations here is well,

00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:26.056
one: what could I factor
out from all of these terms?

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:27.936
I could factor out an x
from all of those terms,

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:30.328
and then to realize what we had left over

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:33.834
was a perfect square,
really using this pattern

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:37.858
that we were able to
see in previous videos.
