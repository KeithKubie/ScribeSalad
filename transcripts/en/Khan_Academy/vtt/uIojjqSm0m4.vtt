00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
- [Voiceover] I could imagine

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.514
that even the earliest human beings,

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.119
or possibly pre-human beings

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:06.232
had asked themselves the questions,

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:10.052
"Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.973
"Why is the universe organized the way that it is?"

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:17.488
And these questions are what we attempt to answer

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.071
in the field of physics...

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.316
In the field of physics,

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.312
which you could view

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:24.612
maybe right after mathematics

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:27.761
as the purest of the sciences.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.646
So you have math, which is very pure,

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:33.592
and then on that foundation of math

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:34.933
you have physics.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:39.159
And physics really does try to use that mathematics

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.048
along with some core ideas

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:43.060
to explain the phenomena,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.238
all the phenomena,

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:45.437
of the universe.

00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:47.204
And physicists will the the first to admit

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:49.643
that they are just beginning to understand

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:51.065
the nature of reality,

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.076
the nature of everything around us.

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:54.986
Now a lot of times, we think physics

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:59.638
is only limited to things like cosmological phenomena

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:01.731
or getting rockets into space,

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:04.779
or how waves move or building structures.

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:07.379
But physics is the foundation for

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.452
all of the other sciences.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.630
When we think about chemistry,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.519
when we think about chemistry,

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.678
which is at the end of the day

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.384
interactions between atoms,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.858
those interactions are really physics-based interactions.

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:22.820
So chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.990
on a foundation of physics.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.062
And then even when we think about ourselves,

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:30.764
our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:35.437
it really all boils down to chemistry and physics.

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:37.997
It boils down to interactions between atoms

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.719
and even mechanical properties of our bodies.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.829
And so even biology,

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.596
even what we are,

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:49.943
is built on a foundation of chemistry.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.072
So this is biology right over here,

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:54.901
which is built on a foundation of physics,

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.562
which is highly dependent on some of the math

00:01:57.562 --> 00:01:59.269
that you've been learning your whole life

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:00.874
and that you will continue to learn.

00:02:00.874 --> 00:02:03.007
And that fundamental question that you might have said,

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:04.958
"Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?"

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.461
Well one, 'cause the math is beautiful,

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:08.859
but also you will see that it starts to,

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.687
in almost the most pure way,

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:13.044
describe the structure of the universe.

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:15.990
And we're going to see that more and more and more

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.473
as we go into physics.

00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:19.139
All of this complex phenomena

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.033
that you see around us,

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.272
whether we're looking at a galaxy

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:22.694
or we're looking at ocean waves,

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.600
or we're looking at even biological systems,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.139
we'll see that a shocking amount of them

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.695
can start to be described using some fairly elegant

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.503
mathematics that we can build on

00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:34.702
and continue to build on.

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:36.815
Simple or elegant mathematics

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:40.919
like force is equal to mass times acceleration.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.824
And we're gonna talk about force and acceleration

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:45.246
as vector quantities.

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:48.314
We're gonna think about things like displacement,

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:50.143
and I'll put it as a vector quantity,

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:52.317
and we'll soon learn more about vector

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:53.637
and scalar quantities are.

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:58.005
Displacement is equal to velocity times time.

00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.321
We'll learn things like accelaration

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:04.385
is equal to change in velocity over change in time.

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.985
What we'll see with even a handful

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.281
of very simple ideas like this.

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.536
We'll go into much more depth in future videos.

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.320
You can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.819
And the one thing that I always loved about physics,

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.627
and I don't think it's always fully appreciated,

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:20.110
sometimes as you start to learn physics,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.979
you'll see all these complicated formula,

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.621
all of these kind of complicated problems,

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.221
but it's super valuable to realize

00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.883
it's all coming from some of these basic ideas.

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.224
Some of the things that I just mentioned,

00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:34.373
these ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:37.400
We're going to explore Newton's laws.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.391
We're going to explain, we're gonna think about

00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:41.992
what are the the different types of forces out there,

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:44.978
and why they might, why they might actually exist.

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:48.310
At its essence, it's all about trying to

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.033
explain the complexity of the universe,

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.739
predict what is going to happen

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.685
based on simple ideas.

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.022
And that's what physics is all about.

00:03:58.022 --> 00:03:59.708
Now when we think of physics,

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.979
it's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.036
In fact, I'm sure we don't know

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:07.733
who the first physicists were.

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:08.883
But some of the,

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:11.321
I guess you could say foundational thinkers

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.490
in physics are these gentlemen that I have here.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.343
And this is just a...

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:16.603
You could kind of say

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:19.569
this is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.886
but this is by no means a complete list.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:25.238
First and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.

00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:27.838
Especially when you start to study physics,

00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.219
you're starting to understand the world

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.621
as Newton understood it.

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:32.881
He understood, "Hey, you know,

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.344
"things don't fall to the ground

00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:35.664
"just 'cause they always fall to,

00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:37.208
"just 'cause that's the way the universe is.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:39.748
"That's a force that's acting on it,

00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:41.820
"and maybe that same force that's causing me

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.137
"to be stuck to my chair right now

00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:46.839
"is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.882
"or the moon orbiting around the Earth."

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.096
He developed Law of Gravitation,

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:54.844
Newton's Laws, and we're going to study that

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.627
as we delve into our basic physics.

00:04:57.627 --> 00:04:58.623
And what we'll see,

00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:00.004
even classical mechanics,

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.052
the physics that Newton established,

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.977
can explain a large range of phenomena

00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.278
with amazing precision.

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:10.325
But as we get into the early 20th century,

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.398
physics starts to get even more wild

00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:14.393
as we start to look at the scales

00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:15.592
of the super small,

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:18.842
and we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,

00:05:18.842 --> 00:05:20.712
and then we have Albert Einstein

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:23.840
as we start thinking about super fast speeds,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.380
the speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.102
That nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,

00:05:29.102 --> 00:05:31.378
which is this mind-boggling thing

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.674
that we have these notions

00:05:33.674 --> 00:05:35.787
of general and special relativity,

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.697
and we start realizing that the universe

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:40.521
is in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,

00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:43.548
and more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.413
But all of the work, even to understand the modern physics

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.135
of Max Planck and Albert Einstein,

00:05:49.135 --> 00:05:52.203
it's based on a lot of the core ideas

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.133
that were given to us by Isaac Newton,

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:56.226
even people before Isaac Newton.

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.725
So as you go into your study of physics,

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.671
and I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.

00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:03.479
I wanted to be a physicist.

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.677
I imagined kind of,

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.933
'cause it's all about, we all wonder,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:07.969
why are we here?

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.777
What is the nature of reality?

00:06:09.777 --> 00:06:12.378
Why do things happen the way they are?

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:14.979
And these are the questions that physics

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.624
is attempting to answer.

00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:19.225
And so as you go into your study of physics,

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.074
I wanna leave you with some quotes

00:06:21.074 --> 00:06:22.801
from these three gentlemen.

00:06:22.801 --> 00:06:25.401
So the first two are from Isaac Newton.

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.018
"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,

00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:32.594
"and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things."

00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:34.300
And I really wanted to stress this,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.661
because a lot of times in your studies,

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.795
you might be finding yourself memorizing formulas

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:41.208
and vocabulary, but that's,

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:43.768
if you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.

00:06:43.768 --> 00:06:45.759
But if you really start to think about it,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.055
really start to think about where these things come from,

00:06:48.055 --> 00:06:51.285
it'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:54.577
And then, you are getting closer to the truth.

00:06:54.577 --> 00:06:57.380
Now, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.265
"I do not know what I may appear to...

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:03.171
"I do not know what I may appear to the world,

00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:07.234
"but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy

00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:08.534
"playing on the seashore,

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:11.033
"and diverting myself in now and then

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:12.699
"finding a smoother pebble

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.426
"or prettier shell than ordinary,

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.352
"whilst the great ocean of truth

00:07:17.352 --> 00:07:20.521
"lay all undiscovered before me."

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.126
I like to imagine there's so much,

00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:24.321
we, even though we think we know so much,

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.571
that we haven't even learned a small fraction

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:29.258
of how the universe really is.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.594
And even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,

00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:32.630
he recognized this.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.113
He's like, "Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:36.572
"into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:37.750
"but there's this vast ocean

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.558
"that I can't even begin to understand."

00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:41.488
You can even imagine alien civilizations

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:43.845
that are thousands of years ahead of us

00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:45.918
technologically or scientifically

00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.157
or even millions of years,

00:07:47.157 --> 00:07:49.067
how they might perceive the reality,

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.408
and they might see us as ants

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:51.789
in that we are just beginning

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.309
to scrape the surface of how the world works.

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:56.836
This is from Max Planck.

00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:59.173
"When you change the way you look at things,

00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.286
"the things you look at change."

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.947
And I find this to be pretty profound,

00:08:03.947 --> 00:08:04.739
because it is true.

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:05.674
As you study physics,

00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:06.588
you will start to see, whoa,

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:08.234
most of what we consider to be reality,

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:09.717
our current understanding is based

00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:11.789
on these forces, but what are these forces?

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.004
And even these things that we think are solid,

00:08:14.004 --> 00:08:15.650
when we go down to the atomic level,

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.112
we see it's mostly empty space

00:08:17.112 --> 00:08:18.819
and it's really just the interaction of forces

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.790
that make us think that something

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.594
is solid or there or tangible is some way.

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:24.934
And you realize these very tangible things

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:27.149
aren't so tangible after all.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:28.774
At the end of the day, the whole world

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.477
is just a mental model that we have.

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:32.309
In some ways,

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.971
it's an illusion

00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.815
that our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:40.313
But we're just beginning to understand it.

00:08:40.313 --> 00:08:42.041
And last but not least,

00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:43.464
and there's actually a ton of great quotes

00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:44.825
from these folks and others,

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.450
but especially Albert Einstein.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.340
"The most beautiful experience

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.453
"we can have is the mysterious.

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:53.399
"It is the fundamental emotion that stands

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.446
"at the cradle of true art and true science."

00:08:56.446 --> 00:08:58.762
And I really want you to take this to heart

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:00.123
as you study your physics.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.155
There will be times where we're going

00:09:02.155 --> 00:09:03.435
to be building our tool kits.

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:04.146
What's a vector?

00:09:04.146 --> 00:09:04.776
What's a scalar?

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.280
Going into some mathematics,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.702
proving some formulas.

00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.165
Those are the tool kits,

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.648
but then we're gonna try to understand

00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:12.050
fundamental phenomena.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.244
How does the universe actually work?

00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:16.397
And if when we start to think about these,

00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:18.856
you don't get a few chills on your skin,

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:21.538
a few goosebumps, and feel that the universe

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:23.569
is more mysterious than you thought,

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:25.419
then we're not studying physics

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.734
the say that we should be studying physics.
