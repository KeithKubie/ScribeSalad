this is a BJ Fogg model actually

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420
this is a BJ Fogg model actually
 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.360
this is a BJ Fogg model actually
behavior model but I think that there's

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370
behavior model but I think that there's
 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.460
behavior model but I think that there's
something really to it which is that you

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470
something really to it which is that you
 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.190
something really to it which is that you
have to motivate your users to get them

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200
have to motivate your users to get them
 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.710
have to motivate your users to get them
over the trigger if you want your

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720
over the trigger if you want your
 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.540
over the trigger if you want your
product to grow to a large enough user

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550
product to grow to a large enough user
 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.010
product to grow to a large enough user
base so then let's talk about the next

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020
base so then let's talk about the next
 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.390
base so then let's talk about the next
level so let's assume you've got like

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400
level so let's assume you've got like
 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.520
level so let's assume you've got like
you guys all here must have this already

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530
you guys all here must have this already
 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.100
you guys all here must have this already
which is that you've got a growing base

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110
which is that you've got a growing base
 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.450
which is that you've got a growing base
of engaged users now what you're like

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460
of engaged users now what you're like
 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.820
of engaged users now what you're like
what ultimately matters like more than

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
what ultimately matters like more than
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.650
what ultimately matters like more than
anything is gaining those users to stick

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:43.660
anything is gaining those users to stick
 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.810
anything is gaining those users to stick
because look like I see this all the

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.820
because look like I see this all the
 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.130
because look like I see this all the
time there's you know these two

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.140
time there's you know these two
 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.840
time there's you know these two
imaginary companies company a and

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:48.850
imaginary companies company a and
 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.510
imaginary companies company a and
Company B Company a as you can see it's

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520
Company B Company a as you can see it's
 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.330
Company B Company a as you can see it's
growing twice as fast as Company B so

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.340
growing twice as fast as Company B so
 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.000
growing twice as fast as Company B so
the founders of Company A feel fantastic

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.010
the founders of Company A feel fantastic
 

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.380
the founders of Company A feel fantastic
but they've got you know they've got

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.390
but they've got you know they've got
 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.390
but they've got you know they've got
into 80 percent monthly retentions not

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400
into 80 percent monthly retentions not
 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.040
into 80 percent monthly retentions not
that bad losing 20 percent of their

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.050
that bad losing 20 percent of their
 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.990
that bad losing 20 percent of their
users every month whereas this other

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000
users every month whereas this other
 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.150
users every month whereas this other
company Company B is only losing 5

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160
company Company B is only losing 5
 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.430
company Company B is only losing 5
percent and so what happens in the first

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440
percent and so what happens in the first
 

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.800
percent and so what happens in the first
six months is that company a like if I

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:10.810
six months is that company a like if I
 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.300
six months is that company a like if I
invest in company I'd be like yeah

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:12.310
invest in company I'd be like yeah
 

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.120
invest in company I'd be like yeah
killing it made the right call here but

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.130
killing it made the right call here but
 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.830
killing it made the right call here but
I'm sure you guys all know how to do

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840
I'm sure you guys all know how to do
 

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.020
I'm sure you guys all know how to do
math like what ends up happening is that

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.030
math like what ends up happening is that
 

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.360
math like what ends up happening is that
after about 12 months in this like

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
after about 12 months in this like
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.990
after about 12 months in this like
random example that I give the lines

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000
random example that I give the lines
 

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.600
random example that I give the lines
cross because ultimately what happens is

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:27.610
cross because ultimately what happens is
 

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.610
cross because ultimately what happens is
that you're only growing the number of

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:29.620
that you're only growing the number of
 

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.380
that you're only growing the number of
people that you're losing every month

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:31.390
people that you're losing every month
 

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.390
people that you're losing every month
and so you don't want to have this kind

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:33.400
and so you don't want to have this kind
 

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.219
and so you don't want to have this kind
of like the empty the what's that

guys know what I'm talking about

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:39.580
guys know what I'm talking about
 

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.330
guys know what I'm talking about
leaky bucket so you don't want to have

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:42.340
leaky bucket so you don't want to have
 

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.130
leaky bucket so you don't want to have
the leaky bucket so how do you keep on

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.140
the leaky bucket so how do you keep on
 

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.440
the leaky bucket so how do you keep on
making sure that you how do you make

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:46.450
making sure that you how do you make
 

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.970
making sure that you how do you make
sure that you're part of the company B

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:47.980
sure that you're part of the company B

retention number not the company a

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.020
retention number not the company a
 

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.920
retention number not the company a
the way that I think about that is with

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:53.930
the way that I think about that is with
 

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.900
the way that I think about that is with
what I call accruing benefits and

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:55.910
what I call accruing benefits and
 

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.400
what I call accruing benefits and
mounting loss so accruing benefits the

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:00.410
mounting loss so accruing benefits the
 

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.160
mounting loss so accruing benefits the
idea there is that you want your users

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.170
idea there is that you want your users
 

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.010
idea there is that you want your users
to add data into your product either

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.020
to add data into your product either
 

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.650
to add data into your product either
explicitly or implicitly and then you

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:08.660
explicitly or implicitly and then you
 

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.690
explicitly or implicitly and then you
want to kind of recycle that data back

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:10.700
want to kind of recycle that data back
 

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.060
want to kind of recycle that data back
to the user in a way that creates more

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.070
to the user in a way that creates more
 

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.010
to the user in a way that creates more
value for them so like when I'm on

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.020
value for them so like when I'm on
 

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.010
value for them so like when I'm on
Facebook and I engage with content on my

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.020
Facebook and I engage with content on my
 

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.720
Facebook and I engage with content on my
newsfeed Facebook's

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:19.730
newsfeed Facebook's
 

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.610
newsfeed Facebook's
taking all that implicit and explicit

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:21.620
taking all that implicit and explicit
 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.160
taking all that implicit and explicit
data and using it to increasingly

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.170
data and using it to increasingly
 

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.050
data and using it to increasingly
personalize the newsfeed for me and

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.060
personalize the newsfeed for me and
 

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.940
personalize the newsfeed for me and
making making it a more engaging product

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:27.950
making making it a more engaging product
 

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.829
making making it a more engaging product
and whether it's like what I click on or

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839
and whether it's like what I click on or
 

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:33.070

even who I add as a friend Facebook uses

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.080
even who I add as a friend Facebook uses
 

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.449
even who I add as a friend Facebook uses
all that to kind of create these

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:34.459
all that to kind of create these
 

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:39.340
all that to kind of create these
accruing benefits the flip side is that

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:39.350
accruing benefits the flip side is that
 

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.230
accruing benefits the flip side is that
you should feel you should have a user

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240
you should feel you should have a user
 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.690
you should feel you should have a user
say the more I use a product the more I

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:43.700
say the more I use a product the more I
 

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.210
say the more I use a product the more I
have to lose by leaving the product that

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.220
have to lose by leaving the product that
 

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.420
have to lose by leaving the product that
you create this experience where I is a

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:49.430
you create this experience where I is a
 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.260
you create this experience where I is a
user start to depend on your product I'm

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.270
user start to depend on your product I'm
 

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.300
user start to depend on your product I'm
leaving artifacts of myself in the

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.310
leaving artifacts of myself in the
 

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.010
leaving artifacts of myself in the
product so it almost becomes an

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.020
product so it almost becomes an
 

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.650
product so it almost becomes an
extension of my identity or it's

00:09:59.650 --> 00:09:59.660
extension of my identity or it's
 

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.720
extension of my identity or it's
certainly just something where I rely on

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:01.730
certainly just something where I rely on
 

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.810
certainly just something where I rely on
it in some way and so to give my

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:04.820
it in some way and so to give my
 

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.490
it in some way and so to give my

can create virtuous loops in the product

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:11.069
can create virtuous loops in the product
 

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:12.949
can create virtuous loops in the product
because this is what really I think

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959
because this is what really I think
 

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:16.069
because this is what really I think
takes a company from you know being you

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079
takes a company from you know being you
 

00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:18.470
takes a company from you know being you
know a solid player to being one of

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480
know a solid player to being one of
 

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.670
know a solid player to being one of
those iconic companies the strongest

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680
those iconic companies the strongest
 

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.559
those iconic companies the strongest
virtuous loop that I'm sure many of you

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:24.569
virtuous loop that I'm sure many of you
 

00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:25.970
virtuous loop that I'm sure many of you
guys hear about all the time is a

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980
guys hear about all the time is a
 

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.180
guys hear about all the time is a
network effect and so at Pinterest we we

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.190
network effect and so at Pinterest we we
 

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.220
network effect and so at Pinterest we we
discovered our network effect through

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.230
discovered our network effect through
 

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.160
discovered our network effect through
our kind of process of creating the

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.170
our kind of process of creating the
 

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.780
our kind of process of creating the
discovery team just this very simple

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:35.790
discovery team just this very simple
 

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.480
discovery team just this very simple
idea which is that when a user pins a

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.490
idea which is that when a user pins a
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.019
idea which is that when a user pins a
pin they either bring a new like website

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:42.029
pin they either bring a new like website
 

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.150
pin they either bring a new like website
a new piece of content into Pinterest or

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160
a new piece of content into Pinterest or
 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.460
a new piece of content into Pinterest or
they're actually creating a new edge in

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.470
they're actually creating a new edge in
 

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.470
they're actually creating a new edge in
our graph by putting that pin on their

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480
our graph by putting that pin on their
 

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.930
our graph by putting that pin on their
board and what we do then is we take

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940
board and what we do then is we take
 

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.199
board and what we do then is we take
that data of like this user put this pin

00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:54.209
that data of like this user put this pin
 

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:56.600
that data of like this user put this pin
on this board here all the other pins

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:56.610
on this board here all the other pins
 

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.790
on this board here all the other pins
that share a board with that pin

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800
that share a board with that pin
 

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.679
that share a board with that pin
therefore those are all edges in our

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:00.689
therefore those are all edges in our
 

00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:03.199
therefore those are all edges in our
graph and we use that information to

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:03.209
graph and we use that information to
 

00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:05.059
graph and we use that information to
make the discovery experience better

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:05.069
make the discovery experience better
 

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:07.730
make the discovery experience better
which gets which gets more people to pin

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740
which gets which gets more people to pin
 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.379
which gets which gets more people to pin

got like this wonderful virtuous loop

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160
got like this wonderful virtuous loop
 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.710
got like this wonderful virtuous loop
there are other types of virtuous loops

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720
there are other types of virtuous loops
 

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.150
there are other types of virtuous loops
so that you're always going to be

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160
so that you're always going to be
 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.670
so that you're always going to be

so you know growth is a great one so

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620
so you know growth is a great one so
 

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.470
so you know growth is a great one so
actually one of the things that our

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480
actually one of the things that our
 

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.150
actually one of the things that our
growth team was always thinking about

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160
growth team was always thinking about
 

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.060

is already on Pinterest and how do we

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:31.710
is already on Pinterest and how do we
 

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.830
is already on Pinterest and how do we
take advantage of the ripples that they

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:33.840
take advantage of the ripples that they
 

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.200
take advantage of the ripples that they
can create so as an example you know I

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.210
can create so as an example you know I
 

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.900
can create so as an example you know I
use this example of sending a pin here

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:38.910
use this example of sending a pin here
 

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.850
use this example of sending a pin here
but I think even a better example is

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860
but I think even a better example is
 

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.250
but I think even a better example is
that you know each pin on Pinterest has

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260
that you know each pin on Pinterest has
 

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.340
that you know each pin on Pinterest has
been repinned thousands of times if not

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.350
been repinned thousands of times if not
 

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.200
been repinned thousands of times if not
like on average millions of times and

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.210
like on average millions of times and
 

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.660
like on average millions of times and
that means that if I find a pin that

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:50.670
that means that if I find a pin that
 

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.340
that means that if I find a pin that
you've that there's a recipe like a

this is what happens on tinder but

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880
this is what happens on tinder but
 

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.390
this is what happens on tinder but
ideally you match with someone you have

a successful date with someone and
that's an off-ramp from the experience

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360
that's an off-ramp from the experience
 

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.720
that's an off-ramp from the experience
it's not actually making the experience

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:44.730
it's not actually making the experience

it's not actually making the experience
more engaging or kind of creating a

more engaging or kind of creating a
 

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.090
more engaging or kind of creating a
stronger loop and so tinder has to

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100
stronger loop and so tinder has to
 

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.710
stronger loop and so tinder has to
constantly figure out how do we get

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720
constantly figure out how do we get
 

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.530
constantly figure out how do we get
people on the top of the loop to keep

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:54.540
people on the top of the loop to keep
 

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.910
people on the top of the loop to keep
them to keep them dating and so as that

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:58.920
them to keep them dating and so as that
 

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.039
them to keep them dating and so as that
said like you know ultimately the

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:01.049
said like you know ultimately the
 

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:03.230
said like you know ultimately the
strongest fuel you can have for your

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240
strongest fuel you can have for your
 

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.049
strongest fuel you can have for your
company is your users doing things in

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059
company is your users doing things in
 

00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:08.090
company is your users doing things in
the product engaging with it in such a

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100
the product engaging with it in such a
 

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.980
the product engaging with it in such a
way that they're making the product

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:09.990
way that they're making the product
 

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.750
way that they're making the product
stronger both for themselves and for

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760
stronger both for themselves and for
 

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.610
stronger both for themselves and for
other people in the company or in the

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620
other people in the company or in the
 

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.530
other people in the company or in the
product and they're also figuring out

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:15.540
product and they're also figuring out
 

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.480
product and they're also figuring out
how to re-engage your users and grow the

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.490
how to re-engage your users and grow the
 

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.980
how to re-engage your users and grow the
product for you and so last but not

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:21.990
product for you and so last but not
 

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.200
product for you and so last but not
least like how do you measure this like

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.210
least like how do you measure this like
 

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.970
least like how do you measure this like
how do you know if you're on the right

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980
how do you know if you're on the right
 

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.630
how do you know if you're on the right
track so we talked about these these

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640
track so we talked about these these
 

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.789
track so we talked about these these
three things you know each of the levels

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799
three things you know each of the levels
 

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:35.870
three things you know each of the levels
in the hierarchy and so you know I as an

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880
in the hierarchy and so you know I as an
 

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.090
in the hierarchy and so you know I as an
investor but I imagine you as a product

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100
investor but I imagine you as a product
 

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.360
investor but I imagine you as a product
manager or GM or the CEO of your company

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:41.370
manager or GM or the CEO of your company
 

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.480
manager or GM or the CEO of your company
ultimately wants to see these these

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:44.490
ultimately wants to see these these
 

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.010
ultimately wants to see these these
three things also which was like am i

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020
three things also which was like am i
 

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.590
three things also which was like am i
growing our users getting more or less

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600
growing our users getting more or less
 

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.590
growing our users getting more or less
engaged over time so the users I got you

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600
engaged over time so the users I got you
 

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.510
engaged over time so the users I got you
know I bought the site one year ago

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520
know I bought the site one year ago
 

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.270
know I bought the site one year ago
versus now what percentage of them are

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280
versus now what percentage of them are
 

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.190
versus now what percentage of them are
engaging with the product yeah are we

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200
engaging with the product yeah are we
 

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080
engaging with the product yeah are we
getting better over time are we getting

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.090
getting better over time are we getting
 

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.049
getting better over time are we getting
worse are the cohorts growing are we

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059
worse are the cohorts growing are we
 

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.900
worse are the cohorts growing are we
retaining them and ultimately you know

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:05.910
retaining them and ultimately you know
 

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.580
retaining them and ultimately you know
how am i doing on my marketing spend are

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:07.590
how am i doing on my marketing spend are
 

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.230
how am i doing on my marketing spend are
we are we getting people through the

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240
we are we getting people through the
 

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.590
we are we getting people through the
through the funnel and so the thing that

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600
through the funnel and so the thing that
 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.930
through the funnel and so the thing that
I think is like the number one thing to

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940
I think is like the number one thing to
 

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.510
I think is like the number one thing to
measure and like everything else in my

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520
measure and like everything else in my
 

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.610
measure and like everything else in my
view is a waste of time is looking at

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620
view is a waste of time is looking at
 

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.830
view is a waste of time is looking at
cohorts and so you look at cohorts like

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840
cohorts and so you look at cohorts like
 

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.440
cohorts and so you look at cohorts like
at does everybody know what a cohort is

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:23.450
at does everybody know what a cohort is
 

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.750
at does everybody know what a cohort is
okay good I'm getting some nods but you

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760
okay good I'm getting some nods but you
 

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.669
okay good I'm getting some nods but you
know the cohort is just all the users

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679
know the cohort is just all the users
 

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:33.140
know the cohort is just all the users
who joined January 2015 and you track

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:33.150
who joined January 2015 and you track
 

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.630
who joined January 2015 and you track
those we've kind of tagged those people

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640
those we've kind of tagged those people
 

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.690
those we've kind of tagged those people
and you watch them month-to-month just

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700
and you watch them month-to-month just
 

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.700
and you watch them month-to-month just
as their own cohort of users and you see

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:40.710
as their own cohort of users and you see
 

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.860
as their own cohort of users and you see
how many of them every week or every

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:42.870
how many of them every week or every
 

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.830
how many of them every week or every
month or completing your core action and

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840
month or completing your core action and
 

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.450
month or completing your core action and
what percentage of them are actually

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460
what percentage of them are actually
 

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.860
what percentage of them are actually
completing the core action so you're

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:48.870
completing the core action so you're
 

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.560
completing the core action so you're
getting a sense of both how how many

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:51.570
getting a sense of both how how many
 

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.960
getting a sense of both how how many
people are the absolute value how are

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:53.970
people are the absolute value how are
 

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.220
people are the absolute value how are
they retaining

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.230
they retaining
 

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.080
they retaining
whether over time your products getting

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.090
whether over time your products getting
 

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.630
whether over time your products getting
better at converting the new people that

00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640
better at converting the new people that
 

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.280
better at converting the new people that
sign up into people that are actually

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.290
sign up into people that are actually
 

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.490
sign up into people that are actually
engaging with the product and so what

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500
engaging with the product and so what
 

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.870
engaging with the product and so what
you see is those three things that I

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880
you see is those three things that I
 

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.760
you see is those three things that I
already talked about it really it's like

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:07.770
already talked about it really it's like
 

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.310
already talked about it really it's like
the distillation of every other metric

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320
the distillation of every other metric
 

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.940
the distillation of every other metric
that you could you could possibly track

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:12.950
that you could you could possibly track
 

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.710
that you could you could possibly track
and you know everybody has a different

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720
and you know everybody has a different
 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.840
and you know everybody has a different
way that they like to to show it if

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:17.850
way that they like to to show it if
 

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.600
way that they like to to show it if
you're an early-stage startup or just

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:20.610
you're an early-stage startup or just
 

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.640
you're an early-stage startup or just
getting started with a new a new app I

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:22.650
getting started with a new a new app I
 

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.530
getting started with a new a new app I
love line graphs I just find it's like

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:24.540
love line graphs I just find it's like
 

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.510
love line graphs I just find it's like
the easiest way to look at it at a

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520
the easiest way to look at it at a
 

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.159
the easiest way to look at it at a
glance and really understand what's

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:28.169
glance and really understand what's
 

00:20:28.169 --> 00:20:30.169
glance and really understand what's
happening with the company but the more

00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179
happening with the company but the more
 

00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:31.940
happening with the company but the more
the bigger you are the further you are

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:31.950
the bigger you are the further you are
 

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.159
the bigger you are the further you are
and you're in your kind of user growth

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:34.169
and you're in your kind of user growth
 

00:20:34.169 --> 00:20:36.710
and you're in your kind of user growth
and maturity the more you end up going

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720
and maturity the more you end up going
 

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.120
and maturity the more you end up going
to the left and so I think like

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.130
to the left and so I think like
 

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.220
to the left and so I think like
ultimately you know if you're able to

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.230
ultimately you know if you're able to
 

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.440
ultimately you know if you're able to
track your cohorts you're able to

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:45.450
track your cohorts you're able to
 

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.510
track your cohorts you're able to
communicate the value of what you're

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520
communicate the value of what you're
 

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.419
communicate the value of what you're
doing both to an investor if you end up

00:20:50.419 --> 00:20:50.429
doing both to an investor if you end up
 

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:52.789
doing both to an investor if you end up
coming down this path eventually or

00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799
coming down this path eventually or
 

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.950
coming down this path eventually or
already have or anybody else in your

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960
already have or anybody else in your
 

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.990
already have or anybody else in your
company so so just to close it out we

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000
company so so just to close it out we
 

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.340
company so so just to close it out we
talked about the three things in the

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:01.350
talked about the three things in the
 

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.760
talked about the three things in the
hierarchy we talked about what it is

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:03.770
hierarchy we talked about what it is
 

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.169
hierarchy we talked about what it is
growing in gauges or what you actually

00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179
growing in gauges or what you actually
 

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:08.299
growing in gauges or what you actually
look for what is an engages or focusing

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:08.309
look for what is an engages or focusing
 

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.700
look for what is an engages or focusing
on the core action we talked about the

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:10.710
on the core action we talked about the
 

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.650
on the core action we talked about the
importance of retaining those users

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660
importance of retaining those users
 

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.270
importance of retaining those users
making sure that you don't have a leaky

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280
making sure that you don't have a leaky
 

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.750
making sure that you don't have a leaky
bucket and then figuring out ways to

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760
bucket and then figuring out ways to
 

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.780
bucket and then figuring out ways to
make the product self-perpetuating and I

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:20.790
make the product self-perpetuating and I
 

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.299
make the product self-perpetuating and I
think that if you are able to build your

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:23.309
think that if you are able to build your
 

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:25.880
think that if you are able to build your
product to kind of check the box and

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:25.890
product to kind of check the box and
 

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.460
product to kind of check the box and
really excel on these three levels I

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:28.470
really excel on these three levels I
 

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.530
really excel on these three levels I
think you've done everything you can

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:30.540
