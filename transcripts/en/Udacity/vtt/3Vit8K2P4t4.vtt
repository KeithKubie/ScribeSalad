00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.925
Okay so we agree one carton of eggs is
really the exact same thing as 12 eggs.

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:09.835
They're equal but I don't like having
a whole carton of eggs floating around.

00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:14.035
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:16.053
So I'm just going to say 1 carton and

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:19.609
because they're equal I can
say 1 carton equals 12 eggs.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.230
Or that 12 eggs equals 1 carton,
they're the same thing.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.410
And now I'm going to do
something a little strange.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.785
So we've seen that 1 carton
divided by 1 carton is 1.

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:35.375
We've seen that 12 eggs equals 1 carton.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:44.135
What is 12 eggs divided by 1 carton?

00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:45.080
This is a tough question.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.990
I want you to really think about
this and enter your answer here.
