00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
&gt;&gt; I think role models are very important
for the Middle East. In a number of areas

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.530
and not just in terms of the political sense,
but also in education and business and other

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.039
endeavors. So we need role models in a variety
of sectors in the Middle East. Now with respect

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.289
to the type of character that are required,
I think that the number one character I look

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.500
for in a role model is integrity. Integrity
above all is what's required from any role

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.310
model in the Middle East with respect to their
moral character, experience, their they express

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.950
it. What I think is the repetoire of any role
model. Beyond that actually depends on the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.730
sector, or on the type of business field you
are taking on. Thanks.
