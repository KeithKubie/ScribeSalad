00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.890
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Hello,
good afternoon.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.210
I'm Ron Charles, editor of the book
section of the Washington Post.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.830
Which is a charter sponsor
of The National Book Festival

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.150
and we are so glad you are here.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.390
First word of thanks to our
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.330
David Rubenstein, and
the many other sponsors

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.630
who have made this possible.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.300
And if you would like to
make a financial contribution

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.810 position:56%
to the festival there is information
in your program about that.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.330
We will have time for questions
afterwards, at these two mics,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.620
know that if you come up to the
microphone you will become part

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.340
of the library's permanent
collection.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.570
So if that's not something you
want to do, stay in your seat.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.110
I am so delighted to be here
today with Geraldine Brooks,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.900
I've known her for years now.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.510
Since she wrote one of my
favorite novels, March.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The moment I
finished it I boldly called her

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.700 position:56%
on the phone out of the blue, a
stranger, choked up, kind of crying,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.340
and told her how much I loved it.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.960
She has since changed
her phone number.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.490
But she still is happy
to get email from fans.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.610
Geraldine Brooks was born
and raised in Australia

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.330
which accounts for
her lovely accent.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.350
She came to the US to
complete a masters degree

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.370
at Columbia University
and soon got a job

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.520
for the Wall Street Journal
covering conflicts in Africa

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.720 position:56%
and the Balkans and the Middle East.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.100
That experience provided the
material for her first book,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.170
Nine Parts of Desire, The
Hidden World of Islamic Women,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050
which was an international
best seller.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.680
Several years later after winning
an overseas press club award

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.520
for her coverage of the Gulf
War, she took off the journalist

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.510
and wrote a novel called
Year of Wonders.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.210
[ Applause ]

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.510
&gt;&gt; Somebody in the
audience just told me

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.510
that was their favorite book ever.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.200
[ Background Conversation ]

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260
&gt;&gt; Encouraged by the
success of that novel,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.600
she published a second one
called March, based on the life

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.580
of Bronson Alcott and the father
figure of the Little Women

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.510
and it went on to win the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Since then she
has published two more celebrated

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.760
novels, People of the
Book and Caleb's Crossing.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.340
Now all of her novels
have been dramatic works

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.610
of historical reclamation and
imagination, but her upcoming,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.480
her new book, The Secret Chord,
is her most ambitious work yet.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.980
The Secret Chord is about David,
King David, ruler of Judah,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.870
ancestor of Jesus,
Michelangelo's subject

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.480
for the first Abercrombie
and Fitch model.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.180
The story is incredible, I
mean I thought I knew this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.840 position:56%
from my Sunday school days, but wow,
it's got war, intrigue, betrayal,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.010
sex, it's one spectacular scandal

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.320
after another even by
Washington standards.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130
You are in for a treat
for Geraldine Brooks,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.670
tells us about her
inspiration, her research,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.580
and her work to bring this
ancient hero to new life.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.510
Please join me in welcoming her.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.540
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.350
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Thank you,
Ron, you really are my hero.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.930
He is just the best,
and may I just recommend

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.780
to your attention Ron has another
hat as well being a book reviewer

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.990
for the Washington Post, he is
also the totally hip book reviewer

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.920
on YouTube, and those of you
that haven't had the pleasure

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.880
of seeing his work there, Ron.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.660
So I'm the kind of person who
tends to be as Zen as possible

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.500
about doing events like this.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.800
Thank you all for coming.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.260
It's hard to be Zen with
this many people in the room.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.680
And particularly when I
read the author instructions

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.360
that the National Book Festival
thoughtfully sends to us,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.140
and it said to be personal.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.440
So that's okay.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.620
So I loaded up a power point
with some slides of my kids,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.440
which I will show you soon.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.940
And then they said
don't use any notes.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.720
And I'm, what do we think we are?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.420
We're people who spend 90%
of our lives alone in a room

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.550
because we're really quite shy.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.260
Don't use any notes?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.840
As you see, I am flouting
that instruction.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.090
I will try to not to refer to
them too much, but like Linus,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.150
I need my security blanket.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.470
I hope for your understanding.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.380
But to try and fulfill the
requirement of being personable,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.030
I thought I would share
with you some information

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.790
about the thing I collect.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.510
I think most people, or many
people, have collections.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.270
Some people have coins or
stamps or bobble headed dolls,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.510
I collect examples
of unhelpful signage.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.340
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Watch

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.500
for falling rocks is a
perennial favorite of mine.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.700
It's the rare ones I treasure, like
bird watcher heading to Antarctica

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.020
or the Galapagos and such,
there's a blue footed booby

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.460
that can be seen no where else.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.510
I like those signs that
you have to travel to get.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.970
And a lot of them are in my
home country of Australia.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.260
In far north Queensland where
the roads are often more notional

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.690
than actual, there's the sign
that says drive according

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.280
to prevailing conditions.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.180
Even better at a place aptly named
Big Hole in the northern territory,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.060
accidents can lead
to injury and death.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.060
Um, there was a sign I saw on
over an expressway in Florida

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.650
that first looked like
helpful information,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.050
texting while driving kills.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.860
Fair enough I thought, and
then I noticed at the bottom

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.870
of the sign it said, for
safety tips, text #safety.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.130
But perhaps the prize in
my collection is the sign

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.230
on the car ferry that goes
back and forth to my home

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.780
on Martha's Vineyard,
for your safety,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.470
please exit the freight deck
while the vessel is underway.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.900
I love that sign.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.530
Every time I see it, it makes me
laugh because I get this vision

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.740
of all the vacation SUVs with
their bungee Chorded extrusions

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.390
of bicycles and kayaks and
spare blankets and pillows

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.810
and all the holiday paraphernalia,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.330
obediently driving off the
freight deck into Vineyard Sound.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.380
And I thought, well that's one
way to thin out the August crowds.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.700
So why do I like these
signs so much?

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.030
It's because they remind me how
magnificently complicated our

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.980
language is and how difficult
it is to convey precise meaning,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.120
no matter how well
intentioned you are.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.600
Somebody at the Martha's Vineyard
Steamship Authority probably put a

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.860
lot of thought into that
sign and getting made

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.090
up in nice high-vis lettering, and
they just wanted to advise people

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.620
to get out of their cars for
the duration of the trip.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.900
And yet they totally blew it.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:06.590 position:56%
So I keep little sticky notes of
these signs on the desk in my study,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.540
and it's to remind me
to be extra careful

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.040
with this fragile treasure,
our language.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.520
But like the Steamship Authority
wiz, I often blow it, too.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.770
The difference between the
right word and the wrong word

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.480
as Mark Twain told
us, is the difference

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.990
between lightning and
the lightning bug.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:34.350 position:56%
And when you're writing historical
fiction the stakes here can be quite

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.490
high because if you
put the wrong word

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.420
in a character's mouth you can
pull your reader out of the time

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.950 position:56%
and place that you're trying to keep
them in and that is unfortunate.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.510
So I've done that, I have to admit.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:09:01.350
In Year of Wonders, my first novel,
I have my 1665 young heroine,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.300
waxing eloquently about the
mauve tide of the Heather moving

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.740
across the mountainside of
her peak district, Home Place.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:18.760
Problem, the first use of the word
mauve as a color wasn't until 1796.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:25.190
I know that because somebody
actually wrote a book titled Mauve,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.210
How One Man Invented a Color
that Changed the World.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:36.240
Whoops. So it was not long
after that novel came out,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.620
and I think I was speaking
about it in England,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.660
and I met a wonderful English
novelist called Jim Crace,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.860
who had written a book
set in biblical Israel,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.480
called Quarantines,
it's a wonderful novel.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.030
And he was telling me about how
he researched that novel and a lot

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.260
of his research had to do with
camping in the Judean Desert

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.540
to get the sense of the place
and he said, on the first morning

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.050
of this camping trip, his
Bedouin guide woke him with a cup

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.190
of lovely cardamom
scented Arabic coffee

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.460 position:56%
and said Mr. Jim, how did you sleep?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.060
And he said Ahmed I
slept like a log.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.810
&gt;&gt; And then he said
he raised his eyes

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.010
to the bare rock ribbed hillsides

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.990
of the Judean Desert,
not a log to be seen.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:36.280
So he turned to his guide and he
said Ahmed, how did you sleep?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.630
And Ahmed said, Mr. Jim, I
slept like a dead donkey.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:47.520
So ever since Jim Crace
shared that story with me,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.300
I spent a lot of time going over my
manuscripts and trying to find logs

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.380
and turn them into dead donkeys.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.990
So I hope when you read
my books you'll find a lot

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.060
of dead donkeys in them.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.110
It's not always easy.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.070
In The Secret Chord for example,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.440
which is set in second
iron age Israel,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.360
I kept running into a lot of logs.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.820
I had to take out the word assassin

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.230
because the original assassins
were violent Persian sect

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.780
of the 11th century and that's not
likely my Hebrew tribesman would

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.830
have been talking about them.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.060
I substituted the word
thug, only to realize

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:34.020
that that was actually a
violent group of Indian outlaws

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.260
from the 15th century and my
Hebrews would not have been talking

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.560
about them either.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.440
So I didn't find a really
good dead donkey in that case,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.050
but sometimes you can
find them and I think

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.000
that the effect is
well worth the effort.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.900
So in Caleb's Crossing, my
young narrator needs to talk

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:01.110
about a foetus and I'm pretty sure
that in Massachusetts in 1660,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.850
she's not using the word foetus.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.170
And lucky for me there's
a wonderful resource,

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.990
the Oxford Historical Thesaurus
of the English Language that digs

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:17.090 position:56%
down on every word in use from today
all the way to early Icelandic,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:23.890 position:56%
and so if you look up foetus you can
go down to mid 17th century and find

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.730
that the word she probably
would have used is shapeling.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:32.120
If you put the word
shapeling into her mouth,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.650
I think you can time travel.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.900
So does it really matter?

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.420
Is it important or is
it just nit picking?

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.780
An expression, I have to say, that
I've loved for it's aptness ever

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.990
since my son got head
lice in the third grade.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.010
It really is very exacting work.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:01.170
But I think combing
through a manuscript looking

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.810
for bad vocabulary is in some
ways very similar to nit picking,

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.390
and I think it does matter.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.470
And I think it's respectful
to you, the reader.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.080
And I'll tell you why.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.560
Not that many years ago, I had
a wonderful year as a fellow

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.850
at The Radcliffe Institute for
Advanced Studies at Harvard,

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.350
and this is just a
terrific boondoggle,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:32.090 position:56%
they pay you to do your own work
and to have lunch with other fellows

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.570
who come from a diversity of fields
across the sciences and the arts

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.220
and academics, and you
give each other ideas

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.480
and it's just a great experience,
and your only obligation is

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.880
to give one talk on what
you're working on and go

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.740 position:56%
to the talks of your fellow fellows.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.980
So one of my fellow fellows was
a mathematician from Bordeaux,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:01.570
and her talk was entitled
Singularities

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.530
in Algebraic Plane Curves.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:12.750
And I have to tell you, I
slumped into that lecture room.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:19.230 position:56%
I took a doodle pad and I thought if
I positioned myself behind a pillow,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.440
a short nap might not
be out of the question.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.020
Math was my not my strong suit.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.050
But on that pad that
I carried that day,

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.190
I found that my doodles
quickly turned

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.940 position:56%
to notations of what she was saying.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.400
And here's a couple of things
that I wrote down that she said.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:47.770
A formal power series about the
original is an infinite sum.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.890
Homomorphism is an
isomorphism if and only

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.290
if the matrix is invertible.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.970
This is like poetry I thought,
and I leaned in to hear more.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.350
She was eloquent and she was
passionate and what she did was,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.720
as soon as I gave up the idea I
couldn't understand a word she was

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.630 position:56%
saying, she cracked open the airlock

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.740
and showed me a glimpse
of her world.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.740
And I now know that
it's a beautiful world.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.230
What she was doing was trying to
find that place in every curve

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:28.400
that is singular and she was trying
to express more perfectly the truth

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.830
about the world, and I
realized that that is what I

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.810
as a novelist also must do, is
to delve in and find the singular

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.420
and get as close as possible to
the truth of the world as I can.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.150
And so it's a beautiful world
but I can't live in her world

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.790 position:56%
because if she's got lungs I've got
gills, I work completely differently

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.420
and my work is all about words.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.290
I didn't start out as a novelist,
I started out as a journalist

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:03.320
and I loved every step I
took in that occupation.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.820 position:56%
But when my son was born 20 years
ago I realized I no longer wanted be

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.030
a foreign correspondent going off
on long, open ended assignments,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.080
and so I had to see if I
could do something else.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.400
And I wrote Year of
Wonders and lucky for me,

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.590
many of you wanted to read it.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.960
So I got to keep doing that.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.560
But I have that son to
thank for the inspiration

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.070
for my most recent
novel, The Secret Chord

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:38.570
because when he was just nine
years old he took the very unusual,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.120
I think, decision for
a boy of that age

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.670
that the one musical
instrument he was interested

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.190
in learning was the classical harp.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.870
I had been braced for drums
so I didn't resist the choice.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.190
But, it was watching him dwarfed

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:01.330
by his teacher's beautiful concert
instrument, that set me back

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.940
to thinking about David,
that avid boy harpist,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.110
that musician whose
music was so powerful

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.160
that it could soothe
the mentally ill

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.640
and even please God in
Heaven so we're told.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.100 position:56%
And I had been a Fine Arts major in
college and I'd been very interested

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.140
in the various depictions of David

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.590
in Italian Renaissance
and baroque art.

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:33.260
This shepherd, this warrior, this
musician, this complicated man,

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:39.610 position:56%
this man that we know, perhaps
before we know any other human being

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.990
in full from early
childhood to extreme old age,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.040
he's really the first
political biography we have.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.980
A man who is very recognizably
human without a lot

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:57.920
of supernatural interventions in
his life, and when I went back

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.290
and read the Books Samuel,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.200
I realized that absolutely
everything happens to him

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.630 position:56%
in his long life, every good
experience and every bad experience,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.820
every powerful emotion that the
human heart could encompass,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.310
and I wanted to tell the story.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.520
But I like to tell my stories
with a first person narrator,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.150
and I wasn't sure who that
should be in this case.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.160
I knew it couldn't be David himself

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.620
because he wouldn't have
enough objectivity to look

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.940
at his own character and he
certainly wouldn't be able

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:37.740
to effectively tell the story
of the women in his life

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.220 position:56%
because if he had understood them he
wouldn't have treated them the way

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.920
he did.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.700
And then I came across
two references in the Book

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:53.380
of Chronicles, intriguing
references to the Book of Nathan,

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:59.330
and those two quotes that tell
us that the life of David,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.910
all his acts from first to last,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.690
have been set down by the
prophet Nathan, really inspired me

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.320
because those of you that paid
attention in religious school,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.890
will remember that Nathan is
the one man who's brave enough

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.750
to confront the king
about his moral failings.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.760
He's the one who tells David

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.790
that he's completely
betrayed his own best self,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.490
tells him what the
consequences of this will be.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:38.670 position:56%
And when you read his ferocious
castigation of the king, you wonder,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.660
what was the career
path for that guy?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.970
Because usually if you say
that kind of a thing to a king,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.640
that's the last thing
you get to say.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.250
But what's wonderful
about this story is

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:58.290
that David accepts
responsibility, accepts the truth

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.090
of what Nathan has said,
and how unusual is that?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.790
&gt;&gt; When have you ever
heard a politician say yep!

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.830
You got me, I did it!

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:13.860
No, it's always, I did not
have sex with that woman.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.700
He said, yeah I did and
that was really wrong

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.000
and I shouldn't have
killed her husband,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.760
and then he brings Nathan
closer so that at the end

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.960
of his life it's not Nathan that
he turns to, to resolve the issues

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.320
of succession and to make sure
that the king who succeeds him

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.570
on this throne is the one
son who should do that,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.560
because he's Solomon who's
come down to us as the bi-word

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.860
for wisdom and good governance.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.540
So, I knew my narrator
was going to be Nathan,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.690
but I wasn't sure what his
voice would sound like.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.080
I imagined at first that he
would have a very tough voice,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.430
that this would be a power
broker, a mafia consigliere,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:58.520
or maybe a Thomas Cromwell,
Henry the 8th's dark imminence.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.170
And then I thought maybe
something really creepy.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:10.150
But Nathan didn't want
to be any of those guys,

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.480
he refused to speak
in that voice to me.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.740
He had something completely
different in mind.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.710
He wanted to sound like these guys.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.120
He wanted to be unworldly,
he wanted to be idealistic,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.740
he wanted to be the light in
the story, and of course he does

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.910
because he's a Hebrew prophet.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:37.290
And that's what these guys are
like, that is how they roll.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.460
They're the ones who bring us to
our best self, so I had to give

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.200
in and let him be that guy.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.040
But then how was I going
to research this book?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.400
Usually I dive into archives and
read all the journals and letters

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.110
and court reChords where
you can hear people

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.880
in verbatim testimony
speaking in their own voice,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.830
so I can get the sound of
the language in my head.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.640
That wasn't going to be
possible in this case,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.920
so I realized that I would have
to do a more experiential kind

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.480
of research, and I took a leaf out
of Jim Crace's book and headed off

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.320
to Israel with my youngest son.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.850
I told you there would be
family photos, and here's one.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.030
I love exploiting my children
as research assistants.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.350
They see things very freshly
and they ask questions

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.970
that we wouldn't think to ask,
so I thought, what can we do

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.070
that is similar to
the kinds of things

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.160
that David might have
done 3,000 years ago?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.330
Not the adultery and
the murder so much.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.980
Herding sheep was the first one
because of course so many leaders

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.630
in the bible start off as
shepherds and I was wondering,

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.350
what is it about the business
about herding sheep that turns

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.890
out to be a great entry level
position for future CEOs of Israel?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:02.190
And I found in that long
afternoon that my son

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.480
and I were herding those sheep
on the hillside in Israel,

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.900
that you have to understand
those that you're trying to lead.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.050
We were trying to separate the
sheep from the goats which turns

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:19.060
out to be just as hard in real
life as the metaphor suggests.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.290
And you can't do it
until you understand

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.230
that goats react differently
to pressure to sheep.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.880
So once we had that insight, I
realized that I was going to use

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.520
that and let David have that
kind of insight about leadership.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.510
So we then did other things,
we stayed in the desert

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.820 position:56%
in goat head tents, eating the kinds
of foods mentioned in the bible,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.920 position:56%
and we drew water from ancient
systems to feel the effort involved,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.790
and we rode camels only
to find when we got home

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.380 position:56%
that we'd got a sore backside for
nothing because there were no camels

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.020
in Second Iron Age Israel, and
mules were what we should have been

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.320
focused on.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:09.000 position:56%
And we went to the places associated
with David, like the Valley of Elah

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.190
where he battled Goliath, and
the caves of En Gedi where he hid

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:19.000
out from King Saul, and we went
into the dig under the old city,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.140 position:56%
where excavations from the
Davidian period are being unearthed,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:32.320
and I have to say that
there's a lot of tension there

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.350
because Israeli archaeologists
are doing the digging

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.160
but it actually runs under
a Palestinian neighborhood

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.250
and that's causing
their houses to collapse

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.640
and there's tremendous
tension around this site.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.800
And it just reminds
you that the battles

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.240
that David fought are
still going on.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.730
So I've only got a few minutes
left and I want to leave time

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.950
for questions so I'm just
going to go quickly to say

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:02.550
that my baby harpist grew
up to be a big harpist.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.430
See, I warned you there
would be family photos.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.840
And on the way, he was having
his Bar Mitzvah and because

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.350 position:56%
of the connection with David and the
harp, he decided to play his harp

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:19.200
at his Bar Mitzvah, and he chose
to play a beautiful arrangement

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.410
of Leonard Cohen's
wonderful song Hallelujah.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.170
And so I not only owe him
the idea for the book,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.650
I also owe him the title because
the first line of that song

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.700
of course is, they say
there was a secret chord

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.670
that David played and
it pleased the lord.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.290 position:56%
But it's the seldom sung later verse
that I think really sums up David,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:45.770
the verse that goes, there's a
blaze of light in every word,

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.400
it doesn't matter which you heard,
the holy or the broken, Hallelujah.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:56.260
And David is holy and broken, and
I think we all are to some extent,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:01.380
and I think that that geniality and
that complexity is what makes him

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.280
such a fascinating figure and
keeps drawing us back to him.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.080
Thank you

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:17.270
[ Applause ]

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.920
&gt;&gt; And we've got microphones here.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.520
And I urge you to all become a
part of the permanent collection

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.910
of the Library of Congress.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:29.380
I'm happy to take questions,
comments, abuse, of any kind.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:35.380
And don't be shy.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.330
No. No. Yes.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.430
&gt;&gt; So I just want to say,
first, I love your books,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.160
I've read all of your fiction.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.180
And one of the things I love
about the historical fiction is

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.570
that you take a subject about which
there's very little or nothing,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.730
like The Year of Wonders, and
you weave this whole story

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.030
and so you're not really messing

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.650
with history, because
I love history.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.000
So I love that about your books.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.330
That and many things.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.000
And I've read The Secret Chord,
and the minute I finished it,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.990
I felt bereaved because I'm going
to have to wait for your next book

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.950
and I would just like to know how
long are you going to make us wait?

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.810
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Well thank you
very much, and I love what you said

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.250
because I do try and follow the
line of fact as far as it leads,

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.210
so I sort of need two
things for a book,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.380
I need an intriguing true story
from the historical records,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.860 position:56%
something that you wouldn't make up,
because you know, I love Mark Twain,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.210
and Mark Twain said fiction must
be plausible and truth needn't be.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.830
So I'm always looking for those
implausible truths like the fact

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.110
that a village quarantined itself
voluntarily during the plague

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.660
or that a Native American
raised in his own language

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.490 position:56%
and culture mastered Latin and
Greek and graduated Harvard in 1665.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.820
If I made them up it wouldn't
be so exciting and the fact is

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.230
that those things happened, but
then the second thing I need is

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.280
that there not be too
much known about them

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.150 position:56%
because if Caleb the Native American
had kept a journal of his time

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.850
at Harvard, there would be
no space for me and it's

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.620 position:56%
because we don't know much about his
experience, the only way to engage

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.950
with it is through imagination.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:22.940
So, I need the void as well as
the skeleton of intriguing facts,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.250
so yes, thank you for that.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:28.010
But I do like to make sure
that as far as we can know,

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.750
I go to a lot of trouble
to know before I start.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.340
It's one diving off into invention.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.910
And how long until the next book?

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.260
I wish it was going to be quicker.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:43.320
It does seem to take me about
the same amount of time to do all

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.140
of them, which seems to
be about three years, so.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.150
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Thank you.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:57.780
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say
thank you for coming.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.560
As a hopeful Australian
writer of historical fiction,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.160
I very much enjoy listening to you.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.950
You talked a little bit about
what you need for your inspiration

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.520
to write, and I was curious
to hear about how you choose?

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.140
You know, you write about all
these quite diverse subjects

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.460
and there's just so much out there,
like there's stories everywhere.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.060
How do you choose what
to write about?

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.810
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: So, it
just seems, sometimes, you know,

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.640
I think Ernest Hemingway had
it right, and he said an idea

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.570
for a novel can be something
you're lucky enough to overhear

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.460
or the wreck of your
whole damn life.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.250
And luckily for me it's been in
the former rather than the latter.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.080
And the novel I'm working on now,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.580
actually literally was something
I overheard at a lunch table.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.490
I was at Plymouth Plantation,
they had invited me because they

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.400
like Caleb's Crossing and they
had it mind to pitch me an idea

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.100
for a novel about somebody
from the plantation,

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.400
and they knew a lot about her.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.680 position:56%
And it doesn't usually work very
well if somebody brings you an idea,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.990
because they're giving you
that idea because it's just

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.760
like something you already did
and I don't want to do that again,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.600
and I've exhausted my, you
know, enough Calvinists already.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.100 position:56%
So, but while I was at this lunch I
started overhearing the conversation

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.210 position:56%
at the other end of the table and it
was an incredibly intriguing story

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.040
about a horse from the 1860s.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.040
&gt;&gt; And I found myself not even
pretending to pay attention

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.840
to the nice people from
Plymouth Plantation and wanting

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.140
to say could you shut up?

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.850
I need to hear what he's saying.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.310 position:56%
So I will be writing that book next.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:44.540
But they do just seem to sort
of, flutter in the window

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.750
like lost birds sometimes.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.050
Thank you.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.330
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks for being here and
thanks for re-Tweeting my Tweets.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.130
I've never missed you
at The Book Festival

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.810
and I've ready every
single one of your books.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Well thank you.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.880
&gt;&gt; So in the three years that
we wait until the next novel,

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.090
what authors or subjects
inspire you,

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.770 position:56%
and what authors would you recommend

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.250
that we maybe pick
up in the interim?

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.550
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Oh,

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:16.140
well I think my favorite living
writer is here this weekend,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.170
and that's Marilyn Robinson.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.580
I'm completely in awe of her.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.900
I think Gilead and
the Gilead trilogy

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.130
in fact is just an
amazing work of art.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.550
And similarly, I think
Hilary Mantel,

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:35.470
I wish she would stop doing screen
play adaptions and plays and get

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.370
on with finishing that
trilogy about Cromwell

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.030
because I cannot wait to read it.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:47.350
I read a tremendous amount of
fiction, I just gobble it up.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.180 position:56%
And I like nonfiction, also memoirs.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.400
I just read a book that might
not have crossed the transom

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.360
of many people here,
it's the first novel

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.910
by a New Zealand novelist called
Anna Smaill called The Chimes.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:10.870
It's dystopian future, where
the world is organized by music.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.130
And I thought it was one of the
most remarkably inventive things

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.430
I've read.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.730
She's a poet and a violinist,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.410
so she knows what she's doing
with language and music.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.980
So I loved that.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:27.460
And then a little memoir
called The Point of Vanishing,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.700
which is a true story of
a young man at Harvard

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.270
who has a horrible accident that
destroys his sight in one eye

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.140
and sends him into a tailspin,
and he goes off to live

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.330
in the woods, a bit like Thoreau.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.050
And he's a worthy successor
to Thoreau.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:48.950
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: So, yeah.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.050
Your books have been a thread
throughout the four different

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.810
generations of my family, and
we really enjoy reading them,

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.010
and each of us our favorite.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.520
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks:
Oh, that's lovely.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I was curious, I imagine
writing a book, each is so distinct,

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:13.140
but if in the different processes
of writing your different novels,

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.690
if there was one novel that
you enjoyed writing the most?

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.390
And if there's one you enjoyed
the final product the most?

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.500
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: You
know, it sounds like a cliché

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.960
but they really are like your
children, and it's really hard

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.110
to pick a favorite of them, because
they're bound up with that time

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.050
in your life, and you remember
exactly where you were,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.300
what room you were in when
you were writing them,

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.090
and how old your children
were, and the various struggles

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.560
that you had around writing them.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:47.020
And you know, you always love your
first novel, I have to love March

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.420
because it brought
me the Pulitzer Prize

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.630 position:56%
and there's nothing wrong with that.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.240
You know, people sometimes
say doesn't it put a lot

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.540
of pressure on you?

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.840
And I go, hell no.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.390
And you know, so it was
so outside of anything

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.660
that I even would have
imagined was possible.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.430
I was so shocked the day the phone
rang and it was an old colleague

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.580
of mine actually, from the
newspaper I used to work at,

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.080
The Wall Street Journal, and
he thought I already knew,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.520
and he's like this is so great.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.820
This is so wonderful.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.400
And I thought, it's three o'clock
and Ken's been out to a long lunch.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.350
What is he talking about?

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.170
And he said, you don't know
you got the Pulitzer Prize?

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.960
And I said don't be so ridiculous,
I haven't done any journalism.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.610
And I hung up on him.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:34.410
And then you know, of course,
everything explodes and I realize

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:38.370
that as unlikely as it seemed, this
was true, and somebody's coming

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.690 position:56%
to the door with flowers, and I'm
on the phone to a newspaper reporter

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.100
and my son, who is eight at
the time, opened the door

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:50.840
and said mom can't
come, she's really busy.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.510
She just got the Pulitzer Surprise!

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:01.050
[ Laughter ]

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.360
&gt;&gt; So I'm sorry, I can't
really narrow it down to one.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.560
Okay, so I'm getting the wind up.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.190
Can we just take one more question?

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.490
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:12.790
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Okay.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.090
&gt;&gt; I've loved your
writing, all your books,

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.860 position:56%
but one I recently finished was
Caleb's Crossing and I love the part

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.290 position:56%
where the scholars are all so skinny

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.920
because they can't afford
anything at Harvard.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.300 position:56%
They can't afford to feed them even.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.600
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: Yes.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.090
&gt;&gt; I just wondered how they
did not have an endowment?

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:32.540
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks:
No, not at that time.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.710
&gt;&gt; I just wondered what was the
overheard conversation or the.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.480
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks: That
was a notation on a map

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.050
of the island of Martha's Vineyard.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.940
We had just moved there as year
round residents and I was intrigued

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.570
to have Native American
neighbors for the first time,

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:52.210 position:56%
so I went to the tribal headquarters
and got all the materials,

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.310
and that's a fantastic
tribe you know,

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.250
because they've never been
displaced from their land

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.660
and they're fantastic
custodians of their culture.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.780
And they had this map of the
island with all the notations

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.760
of the place names in
the Wampanoag language,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.880
and places of significance,
and right near

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.820
where we were living it
said birthplace of Caleb,

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.930
first Native American
graduate of Harvard.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:18.880
And my eye couldn't actually
accept that the next bit was 1665.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.660
I had to read it as
1965 because it was

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.690
so beyond what I would
have considered possible.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.080
And then when I found
out it really was 1665,

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.540
I was, how did that happen?

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.840
And what was it like?

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.160
And then I was off to the races.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.940
And that's generally how it does.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.540
&gt;&gt; Geraldine Brooks:
Thank you very much.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.090
[ Applause ]

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.010
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
