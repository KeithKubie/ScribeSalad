00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.690
- [Instructor] When we look
inside of eukaryotic cells,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.440
we see membrane-bound organelles,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.320
and some of these
membrane-bound organelles

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.410
are particularly interesting.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.420
For example, here is a
diagram of a chloroplast

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.140
that are found in plant or algal cells,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.310
and we know that this is

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.640
where the photosynthesis takes place,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.740
but what's really interesting
above and beyond that

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.530
is that it seems that chloroplasts have

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.740
a lot of the machinery necessary

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.030
for being a prokaryotic cell on its own.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.690
We don't see it acting on its
own, but it has its own DNA.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.690
It has ribosomes, which
we know are the site

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.490
where we go from messenger RNA to protein.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.710
Similarly, another interesting
membrane-bound organelle

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.910
that we see in eukaryotic cells,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.477
and this would include even animal cells

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:55.250
and the cells in your and
my bodies, are mitochondria,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.940
and mitochondria are often viewed

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.530
as the energy factories
of eukaryotic cells,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.320
where we can leverage oxygen
in order to produce ATP,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.110
and like chloroplasts,
mitochondria has its own DNA.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160
It also has mitochondrial ribosomes.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.530
Here are some just diagrams

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.350
of how mitochondria might look

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.380
inside of a larger eukaryotic cell.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.930
And so, evolutionary biologists

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.530
for many decades looked at this

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.510
and said, well, why do these things exist?

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.020
Why do they almost look like
prokaryotic cells on their own?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.690
And there's even examples
of prokaryotic cells,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.020
independent prokaryotic bacteria,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.730
that live in symbiosis
inside of other cells,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.270
and they look an awful lot

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.880
like mitochondria and chloroplasts.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.800
And so, if we fast-forward to the 1960s,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.990
someone named Lynn Margulis comes

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.600
on the scene with endosymbiosis theory,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.810
and her view is, is that these
membrane-bound organelles

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.780
like mitochondria and chloroplasts,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.500
if we go deep into our evolutionary past,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.990
say, two and a half billion years ago,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.540
their ancestors were actually

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.220
independent prokaryotic organisms

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.110
that could produce energy
aerobically, or using oxygen,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.460
and precursors to what
we would consider today

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.990
to be modern eukaryotic cells

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.910
that might have already had
some membrane-bound structures,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.850
like a nucleus and
maybe some other things,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
that they could only metabolize
things anaerobically.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.430
They couldn't leverage oxygen,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.360
while these other characters
could leverage oxygen,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.220
and then they could have become symbionts,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.900
where the one that could leverage oxygen

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.310
to produce more energy

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.830
would get engulfed into the larger cell,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.230
and that larger cell is able

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170
to provide nutrients and protection,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.730
while the smaller cell
that's engulfed inside

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.450
of it is able to better
metabolize the nutrients

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.340
and leverage oxygen to
produce more energy,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.940
and that over time, this
symbiotic relationship

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.010
became even more connected,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
so that the smaller organism
could not operate by itself,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.170
that it lost some of its DNA

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.230
that was necessary to act independently,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.240
and some of it might
have gotten incorporated

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.320
into the DNA of the larger cell.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.560
And those smaller organisms
are what eventually evolved

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.640
into what we consider
today to be mitochondria.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.450
This is a fascinating theory,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.460
and it's actually been proven out.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.320
When Lynn Margulis first
published this in the late 1960s,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.770
she wasn't taken that seriously,
but in the decades since,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.780
it's been validated as we've looked

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.820
at the DNA structures of
mitochondria and chloroplasts,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.270
that this actually is
the most likely theory

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.610
of how they emerged in our cells.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.810
And so, it's just a fascinating glimpse

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.850
of evolution in general.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.900
We talk a lot about natural selection

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.780
and the role of variation and mutations,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.030
but Lynn Margulis introduces another idea

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.920
that could catalyze evolution,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.240
and that's that of symbiosis,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.030
and we see symbiosis
throughout the natural world.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.320
And her argument is,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.870
sometimes those symbionts
can become so codependent

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.993
on each other that they
merge into one organism.
