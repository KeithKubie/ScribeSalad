00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.100
The condition is known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans
Progressiva (FOP) or “Stone Man Syndrome”.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.930
It affects an estimated 1 out of every 2 million
people beginning when they are children, and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:29.930
to date there is no cure.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.219
The telltale sign of someone with this condition
is a small big toe that is abnormally formed,

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.149
often pointing at an odd angle.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.969
As the baby grows into a child, they typically
will start developing very painful nodules

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.570
around their back, head, neck, and shoulders,
generally triggered when the babies or children

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.940
fall or otherwise bump into something.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.230
These nodules will eventually turn to bone,
but because this condition is so rare, the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.789
condition is misdiagnosed about 80% of the
time.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.460
Generally most doctor’s first think the
nodules are cancerous and biopsies are usually

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.640
performed, as well as radiation treatment
and other surgeries, such as the case with

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.190
Ashley Kurpiel, who was diagnosed with cancer
and had her arm amputated at her shoulder

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.070
when she was just three years old, even though
she really just had FOP.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.790
Besides potential amputations when they weren’t
necessary, these surgeries will make the condition

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.070
itself worse.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.040
FOP flare-ups are triggered by trauma to muscles,
even just tripping and falling as kids do

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.471
all the time, is sufficient to trigger a flare-up
that will result in the development of bone

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.070
on their muscles and connective tissues.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.380
In addition to muscle trauma, things like
getting the common cold or flu can also cause

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.380
flare-ups.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.420
Even if the condition is correctly diagnosed,
there’s little that can be done to help

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.930
alleviate the problem as surgery is not an
option and there is no cure, as noted.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940
As the person with FOP ages, slowly their
ability to move is taken away from them, “entombing

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.570
a patient in a skeleton of heterotopic bone”.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.240
“Even seemingly minor things like preschool
immunizations, injections for dental work,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.070
[or] minor bumps and bruises from falling
off a bicycle, can cause these children to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.670
lock up their jaw, lock up their joints that
never move again,” says Dr. Fred Kaplan,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.909
known as “Uncle Fred” within the FOP community,
one of the few doctors who has dedicated his

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.439
life to finding a cure for FOP.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.359
As he states, “My lifelong goal since I’ve
started working on FOP is not just to modify

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.629
the symptoms but to change the course of the
disease.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.209
And eventually stop it.”

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.190
In the extreme case, such as Fop sufferer
Henry Eastlack, they lose the ability to move

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.190
at all.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.860
In his final days, shortly before his 40th
birthday, Henry’s ability to “move”

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.840
was limited to moving his lips slightly, eyes,
and tongue.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.209
But even before this happens, the condition
can become extremely debilitating, even life

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.269
threatening.

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.909
For instance, by the age of 17, Tiffany Linker
from North Carolina, had to start wearing

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.639
an oxygen mask as extra bone developed around
her rib cage, constricting her ability to

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.280
expand her lungs.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.030
Tiffany was the first of now over 500 children
and adults (of the known 700+ cases) Dr. Kaplan

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.829
has treated for FOP.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.079
Tiffany had previously undergone numerous
surgeries and chemotherapy for what doctors

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.019
suspected was a rare form of cancer.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.819
Finally, when no treatment worked, Tiffany’s
parents were told she’d be dead within two

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.819
weeks.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.769
But, of course, she didn’t have cancer at
all.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.910
She had FOP.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.829
Kaplan’s work with Tiffany and others helped
inspire him to dedicate his life to the eradication

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.079
of this condition.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.099
As he said, “I was watching a metamorphosis
before my eyes.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.939
I was seeing a normal child turn into a child
who was imprisoned in a second skeleton — literally

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.939
imprisoned in this cage of bone.”

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.999
Of her condition, Tiffany stated in an interview
in 2006,

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.540
A flare-up can happen overnight while you’re
sleeping.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.010
Like, you’ll be walking around one day,
and you’ll go to bed and the next day you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.169
won’t be able to move.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.379
That’s how fast it works…

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.400
(As to how it feels to have FOP) I would say,
let me tie your arms to your sides where you

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.280
can’t move them and then put a neck brace
and a back brace where you won’t be able

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.559
to move and then stay in a wheelchair all
the time, and then tell me how you feel.

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:03.160
Sadly, a few years after this interview, Tiffany
lost the ability to walk, and on July 30,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.790
2012 passed away at the age of just 23.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.079
Many who suffer from FOP have to eventually
make the decision as to whether to stay in

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.250
a wheel chair at all times as their condition
worsens, so that they don’t end up being

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.380
locked in a straight bodied position.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.709
There is finally some hope for people with
FOP.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.860
In 2006, Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues at
the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.550
discovered the gene that causes FOP, specifically
a mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.000
Among other things, this gene helps control
the development of bones and muscles, as well

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
as the gradual replacement of certain cartilage
with bone as you age.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.449
People with FOP have a mutation in one of
the two copies of this gene in each cell (one

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.650
normal copy, one mutated copy).

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.729
This results in the body “repairing” damaged
fibrous tissue with bone.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.050
For those interested in the ultra-technical
version of the cause, it is as follows:

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.630
A mutation in the gene ACVR1 is responsible
for the disease.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.400
ACVR1 encodes activin receptor type-1, a BMP
type-1 receptor.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.250
The mutation changes codon 206 from arginine
to histidine in the ACVR1 protein.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.260
This causes endothelial cells to transform
to mesenchymal stem cells and then to bone.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.580
This discovery is not only a big deal for
the few who suffer from FOP, but also because

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.949
research into curing FOP may well end up helping
those who suffer from osteoporosis, bone fractures,

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.669
and other such similar conditions.

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.920
While there is still no cure, this discovery
has opened the door for possible cures or

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.759
treatments of FOP, such as one developed very
recently by Dr. Josef Kaplan, Dr. Eileen Shore,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.569
and Dr. Frederick Kaplan.

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.340
They engineered an RNA molecule such that
it would “silence” the mutated ACVR1 gene,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.949
while leaving properly working one in the
cell alone.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.139
When the treatment is complete, it would leave
the non-mutated gene to work normally, thus

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.700
stopping the advancement of FOP.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.340
While still a long way from a cure, this method
at least provides some hope for FOP patients.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.689
Further, clinical trials have very recently
begun using the retinoic acid receptor gamma

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.660
palovarotene to inhibit this type of abnormal
bone development.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.470
In animal testing, at least, this latter treatment
has shown some promise, with human trials

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.470
now underway.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.470
Now normally I wouldn’t try to solicit donations
to something on Today I Found Out, but because

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.759
the condition effects so few people, very
little money is available for researching

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.554
FOP and finding cures, with a large percentage
of the funds available for finding a cure

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:28.639
for FOP raised by family members of those
with FOP (of which there are only about 700-ish

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.129
people diagnosed world-wide).

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.310
Further, there are only about 3 principle
doctors + support staff like doctoral students

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:54.560
and the like working on finding 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.830
a cure.
