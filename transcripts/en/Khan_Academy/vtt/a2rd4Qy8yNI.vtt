00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
- [Instructor] We have
already seen a situation

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:05.517
multiple times where there
is some parameter associated

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:07.625
with a population, maybe
it's the proportion of a

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.884
population that supports
a candidate, maybe it's

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.350
the mean of a population.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.358
The mean height of all
the people in the city.

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:15.423
And we've determined
that's it's unpractical or

00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:18.202
there's no way for us to know
the true population parameter.

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:21.460
But, we can try to estimate
it by taking a sample size.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.627
So, we take n samples and
then we calculate a statistic

00:00:26.573 --> 00:00:28.071
based on that.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:30.476
We've also seen that, not
only can we calculate the

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:33.276
statistic, which is trying
to estimate this parameter,

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:36.453
but we can construct a
confidence interval about that

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.541
statistic based on some confidence level.

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.718
And so, that confidence
interval would look something

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:44.620
like this.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.666
It would be the value of the
statistic that we have just

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:51.055
calculated plus or minus
some margin of error.

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:55.488
And so, we'll often say this
critical value, z, and this

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.886
will be based on the number
of standard deviations we want

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:59.763
to go above and below that statistic.

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:02.484
And so, then we'll multiply
that times the standard

00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:06.651
deviation of the sampling
distribution for that statistic.

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:11.413
Now, what we'll see is
we often don't know this.

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:13.164
To know this, you
oftentimes even need to know

00:01:13.164 --> 00:01:14.380
this parameter.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.095
For example, in the situation
where the parameter that we're

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.933
trying to estimate and construct
confidence intervals for

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.054
is say, the population proportion.

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:23.839
What percentage of the
population supports a certain

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:24.924
candidate?

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:27.730
Well, in that world, the statistic
is the sample proportion.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.854
So, we would have the sample
proportion plus or minus

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:35.903
z star times, well we can't calculate this

00:01:35.903 --> 00:01:38.428
unless we know the population proportion,

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:41.335
so instead we estimate this
with the standard error

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.793
of the statistic, which, in this case,

00:01:43.793 --> 00:01:47.053
is p hat times one minus p hat.

00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:50.069
The sample proportion times
one minus the sample proportion

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.425
over our sample size.

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:55.012
If the parameter we're trying
to estimate is the population

00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:58.155
mean, then our statistic is
going to be the sample mean.

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:01.544
So, in that scenario we're
going to be looking at,

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:05.711
our statistic is our sample
mean plus or minus z star.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.969
Now, if we knew the standard
deviation of this population,

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.570
we would know what the standard
deviation of the sampling

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.784
distribution of our statistic is.

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:18.708
It would be equal to the
standard deviation of our

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:22.875
population times the square
root of our sample size.

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:26.041
But, we often will not know this.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.692
In fact, it's very unusual to know this.

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:31.365
And so, sometimes, you'll say,
okay, if we don't know this,

00:02:31.365 --> 00:02:34.372
let's just figure out the
sample standard deviation of our

00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:35.730
sample here.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.369
So, instead, we'll say, okay,
let's take our sample mean

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.036
plus or minus z star

00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:45.028
times the sample standard deviation

00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:48.323
of our sample, which we can
calculate, divided by the

00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:50.105
square root of n.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.081
Now, this might seem pretty
good if we're trying to

00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:57.652
construct a confidence
interval for our sample,

00:02:57.652 --> 00:03:02.518
for our mean, but, it
turns out, that this is not

00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:06.995
not so good because it turns
out that this right over here

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:10.740
is going to actually
underestimate the actual interval,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.409
the true margin of error you
need for your confidence level.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.480
And so, that's why statisticians
have invented another

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.355
statistic.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:20.824
Instead of using z, they call
it t and instead of using

00:03:20.824 --> 00:03:23.794
a z-table, they use a t-table.

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:25.988
Now, we're going to see
this in future videos.

00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:28.838
And so, if you are actually
trying to construct a confidence

00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:31.088
interval for a sample mean,

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.730
and you don't know the true
standard deviation of your

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.626
population, which is normally the case,

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:40.012
instead of doing this, what
we're going to do is we're going

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.739
to take our sample mean, plus
or minus, and our critical

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.233
value, we'll call that t star
times our sample standard

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.742
deviation, which we can
calculate, divided by the

00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.050
square root of n.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.480
And so, the real, functional
difference is that this

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.144
actually is going to give us
the confidence interval that

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.652
actually has the level of
confidence that we want.

00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:05.346
If we want a 95% level of
confidence, if we keep computing

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:09.104
this over and over again
for multiple samples,

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:13.954
that roughly 95% of the time,
this interval will contain

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.037
our true population mean.

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:19.256
And, to functionally do it,
and we'll do it in future

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:22.732
videos, you really just have
to look up a t-table instead

00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:23.815
of a z-table.
