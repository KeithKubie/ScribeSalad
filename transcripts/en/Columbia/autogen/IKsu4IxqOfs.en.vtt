I'm sorry the thing was on the on the
use of the word man the stuff that I

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:36.270
use of the word man the stuff that I
 

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.060
use of the word man the stuff that I
talked about at the beginning since the

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480
biblical passages were written
 

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.170
biblical passages were written
originally in Hebrew has anybody looked

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180
originally in Hebrew has anybody looked
 

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.420
originally in Hebrew has anybody looked
into the the Hebrew medium it's a very

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:44.430
into the the Hebrew medium it's a very
 

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.150
into the the Hebrew medium it's a very
very important point and I I should have

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160
very important point and I I should have
 

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.770
very important point and I I should have
done something I'm sure something has

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780
done something I'm sure something has
 

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.400
done something I'm sure something has
been done it hasn't percolated through

been done it hasn't percolated through
 

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:53.960
been done it hasn't percolated through
in the way that would suggest it

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:53.970
in the way that would suggest it
 

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.600

decisively settles anything and I think

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:56.610
decisively settles anything and I think
 

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.690
decisively settles anything and I think
it's a fact that many languages and

00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700
it's a fact that many languages and
 

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.370
it's a fact that many languages and
probably Hebrew is among them Mike I

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380
probably Hebrew is among them Mike I
 

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.260

don't know whether you know they do have

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:03.270
don't know whether you know they do have
 

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.540
don't know whether you know they do have
a generic term for human being that does

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:05.550
a generic term for human being that does

a generic term for human being that does
also can also have the narrow usage so

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:09.450
also can also have the narrow usage so
 

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:13.270
also can also have the narrow usage so
my hunch is that the Hebrew by itself

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280
my hunch is that the Hebrew by itself
 

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.460
my hunch is that the Hebrew by itself
simply as a matter of vocabulary doesn't

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:16.470
simply as a matter of vocabulary doesn't
 

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:18.290
simply as a matter of vocabulary doesn't
settle the matter and that one has to

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300
settle the matter and that one has to
 

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.620
settle the matter and that one has to
look at the at the the text and the

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:21.630
look at the at the the text and the
 

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.900
look at the at the the text and the
context and the particular argument and

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:23.910
context and the particular argument and
 

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:25.310
context and the particular argument and
this particular reflection on the

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:25.320
this particular reflection on the
 

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.820
this particular reflection on the
argument in order to get the in order to

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:28.830
argument in order to get the in order to
 

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:32.720
argument in order to get the in order to
get the conclusion so it's I mean the

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:32.730
get the conclusion so it's I mean the
 

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.640
get the conclusion so it's I mean the
moment you mentioned it maybe it became

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:34.650
moment you mentioned it maybe it became
 

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:36.170
moment you mentioned it maybe it became
clear to me that this is something that

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180
clear to me that this is something that
 

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.270
clear to me that this is something that
one ought to look into what Locke is

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280
one ought to look into what Locke is
 

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.800
one ought to look into what Locke is
doing is not so much meditating on the

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:41.810
doing is not so much meditating on the
 

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:45.650
doing is not so much meditating on the
the Hebrew word as noticing that the

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660
the Hebrew word as noticing that the
 

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.840
the Hebrew word as noticing that the
hebrew word is associated with a plural

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:47.850
hebrew word is associated with a plural
 

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.660
hebrew word is associated with a plural
pronoun so man as a safe let us make man

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:50.670
pronoun so man as a safe let us make man
 

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.960
pronoun so man as a safe let us make man
and let us give them authority over the

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:53.970
and let us give them authority over the
 

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.970
and let us give them authority over the
whole world and that association of the

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:55.980
whole world and that association of the
 

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.950
whole world and that association of the
word man with the plural pronoun is is

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960
word man with the plural pronoun is is
 

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.020
word man with the plural pronoun is is
certainly in the Hebrew original and

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:00.030
certainly in the Hebrew original and
 

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.080
certainly in the Hebrew original and
that's what lockers exploiting this was

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:03.090
that's what lockers exploiting this was
 

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:05.510
that's what lockers exploiting this was
spoken to them who is them Adam and Eve

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520

the reference of them must be the same

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500
the reference of them must be the same
 

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.890
the reference of them must be the same
as the reference of man and man and so

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900
as the reference of man and man and so
 

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.170
as the reference of man and man and so
on so it's that contextual relational

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180
on so it's that contextual relational
 

00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:39.010
on so it's that contextual relational
aspect that he talks about

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.020

many of the arguments that I pointed out
 

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.480
many of the arguments that I pointed out
seem if anything to give greater

view that all these differences are
 

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:12.470
view that all these differences are
consistent with basic equality it's

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480
consistent with basic equality it's
 

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.180
consistent with basic equality it's
clear that whatever he's saying about

have a strong religious but non
 

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.030
have a strong religious but non
scriptural argument so it's one of those

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040
scriptural argument so it's one of those
 

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.530
scriptural argument so it's one of those
cases where you know how sometimes

people say well natural or arguments are
supposed to parallel scriptural

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:40.290
supposed to parallel scriptural
 

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.440
supposed to parallel scriptural
arguments but it doesn't mean that

secular arguments parallel scriptural
 

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:47.480
secular arguments parallel scriptural
arguments the the argument can be non

arguments the the argument can be non
 

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.240
arguments the the argument can be non
scriptural but still be religious in its
