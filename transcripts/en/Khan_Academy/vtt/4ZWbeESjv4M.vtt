00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.100
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.620
we're gonna do a few examples

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.790
finding domains of functions.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.870
So let's say that we
have the function f of x

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.610
is equal to x plus five

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.490
over x minus two.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.380
What is going to be the domain

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.760
of this function?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.460
Pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.410
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.530
Now the domain is the set of all x values

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.530
that if we input it into this function,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.190
we're going to get a legitimate output.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.230
We're going to get a legitimate f of x.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.090
And so what's a situation
where we would not

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120
get a legitimate f of x?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.160
Well, if we input an x value

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.910
that makes this denominator equal to zero,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.520
then we're going to divide by zero

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.420
and that's going to be undefined.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.640
And so we could say that the domain,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.640
the domain here is all real values

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.880
of x, such that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.720
x minus two does not equal zero.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.850
Now typically, people
would not want to just see

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.570
that such that x minus
two does not equal zero,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.580
and so we can simplify this a little bit

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060
so that we just have an
x on the left hand side.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.910
So if we add two to both sides of this,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.300
we would get, actually,
let me just do that.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.580
Let me add two to both sides.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.450
So x minus two not equaling zero

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.520
is the same thing as x not equaling two,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.100
and you could have done
that in your head, as well.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.150
If you wanted to keep x
minus two from being zero,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.090
x just can't be equal to two,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.550
and so typically, people
would say that the domain here

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.150
is all real values of x

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.370
such that x does not equal two.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.560
Let's do another example.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.060
Let's say that we're told that g of x

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.060
is equal to the principle
root of x minus seven.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.230
What's the domain in this situation?

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.550
What's the domain of g of x?

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.300
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.173
Well, we could say that domain,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.770
the domain is going to
be all real values of x

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.870
such that, are we going to have

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.160
to put any constraints on this?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.150
Well when does a principle
root function break down?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.520
Well if we tried to
find the principle root,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.200
the square root of a negative number,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.550
well, that would then break down,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.120
and so x minus seven,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.710
whatever we have under the radical here

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.470
needs to be greater than or equal to zero,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.350
so such that x minus seven

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.030
needs to be greater than or equal to zero.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.620
Now another way to say
that is if we add seven

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.150
to both sides of that,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.220
that would be saying that
x needs to be greater than

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.030
or equal to seven,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.680
so let me just write it that way.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.760
So such that x is greater than

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.540
or equal to seven.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.320
So all I did is I said, all right,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.870
where could this thing break down?

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.230
Well, if I get x values
where this thing is negative,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.063
we're in trouble,

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:01.270
so x needs to be greater,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.830
x minus seven, whatever we have in this,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.780
under the radical needs to be greater than

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.180
or equal to zero,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.070
and so if you say that x minus seven

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.540
needs to be greater than or equal to zero,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.150
you add seven to both sides.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.690
You get x needs to be greater than

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.110
or equal to positive seven.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.400
Let's do one last example.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.660
Let's say we're told that h of x

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.840
is equal to x minus five squared.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.163
What's the domain here?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.070
So let me write this down.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.033
The domain is all real values of x.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.470
Now are we going to have to
constrain this a little bit?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.060
Well, is there anything
that would cause this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.583
to not evaluate to a defined value?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.140
Well, we can square any value.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.180
To give me any real
number and if I square it,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm gonna just get another real number,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.120
and so x minus five can
be equal to anything,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.010
and so x can be equal to anything.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
So here, the domain is
all real values of x.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.130
We didn't have to constrain it in any way

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.990
like we did the other two.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.340
The other two, when
you deal with something

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.230
in the denominator that
could be equal to zero,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.820
then you've got to make
sure that doesn't happen

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.210
'cause that would get
you an undefined value

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.360
and similarly, for a radical,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.860
you can't take the
square root of a negative

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.840
and so we would, once again,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.323
have to constrain on that.
