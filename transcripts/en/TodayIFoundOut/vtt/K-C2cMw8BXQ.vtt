00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:15.090
Bert Trautmann was born October 22, 1923 in
Bremen, Germany.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.750
Blue-eyed and blond haired, Trautmann was
the product of a tumultuous political climate

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.930
within the post-World War I country.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.810
He grew up surrounded by Nazi-ideology, including
blaming the Jews for the country’s economic

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.180
problems and believing certain Germans, such
as himself, were members of the “master

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.180
race.”

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.980
So it’s not surprising that he joined what
would become the “Hitler Youth” when he

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.180
was ten years old.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.740
He later said of this, “At that age you
just want adventure.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.030
It was just like the boy scouts.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.010
It was fun – sport, sport, sport.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.750
The idea that we were Nazis at the time is
nonsense.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.090
The indoctrination came later.”

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.210
And, indoctrinated he was.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.460
Although you didn’t know it, your mind was
influenced by the Nazi propaganda.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.280
You listened to the political speeches.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910
I would be lying if I said I wasn’t impressed.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.170
People have an affinity towards their own
and the Nazi’s were telling us that German

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.920
people were suffering apparent atrocities
in Poland or wherever.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.729
We didn’t realise the power of propaganda…

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.109
Hitler seized his chance in a country in turmoil.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.579
He said: ‘If you vote for me I’ll get
you this and I’ll do that’.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.420
People had no idea that he was preparing himself
for war and to occupy Europe.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.569
They just wanted food and prospects for their
families.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.759
When the war broke, he eagerly volunteered
for the Germany army.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.250
Most of my friends did too, we didn’t think
why or for what.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.590
Hitler had influenced the education system
to such an extent that we didn’t form opinions.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.149
We were indoctrinated.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.029
There was peer pressure to join the Hitler
Youth and then the forces proper…

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:43.299
People say ‘why?’, but when you are a
young boy war seems like an adventure.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.579
Then, when you’re involved in fighting it’s
very different, you see all the horrible things

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.039
that happen, the death, the bodies, the scariness.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.490
You can’t control yourself.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.600
Your whole body is shaking and you’re making
a mess in your pants.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.159
While he initially underwent training to become
a radio operator, he proved less than adept

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.929
at the tasks involved and switched gears to
become a paratrooper instead.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.920
As such, Trautmann, only a month out of paratrooper
training, joined other German soldiers in

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.780
invading Russia in June of 1941.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.819
He later stated, “We just followed orders,
we didn’t know that Moscow was the ultimate

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.400
target and we seldom had face-to-face contact
with the enemy.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.480
You could hear the guns but you never saw
people die.”

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.409
However, that October marked the eighteen
year old’s first experience with the brutality

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.599
of Hitler’s ideology, and the experience
left a mark on him.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.510
Trautmann and another soldier set out to investigate
gunshots heard in a nearby forest when they

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.379
stumbled upon a mass execution conducted by
the notorious Einsatzgruppen, also known as

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.379
the SS.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.640
It was hard to take in.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.099
There were trenches dug in the ground about
three metres deep and fifty metres long, and

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.930
people were being herded into them and ordered
to lie face down, men, women and children.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.750
Einsatzgruppen officers stood above, legs
astride, shouting; a firing squad was lined

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.250
up at the edge of the trenches, shooting into
them.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.819
For a while everything went quiet, then another
group was ordered forward and the firing squad

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.080
shot another salvo into the trench…

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.939
After witnessing this, the pair very carefully
crawled away from the site.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.000
Had they been discovered by the SS, they would
have wound up in the trench too.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480
After spending nearly three years on the Eastern
front, including being captured by the Russians

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.840
and later escaping, Trautmann’s regiment
was moved west.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.220
At this point, he was among about 100 soldiers
left in his regiment which was 6,000 strong

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.719
when it entered Russia.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.109
Then in March of 1945, he decided that he
had enough.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.550
Nearly everyone in his unit was dead anyway,
so he deserted from the German army.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.219
This was no small decision.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.200
He stated later, “I realised that war wasn’t
good.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.110
You couldn’t desert though because the SS
would pick you up if you strayed too far.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.790
They would shoot you or send you to the front
with the youngest soldiers.”

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.140
Nevertheless, with no papers granting leave,
he decided to risk it and head for his home

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.150
in Bremen, attempting to avoid soldiers from
both sides of the fight.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.110
“I wandered through fields until night fell.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.069
I found myself close to a village.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.090
It was unerringly quiet.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.629
Something didn’t quite seem right and I
went into a farmhouse for shelter.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.720
From nowhere, Americans jumped on me.”

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.280
They soon made him turn around with his arms
above his head.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.900
“Then I heard their guns click.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.969
They were about to shoot me.”

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:12.969
But they didn’t.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.220
“I’ve no idea why, but the officer just
told me to clear off.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.220
So I did.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.280
I ran and ran, over hedges and through fields…I
ran straight into six camouflaged British

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280
soldiers.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280
They were less forgiving.”

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.420
The young soldier who had been awarded five
medals, one of which was the Iron Cross (and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.060
all of which he would later toss in the garbage),
for his acts during the fighting was shipped

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.610
to England to the POW camp at Kempton racecourse,
and then transferred to Camp 180 in Northwich,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.610
Cheshire.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.820
However, a problem arose in the camp, not
so much from the POW’s towards their captors,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.730
or vice-versa, but rather between the Germans.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.730
Many of the captured POWs were ardent anti-Nazis,
while others were Nazi to the core, and then

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.270
there were those in-between.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.790
Needless to say, these groups didn’t get
along well and things came to blows regularly.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.020
Thus, the British had to divide them up, separating
them based on political opinion.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.670
The groups were, Group A: anti-Nazis; Groups
B: those who were more or less politically

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.810
neutral; and Group C: those who were thoroughly
indoctrinated with Nazi ideologies.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
Having been raised on Nazi propaganda, despite
being somewhat disillusioned at this point,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.000
Trautmann still held to these ideologies and
was placed in Group C. He later stated, “When

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.880
people ask me about life, I say my education
began when I got to England.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.250
I learnt about humanity, tolerance and forgiveness.”

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.250
His reeducation began by being forced to watch
a film about the Holocaust and learning of

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.410
the concentration camps.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.990
“My first thought was: ‘How can my countrymen
do things like that?'”

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.500
He was then made to work as a driver for a
Jewish officer, Sergeant Hermann Bloch, to

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.650
which he, “quickly came to see Bloch, and
every other Jew, as human beings.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.940
At first I sometimes lost my temper with him,
but, in time, I talked to him as if he was

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.570
just another English soldier.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.570
I liked him.”

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.630
At the same time he was learning to let go
of Nazi ideology, he also played soccer in

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.410
his free time, a hobby he had since childhood
where he’d once been given a certificate

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.530
of athletic excellence signed by the president
himself.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.710
The twenty-two year old quickly became a star
on the field at the camp.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.050
He played as a centre-half until his teammates
convinced him to switch to goalkeeper after

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.210
he suffered an injury.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.820
After being released from the POW camp in
1948, Trautmann decided against returning

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.410
to Germany, instead remaining in Great Britain,
working for the government disposing bombs.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.500
He also continued to play goalkeeper on the
semi-professional St. Helens Town team.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.410
Word quickly spread of his talent, and the
professional soccer team of Manchester City

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.940
Football Club offered him a position in 1949.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.190
But having a former highly decorated German
soldier on the team didn’t sit well with

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.110
the public so soon after the war, particularly
among the Jewish populace.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.820
A crowd of more than 20,000 people protested
outside of the stadium and letters arrived

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.270
that derided the team for signing a former
member of the Luftwaffe.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.850
However, Manchester’s Communal Rabbi, Dr.
Alexander Altman, wrote a letter which was

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.690
published in the Manchester Evening Chronicle
arguing against such blanket hate against

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.350
the country’s former enemies.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.160
He stated, “Despite the terrible cruelties
we suffered at the hands of the Germans, we

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.830
would not try to punish an individual German,
who is unconnected with these crimes, out

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.830
of hatred.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.440
If this footballer is a decent fellow, I would
say there is no harm in it.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.320
Each case must be judged on its own merits…”

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.520
As Trautmann’s conduct at the time was exemplary,
he eventually won over the fans.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.240
“Thanks to Altmann, after a month it was
all forgotten…

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.310
Later, I went into the Jewish community and
tried to explain things.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.740
I tried to give them an understanding of the
situation for people in Germany in the 1930s

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.280
and their bad circumstances…”

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.060
Of course, it helped that he was exceptional
at his position.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.990
For instance, in his first match in London,
he was initially booed and called all manner

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.400
of names by the crowd.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.490
However, after making several truly outstanding
saves during the match, at the end of the

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.140
game he received a standing ovation, even
from the opposing team who applauded him along

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.400
with the crowd as he walked off the pitch.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.510
He went on to play in over 500 games for the
organization over the next fifteen years and

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.610
is generally considered one of the greatest
goalkeepers in the history of the sport, and

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.170
the first of that position to ever win the
FWA Footballer of the Year Award, which he

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.540
accomplished in 1956- the same year perhaps
the most well-remembered event of his career

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.540
took place.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.040
The incident in question took place on May
5, 1956, during the FA Cup Final between Manchester

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.900
City and Birmingham City.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.830
In the second half of the game, the score
stood 3-1 Manchester City.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.220
Trautmann was guarding the goal when an opposing
player, Peter Murphy, attempted to score.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.740
Trautmann dove for the ball and ended up with
Murphy’s knee connecting behind his ear.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.340
The immediate result was simply that he saw
stars and experienced significant pain in

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.340
his head and neck.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.740
But due to a rule at the time that did not
allow players to be substituted, he continued

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.810
to play the last sixteen minutes of the game
“in a kind of fog.”

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.310
Despite this “fog,” he managed to make
several critical saves in the last minutes

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.020
of the match, saving the game for Manchester
City.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.071
During the medal ceremony after the game,
Prince Philip noted to Trautmann that his

00:08:56.071 --> 00:09:00.530
neck looked crooked, but Trautmann gave little
thought to the matter and even attended the

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.600
banquet after, despite the pain in his neck
and that he couldn’t turn his head.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.510
The next day, he did go to see a physician,
who told him it was nothing to worry about,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.210
and just a crick in his neck that would resolve
itself in time.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.350
But the pain continued and was so severe that
three days later he decided to get a second

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.350
opinion.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.950
That’s when an X-ray revealed that he had
five dislocated vertebrae, one of which had

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.450
completely cracked in two.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.440
The only reason he had avoided being paralyzed
and possibly killed after the initial kick

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.680
and as he dove around later in the game was
that one of the other dislocated vertebrae

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.140
had wedged itself tightly against the broken
one, preventing the two broken pieces from

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.310
moving.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.630
Trautmann continued to play after healing
from the injury, finally retiring as a player

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.700
in 1964.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.660
Among other awards he received in his lifetime,
the significant role he played in normalizing

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.460
British and German relations after World War
II led to Queen Elizabeth II appointing him

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.210
an “Honorary Officer of the Order of the
British Empire” in 2005.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:10:24.990
He died eight years later at the age of 89
at his home 

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:33.010
in Spain.
