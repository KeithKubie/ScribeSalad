I think what playboy aspired to from the

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779
I think what playboy aspired to from the
 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.870
I think what playboy aspired to from the
beginning was to represent the good life

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880
beginning was to represent the good life
 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.000
beginning was to represent the good life
and part of that was the attraction

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010
and part of that was the attraction
 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.400
and part of that was the attraction
between men and women and the romantic

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410
between men and women and the romantic
 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.009
between men and women and the romantic
part of life and that is also a very

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019
part of life and that is also a very
 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.040
part of life and that is also a very
strong human desire and one that is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
strong human desire and one that is
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.899
strong human desire and one that is
shared by women and men and one that's

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:34.909
shared by women and men and one that's
 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.770
shared by women and men and one that's
shared around the world so we see our

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780
shared around the world so we see our
 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.979
shared around the world so we see our
role as something quite different and

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989
role as something quite different and
 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.799
role as something quite different and
that influences the standards with which

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809
that influences the standards with which
 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.799
that influences the standards with which

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809
we approach the content and the breadth
 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.500
we approach the content and the breadth
of content that we can deliver

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510
of content that we can deliver
 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.489
of content that we can deliver

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139
and in turn has allowed us to create a
 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:57.579
and in turn has allowed us to create a
real consumer products brand so I think

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589
real consumer products brand so I think

and then to be true to that in terms of
how the consumers see it and that's a

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939
how the consumers see it and that's a
 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.380
how the consumers see it and that's a
