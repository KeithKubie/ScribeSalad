00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.840
the brain much more to do with emotion
with novelty with intuition and to some

really say that one half is more

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650
really say that one half is more
 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.760
really say that one half is more
important than the other because they

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770
important than the other because they
 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.360
important than the other because they
they have to come together completely
