foreseeable future I think continue to
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.359
foreseeable future I think continue to
pursue very aggressive policies which

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
pursue very aggressive policies which
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950
pursue very aggressive policies which
will deliver so of all of these what are

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
will deliver so of all of these what are

the top picks well I think there's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
the top picks well I think there's
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.580
the top picks well I think there's
another category which we do know is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
another category which we do know is
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.290
another category which we do know is
probably on the right track and it's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
probably on the right track and it's

when we introduce political economy that
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889
when we introduce political economy that
we find it we see a lot of countries

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
we find it we see a lot of countries
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.910
we find it we see a lot of countries
where there's usually been a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
where there's usually been a
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.530

center-right government that's come in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
center-right government that's come in
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.880

Seal of Approval economic policies and
then there's a center-left government

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
then there's a center-left government
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900
then there's a center-left government
