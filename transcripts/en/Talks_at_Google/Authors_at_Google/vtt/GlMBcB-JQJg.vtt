SPEAKER 1: Today I'm really
delighted to introduce

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.160
Oliver Uberti and Dr.
James Cheshire, who've

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.960
written this magnificent book,
very beautiful and informative.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.380
Oliver's a designer
and journalist.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.450
He was previously
senior design editor

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.980
at "National Geographic."

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
And Dr. Cheshire is at
University College London,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
where he's a senior lecturer in
quantitative human geography,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.635
and has a great interest
in using big data

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.440
and visualization in
the social sciences.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.510
So, please welcome.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.190
Thank you.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.310
OLIVER UBERTI: Hello, and
also hello to the wider Google

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.920
audience.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.230
It brings me great pleasure to
be here, in a number of ways,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.900
especially being here in Boston,
because my brother, Justin

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.670
Uberti, actually worked here
for at least a year, I believe.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.110
He worked at the Kirkland
office and then came to Boston

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.540
and is now back in Kirkland.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.710
He may be watching
so, what's up, bro?

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.990
We're going to talk about
a number of things today.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.540
We're going to be talking
about data visualization.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.700
We're also going be talking
about the partnership

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.530
that James and I
have, as an academic

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.920
and as a graphic designer
working on equal footing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.130
to bring hard science to the
public in these immersive data

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.712
visualizations.

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:33.170
And we're going to
reveal how we do

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.160
that-- a bit of our process,
on the back-end processing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.610
data but then also all the
labeling and front-end work

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.337
that goes to making
these data sets

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.920
more accessible to
the public than you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.590
might find in the back
of a scientific journal.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.936
But first I want to talk
a little bit about how

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:52.060
we came to know each other.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.460
And that starts off with my
work in "National Geographic."

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.110
As a senior design editor,
I kind of came of age

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.890
as data and big data was coming
of age in the early 2000s,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.530
and found myself-- even though
I was in the design department--

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.539
eavesdropping a lot in
the graphics department.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.100
I was really
interested in this idea

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.860
of how we take
data and statistics

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.510
and start to visualize them.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.090
And coming from a
fine arts background,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.830
I like to work with
my hands a lot.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.730
And we had this data
set from a story out

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.830
of the EPA and a study through
Baylor University, where

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.480
they were finding
pharmaceuticals--

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.130
evidence of
pharmaceuticals showing up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.672
in fish tissue in sites
all around the country.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:34.130
And to communicate
this, I thought,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.010
we got to make a
fish out of pills.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.580
And not
computer-generated pills,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.650
not sugar pills, but
the actual medications

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.090
that were found in the study.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.950
So we set up a photo studio
in a pharmacy after hours

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.880
and I created this large
mouth bass out of Prozac

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.740
and antihistamines.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.520
The green and the yellow
pills are the Prozacs.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.220
And it was really--

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.746
I had no way of knowing what,
really, pills the pharmacy

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.870
was going to have in stock.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.000
So I showed up with this
spreadsheet of permutations

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.490
of how to keep the
ratios in balance,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.920
depending on how many
pills were available.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.990
And then I got word of a set of
research coming out of London.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.840
And James' PhD
project was actually

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.550
looking at surnames and
the most popular surnames--

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.711
a huge database of
surnames in the UK.

00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:29.210
And I was wondering
if he could help

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.630
me create a map of the most
popular surnames in the United

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.770
States.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.610
And going back and forth
over a course of months,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.040
we produced this map,
which reveals the 25 most

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.420
popular surnames in each
state, their size by frequency,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.620
and color by country of
origin, approximately.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
So you get pockets of
Scandinavian and German

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.630
ancestry in the Midwest,
Spanish surnames rising up

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.590
in the southern states, pockets
of French down in Louisiana,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.540
and then, of course, up
here in Massachusetts

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.600
there's some Irish ancestry
poking in the top 25.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.830
And to talk a little bit
more about this research

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.350
and what led us on to
our next collaboration,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.691
I'll bring James up.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:18.899
JAMES CHESHIRE: Hi, everyone.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.910
Thanks for having us.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.430
So, essentially, Oliver
was the first designer

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.610
I'd ever met, or even spoken
to, I think, at this point.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.170
Traditionally, us in
the academic sphere

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.890
don't often stick our heads
out of our research offices

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.670
to speak to a broader audience.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.503
And I really enjoyed working on
this particular project, where

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:45.410
we were taking kind of a
large database of names

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.690
and making them kind of
easily accessible and readable

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.190
this way.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.179
And for someone who was just
a PhD student at the time,

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:54.470
getting something in the
"National Geographic" magazine

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.840
was kind of a big deal.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.450
Alongside this, I was working
on lots of maps and graphics

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.110
about London.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.628
So this was--

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:06.620
I'm not quite sure,
maybe a decade

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.170
ago now, maybe slightly less.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.020
And London was really
entering a transition

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.364
from being quite a data-poor
city to a very data-rich one.

00:05:16.364 --> 00:05:17.780
So there was a lot
of initiatives,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.690
particularly in the
UK, but also over here

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.850
in the States about
opening up data,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.670
making data freely
available to the public

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.300
and for others to
use and make use of.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.590
And so this was bubbling away
in the background on a blog

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.595
that I was participating--

00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:37.700
I was contributing to
and making new forms

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.037
of maps, that kind of thing.

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:40.370
And it gained a lot of interest.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.470
And a couple of
publishers approached

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.690
me to turn it into a book.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.570
And it occurred to me that--

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.659
you know, I'm good at making
maps that are OK online

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.450
and they look all right
in research papers.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.280
But I really needed a
designer to take these maps

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.780
and put them on
the printed page.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.424
And the options were,
you could submit a draft

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.840
manuscript to a publisher and
use their in-house designer.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.670
Or you could work
collaboratively with one

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.780
as a co-author throughout.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.230
And that's why I approached
Oliver as a recommendation--

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.260
someone to recommend,
really, in the UK.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.789
But he'd just gone freelance
at that point and--

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.330
I think he thought I was a lot
further along with the project

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.420
than I actually was.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.490
But he agreed to work with me.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.130
So this was our first book,
called "London, the Information

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.630
Capital."

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.700
And we did a whole series of
dad visualizations on that.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:42.590
This one is looking at 24 hours
of flights over UK airspace.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.040
And just before we came out
with the book, Strava data,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.770
the quantified self movement,
all that kind of stuff

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.660
had just started.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:58.340
So we got access to a
bulk download from Strava.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.080
It was still a startup, a
small startup at that point.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.340
And we were able to map
the flows of cyclists

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.190
into London across
the rush hour period.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.750
And so, I think, if
we look back and we

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.230
think about what the biggest
contribution of that book

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.890
was and is, it was this.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.630
For the first time,
we were taking data

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.200
that were being
collected on apps

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.480
or that were already
collected and stored

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.500
behind firewalls and things
like that, we were taking it out

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.750
and we were taking it
to a wider audience.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.480
And this was the first time
people had seen this stuff

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.170
about London, or even any city.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.070
And so that kind of got us
thinking about some of the work

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.990
that we can do together
as a collaboration,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.880
and how we can make
a contribution.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.090
And we've decided that the
things we're really interested

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.330
in is taking a moment in
time when data is suddenly

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.690
becoming available in
unprecedented volumes,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.770
capturing it in
data visualizations,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.240
and publishing it as books.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.230
And it's not just about data
visualization for its own sake.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.170
We've all seen things
online where there's--

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.610
they kind of look
cool initially,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.110
and then you look back at
them for a second again.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.130
You think, actually, what
was telling us, or telling me

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:16.510
anything?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.968
Or, I don't really
understand that.

00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:20.680
Network diagrams
are a classic case--

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.554
social networks,
things like that.

00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:24.970
So we're very much
in the business

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.450
of taking good
design principles,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.300
good cartographic principles,
and transforming them

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.429
into compelling and interesting
data visualizations.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.440
They look quite
traditional in many ways.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.120
And you'll see that in some
of the slides we're showing.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.039
So the London book
was a great success.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.750
The publisher, obviously,
wanted us to do a second one.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.957
And they were thinking about
UK, maybe another city,

00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:48.790
something like that.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.880
But Oliver, through his work
at "National Geographic,"

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.400
was keen that we move
spheres and actually move

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.670
into the animal kingdom, because
he'd noticed that they were

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.410
this kind of
technological moment

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.710
when millions or
billions of data points

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.460
were now being collected
on small sensors.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.191
And for those-- if any of you
have worked with spatial data,

00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:10.690
coordinates, that
kind of thing, you

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.850
know the great advantage
is the formats.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.800
Everything is exactly
the same, whether it's

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.160
commuting cyclists in
London in this map,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.840
or some commuting
baboons in this map.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.470
And this is a study
where they had

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.640
GPS loggers on a
troop of baboons,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.830
or most of a troop of
baboons, and they were

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.220
sampling them every second.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.910
So they had their
location every second

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.370
over a three week period.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.980
So that's a lot of data points.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:48.720
And the nice thing about it was,
you get these daily movements.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.920
So you can see, this is
where they start sleeping.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.590
And then this is where
they go out foraging.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.220
And then they loop back
to their sleeping site.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.230
That gives a nice kind
of overall impression

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.060
of their behavior.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.010
But what the researchers
were really interested in

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.202
is how baboons make decisions
on where they decide to go.

00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:09.160
And so thanks to their
data, thanks to the fact

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.770
that they had data at
second-by-second resolution,

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.080
you can zoom in to
particular moments.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.020
And the moment we chose
was the baboons running

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.527
across this area of crop land.

00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:21.610
Here, they didn't like it.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.760
They got harassed by
local herders and farmers.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.170
So it was a big thing for
the baboons to run across.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.940
They didn't want to hang around.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.330
And we could then see
that exact moment.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.250
We could see that some
baboons run off one way.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.930
Some run another way.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.140
And the fact that also--

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.820
the kind of "go" signal,
the one that they all

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.610
started running on, was led by
a juvenile and their mother,

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.470
not by an alpha male or female.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:57.320
And you can see how at
different moments in time,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.410
the baboons either
decide to compromise

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.000
where they want to
go or they choose

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.125
to follow one or the other.

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:05.240
But it's a fairly democratic
decision-making process

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.600
that the research
had a hunch about,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.960
but were only
really able to prove

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.500
through a large-scale
data-mining exercise

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.970
to create these rules about,
when one baboon goes one way,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.970
how do the others follow?

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.980
And this study
really represents,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.930
I think, that transition
from a researcher

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.420
having to spend weeks in the
field in a hide or a truck,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.470
just monitoring visually the
behaviors of these animals,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.460
to essentially being able to
remotely follow them and things

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.280
like that.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.330
And it's a transition
that, I think,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.810
has probably been most profound
in looking at marine data

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.500
in particular.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.550
So up until about--

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.142
I don't know, maybe 20
years ago, or even less,

00:11:54.142 --> 00:11:55.600
probably 20 years
ago, was probably

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.200
one of most
comprehensive data sets

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.910
on the distribution of
whales that existed.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.950
And it was actually created
from 19th century whaling logs.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.530
So in this case, because
whales were a resource,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.435
the city of Boston
in particular was--

00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:16.750
all the areas around
here were particularly

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.420
dependent on whaling, you wanted
to know where the whales were

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.720
and how many you'd caught,
because it was essentially

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.400
an auditing exercise.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.910
And a guy called Townsend went
through and manually mapped

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.120
each of the locations,
the approximate locations,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.580
of where whales were
killed, by species.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.370
And you get this
distribution map,

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.115
where you get different
species of whale,

00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:45.820
at different times
of year, appearing.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.980
And this, like a number of
examples in the animal kingdom,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.730
is an example of where--

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.170
you're mapping where the
animals have died, essentially.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.920
It's not when they're living,
but when they've been killed.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.150
You're managing a resource.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.860
You're not managing
a environment.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.520
You're not managing
an ecosystem.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.640
And that led
researchers in the 60s

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.000
onwards to start developing
their own mini-sensors

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.950
to monitor animal
movement and behavior.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.600
So this is one of the
first bio-logging devices

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.400
that was created.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.157
It was by a guy called
Rory Wilson, who was

00:13:27.157 --> 00:13:29.840
at the University of Swansea.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.150
And you can see here,
it's kind of a syringe

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.100
that he's pushed a spring in.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.450
This is a piece of cork.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.850
And on that piece of cork,
he had a bit of magnesium

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.290
that was burning when it
came into contact with water.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.570
And they strapped it to
the front of penguins.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.860
And when the penguin
was swimming, depending

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.180
on the speed it was going,
it would push that cork in,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.960
kind of up that syringe.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.600
And the magnesium would
burn a line on it.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.824
And you'd see how fast
the animal was swimming.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:06.990
No one had done this before.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.570
And even with this
somewhat clumsy device

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.160
on the front of
them, he discovered

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.090
that the birds were
swimming faster and further

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.610
than we thought.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.200
Jump forward to the present day.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.080
This is what Rory's
lab now looks like.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.420
It's kind of a mission
control for animal data.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.630
Here we have a couple of minutes
of data from a circling vulture

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.550
that they've attached a tag to.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.569
So you can see, there's all
kinds of different senses

00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:39.610
that they've crammed into
this small device now--

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.790
accelerometers,
magnetometers, GPS.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.650
And so this is like
a feed of information

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.110
they have about the
birds' spiraling behavior,

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.410
looking at turbulence over the
wings and that kind of thing.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.852
So we really wanted to kind
of get to grips with the data

00:14:58.852 --> 00:15:01.060
and see if we can visualize
it in an interesting way.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.670
How do you take that,
which isn't necessarily

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:10.644
a user-friendly
version of a data feed,

00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:12.310
how do you make that
into something that

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.820
looks a bit like this, where
you've actually just extracted

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.960
a small sample of that data, a
really interesting part of it,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.710
just for a few seconds
of a vulture flight?

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.050
And you've looked at
the air temperature

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.860
outside, which is one of the
things that we're mapping here.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.580
And you can really see how
the sensors are detecting

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.260
these really tiny kind of
fluctuations, perturbations

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.710
in bird behavior.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.260
And they can start looking
and understanding that,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.360
to see how the animal
behaves and how it

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.130
accounts for different things.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.870
So that's the journey
we're on here.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.010
And there's some really
remarkable technology.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:59.260
So we've got Rory's really
high-resolution magnetometers,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.760
accelerometers, and
things like that

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.450
that he's trying
to put on birds.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.210
And then we've also
got tags that--

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.320
this is probably the largest
tag that we feature in the book.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.470
It's about the size
of a computer mouse.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.010
That thing is capable
of collecting something

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.130
like 62 gigabytes of
data in a 12-hour time

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.220
period about one whale.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.060
And here there's a couple
of little attachments

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.610
where they stick suction cups,
the same thing you'd attach

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.280
a sat nav to a car window with.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.480
They creep up behind the whale
with this thing on a long pole.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.300
And then they kind of
just flick the pole down.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.089
And it hits the back of
the whale and sticks on.

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:44.630
And then after about
12 hours it will

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.890
drop off and float to the
surface with all this data.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.650
And these are passive sensors.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.760
They have active ones too.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.634
But they're passive in
the sense that they're

00:16:54.634 --> 00:16:59.100
using the whale's sonar to
detect what the whale is doing.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.880
So when whales-- toothed
whales in particular-- hunt,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.410
they emit some sonar
that bounces back

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.810
from their environment.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.954
And just as the whale is
detecting the bounce-back,

00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:16.322
the sensors are able
to detect as well.

00:17:16.322 --> 00:17:17.780
And we have the
exact moment-- this

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.720
is over a five-second period
when a toothed whale is

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.380
hunting a very small fish.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.790
So this is a fish
that's maybe this big.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.400
And just from the sonar--
it's a bit tricky to see here.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.350
But you can see that there's
these signatures here.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.110
And this is stuff
bouncing-- this

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.190
is the reflection coming
back from the particular fish

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.470
that he's after.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.850
So the width of each
of these boxes--

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.450
columns here is the
time between buzzes.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.140
So the whale starts
off clicking.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.485
So it will let off a click
and wait some milliseconds

00:17:57.485 --> 00:17:59.780
before the next one comes
back, a few milliseconds

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.190
before the next one comes back.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.690
And it-- at kind of
a coarse resolution,

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.120
it realizes there's a fish here.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.890
This is something
I'm interested in.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.830
And then it zooms in
a bit on the fish.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.290
And then for a
couple of seconds,

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:17.389
it then does this buzz, which is
a really high-resolution noise.

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:18.680
And then this is the signature.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.020
And we get every
moment that the fish

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.260
is getting closer and closer.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.370
The whale's head's here.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.570
So this is kind of distant.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.680
So you can see the fish is
getting closer to the whale.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.380
And then this is--
at point C, this

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.770
is where the fish realizes
that it's possibly lunch.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.220
And it coils up and kind
of springs off to try

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.090
and swim away.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.080
So you get this slightly
more scattered impression

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.620
from the sonar here.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.130
And then you get it swimming
off in this direction.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.614
And then it
completely disappears,

00:18:51.614 --> 00:18:53.030
because the good
news for the fish

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.190
is that the fish
essentially just did that.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.940
And as soon as the
fish moves to one side,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.525
the whale can't see it
anymore, because that sonar is

00:19:02.525 --> 00:19:04.110
a pretty narrow field of view.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.960
So the worst thing you can do if
you're being chased by a whale

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.800
is to try and out-swim it.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.350
You just need to move to
one side, and it loses you.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:23.090
So we have information about
how the whales are feeding,

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.220
about their particular ecology.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.750
But we're also using animals
to do some ocean sensing

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.350
for ourselves.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.829
So these are like animal
sentinels, if you like.

00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:35.870
And this is one of our
favorite examples, really,

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.000
that shows some of the processes
that we're going through.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.670
So this is a sensor--

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.380
it's actually quite large.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.542
It's a little bit
bigger than this--

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:46.250
it's about this size,
actually, that gets

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.490
stuck to the head of a seal.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.640
And it detects information about
ocean temperature, salinity,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.080
that kind of thing--

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.990
not for ecologists,
but for oceanographers

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.180
who want to know what's going
on in the world's oceans.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.630
And there's hundreds
of these seals swimming

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.420
around Antarctica.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.240
And this is kind of
the raw feed of data

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.850
that comes back, or at
least some indication

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.050
of their location.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.810
And this, to me, was
the first graphic--

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.835
raw graphic I produced.

00:20:15.835 --> 00:20:17.210
And it really
captured everything

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.230
we were trying to
show for the book.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.680
It was one of these graphics
that you think, wow,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.930
that's a big hairball of data.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.510
That's really interesting.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.140
What surprised me, really, was
Oliver's initial take on it.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.690
So here we have
the big hairball.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.540
And I thought this would
be the main feature

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.755
story about these
particular sensors,

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.200
these particular animals.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.690
I sent that previous
image to Oliver.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.080
He then puts in a kind
of initial draft layout.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.300
This is the first layout
that we came up with.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.160
And you'll see that
his instinct is just

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.340
to remove all the color
and all that clutter,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.760
and just focus on one individual
track, one individual story.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.479
That's what we want to show
within this big hairball.

00:20:57.479 --> 00:20:59.520
And it's a bit like this
in nature documentaries.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.780
If you ever watch a
nature documentary,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.030
they're not looking at the
whole colony of gannets.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.174
They'll zoom in on one
particular breeding

00:21:05.174 --> 00:21:06.340
pair or something like that.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.423
It's because people can
understand that and relate

00:21:08.423 --> 00:21:08.940
to it.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.730
And this is essentially what
we're trying to do here.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.420
So this is a fictitious track
that's just been drawn on.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.330
But we start looking
through the hairball

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.230
to find one that we particularly
thought was representative.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:28.290
And we settled on Rudolph,
who is an elephant seal that

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.360
was tagged for a year
or more-- actually,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.150
I think, a couple of years.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.770
And we actually track him
swimming along the Antarctic

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.800
Peninsula, hauling out
here on some sea ice,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.580
and then swimming back across
towards the Falkland Islands

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.950
and around there.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.420
One story, that we
then started thinking,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.360
well, this is
really interesting.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.600
But it's a bit of a
blank canvas still.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.560
We've got the journey.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.150
But what's he encountering?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.640
What kind of terrain is there?

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.410
What's going on in
the water beneath him?

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.364
So we spent a lot of time
working on terrain-mapping

00:22:09.364 --> 00:22:11.280
techniques-- and we'll
talk briefly about this

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.930
in a second--

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.800
that really captures the
ocean floor as it is.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.090
So you can see the deep
trenches he's swimming over,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.140
the sea ice he's encountering,
and really getting to grips

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.730
with that single narrative.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.794
You'll see that we have
the hairball still, here.

00:22:28.794 --> 00:22:30.210
But it's actually
been shrunk down

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.540
to quite a small part of
the double-page spread,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.670
because we wanted to focus
in on that individual.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.090
And what's more, we actually
gave Rudolph two spreads

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.710
in the book, which is quite a
privilege not many animals get,

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.082
two double-page spreads.

00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:47.290
Because, actually, we were
interested too in the data

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.456
that he was able to collect
about ocean temperature.

00:22:49.456 --> 00:22:55.440
So that particular transect is
strung across the page here.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.950
The black line is the
depths that he's diving to.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.610
Now, I thought this was
a glitch on the sensor.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.490
But this line here
is 1,000 meters down.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.526
So at that point, he breaks
1,000 meters underwater.

00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:09.900
And I thought that
was a mistake.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.150
But actually seals
are capable of--

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.170
they regularly dive to
those kinds of depths.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.210
And that's why they're
great ocean monitors,

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.640
because as they're diving
down, they're collecting

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.930
all these measurements.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.890
And you get a temperature
gradient here of data.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:33.150
You can see how we've gone
from that initial hairball--

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.880
which looks a bit like this as
well, with the contextual data,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.010
these individual animal types--

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.370
to a much cleaner impression
of what's going on.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.640
So really, a lot of what we do
is a data-reduction exercise.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.660
We talk about big data.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.076
But we're actually
in the business

00:23:50.076 --> 00:23:52.110
of reducing as much
of the data as we can,

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.120
to get insight or
intelligence, I guess.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.057
For another part
of this story it

00:23:59.057 --> 00:24:01.390
was really important to get
that contextual information.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.060
So I mentioned the
sea floor that we

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.000
were interested in for Rudolph.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.759
But if you're a bird
and you're flying,

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:11.550
actually that doesn't
make much difference.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.530
What you're interested
in is the medium

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.696
that you're passing through.

00:24:14.696 --> 00:24:17.550
And that's air, that's the
winds you're encountering.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.670
So I'm sure many
of you have seen

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:26.460
this really excellent
weather visualization called

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.980
"earth.nullschool."

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.630
It was one of the
first visualizations,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.140
as a cartographer, that really
made the cartographic community

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.776
sit up and think, actually,
computer scientists

00:24:36.776 --> 00:24:38.400
know what they are
doing sometimes when

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.780
it comes to data visualization.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.070
And they're capable of creating
these kinds of graphics.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.940
So inspired by that,
I thought, we really

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.070
need to show global
wind patterns

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.220
for a story we've got
about albatrosses.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.810
So here is something
I generated.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.670
Does anyone use R here?

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.170
R-stats?

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.420
I did this in R.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.090
It's probably one of my
proudest visualizations

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:10.260
I've ever done in R,
which captured the wind

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.980
conditions approximately
during the period

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.190
that we were interested in.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.050
It's modeled data.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.380
It's not actual-- they
have a few readings.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.270
But of course, they
have to interpolate.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.340
But you can basically
see Antarctica.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.040
This is Antarctica, and
all the winds rushing off.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.540
And the reason this
was so important

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.032
was it brought to life this
story about these migrating--

00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:33.990
these wandering albatrosses
that go all the way

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.820
around Antarctica.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.730
And in particular,
there's this point

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.572
of no return, which is these
Kerguelen Islands, here.

00:25:43.572 --> 00:25:45.030
And essentially,
because of the way

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.780
that the winds are whipping
around the continent,

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.370
it's easier for a bird
to fly all the way around

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:57.750
than to try and turn back
to the breeding colony.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:02.150
So you can see here, this guy
made it and then turned back,

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.880
whereas this one carried
on all the way around,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.082
because they needed the
tailwinds to help them.

00:26:08.082 --> 00:26:09.540
And the researchers
hadn't actually

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.730
mapped the wind onto their data,
or their data onto the wind.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.187
So this was something that
we were quite pleased with,

00:26:18.187 --> 00:26:19.770
because it really
brought to life some

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.220
of the importance of the context
that the animals are moving

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:24.720
through.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.630
And that's often overlooked,
particularly by the researchers

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.940
who are more concerned about
the specifics of their data.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:41.060
And then just a final example of
context that we can now do is--

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.140
thanks to satellite imagery
and remote sensor technology,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.312
you can actually map the
data onto the conditions

00:26:49.312 --> 00:26:51.520
that the animal was really
experiencing at that time.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.800
So this is a story about
snowy owls in the Great Lakes

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:02.170
and how they spend time
over the winter and how,

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:06.140
thanks to tracking
technology, the researchers

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.150
noticed that the
birds were spending

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.622
a lot of time on lakes,
on the Great Lakes,

00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:14.580
and actually discovered
that they were floating

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.720
on ice and hunting wildfowl.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.470
And if we'd used a standard
satellite imagery base map

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.460
for this that was probably taken
in the summer or something like

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.520
that, all these blue circles,
which are moments when

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.050
the birds-- a partcular owl--

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.559
spent time drifting on ice,
would have been in water.

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:36.850
They wouldn't have been on ice.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:43.125
So thanks to the NASA MODIS
imagery, we were able to get--

00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:44.310
again, approximate date.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.040
This was over a month-long
period we had this data.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.800
So we selected one
day in that month

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.940
and we were able to line
up the bird information

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.120
with the actual ice information.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.950
Often people overlook that.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.080
But from a very
detailed perspective,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.080
is quite important for
us to be able to do that.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.940
And it's really
demonstrative of a transition

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.930
from a data-poor environment
to a very data-rich one

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.570
that satellites have
been able to give us.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.500
So I'll hand over to Oliver now
to talk a bit more about some

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.505
of our design process.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.230
OLIVER UBERTI: In
both of our books,

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.530
a theme that emerges to
us nearly every day--

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.560
we're working two years
at a time on the books--

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.954
that we could have never done
these books by ourselves.

00:28:38.954 --> 00:28:41.370
I couldn't have produced this
book without James's ability

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.820
to process huge data sets
and his GIS expertise

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.260
and his just general knowledge
of cartography and computer

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.160
programming-- writing
custom scripts that

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.750
produced those wind patterns.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.460
What I like to
bring to the table,

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.310
besides a journalistic
storytelling perspective,

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.710
is the design, the typography.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.500
And a big part of helping a
reader engage with these maps

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.590
and pull away a
story is labeling.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.450
And every time we
make a book, we

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.330
have to decide these
basic principles of,

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.960
what does a road
look like in our map?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.840
How do we label a
country versus a bay

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.740
versus the actual animal's
behavior and tracks?

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.840
How do we create
a hierarchy that

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.580
lets the reader zero
in on what they want

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.730
to know as quickly as possible?

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.200
So I'm going to talk
you through one example.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.756
I live in Los Angeles.

00:29:32.756 --> 00:29:34.380
One of my favorite
stories in the book,

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.950
and the story of conservation
that feels most urgent to me,

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.030
is about P22 and the mountain
lions of Los Angeles.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.690
I live near Griffith Park.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:48.366
P22 is a bit of an A-lister
in Hollywood right now.

00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:49.740
He's got his own
Twitter account.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.710
You can get t-shirts with
his likeness on them.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.770
This is an incredible
photograph by Steve Winter

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.460
He shot this for "National
Geographic" using camera traps.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.740
And the problem that the
mountain lions in the Southern

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.380
California region are facing
is that they're effectively

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.590
marooned on genetic
islands by the freeways.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.290
These freeways are 8,
10 lane lanes long.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.230
In the Santa Monica
Mountains is one population.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.420
P22 escaped out of
the Santa Monicas

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.800
and got to Griffith Park,
where he lives by himself.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.640
But the chances of him getting
back to the Santa Monicas

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.260
to mate with another
female are slim.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.330
And even then, he's still
mating within his own gene pool.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:38.290
So the prognosis for his
genetics is not very good.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.120
Down in the Santa
Ana Mountains--

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.770
south of LA towards
Orange County

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.900
on the way to San Diego--
is another population

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.010
of mountain lions.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.620
And in both cases, they
really need an escape hatch.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.780
They need a vegetated
bridge that--

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.630
you start to see in some other
countries, in Canada, Slovenia,

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.180
some countries are building
these forested overpasses

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.730
to allow the free
movement of wildlife.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.700
There's a proposal that's been
green-lighted to help mountain

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.920
lions from P22's family up
in the Santa Monica Mountains

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.930
get across the 101.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:16.850
But down in the Santa Anas that
proposal hasn't taken hold.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.710
And so I really wanted to zero
in on that other Santa Ana

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.090
population.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:25.260
This is about 15 years
of mountain lion tracking

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.130
in Southern California and
the Santa Ana mountains.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.440
And as we showed with
the seals, if you just

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.575
plot the data that
comes out of the sensors

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:34.950
it doesn't mean a whole lot.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.000
So how can we start
establishing context

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.240
to bring the story
to life for readers?

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.030
Well, one thing we want to do
is we want to lay in the terrain

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.220
that the mountain lions
are passing through.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.780
So we've got digital elevation
models of the mountain ranges

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.460
along the coast.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.720
And it was important to me
that this book come together

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.100
as an ensemble, and just have a
color palette and a visual feel

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.350
that tied all these
different maps or all

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.975
these different parts
of the world, all

00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:05.160
these different species
and technologies together.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.450
And again, coming from
a fine arts background,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:12.060
I wanted to take these DEMs a
little bit further visually.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.620
And there's a
technique you learn

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.450
in art school called stippling.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.480
If you want to render an
object, the shadowed areas,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.370
you can just draw a lot of dots.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.460
And in the lighter, highlighted
areas, draw fewer dots.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.580
So working together with James,
in a number of iterations,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.110
he wrote a custom script
where he could essentially

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.320
take a digital elevation
model, run it through this,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.330
and put lots of
little dots, a lot

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.790
of stippling in the dark
shadowed areas of the mountain

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.609
ranges, and fewer dots in
the lower-lying flat areas.

00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:44.400
And so you end up
getting an output looking

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.940
like this, which we used
on every land-based map

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.780
throughout the book.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.720
And that same technique
is what gives the texture

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.520
to the bathymetry you saw in
the seal map near Antarctica.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.760
But then there's a lot
of human environments

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.120
that the mountain lions
are interacting with.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.480
And we need to start
identifying them.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.034
So this is me--

00:33:11.034 --> 00:33:12.450
at the very beginning
of the book,

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.420
before we even start
producing a lot of these maps,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.250
I'm coming up with a
typographic palette,

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:24.004
a series of three fonts that
we can use interchangeably to--

00:33:24.004 --> 00:33:25.420
how do we label
the waters, how do

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.480
we label the cities,
a series of symbols

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.720
we can use to label
mortality events

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.980
or when a wolf kills an animal.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.040
And then building a
template, an Illustrator that

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.580
has a hierarchy broken out.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.280
So we can easily turn on and
turn off and organize all

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.370
of this contextual information.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.290
And so then James starts
sending me exports.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.020
This is drainage in
Southern California.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.730
And most of this is--

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.470
all these green little streams
and temporary drainages

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.010
or seasonal drainages
are hugely irrelevant.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.002
So it's an enormous
data-cleaning chore

00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:07.710
to start turning this
into something that

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.275
doesn't make your eyes bleed.

00:34:10.275 --> 00:34:12.150
Then you start throwing
in the road networks.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:15.570
Now, this is really where the
story of the human environment

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.590
meets the story of
the animal behavior.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.730
So this is going to be what I
want to highlight in my map,

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.033
more than the drainage.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:28.300
And you can see, we've overlaid
this over the stippling.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.449
And in our initial
drafts, you start

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.130
to get something like this.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:39.030
And I've got all of the
data points you saw earlier.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.159
And I've just grayed
them back, colored

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.159
them darker gray for male
lions and lighter gray

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.489
for female lions.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.030
And then we started talking with
the researcher and thinking,

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.310
can we pull out five
individuals that

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.250
maybe show different behaviors?

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:58.140
For instance, the females don't
have a large dispersal range.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.970
The female mountain
lions tend to stay

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.920
close to where they were born.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.170
And they continue
to raise their cubs.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.660
Whereas you get
mountain lions who--

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.090
the male mountain lions,
who need to disperse out

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.610
for a number of reasons, one
being that they will be killed

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.710
or eaten by the
older male mountain

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.730
lions if they don't strike out
and find their own territory.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.600
So there's this one
intrepid mountain lion, M56,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.630
who leaves the Santa
Anas near Camp Pendleton,

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.470
up here, and then comes down
along the coast in Oceanside

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.970
and cuts up along the Santa
Margarita River, and comes over

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.945
and is the only documented--

00:35:34.945 --> 00:35:37.440
in 15 to 17 years--

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.360
mountain lion that's crossed
west to east across I-15.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.140
So he gets across.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.040
And you think he's home free.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.498
He's got this unbroken chain
of wilderness, essentially all

00:35:46.498 --> 00:35:48.120
the way down to Mexico.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.200
But he comes down here into
the [INAUDIBLE] Valley,

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.230
preys on a rancher's sheep.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.620
The farmer gets a
depredation permit.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.200
And M56 was.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.732
Shot The challenge is
not just getting across,

00:36:05.732 --> 00:36:07.440
but getting across
and living long enough

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.960
to pass on your genes.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.080
But again, this wasn't
really doing it for me.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.620
The color scheme is
a bit lugubrious.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.810
All the successive data points
in the background of the male

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.880
and female lions is really
making it harder to,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.640
as a reader, connect with
the individual stories.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.730
So I cleaned out all
of that other data

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.420
from all the other
lions and just zoomed in

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.820
and used bright highlight
colors to pull out

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.260
the individual stories
and, in the hierarchy,

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.380
subdued everything else.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.590
Now this is an ongoing
conservation issue.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.350
And it's a story of maybe
what we did wrong, right?

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.440
The mountain lions are a signal.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.305
They tell us that maybe
we've gone too far,

00:36:57.305 --> 00:36:59.640
that our freeways and
our infrastructure

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.940
is a greater barrier than
we had previously imagined.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.180
And we need to now take steps,
like creating vegetated bridges

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.020
to step backward and give
the wildlife a chance

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.990
to live in proximity to humans.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.260
But over in Kenya,
where the infrastructure

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:25.854
hasn't been so permanently
infixed on our landscape,

00:37:25.854 --> 00:37:27.270
they're taking
proactive measures.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.760
It's one of the first
places on the planet where

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.980
they're developing their
infrastructure with wildlife

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.280
in mind.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.320
One of the great pleasures
of this book for me

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.320
was to go over to Kenya and
work with Save the Elephants.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.350
And they allowed me to
join a collaring expedition

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:44.700
in Tsavo National Park, where
recently a major railway had

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.130
been built from Nairobi, in
the center of the country,

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.920
to Mombasa on the coast.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.470
Now this railway--
high-speed railway

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.690
bisects Tsavo National
Park, right through elephant

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.440
migration corridors.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.919
But, through Save the
Elephant's lobbying efforts

00:37:58.919 --> 00:38:00.960
and working with a number
of local organizations,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.876
they were able to get
the construction company

00:38:02.876 --> 00:38:06.960
to install these
underpasses at points

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.730
throughout the entire railway.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.290
It's an elevated
railway, and you've

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.420
got these tunnels underneath.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.404
But what they didn't know was
which of these many underpasses

00:38:16.404 --> 00:38:17.820
elephants were
most likely to use.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.870
And if they could
figure out which

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.010
ones they were going
to use, then they

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.470
could target their conservation
efforts and anti-poaching

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.690
efforts to those corridors.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.660
So we collared, while I was
there, 10 elephants-- five

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.610
male, five female.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.170
They wear these big, bulky
belts around their neck

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.660
with a counterweight
on the bottom

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.810
and a GPS device on the top,
because the elephants are

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.130
pretty rough on these devices.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:42.796
And they'll slam them
up against things.

00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:45.540
They have to be pretty sturdy.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.056
And then this is just a
zoom-in on a larger map

00:38:48.056 --> 00:38:49.430
that we have in
the book, to show

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.640
what happened after 30
days of being collared.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.720
And a key theme in this book is
that animals aren't these furry

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.300
robots out there in the world,
following a "Westworld"-type

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.710
loop.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.180
They make individual
decisions all the time.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.030
And a couple of those
individual decisions,

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.300
even within a species,
come out in this book.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.690
So after being collared, there's
this one you see here in red.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.510
She was collared up here,
off the top of the map.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:19.779
And any time you have to
subdue an animal and collar it,

00:39:19.779 --> 00:39:21.570
it's a little bit
traumatic for the animal.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:25.550
They, incredibly, can shoot
a dart from a helicopter,

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:28.910
land, run over, take
all their measurements,

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.410
pour water on the animal, keep
its breathing airway open,

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.390
attach the collar,
and then inject

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.940
a antidote that wakes
the animal back up,

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.100
all within about
10 to 12 minutes.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.480
I couldn't believe
I was watching

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.810
this right in front of me.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.010
But after those 12 minutes,
the animal wakes up.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.880
And Manyani here, the red
line, she comes rushing down

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.030
and goes right to the
humans that she trusts--

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.910
here, by the Kenya Wildlife
Service field training school--

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.227
and for about 30
days, just hung around

00:39:58.227 --> 00:39:59.810
outside the ranger
school, because she

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.480
knew she was safe there.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.240
A couple other ones just
continued doing what they do,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.550
and going over to
some of the rivers

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.030
where they like to drink.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:13.370
And this guy,
[? Rachinga, ?] down here,

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.890
he was the first
one, within 24 hours

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.770
of being collared, to use
one of the underpasses

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.050
and make his way up
here and back down.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.669
And within a month he
was just crossing here

00:40:24.669 --> 00:40:25.460
on a regular basis.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.710
And here you get a
sense of both sides.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.590
This is the railway
berm under construction

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:38.750
as we're flying in, and Tsavo
East over here and Tsavo West.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.730
They're planning to
turn this two-lane road

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.940
into a multi-lane-- four-,
five-, six-lane road.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.280
So this is going to be another
barrier for the elephants

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.970
to get across.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.832
But again, with
proactive planning,

00:40:49.832 --> 00:40:51.290
they can build
their infrastructure

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.942
with wildlife in mind.

00:40:52.942 --> 00:40:57.500
This just gives you a
sense of how quickly

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.310
they can get in there
and collar the elephants.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:05.600
And then the moment when
one of them wakes up.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.470
Save the Elephants
wasn't too thrilled

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.540
that some rangers
spray-painted a number

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.060
on the side of the elephant.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.680
But I guess that
makes it easier,

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.430
when they were doing
their aerial surveys,

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.910
to see where the ones
they collared were.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.970
But anyway, that's one
of the hopeful stories

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.840
in the book of using this
combination of science,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.690
research, technology, ecology,
and data visualization

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.515
to make sure that humans
and animals can coexist

00:41:41.515 --> 00:41:43.282
moving forward.

00:41:43.282 --> 00:41:48.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:51.026
SPEAKER 1: Any questions?

00:41:51.026 --> 00:41:56.190
AUDIENCE: Did you often have to
deal with untrustworthy data?

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.410
JAMES CHESHIRE: What do
you mean by untrustworthy?

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.730
AUDIENCE: Like from--
different data sampled

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.600
from different places and
maybe you had to clean it up.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.190
Or just that it just didn't
seem like it was actually

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.010
reasonable.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.530
JAMES CHESHIRE: So it's an
interesting debate, actually,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:20.580
within the community about
what you do with bad data,

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.270
because obviously-- there's
a bit of a trend or perceived

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.730
trend of academic life where
you have to be always reporting

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:27.570
positive results.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.240
And sometimes negative
stuff is useful as well.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.550
And this really applies to at
what stage you share your data.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:40.680
So are you sharing data that
were collected-- the raw data

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.330
collected on the device?

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.980
Or do you share
stuff that's gone

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.070
through a data-cleaning process?

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.830
So we were getting data from
all stages of that process.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.550
Now if some stuff
was completely off--

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.580
you know, GPS point was
1,000 kilometers away

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:06.270
or whatever-- then I did a basic
cleaning operation, which often

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:10.320
was a standard data reduction
thing, where you run across

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.750
and say, well, there's
no way an animal went

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.560
1,000 kilometers in an hour,
or something like that.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.630
But our approach has always
been to try and show as much

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:24.770
of the data as possible
without doing too much with it.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:29.370
Now, there's whole
studies on how

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.590
you interpolate between
data points and all

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.212
that kind of stuff.

00:43:33.212 --> 00:43:35.670
But we try to stay out of that
as much as possible and just

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.520
show specific--

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.030
the raw data as best we can.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.949
Because if a data set
has been interpolated

00:43:41.949 --> 00:43:43.740
or if someone has done
some modeling on it,

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.698
then you've got to explain
that process as well

00:43:45.698 --> 00:43:47.760
to the reader, which
we didn't want to do.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.030
So the answer is yes, there
were messy data points.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.780
But fewer than I
expected, actually,

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.277
given the technologies that
were involved, kind of thing.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.240
AUDIENCE: Is there a dream
data set or dream data sets

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.397
that you haven't worked with
yet that you'd really like to?

00:44:08.397 --> 00:44:10.480
JAMES CHESHIRE: We get
asked that question a lot--

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.320
OLIVER UBERTI:
Specific to wildlife--

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.190
JAMES CHESHIRE: But we're
no better at answering it.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:14.190
OLIVER UBERTI: Or just
in general, on the next--

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.050
a future project?

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.790
AUDIENCE: You're the experts.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:16.540
OLIVER UBERTI: OK.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:21.550
JAMES CHESHIRE: Uh--

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.435
OLIVER UBERTI: We have a
third book in the works.

00:44:23.435 --> 00:44:24.190
JAMES CHESHIRE: Which-- yeah.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.045
OLIVER UBERTI: I just
don't know how much

00:44:25.045 --> 00:44:26.122
we want to talk about it.

00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:27.580
JAMES CHESHIRE:
No, there's stuff--

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.650
I think the dream--

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.169
so specific to this, the dream
that researchers are after

00:44:33.169 --> 00:44:34.960
and that they're probably
a couple of years

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.010
away from getting
is interaction data.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.670
OLIVER UBERTI: Yeah,
social behavior.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:40.980
JAMES CHESHIRE: So we've got--

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.880
the example we have
is from some ants

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.690
that they put QR
codes on the backs of

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.210
and use high-resolution
cameras to track ants

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.090
in these particular colonies.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.160
That was our largest
data set, because they

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.306
were getting interactions.

00:44:57.306 --> 00:45:01.490
And they're planning-- there's a
group, particularly in Germany,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.565
called the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology that

00:45:04.565 --> 00:45:07.110
are planning to deploy
enough sensors that you get

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:12.170
interaction both between animals
and predator-prey relationships

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:13.270
and human.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.540
So as soon as you start
bringing interactions in,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.720
the data set explodes.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.930
And so that's something that
we're not quite at that stage

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:20.971
yet.

00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:22.470
But that's something,
I think-- just

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.564
to get our heads around
that would be cool.

00:45:24.564 --> 00:45:26.230
And then I think just
building on that--

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:27.550
Oliver might talk briefly.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:28.990
But we're getting to the
point where animals--

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.230
they're backing
each other up now--

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.063
OLIVER UBERTI: Yeah.

00:45:31.063 --> 00:45:33.130
JAMES CHESHIRE: With
their data as well.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.200
OLIVER UBERTI: There's a story
out of Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.010
We have a series of graphics
in here on the sea otters

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.730
off California,
and how they were

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.860
thought to be extinct
until a small population

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.800
was discovered back in
the 30s and protected.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.210
And now they've rebounded.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.100
And the Monterey Bay
Aquarium is doing

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.540
all sorts of
conservation efforts

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.000
and tracking to manage
that population.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.360
And they're about to release,
if they haven't already

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.970
released it this
year, this program

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.430
called Otternet that I really
wanted to get into the book.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.250
But the technology just
wasn't deployed yet

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.710
by the time we had to publish.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.480
And Otternet is
that exact thing.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.950
It's this idea of getting
the social behavior

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:15.290
and interactions between mating
males and resident females,

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:19.930
and how as an entire population
they're working together.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:24.275
And between buoys, whenever
the otters pass by the buoys,

00:46:24.275 --> 00:46:27.220
they offload their
data to storage.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.450
And then when the otters
pass by each other,

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.610
they offload their data to
the sensors on each otter.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.240
So in case anything
happens to the otter,

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.450
their data isn't lost forever.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:38.620
That's really the frontier.

00:46:41.246 --> 00:46:42.370
AUDIENCE: That was awesome.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.150
Thanks for being here.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:47.020
My question is, how much
do you know about the story

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.900
before you start the
visualization process?

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.330
Or do you look at a big
data set and figure out,

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.405
what's the right story
to tell based off this?

00:46:54.405 --> 00:46:56.530
How much do you talk to
the researchers beforehand?

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.904
OLIVER UBERTI: The research--
this book is about animals.

00:46:58.904 --> 00:47:01.330
But it's really about the
researchers who study them.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:06.130
I mean, they were so kind
to sometimes welcome us

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.880
into their homes, in
Ohio or in Nairobi.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.380
James went out in
the North Atlantic

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.020
with killer whale researchers.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.100
They worked with
us start to finish.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.230
We would usually do
initial interviews

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.330
to try and get a sense
of-- and maybe we'd

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.775
heard about their research
in a scientific journal.

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.650
And then we reached out
to them and told them

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.070
what we were doing.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.980
And then we'd do initial
interviews to figure out, OK,

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.530
what could be cool to visualize?

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.249
What are some of your
favorite stories?

00:47:34.249 --> 00:47:36.790
What are some of your favorite
individuals who have surprised

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.890
you with unique behaviors?

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.572
And then once they shared our
data, we'd do initial plots.

00:47:41.572 --> 00:47:43.030
And it was always
a back and forth.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.410
OK, are we on the right track?

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.340
Yes, this looks good.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.290
And then at the end--

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.205
coming from "National
Geographic,"

00:47:49.205 --> 00:47:52.900
my habit as a designer is
to build the visuals first.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.160
And then we write the story
last to fill in the space

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.040
that the visuals have
allotted for the text.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.190
And so once we had finished the
layout and drafted the story,

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:06.220
then we sent it back to them for
a final review and corrections.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.210
JAMES CHESHIRE:
Yeah, I think there

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.760
was a slightly different-- that
was a difference in process

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.930
for the London book.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.360
Most of that was in
my head to start with,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.400
in the sense that I'd
researched the city.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.060
I knew what was going on.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.540
So I knew that these would be
the stories I wanted to tell.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.842
Whereas this was
much more iterative.

00:48:21.842 --> 00:48:23.800
It was like, oh, well--
you show the researcher

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.580
the graphic we've done.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.740
And they were like, oh, well,
we didn't think of it like that.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.114
Or, that's much
more interesting.

00:48:28.114 --> 00:48:30.006
And you'd go back to
the drawing board, so--

00:48:30.006 --> 00:48:32.380
OLIVER UBERTI: We have no
illusion that we're biologists.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.180
We're not-- I mean,
geographer, designer.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.240
But our combined
skill sets allow

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.960
us to help scientists share
their research more widely.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.390
And also, in some
cases, we surprised them

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.930
with what we were able to reveal
about what their animals were

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.626
doing.

00:48:47.626 --> 00:48:49.750
I just want to make one
more point to tack on that,

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.250
is that that is really--

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.800
for you here at Google and
people who work with data

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.942
and have these
incredible skills,

00:48:55.942 --> 00:48:58.150
that's the beauty of this
animal tracking revolution,

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.483
is that you don't have to be
a biologist to get involved

00:49:00.483 --> 00:49:01.480
in conservation.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.760
These scientists all
over the planet--

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.020
they're inundated with data.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.850
A week-long study
could inundate them

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.560
with millions of data points.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.780
So they really need people
to help crunch the data

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.030
and interpret it.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.030
AUDIENCE: Has either of
you specifically studied

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.610
cartography or worked
with any cartographers?

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:24.590
Obviously, "National
Geographic," for example,

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.380
has a huge cartography
department.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.380
Or is it more just kind of
more general graphic design

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.400
principles that you work from?

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.481
JAMES CHESHIRE: So I've got no
formal cartographic training

00:49:36.481 --> 00:49:36.980
at all.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.940
So I did a geography degree
and then a geography PhD.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.630
But none of it was
really cartography.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.150
I think what's interesting--

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:50.720
I mean, the US is kind of
ahead of the UK in many ways.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.880
There's a transition,
I think, that--

00:49:55.684 --> 00:49:58.380
I teach cartography to students.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.650
But I call it data
visualization,

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.470
because they get paid
five times as much

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.840
for it if they put that on
their CV, for one thing.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:11.790
And secondly, there's
a lot more to it.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.840
The good stuff about how
you convey information

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.990
to people and the
standardization of things,

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.705
and like that visual
hierarchy of labels

00:50:18.705 --> 00:50:21.330
that Oliver was talking about,
I mean, that's really important.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:24.680
But increasingly,
to make maps you

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.122
need to have this broader
data sciencey type

00:50:28.122 --> 00:50:30.080
background, because that's
where the action is.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.160
It's not where people--

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.790
people aren't having to
map new areas of the world

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.720
for the first time.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.655
The frontiers, really,
are in these databases

00:50:37.655 --> 00:50:38.900
that are being extracted.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.910
So that's something I'm
really a kind of lobby

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.300
for within the
cartographic community,

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.340
back in the UK at
least, to try and get

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.290
more people with
programming experience

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.570
to learn a bit about cartography
and not make the same mistakes.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.730
But also, people who have
got cartographic training

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.830
to learn a bit about
programming So they

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:02.180
can make the efficiency
savings like we've

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:05.147
been able to make in this.

00:51:05.147 --> 00:51:06.230
OLIVER UBERTI: Absolutely.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.790
By osmosis, working at "National
Geographic" for a decade,

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:12.230
I was immersed in their
cartographic practices,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.550
labeling styles.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.210
They have proprietary
fonts that they use.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.580
But there are
things like, OK, you

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.560
can use italics for
physical features.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:29.900
Or use different sizes of
sans serif or sitting labels.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:35.060
And a lot of that was definitely
informing my thought process

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.840
when I set about to build
this typographic palette.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:44.600
And we actually hired one
of my former colleagues

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.880
in the cartography department
to be a map editor.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.190
So after we produced 50-some
maps he vetted all of them

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.100
and, in many, many cases,
spotted things that I never

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.930
would have picked up
on my own, such as--

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.987
I had a road crossing
the Niger River in Mali.

00:51:59.987 --> 00:52:01.820
And in fact, there is
a ferry that takes you

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.195
across there, not a road, so.

00:52:04.195 --> 00:52:05.070
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.181
Well, thanks again.

00:52:06.181 --> 00:52:06.680
Very nice.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.580
OLIVER UBERTI: OK.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:11.230
[APPLAUSE]
