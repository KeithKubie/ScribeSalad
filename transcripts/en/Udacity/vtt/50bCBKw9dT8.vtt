00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
When building forms, you've got one main
objective, getting more conversions.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.640
That's when a new visitor to your
site sign up or make a purchase and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.460
nothing is more effective than making
forms quick and easy to finish.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense because
the less users have to type,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.930
the less that's in the way
between them and converting.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.200
It's pretty simple.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.180
You know, in my mind the best
example of a super fast form

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.310
is Amazon's One Click Ordering.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.690
It's great because you're
just done in milliseconds.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.840
&gt;&gt; True, that's a fast form but
it only works for

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.520
some products and
only if the users are already signed in.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.150
For all other situations,
it pay to help out your users.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.770
Guide them through useful labels,
pronged validation, and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.150
progress indicators.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.990
Build their confidence and
watch your conversions go up.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.690
&gt;&gt; That's great advice, let's do it.
