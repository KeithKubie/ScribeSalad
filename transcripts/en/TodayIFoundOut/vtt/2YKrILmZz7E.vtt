00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.810
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
In the video today, we're looking at why,
when stating the time, it's common to add

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.490
"o'clock".

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.799
The practice of saying “o’clock” is
simply a remnant of times when clocks weren’t

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.120
very prevalent and people told time by various
means, depending on where they were and what

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.400
references were available.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.550
Generally, of course, the Sun was used as
a reference point, with solar time being slightly

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.349
different than clock time.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.300
Clocks divide the time evenly, whereas, by
solar time, hour lengths vary somewhat based

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.940
on a variety of factors, like what season
it is.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.200
Thus, to distinguish the fact that one was
referencing a clock’s time, rather than

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.900
something like a sundial, as early as the
fourteenth century one would say something

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.010
like, “It is six of the clock,” which
later got slurred down to “six o’clock”

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700
sometime around the sixteenth or seventeenth
centuries.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.370
In those centuries, it was also somewhat common
to just drop the “o’” altogether and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.390
just say something like “six clock.”

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.610
Using the form of “o’clock” particularly
increased in popularity around the eighteenth

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.540
century when it became common to do a similar
slurring in the names of many things such

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.010
as “Will-o’-the wisp” from “Will of
the wisp” (stemming from a legend of an

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.140
evil blacksmith named Will Smith, with “wisp”
meaning “torch”) and “Jack-o’-lantern”

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.330
from “Jack of the lantern” (which originally
just meant “man of the lantern” with “Jack,”

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.230
at the time, being the generic “any man”
name.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.040
Later, either this or the Irish legend of
“Stingy Jack” got this name transferred

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.110
to referring to carved pumpkins with lit candles
inside).

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.990
While today with clocks being ubiquitous and
few people, if anybody, telling direct time

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.610
by the Sun, it isn’t necessary in most cases
to specify we are referencing time from clocks,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.900
but the practice of saying “o’clock”
has stuck around anyway.
