00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.759
&gt;&gt;Well, India I think is sitting at a very
exciting stage of economic

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.469
development because I believe this is the
time that the rebalancing of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.140
economic power in the world is taking place.
It is countries like India and other Asian

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.300
countries that are growing
at a much faster rate compared to the Western

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.220
countries.
What is driving India's growth is the very

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.220
strong domestic consumption
and to that we will add a huge force of investment

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.259
in infrastructure
that is likely to take place going forward.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.390
So growth drivers of domestic consumption
and of investment.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.750
I think we are poise to see very, very high
rates of growth for the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.160
country which means that clearly, a rebalancing
of economic power will

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930
take place.
And therefore, I think at this stage of the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.330
world economic allotments,
so to say, India is sitting at a very exciting

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.360
state.
India is not only going to become a very strong

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.940
superpower but India in
a way is going to drive the world's economic

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.420
growth in the next decade.
