00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.590
At this point, adding a new method to the Car class is as easy as modifying one

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.410
line of code and then it will automatically be available on the object.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.580
If you're not familiar with the syntax of extend,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.500
you should look up an implementation that's made available in one of the many

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.590
open source libraries that build this for you.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.430
But know that it is not a native JavaScript function.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.917
So to keep our example simple, we're going to go back to the old version of

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.549
the code that only have one method to add to every Car.

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:25.930
Let's go back to our diagram.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.853
In these most recent edits, we have gone from having a move variable that stored

00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:35.820
a function object to instead having a methods variable that stores an object.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.670
And that object has a move property pointing to the same function.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.090
You could say that this is better,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.290
because the methods object is now capable of storing as many

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.310
difficult methods as you want to have available on every Car instance.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.870
One problem I'm noticing with this code is that the name methods,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.440
doesn't seem to make it very clear that the methods object is affiliated in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.140
some way with the Car class.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.610
We could easily confuse it as being perhaps a method container for

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.840
some other class.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.209
Furthermore, in the current code it's a global variable,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.705
which is something we should avoid.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:11.880
It'll be nice if the methods object was clearly encapsulated somehow along with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310
the Car class function,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.220
such that the two of them were bundled up together nice and neat.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.860
But it's just as easy to store an object like this methods object,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.290
as a property of another object as it is to store it in the global variable.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.440
So, let's use the object features of the Car function to make room for

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.650
the object that stores these methods.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.960
Instead of using a global variable called methods,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.374
we will instead put a property on the Car function called .methods
