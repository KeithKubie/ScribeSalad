Since this new client-side validation,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.860
doesn't use Javascript directly, disabling Javascript,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.330
won't actually disable it. But, older browsers might not recognize that

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.420
input type and then it let's the user type in whatever

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.380
they want. And in general, it's

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.390
fairly easy, to, circumvent client-side validation.
