This episode was proudly
made possible by Subaru.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.510
So one of the ways
in which I describe

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.666
human beings is by saying
we are addicted to the new.

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.680
Now, what does this mean,
addicted to the new?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.620
It means that we are
addicted to explore

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.190
the perimeters of possibility.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.935
We are addicted to
probe the unknown,

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.520
to gnaw against the ineffable.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.500
We are programmed neurologically
with the chemical dopamine

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.230
to reward us for overcoming
limitations and exploring

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.010
the unknown.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.390
This idea, this
addiction to the new

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.887
is responsible for a species
that didn't stay in the caves,

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:53.970
didn't stay on the planet.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.120
And it won't stay within
the limitations of biology.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.920
Literally, we are
addicted to the new,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.690
and that is why
we have triumphed

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.820
to become the chief
agents of evolution.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.674
It's the dopamine.

00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:11.310
It's the dopamine.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550
