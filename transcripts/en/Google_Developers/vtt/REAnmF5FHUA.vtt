00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.950
Microsoft gets a fresh start on
the web with Project Spartan,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.790
and what exactly
are these beacons

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.340
trying to tell your smartphone?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.410
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.870
This is "LazyWeb."

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.200
Fire up your iPhones
because Facebook

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.550
has just announced that React
Native is now open source.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.330
Demonstrated at this
year's React Conf,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.870
React Native is
a compiled target

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.640
which lets you run your
React app in native iOS.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.634
The project ships with
a bundle of components,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.300
and there's already
a catalog of add-ons

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.016
available at react.parts.

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:33.390
Building a web
for everyone means

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.280
making your site
accessible, but finding

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.241
good examples of accessible
websites can be tough.

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.240
A11ywins is a new Tumblr
created by Marcy Sutton

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.300
with daily updates highlighting
accessible websites.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.120
Featured sites like
status.modern.ie

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.430
demonstrate how complex sites
can be made usable for all.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.605
The wait is finally over
because Polymer 0.8 has landed.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.730
The new version brings with
it dramatic performance

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.300
improvements and
benchmarks showing

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.000
a 5x speedup in mobile
Safari and an 8x boost

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.267
in desktop Firefox.

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:02.100
You can get a first
look at this new release

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.730
in this week's episode of
"Polycast" by yours truly.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.530
Fetching resources is
a major bottleneck,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920
but what if you could tell
the browser to preload them?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.570
Preload link elements
tell the browser

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.610
that it should download
a resource ahead of time

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.276
since this resource
will be needed later

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:16.590
during page navigation.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.120
A recent intent to
implement signals

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.021
that preload links may
be coming to Chrome

00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:21.020
in the very near future.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.230
Move over IE because it's time
for developers to meet Spartan.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.760
Branded as a new browser for
the next iteration of Windows,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.150
Spartan is a stripped-down fork
of IE 11 aimed at being lean,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.777
mean, and standards-compliant.

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:36.860
You can catch "The Verge's"
deep dive into Spartan

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.710
or take it for a spin yourself
by downloading the Windows

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.444
Technical Preview.

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:43.860
The physical web
is all around us,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.859
or it will be soon thanks
to this set of beacons

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.056
created by Blesh.

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:48.930
Started as an experiment
by a team at Google,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.930
the physical web project
aims to give users

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.020
interaction on demand by
linking physical objects to web

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.130
applications.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.834
Beacons transmit signals
which are picked up your phone

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.250
and allow you to
open applications

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330
specific to your surroundings.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.100
Now it's time for a solar
system in your browser.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.540
To all you LazyWebbers out
there, thanks for watching.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.640
