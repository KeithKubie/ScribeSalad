00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's do one more bit of practice

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
converting non-deterministic machines to deterministic ones.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here I've written a non-deterministic machine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It has ambiguity.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Right in state 1 there are 2 ways to go on a.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It also has epsilon transitions,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I'll start making its deterministic equivalent down here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well, when we enter the non-deterministic machine,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we could only be in state 1, but after that we could see an a,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and if I see an a I could be in 2, 4,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or I could take the free epsilon transition to 5,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or I could keep going and take the free epsilon transition to 6.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll label my new state 2456

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because it keeps track of everywhere that I could have my fingers

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
if I'm simulating this non-deterministic machine.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, should this state be an accepting state or not?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, remember that a finite state machine accepts if there's any path

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to an accepting state, and 6 is one of our accepting states.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Because the original machine could accept a,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a, epsilon, epsilon, win, we want our new machine to also accept a.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A, win.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In my converted world, the state accepts if any of its corresponding

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
original states also accept.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's say that I'm in either 2, 4, 5, or 6 and I see a c.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If I'm in 2 and I see a c, I fall off the world.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If I'm in 4, fall off the world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
5, I go to 6, looking good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
6, fall off the world.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Here if I was in 2, 4, 5, or 6 and I see a c,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I end up just in state 6, and that's definitely an accepting state.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, there's some other ways to get out of 2, 4, 5, and 6,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and when we do, we might be in states 2 or 3.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Since 3 is an accepting state up there,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
2 or 3 is an accepting state down here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If I'm in 2 or 3, on a b from 2 I go to 3,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and c I'd fall off the world, so we'd end up in state 3.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If I'm in 2 or 3 and I see a c,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I must really have been in state 3, and I stay in state 3,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so either on b or c we end up in just state 3,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which is also an accepting state.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And if I'm in state 3, there's a self-loop back to state 3.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, I've filled out almost all of this deterministic equivalent.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But I forgot to label an edge.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Help me out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
As the quiz, what should the label for this edge be

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so that this deterministic equivalent and this non-deterministic machine

00:02:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
accept exactly the same language?
