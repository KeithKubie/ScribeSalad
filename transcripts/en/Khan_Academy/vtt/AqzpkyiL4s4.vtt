00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:02.640
- [Voiceover] Alice fills
up the gas tank of her car

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.648
before going for a long drive.

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:08.084
The equation below, and
that should be above.

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:12.313
The equation above models
the amount of gas, g,

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:16.970
in gallons in Alice's car
when she has driven m miles.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.561
What is the meaning of 32 in the equation?

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.440
All right, let's look up here.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.661
This is the gallons that
she has left in her car,

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.845
and what's going on here?

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.696
So it makes sense that,
look, when m is zero,

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:29.619
when she has driven
nothing, she's going to have

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.715
15 gallons in her car.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:33.845
And then as you drive more and more,

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:36.978
you're going to subtract more
and more gallons from her car.

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:39.742
So this is, this term right over here,

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:42.597
this is the number of gallons,

00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:45.453
this is the number of gallons used up.

00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:46.743
So why are you dividing?

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:51.306
If you have m miles divided
by 32, how do you get gallons?

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:54.450
What do the units on the 32 need to be?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.843
And so, let's just think about this.

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:59.689
If I have miles, so this is miles up here,

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:02.971
and I'm going to be dividing
them by some mystery units,

00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.633
some mystery units, I need to get gallons.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.249
I need to get, I need to get gallons,

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.767
'cause this is going to be
the number of gallons used up.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.702
So what are the mystery units going to be?

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.914
Well, we can treat these
units the way we would treat

00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:19.373
algebraic, algebraic variables.

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:22.466
So we could solve for units here.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.792
So we could take the
reciprocal of both sides,

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:27.508
and we could say the
units, the mystery units

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:31.399
divided by miles is going
to be one over gallons,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.818
or I guess you could say per gallon.

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:35.449
It's going to be one over gallons,

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.515
and then multiply both sides times miles.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:40.351
Multiply both sides times miles.

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.401
You're going to get the mystery units.

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:45.213
The mystery units are going to be,

00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:47.351
if you multiply both sides by miles,

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:50.541
and I don't want to get
confused with this over here.

00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:54.191
So we multiply both sides by miles,

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.938
both sides by miles.

00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:00.587
Your mystery units are going to be miles,

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.894
miles per gallon.

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:07.414
So this right over here,
the units over here,

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:10.456
in order for this thing
to come out to miles,

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:12.596
in order to come out to gallons,

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:14.252
in the numerator you have m miles

00:02:14.252 --> 00:02:18.142
divided by 32 miles per gallon,

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:20.219
miles per gallon.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.623
This is telling you how much mileage

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:26.965
you get per gallon for her
car, how much she is getting.

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.299
So let's look at the choices.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.873
Alice uses 32 gallons of gas per mile.

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:34.153
Now we have to be very careful.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.514
It's miles per gallon, not gas per mile.

00:02:38.214 --> 00:02:40.691
Alice's tank can hold 32 gallons of gas.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:45.195
No, Alice's tank can
hold 15 gallons of gas.

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:48.081
She fills up her tank, and
before she's driven anything,

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:49.672
we see here, when m is zero,

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:51.559
she's going to have 15 gallons in her car.

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.015
So that's not right.

00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:56.271
Alice can drive 32 miles on a tank of gas.

00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.932
That's right. The units here
are 32 miles per gallon.

00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:02.510
So that's that one.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.444
Alice's car can drive
32 miles to the gallon.

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:11.530
Oh, whoa, that was, that
was, that was a close one.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.749
This isn't 32 miles per gallon.

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.564
This is 32 miles on a tank of gas.

00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:17.841
This would be 32 miles on over 15 gallons.

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:19.252
No, no, that's not right.

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:21.050
Well, that was a close one.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.009
Alice's car can drive 32 miles per gallon.

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.852
That's right, 32 miles,
32 miles per gallon.

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.478
And if this unit business that I just did,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.116
you find it confusing, one
other way to think about it,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:37.083
I mean, you could have ruled,
you could have ruled out

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.963
something like this, because
when you look at this,

00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:42.942
you can see that okay, her tank holds 32,

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:46.569
her tank holds 15 gallons.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.147
You could have tried, you
could have tried this one,

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.609
and you would have seen that
the units didn't work out.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.691
If you have 15 gallons,

00:03:56.301 --> 00:04:00.911
15 gallons minus m miles

00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.002
divided by 32, 32 gallons per mile,

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:09.541
32 gallons per mile,

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.170
what would the units end up being here,

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.335
especially right over here?

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.640
You would have miles
divided by gallons per mile.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.873
This is going to be, this is
going to be minus m times,

00:04:19.873 --> 00:04:23.040
I guess let me write
it this way, m over 32,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.585
miles times miles per gallon,

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.848
miles per, miles per gallon,

00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:32.679
and you get miles squared per gallon.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:35.930
You'd get these crazy units up here.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.778
So, hopefully it makes sense

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:39.866
that we would pick this last choice.

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:41.952
And this one almost got me
when they said tank of gas.

00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:43.499
I was thinking, my brain
was thinking gallon.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.685
I was so already
programmed for the answer.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:49.503
But anyway, yes, the last choice

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:51.192
is what we want to go with.
