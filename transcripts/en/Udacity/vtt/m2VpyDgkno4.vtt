00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.150
Yeah, so how can we make forms that
are fast, easy and accurate to fill in?

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.480
Which is essentially all of form design.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.630
So, I'll try a distill
an entire book slash

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620
years worth of materials into
a couple of minute answer.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.930
But at the very highest level,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.340
when we have a series of
questions we need answered.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.230
The process we should start with is this
thing that Caroline Gerrit calls, keep,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.430
cut, postpone, or kill,
I think is the right methodology.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.260
I might have one of those words wrong.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.150
But keep is, this is information
that's critical, required,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.120
we've got to have it
in the form somewhere.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.130
Cut, I guess that's the one for kill.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.110
Cut means we actually don't need it.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.450
And it's surprising how many times
you can go and look at forms and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.710
see things that are included there and
nobody's even actually using.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.359
You go and talk to the team like, oh,

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.444
well what are we doing
with this piece of data?

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:50.035
I don't know.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:53.850
because it's over here, has anybody
look at this in the past three years?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.700
No, but we've always collected this.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.120
So here it is.
So there's stuff you can cut.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.478
Postpone is things
that you can ask later.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:06.190
So there's a lot of information that
we force you to give us upfront,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.610
which isn't applicable, and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.330
actually has a better time and
place further down in the flow.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.940
So postponing questions
until they're appropriate

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.410
is a really good strategy as well,
and the last one is explain.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.310
And explain just basically boils down
to telling people why you're asking for

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.130
something, or
how they can answer that question.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.440
There's a case study at the beginning
of my web form design book where

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.288
a major e-tailer, a huge e-commerce
site, had two options at checkout,

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:37.170
one was log-in and one was register.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800
It turned out you could actually
register without creating an account.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.830
You could actually buy something
without making an account, but

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.050
it was totally unclear
from that language.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.300
Login or register.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.130
So what they did is they changed the
label of the button that said register

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.240
to continue and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.950
they put a little bit of text that said
you do not need an account to continue.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.300
And conversions went
up something like 30%.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.610
They made 300 million
more a year overnight,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.810
just from explaining what they
were actually talking about.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.190
So that keep, cut, postpone, and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.870
explain methodology is great
at the very highest level.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.840
Then when you go deeper, you get much
more into interaction design and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.830
visual design considerations.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.830
What's the right input control for
this type of question?

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.860
How do I minimize typing mistakes?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.000
How do I bound people so
that they don't go into an error state?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.560
And you can do that with things
like custom keyboards, input types,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.540
inline validation.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.580
There's a whole school of methodology
for the nuances of forms.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.440
But it all starts at that bigger picture
methodology of really thinking through

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.000
what should be there, where and
what you need to tell people about

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.110
the questions you're asking them,
if that makes sense.
