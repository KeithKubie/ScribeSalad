00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.330
Engineers in San Diego are working on smart
clothes to cool and heat the human body using

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.900
fabric that expands or shrinks in reaction
to temperature.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:20.119
And 100 million dollars have just been allocated
to use radio telescopes to search for aliens.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.159
Researchers at Duke University connected the
brains of four rats to create a brainet.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.769
After networking the four brains via electrodes
the rats were given tasks in memory storage

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.250
and retrieval and the brainet performed better
than individual rats did.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.030
This technology could revolutionize computing,
as well as provide new mental and physical

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.480
therapies for stroke victims or people in
comas.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
Oregon State University researchers have patented
bacon seaweed.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.980
Created from a strain of red marine algae
this new superfood is packed with minerals

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.829
and proteins and has twice the nutritional
value of Kale.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.800
But most importantly when it's fried it tastes
like bacon.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.600
A construction company VolkerWessels hopes
to start building roads out of plastic.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.000
Their proposed idea would be to collect plastic
floating in the ocean and then process it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.430
into sections of road that could be installed
onsite like tiles.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.500
In theory, these roads would be more durable,
environmentally friendly, and easier to install

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.870
than asphalt, however concerns over their
safety when in contact with rain or extreme

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.590
heat must be addressed before the project
can move forward.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.159
Not to mention the actual cost of collecting
plastics from the ocean.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.000
The Hankook iflex is an airless tire.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.189
Comprised of three solid sections the iflex
promises a smoother ride, more fuel efficient

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.979
driving, and it's not only made out of recycled
materials it can itself be recycled.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.049
The tire has actually been in development
for several years but recent advances in the

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.340
manufacturing process means they can start
moving past prototyping stages and into performance

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.090
and durability testing.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.780
The In-situ Fabricator is a robot that can
lay bricks for construction sites.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.659
Unique in that it is autonomous, the fabricator
can build a 3D map of a construction site

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.759
and upload it, which also means that the robot
can navigate the area on its own.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.910
It’s not yet ready for commercialization
though as it needs a human to feed it bricks.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.190
Images of celebrities were used in mind game
experiments to discover how memories are formed.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
The researchers would show a subject a photo
of someone like Jennifer Aniston next to the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.470
Eiffel Tower and then monitor which neurons
fired within the brain.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.040
They found that if then just shown an image
of Jennifer Aniston the subject’s neurons

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.610
related to the Eiffel Tower would also fire
up, illustrating that neurons change their

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.470
firing properties at the exact moment that
a memory is formed.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.720
Basically, they observed learning.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.280
The Stella Lux is a family-oriented solar
car that generates more energy than it uses.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.290
Built to accommodate four people and reach
a speed of 77 MPH (125 KM) the Stella Lux

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.860
is able to take its surplus energy each day
and return it to the grid.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.510
In October, it will be competing in the Bridgestone
world solar challenge, and if you pledge of

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.800
10,000 euros to the team they’ll fly you
to Australia to take a ride in the car.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.160
A new species of Raptor was discovered in
China and it has feathered wings.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.870
The raptor probably couldn’t fly, so possible
explanations for the wings include for use

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.280
in mating displays, protecting eggs, or regulating
body temperature.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.230
The discovery raises questions about the evolution
of wings, and how they may have initially

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.870
evolved for purposes other than flying.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.150
Raytheon has created a see-through aluminum
ceramic that is bullet proof.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.880
The substance is half as heavy as traditional
bullet proof glass and is twice as effective

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.550
at stopping bullets, and it remains transparent
even after being shot.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.550
So far the armor is only used for battlefield
lenses, or windows over missile sensors, but

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.980
could someday allow for even safer windshields.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.120
Buddy is a new companion robot for your home.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
He autonomously patrols the house reminding
you of important events, acting as your alarm

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.860
clock, turning off your lights when you’re
not around, and alerting you of suspicious

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.860
activity.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.900
You can take control of buddy remotely in
order to check on your home, and he can act

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.720
as a party photographer, or tutor for your
child.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.030
And he's being built to be a robotic modular
platform that a community could program for

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.030
and improve.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.950
Finally mcity, is a city built specifically
for autonomous vehicles.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.759
The types of technologies that'll be tested
out here are both connected so vehicles communicating

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.000
with other vehicles even around blind corners
as well as to the infrastructure.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.670
And then various levels of automation all
the way up to fully autonomous.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.919
Will the automated vehicle detect the pedestrian
in the crosswalk and stop?

00:04:31.919 --> 00:05:09.800
I’m going to leave you with tangible holograms,
and as always, thanks 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.090
for watching.
