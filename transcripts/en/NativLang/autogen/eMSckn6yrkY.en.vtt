grammatical rule is by helping you to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080
grammatical rule is by helping you to
 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.930
grammatical rule is by helping you to
formulate a rule to explain a

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940
formulate a rule to explain a
 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.990

it looks like the verb and the subject

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979
it looks like the verb and the subject
 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.760

to switch places when you ask a question
so let's try and formulate a rule using

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840
so let's try and formulate a rule using
 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.749
so let's try and formulate a rule using
the concept of inversion to describe the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759
the concept of inversion to describe the
 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.700
the concept of inversion to describe the
situation in English and see how well it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710

it explain the second example has he

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729
it explain the second example has he
 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.090
it explain the second example has he
done the work in that case our main verb

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100
done the work in that case our main verb
 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.190
done the work in that case our main verb
is actually an auxiliary with the past

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200
is actually an auxiliary with the past
 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.910
is actually an auxiliary with the past
participle it has done but the whole

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
participle it has done but the whole
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.160
participle it has done but the whole
phrase has done doesn't switch doesn't

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170
phrase has done doesn't switch doesn't
 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.440
phrase has done doesn't switch doesn't
invert with the subject only the verb

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
invert with the subject only the verb
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.230
invert with the subject only the verb
has does so we don't find that we ask

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
has does so we don't find that we ask
 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.410
has does so we don't find that we ask
has done he the work we ask has he done

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
has done he the work we ask has he done
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.649
has done he the work we ask has he done
the work we realized that we don't move

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659
the work we realized that we don't move
 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.959
the work we realized that we don't move
the whole verb phrase we actually

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969
the whole verb phrase we actually
 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.539
the whole verb phrase we actually
extract a verb from its verb phrase and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549
extract a verb from its verb phrase and
 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.280
extract a verb from its verb phrase and
place it before the subject now

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
place it before the subject now
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560
place it before the subject now
it doesn't look like we're inverting

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
it doesn't look like we're inverting
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300
it doesn't look like we're inverting
anything because the subject noun

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
anything because the subject noun
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.690
anything because the subject noun
doesn't end up inside the verb phrase

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
doesn't end up inside the verb phrase
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.350
doesn't end up inside the verb phrase
instead it looks like we're actually

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
instead it looks like we're actually
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.110
instead it looks like we're actually
just extracting that one head verb and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
just extracting that one head verb and
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.200
just extracting that one head verb and
moving it before the noun with that in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210
moving it before the noun with that in
 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.270
moving it before the noun with that in
mind let's formulate a new rule to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
mind let's formulate a new rule to
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610
mind let's formulate a new rule to
describe the situation let's say English

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
describe the situation let's say English
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160
describe the situation let's say English
speakers extract the head verb from its

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
speakers extract the head verb from its
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290
speakers extract the head verb from its
verb phrase and move it before the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
verb phrase and move it before the
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.170
verb phrase and move it before the
subject noun to ask a question now we

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
subject noun to ask a question now we
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.210
subject noun to ask a question now we
have a descriptive rule that seems to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
have a descriptive rule that seems to
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.310
have a descriptive rule that seems to
work for both of the examples we have at

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320
work for both of the examples we have at
 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.560
work for both of the examples we have at
hand

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
hand
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.760
hand
so we're going to change our rule

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770
so we're going to change our rule
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.070
so we're going to change our rule
slightly to produce similar sentences

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
slightly to produce similar sentences
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.260
slightly to produce similar sentences
but the slight change we're making is a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270
but the slight change we're making is a
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.680
but the slight change we're making is a
move toward imperative logic extract the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
move toward imperative logic extract the
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.900
move toward imperative logic extract the
verb from its verb phrase and move it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
verb from its verb phrase and move it
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.630
verb from its verb phrase and move it
before the subject now this gives us a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
before the subject now this gives us a
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.670
before the subject now this gives us a
set of instructions that if applied to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
set of instructions that if applied to
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.590
set of instructions that if applied to
the declarative sentence produces the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600
the declarative sentence produces the
 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.760
the declarative sentence produces the
question as its output this be have

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770
question as its output this be have
 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.220
question as its output this be have
question asking rule will work pretty

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
question asking rule will work pretty
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.220
question asking rule will work pretty
well until we get to an example like he

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
well until we get to an example like he
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.800
well until we get to an example like he
will have done the work on Friday we'd

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810
will have done the work on Friday we'd
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900
will have done the work on Friday we'd
expect will he have done the work on

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910
expect will he have done the work on
 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.110
expect will he have done the work on
Friday but we get have he will done the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
Friday but we get have he will done the
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.110
Friday but we get have he will done the
work on Friday these rules are a work in

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
work on Friday these rules are a work in
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.800
work on Friday these rules are a work in
progress then I hope you now have a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
progress then I hope you now have a
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.479
progress then I hope you now have a
handle on the basics of the grammar of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
handle on the basics of the grammar of
 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.580
handle on the basics of the grammar of
sentences and thank you for learning

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
sentences and thank you for learning
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.070
sentences and thank you for learning
with me
