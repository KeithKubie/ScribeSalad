00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.152
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Early on, we saw that if we have a compound inequality that's written in a

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.706
chained form like this, it's really the same as having two inequalities joined

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:13.393
together with an and. We know that with this inequality, x needs to lie between

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:18.053
negative 2 and 6, where 2 is included in the interval. So it's true that both x

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:22.847
is greater than or equal to negative 2, then we have x is less than 6. Let's

00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:27.300
graph each of these individually on a number line, and then, the compound

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.740
inequality on a third one. First we have that x is greater than or equal to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.485
negative 2, or in other words, that negative 2 is less than or equal to x. Then

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:40.903
we have, x is less than 6. And then if we graph these two together, what we're

00:00:40.903 --> 00:00:45.323
really doing is finding the shaded part of the number line between the two that

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:49.743
overlaps. So, if for example, I lay this number line on top of this number line,

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:53.964
and I then shade in the part that's overlapping, I get exactly what we have in

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.952
the compound inequality down here, because of the and. We have a double

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:02.374
restriction happening, and that further reins in the values that x can equal to

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.595
this smaller range than we would have if we had either one of these true on its

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:06.984
own.
