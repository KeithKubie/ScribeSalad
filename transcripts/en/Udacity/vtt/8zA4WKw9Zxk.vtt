00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:03.040
So to close, do you have any thoughts for students who are taking this class?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.542
I mean, it's very exciting to get to teach thousands of students about parallel computing.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.559
What should they be thinking about going forward?

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.730
I think my big advice for students is to get your feet wet.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.568
Go out there and write a bunch of parallel programs. The future of the world is parallel.

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.456
Serial programs, it's going to be like COBOL programs.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:21.807
I mean, and people used to do those, but they don't do them anymore.

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:27.003
Don't just write the program, but be a critic of your own code,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:31.393
and go and profile it, understand why it performs the way it does,

00:00:31.393 --> 00:00:34.641
and understand that memory is not flat.

00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.963
If you want to get good performance out of a program,

00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:40.861
you have to understand the hierarchy of the memory system and find a compelling application.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.642
I always find that if you really want to make progress on improving your programming skills,

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:47.658
especially parallel programming skills,

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:51.677
it's motivating to say, okay, I've got this really cool computational photography application.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.579
I'm going to make cool pictures.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.885
That's actually one reason why graphics is so fun is that you can see your results.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:01.260
Super. Thanks so much for coming, Bill. I really appreciate your time.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.123
Oh, well thank you, John. It's really been a pleasure.
