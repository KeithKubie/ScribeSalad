00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.090
There are over 3 Billion base pairs in just 1 copy

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.090
of the human genome. That's such a huge number, it, its

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.620
hard for humans to conceive of such a big number in

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.160
isolation. So let's put it in a little more context. If you

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.650
were to run the sequence of the human genome across this

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.360
very screen at the rate of about 15 letters per second

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.750
It would take over six years for you to read the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.690
whole thing just one time. No bathroom breaks, no eating, no sleeping,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.860
just reading the sequence for over six years.
