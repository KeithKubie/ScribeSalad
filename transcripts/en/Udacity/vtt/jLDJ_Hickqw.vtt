Welcome to the Beginning Ruby
nanodegree program.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.719
I'm Walter.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:04.410
&gt;&gt; I'm Colt.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.010
&gt;&gt; And I'm Julia.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt; And we'll be your instructors.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.460
Congratulations on taking your first
steps towards becoming a Ruby developer.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.650
&gt;&gt; We've teamed up with industry leaders
to create a program that will help you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.678
build the foundational skills you
need to become a web developer.

00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:20.530
In this nanodegree program you'll
iterate on a series of projects for

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.550
your portfolio designed to get
you thinking like a programmer.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.890
&gt;&gt; Our goal is for you to become
a self-sufficient programmer.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.835
It's not simply enough for us to teach
you technical syntax in isolationw.

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:34.045
We want you to become a contributing
member of the Ruby community.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.135
&gt;&gt; We'll be here to
support you along the way.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.555
&gt;&gt; And before we get started, let's
first go over some general information

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.595
about what you can expect
from this nanodegree program.
