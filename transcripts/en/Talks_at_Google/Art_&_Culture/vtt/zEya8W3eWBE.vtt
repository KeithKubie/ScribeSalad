BRETT PERLMUTTER: Can we do
another applause for Cimafunk?

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.260
An [SPANISH]?

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:14.760
Wow.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.030
So my first question
is something everyone

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.240
is wondering in the room.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.258
How do you move
your legs like that?

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:24.800
Have you always been
able to do that?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.708
CIMAFUNK: No.

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:26.250
I don't know.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.020
I don't know.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.660
It just happened one day.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.020
I asked myself if could be
nice if you can sing and dance,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.610
so try and it work.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.335
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
What day was that?

00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:39.460
CIMAFUNK: I don't remember.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460
It was a long time ago.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.870
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
So you were young?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.800
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, I working in a
cruise ship for eighth months.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.230
So it's like a show and stuff.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.300
You have to make it show there.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.645
So I start to say, OK, maybe
I can dance and sing also.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:51.770
Could be nice for the show.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.570
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
That's pretty good.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.810
Well, tell us about
the name Cimafunk.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.177
Where does it come from?

00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:00.510
CIMAFUNK: Well, the name "Cima."

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.160
"Cima" is, it come
from the word cimarrón.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.507
Cimarrón, I seen that in
English, it call my rooms.

00:17:08.507 --> 00:17:10.715
Was a slave who escaped from
the house was the master

00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:13.944
and start to in
the forest, hide.

00:17:13.944 --> 00:17:15.619
In Cuba what we
call in cimarrón.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.589
So I always fully identify with
that because for my family,

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:23.700
he was like a Nigerian guy who
came in the forest of Pinar del

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.200
Río.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.780
And he was a slave,
also, and stuff.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.518
So the history and the files
say that he was a slave

00:17:29.518 --> 00:17:30.560
and he came from Nigeria.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.200
So I figured out that and
I feel very identified

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.040
with his culture.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.710
And also because
they are from Cuba.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.900
[INAUDIBLE] through all
the rhythm, all the stuff.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.470
Was the African people who
bring these to our country.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.360
So I take "cima" from cimarrón
and funk for the music,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.108
for the style, for the
visuality, for funk.

00:17:48.108 --> 00:17:49.400
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Unbelievable.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.060
So you have been compared
to the James Brown of Cuba.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.730
CIMAFUNK: No, no, no.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.032
This is not right.

00:17:58.032 --> 00:17:59.240
It's too much, it's too much.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.970
I'm just learning the styles.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.625
This is too-- it's
too hard being that.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.500
BRETT PERLMUTTER: I
mean, nevertheless you're

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.370
doing big things.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.160
You were reviewed by
"New Yorker" magazine.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.030
One reviewer called you, like,
a mix between Missy Elliott

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.330
and Cameo infused with a strong
dose of Caribbean flavor.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.603
CIMAFUNK: That's crazy man.

00:18:19.603 --> 00:18:21.270
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Are
these people nuts?

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.312
I mean, we just heard it.

00:18:22.312 --> 00:18:23.870
CIMAFUNK: Yeah.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.658
You know, everybody feels
the scene in their own way.

00:18:27.658 --> 00:18:28.200
I don't know.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.910
I'm just, I'm recycling
the music, the style.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.800
I'm putting a little
bit on myself,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.025
but I'm using the stuff
that they already done.

00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:36.900
I'm love James Brown.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.330
I'm love [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.792
And I have a lot of
reference from music

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:41.750
from the United States.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.170
I really love all the old times.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.670
And I'm, like, taking
this thing from there,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.040
and I'm putting my stuff
with my Cuban thing.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.270
And it is what is.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.562
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So who are
your points of references?

00:18:52.562 --> 00:18:54.250
Who are your musical influences?

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.980
CIMAFUNK: I hear a lot, since I
was a child, to Lionel Richie.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.770
So my uncle give me a cassette
of Michael Jackson also,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.440
the album "Invincible."

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.380
And after I started to
follow the music from US.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.430
Ohio Players.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.500
Funkadelic.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.490
James Brown, of course.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.360
Marvin Gaye.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.320
Prince.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.850
Sonny Boy.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.200
A lot of all people.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.450
All the [INAUDIBLE]
and also Sam &amp; Dave.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.020
And I'm from Cuba and all this.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.920
And I get a huge
background from Cuba--

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.502
Benny Moré, Bola de
Nieve, Celia Cruz.

00:19:25.502 --> 00:19:26.710
Everybody, everybody in Cuba.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.400
It's a lot of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.075
It's a band were
I still working.

00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:33.950
You have been, like,
t-shirt for many people.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.200
And, like, this is
like many musicians.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.800
And I listen
everyday someone new.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.983
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So it's
truly Afro-Cuban funk?

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:44.150
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, it seems so.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.490
It seems so.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.300
Yeah, the people, when
the people ask you

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.160
for a style of music, I say
Afro-Cuban because I'm African

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.430
and Cuban and stuff and funk
because it's a mix of that.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.230
But at the end, it's music.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.787
It's groove, it's groove.

00:19:59.787 --> 00:20:00.870
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Amazing.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.980
So what-- we're here
in Google, so I'd

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.370
be remiss if I didn't talk
about the internet a little bit.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:13.400
So in Cuba, we're witnessing an
amazing step change in access

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.930
to the internet.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.860
Before there was this amount
of internet access in Cuba,

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.447
how did you share your music?

00:20:20.447 --> 00:20:21.530
How did you distribute it?

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:21.890
CIMAFUNK: Before?

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.932
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Before.

00:20:22.932 --> 00:20:25.340
CIMAFUNK: Well
before that, I wasn't

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.700
making a lot of campaign.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.280
So I was more calm.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.650
Before that it's a
behave in television,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.930
in the TV and the radio.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.920
But it was a little
bit more hard.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.480
We have something called the
Paquete that is a platform

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.400
that the people use
for share music.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.000
And you have a lot of
information, and you go

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.755
and you copy all
this information.

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:46.610
And the people have,
like, many houses

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.200
when they give you this
information to the town,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.460
to the crowd.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.910
And that's the most viable
way to share the information

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.960
before the internet.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.920
And now also work super good.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.270
But no, definitely was a change.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.630
Was a big change when we start
to get access to the internet.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.082
For me, especially, it was
like a huge difference.

00:21:08.082 --> 00:21:10.040
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So you
had the Paquete, which

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.870
is like an offline internet.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.840
And now you have
internet access that's

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.770
becoming more ubiquitous.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.980
It's becoming cheaper
and more accessible.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.850
Here in Google we
had put servers

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:28.380
in Cuba, which came live
in 2017 that made platforms

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.865
like YouTube available there.

00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:31.990
CIMAFUNK: That's great,
that's great, that's great.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.720
And these were fast already.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.370
Were more fast that--

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.410
well, before it was
impossible get in there.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.713
Now it's working, it's working.

00:21:38.713 --> 00:21:40.130
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
So it's working.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.528
OK, that's good.

00:21:41.528 --> 00:21:42.945
We're going to
tell the engineers.

00:21:42.945 --> 00:21:44.190
CIMAFUNK: Yes, yes, yes.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.410
It's safe to say congratulations
to the engineers.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.890
Thank you.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.000
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So how do
you share your music now?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.560
CIMAFUNK: I share
for both sides.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.470
I shared the analogic
way that is the Paquete

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.315
and I share the internet way.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.630
But now it is amazing.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.560
Because before, the most part
of the crowd, the audience

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.120
to follow Cimafunk
when I started

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.450
was from outside of Cuba.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.970
Because I released the
album in Paris and I

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.380
made all the campaign there.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.672
But now it's, like,
90% of the people

00:22:14.672 --> 00:22:16.380
are from Cuba who are
following Cimafunk.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.440
And it's in the network,
it's in the internet

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.730
where I'm making everything,
almost everything now.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.550
All the personal information
of the concert, all the joke.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.300
Everything.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.540
I post there and I have the most
part of the crowd is from Cuba.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.100
That's why was telling you.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.235
That's something new.

00:22:30.235 --> 00:22:31.110
That's something new.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.720
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So your
digital audience is in Cuba?

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.345
CIMAFUNK: Yeah.

00:22:34.345 --> 00:22:38.280
The most part of the
people is crazy with that.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.440
The people get
connection and it's

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.060
like a full time, full time.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.462
They always trying to find a way
to be connect to the internet,

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:47.170
and it's good because
I'm doing the same.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.990
So I'm making information,
putting information out there.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.415
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
That's fabulous.

00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:50.985
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:52.410
It's great, it's great.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.312
Been a good change.

00:22:53.312 --> 00:22:54.270
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Yeah.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.080
So in many ways, in Cuban,
I know you're very humble.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.040
But I've gone to concerts
where you're selling out,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.390
there are tens of thousands
of people crammed to see you.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.750
And really you're
becoming, or your sound

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.910
is becoming, a bit of the
sound of this new generation

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.860
of creatives in Cuba.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.690
And we had the opportunity to
collaborate in a fashion show

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.390
with Clandestina, and you
opened for the fashion show.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.450
How do you collaborate with
other creatives in Cuba?

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.930
CIMAFUNK: Well, now
we are making them.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.430
For example, for all
the visual content

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.500
I work with many designers.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.720
Now especially with
Idania [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.760
She have the great hands
for all these things.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.130
So she's a creator,
and she's giving me

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.620
the chance to work with her.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.350
And for the visual side,
all people from audiovisual,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.690
we are working together
with Clandestina.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.490
Also, they've maybe some custom.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.590
Now it's a movement of
trying to be all together,

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.170
trying to put this in better.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.140
It's the only way
if we stay together.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.750
In my generation, now, that
is the feeling in Cuba.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.780
It's the feeling of the
people are going to stay here.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.630
I'm going to try to improve,
especially, the arts.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.707
Now we had the
biennale, you should

00:24:14.707 --> 00:24:15.790
know it's a madness there.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.218
It's like a most
young than ever.

00:24:18.218 --> 00:24:19.760
More people from my
generation that--

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.745
BRETT PERLMUTTER: This
is the art biennial?

00:24:21.745 --> 00:24:22.620
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.240
The art biennale [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.323
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Amazing.

00:24:25.323 --> 00:24:26.670
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, it's crazy now.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.240
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So if we were
to hop over to United States,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.235
how has your time here been?

00:24:32.235 --> 00:24:34.110
Is this your first tour
in the United States?

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.090
CIMAFUNK: Yeah,
it's my first tour.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:36.980
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
And how's it going?

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.080
CIMAFUNK: Yeah.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.870
Great, great.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:38.730
It's great.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.920
Everywhere that we
arrive, the people

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.910
receive us with really
kindness and they give us

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:46.690
all time, everything.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:51.930
And we have been in places
really special for us.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.600
Example, this is a super
special to be here.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.420
And you all announced, so we
was playing in Tipitina's.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.060
And in Washington, we
play in Tropicalia.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.540
It's like places
when the people--

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.370
that the people enjoy and place
it with history and stuff.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.930
So have been great,
have been great.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.780
All the culture, all the
people, the music industry.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.845
It's amazing.

00:25:10.845 --> 00:25:11.970
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Fabulous.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.290
That's great.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.390
And tell us about
your concert in Miami.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:21.670
So historically, going to Miami
has a certain significance.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.270
CIMAFUNK: Yeah because
it's everybody there.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.940
It's Cuba, it's Cuba, it's Cuba.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.690
Miami is, like, a lot
of people from Cuba.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.728
And they was waiting for
the music for many time

00:25:30.728 --> 00:25:32.770
and they was, like, getting
crazy in the network.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.478
Like, you have to
come, you have to come.

00:25:34.478 --> 00:25:36.600
So when we arrive, it
was like a madness there.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.773
It was a crazy day.

00:25:37.773 --> 00:25:39.190
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
It was sold out.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.645
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:40.437
Sold out, sold out.

00:25:40.437 --> 00:25:41.450
That was crazy.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.410
The people was crazy.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:50.180
And it was 12:00 AM, and was
kids getting to the stage.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.290
It was, like, crazy.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.033
Crazy day.

00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:54.450
BRETT PERLMUTTER:
Sounds fabulous.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.790
Sounds like you'll remember
it for a long time.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.760
CIMAFUNK: Yeah, definitely.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.850
We want to come back now.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.183
In May we're going to come back.

00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:00.183
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Great.

00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:01.020
CIMAFUNK: May again.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.400
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Great.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.700
So what is one thing that
the world should know

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.210
about Cuba and Cuban music?

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.610
CIMAFUNK: Well, I think that
there's many, many things.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:19.340
I'm super proud of
being Cuba, and I'm

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:23.200
super proud of the legacy
of the music in Cuba.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.380
I'm seeing that, and the people
should know that, we are,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.310
my generation is getting now
more in touch with the past

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.910
and with things that the
Cuban music have done for them

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.660
for the universal music.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.810
And it's great.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.880
It's great that
the people can know

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.590
that the importance
of the Cuban music

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.890
in the actual music
in the hip-hop,

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.370
in the funk, in the jazz,
and in many, many music.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.930
Even in the rock, if you hear.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.560
[SPANISH] and los Afro-Cuban.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.250
It was one of the first big
bands who arrived to in here.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.310
And you hear the
mambos of [SPANISH]

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.240
and after you hear some
beat from The Beatles

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.000
20 years later, and you
see that is the same lines.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.440
So it's like Cuba have been
there since many time ago.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.607
And it's important for us
try to put this in there

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:10.690
in the mind of the people.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.732
It's more than reggaeton.

00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:14.110
It's more Latin by many,
many musical styles

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:18.515
that bond the country and get
transforming in other stuff.

00:27:18.515 --> 00:27:19.810
BRETT PERLMUTTER: That's great.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.430
Well, I think the audience
wants to ask a few questions,

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.172
but before they do I
have a surprise for you.

00:27:26.172 --> 00:27:27.880
I didn't tell you I
was going to do this.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.005
We're going to play a game.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.100
It's a game of free association.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.030
It's very simple.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.950
So I'm going to say
one word or one phrase,

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.200
and then you're going to
tell me the first thing that

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.105
comes to your mind in one
word or one phrase, OK?

00:27:44.105 --> 00:27:44.980
CIMAFUNK: Easy words.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.188
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Easy words.

00:27:46.188 --> 00:27:48.420
OK.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.980

Florian.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.550
AUDIENCE: I saw y'all in
the dining hall and I said,

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:26.840
they're too cool to work here.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.830
And I was right.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.650
I was right.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.370
Tremendous.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.640
I feel like I want to watch
the movie that you guys would

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:36.320
be the soundtrack to.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.420
That's where my brain went.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.000
I'm very curious
about the effect

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.450
that your rise as a
style, as a group,

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.480
is having on dance
culture in Cuba.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.140
Because, as a student
of salsa myself, I

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.500
saw several continents
moving in the legs on stage.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.360
And I wonder how is
that translating now,

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.652
you mentioned with the arrival
of internet and the fact

00:49:58.652 --> 00:50:01.250
that people can see more of
you, what effect that's having

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:02.380
on dance culture.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.650
CIMAFUNK: Bueno.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.900
This is [INAUDIBLE]
everybody is positive.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.520
Because normally the people
in Cuba dance more salsa

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.150
is what we used to do normally.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.560
Salsa or reggaeton.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.290
Sometimes some
dancehall or some stuff

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:19.010
like that, but never
something like this.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:21.350
But the scene is that
the people now they

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.900
don't ask what we are playing.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.630
When they feel it, they
move and they are dancing.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.960
So when the people start to
realize a couple of months

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.530
ago that was all the music
and they could dance that,

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.780
then it was more
intense and they

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.713
start to communicate
with us and say, OK, man.

00:50:37.713 --> 00:50:38.630
We can dance with you.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.630
So we go to the concert.

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:41.810
If we want to dance, we go
to a concert to Cimafunk.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.030
It's no salsa, it's no
reggaeton, but we can dance.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.190
Oh it's positive.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.760
100%.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.382
Thank you.

00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:50.340
BRETT PERLMUTTER: We have
a question over here.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:50.840
Steve.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.540
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.332
Yeah, I noticed, I
couldn't help but notice

00:50:53.332 --> 00:50:56.460
at the end of the set while
Brett was on stage with you,

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.100
maybe his talents could best
be used outside of here.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.170
You have an opening,
you know, for Cimafunk.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:02.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:02.942 --> 00:51:05.400
BRETT PERLMUTTER: If I could
be one of your backup dancers.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.150
CIMAFUNK: Wow man.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.160
Definitely bro.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.790
He's a dancer also.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.280
AUDIENCE: I noticed the same.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:11.970
I was thinking the same.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:13.080
CIMAFUNK: Man if you want.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.538
Tomorrow we will
play in the night,

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.430
so tomorrow everybody's invited.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.540
And you can come up
to the stage and you

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.590
can do whatever you feel.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:21.870
You want to dance, you
want to play something.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.990
The stage tomorrow
is for everybody.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:27.930
So you're invited,
man, if you want to go.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.743
BRETT PERLMUTTER: With his
endorsement, I'll take it.

00:51:30.743 --> 00:51:32.910
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering how
you picked the band, how

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.800
that kind of came together.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:39.005
CIMAFUNK: Normally, I put in
a previous band with more--

00:51:39.005 --> 00:51:40.380
I'm going to say
more all people.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.450
And because I don't know music.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.250
I just make by hear.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.090
I made the things.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.550
I record with the voice, and
sometimes the musician came

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.620
and they put more in that.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.350
But at the beginning,
I start to travel

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.370
to work with other musicians.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:58.050
But we didn't get the
good communication,

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.660
because they was,
like, too much music

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.210
and I couldn't find
a way to transmit

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.840
what I was trying to do.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.730
So I tell you, almost.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.240
I send out maybe one year
putting the musician together.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.300
And I chose new
guys in the media

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.770
in the musical
environment in Cuba.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.630
So we start to talk, we
start to get communication.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.850
And finally, we understand and
we start to groove together.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:27.370
It was a crazy process.

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.446
We tried six bass players.

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:34.940
It was crazy, but at the end
we found the right people.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.900
Thank you.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.233
BRETT PERLMUTTER: So it was
a much easier process for me

00:52:38.233 --> 00:52:39.818
to become one of your dancers?

00:52:39.818 --> 00:52:41.235
CIMAFUNK: I don't
know about that.

00:52:41.235 --> 00:52:41.880
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.713
You can dance, you can
dance, you can dance.

00:52:43.713 --> 00:52:45.020
If you feel it, you can dance.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.145
BRETT PERLMUTTER: Who knew?

00:52:46.145 --> 00:52:46.680
All right.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.430
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.295
I heard that you were going
to be a medical student,

00:52:50.295 --> 00:52:52.170
or you were.

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.075
What happened?

00:52:53.075 --> 00:52:53.700
CIMAFUNK: Yeah.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.415
Music, music, music, music.

00:52:55.415 --> 00:52:56.790
Because when I
was in the school,

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:58.380
I started to make music.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.780
And when I arrived
to the capital,

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.622
I was living in the
outside of the countryside.

00:53:05.622 --> 00:53:07.080
When I arrived to
the capital and I

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.960
saw what was happening there
with the music environment,

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.990
I just decided to
quick and move.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.190
And I do, I finished.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.980
I stop the school
and I ride to Havana

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:21.872
and start to find a way to
improve myself in music.

00:53:21.872 --> 00:53:23.830
AUDIENCE: And I will see
you in Havana in July?

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:24.413
CIMAFUNK: Yes.

00:53:24.413 --> 00:53:26.310
Definitely,
definitely, definitely.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:26.810
Thanks.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.863
Thank you.

00:53:27.863 --> 00:53:30.030
BRETT PERLMUTTER: OK, so
let's do one final applause

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.810
for Cimafunk.

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:31.870
Thank you.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:35.310
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.110
CIMAFUNK: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.460
[APPLAUSE]
