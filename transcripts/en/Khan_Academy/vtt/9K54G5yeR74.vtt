00:00:00.977 --> 00:00:03.530
- [Instructor] We are asked
to evaluate the expression

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.212
five to the x power minus
three to the x power

00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:09.613
for x equals two.

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.723
So pause this video, and
see if you can figure out,

00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:16.563
what does this expression
equal when x equals two?

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:18.050
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.495
So what we want to do is
everywhere we see an x,

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:22.080
we want to replace it with a two.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.098
So this expression, for
x equals two, would be

00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:27.810
five to the second power

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.918
minus three to the second power.

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:33.308
Well, what's that going to be equal to?

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.221
Well, five to the second power,

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.105
that's the same thing as five times five.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.384
And then from that, we
are going to subtract

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:43.884
three times three,

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:46.830
three times three.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.512
And now order of operations would tell us

00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:50.894
to do the multiplication
or do the exponents first,

00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:52.522
which is this multiplication.

00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:55.221
But just to make it clear,
I'll put some parentheses here.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.020
And this is going to be equal to,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.853
five times five is 25,

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:01.689
minus

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.363
nine,

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.798
which is equal to,

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:07.870
what's 25 minus nine?

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.167
It is equal to 16.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.916
So that's what that expression
equals for x equals two.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:15.395
Let's do another example.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:16.978
So now we are asked

00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:21.615
what is the value of y
squared minus x to the fourth

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.400
when y is equal to nine and x equals two?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.655
So once again, pause this video,

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:28.008
and see if you can evaluate that.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:29.508
All right, so here

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.878
we have variables as the bases,

00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:34.536
as opposed to being the exponents,

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:36.084
and we have two different variables.

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:38.064
But all we have to do
is wherever we see a y,

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.673
we substitute it with a nine.

00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:43.905
And wherever we see an x,
we substitute it with a two.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.162
So y squared is going
to be the same thing as

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:48.162
nine squared

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:50.684
minus,

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.274
minus

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:55.177
x, which is two.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.201
That minus looks a little
bit funny, let me see.

00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:00.930
So this is gonna be nine squared minus x,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.831
which is two,

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.664
two to the

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:06.117
fourth power.

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:09.007
Now what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.632
Well, nine squared is nine times nine.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:16.549
So this whole thing is
going to be equal to 81.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.568
This whole thing right over
here is nine times nine.

00:02:20.568 --> 00:02:23.196
Nine times nine is that right over there.

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:27.077
And then from that,
we're going to subtract

00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:28.991
two to the fourth power.

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:30.259
Well, what's two to the fourth power?

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:34.355
That is two times two,
times two, times two.

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:37.154
So this is going to be,
two times two is four,

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.092
four times two is eight,
eight times two is 16.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.759
So it's 81 minus 16.

00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:45.291
Now what is that going to be equal to?

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.791
Let's see, 81 minus six is 75,

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:52.737
and then minus another
10 is going to be 65.

00:02:52.737 --> 00:02:54.022
So there you have it,

00:02:54.022 --> 00:02:56.126
y squared minus x to the fourth,

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:59.746
when y is equal to nine and
x equals two, is equal to 65.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.833
And we're done.
