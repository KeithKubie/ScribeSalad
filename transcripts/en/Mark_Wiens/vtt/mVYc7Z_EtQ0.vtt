00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.601
- Hey everyone, it's Mark
Wiens in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.554
and today we're taking a
day trip to one of the most

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.339
famous floating markets in Thailand.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.741
It's called Amphawa floating market

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.939
and we're gonna go pick up Mike Chen.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.933
He's another amazing food guy.

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.065
He loves to eat and he's in
Thailand right now hanging out

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.279
and we're gonna give you
a full tour of Amphawa.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.408
How to get there, what to
do, and most importantly,

00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:24.486
some incredibly delicious food.

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.718
We're gonna eat a bunch of delicious food.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:28.506
So keep watching this
video, a full Amphawa

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.589
floating market tour guide coming up.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:38.665
- All right, met up with Mike.

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.808
We are driving on our way to Amphawa.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.462
It's located in a province
called Samut Songkhram

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.509
which is about an hour
and a half from Bangkok

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.861
but this is a really
popular floating market.

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:51.654
Especially a lot of Bangkok
people go there for the weekend

00:00:51.654 --> 00:00:55.955
to eat, to hang out, to
enjoy, so it's gonna be cool

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.455
to go there and eat with Mike.

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:01.933
- I'm excited, I mean I have
cold noodles that's on land,

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.760
now maybe I'll get some
actually on a boat.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.343
(upbeat music)

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:18.453
- All right, we just made it to Amphawa.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.809
This is one of the most
famous and one of the biggest

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:24.268
and probably one of the
busiest floating markets

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:25.208
in all of Thailand.

00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:26.798
This is an afternoon floating market

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:29.473
so it opens up about 2 or 3 p.m. is when

00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:33.177
it really gets started and
when a lot of people come here.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:35.229
And we are now just entering the main,

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.341
one of the main alleys.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:39.428
There's food clustered
on both sides of us.

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:41.440
All the snacks you can imagine.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.773
You can just come here and eat non-stop.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.078
There's a lot of food to choose from.

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.354
There's so many different things

00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:55.392
so we have decided to stop
for some fried fish cakes.

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:57.422
In Thai, they're called
(speaking foreign language).

00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.558
And then we also got, we're gonna order

00:01:59.558 --> 00:02:01.853
just some fried quail eggs.

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:02.760
- [Mike] They're so pretty.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.949
- [Mark] They are.

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:05.426
And it's just so pure
man, it's just an egg.

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:08.632
- There's some chili
seasoning she put on there.

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.229
I can't wait to have it.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.369
All right, so what do
you want to try first?

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.474
The fried fish cake?

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.403
- Yeah sure, let's try
the fried fish cakes.

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:16.236
- Let's do it.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.017
- And these are, it's a
combination of minced fish

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:22.184
with curry paste so it has
some curry flavor in it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.432
and these are fried whole basil leaves.

00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:27.640
All right.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.473
- Oh.

00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.222
- Oh, it's really juicy.

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.931
- That's three ohs, and
that means it's good.

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:41.764
Woah.

00:02:41.764 --> 00:02:43.615
- That is very tasty.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:46.158
- That's delicious, that's delicious.

00:02:46.158 --> 00:02:49.976
- [Mark] Airy, spongey, it's
packed, you can really taste

00:02:49.976 --> 00:02:53.588
the curry paste in there,
the red curry paste in there.

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:54.421
- It's got some kick to it.

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.246
Next up we got these little quail eggs,

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.488
which they caught my eye
because they're so pretty.

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:00.558
And they're sitting in this beautiful

00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:03.427
banana leaf bouquet and
they just kinda look like,

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:07.177
I don't know, little
sun flowery deliciousy--

00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:10.606
- Yeah, little one biter eggs.

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:14.176
Oh yeah.

00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:17.763
I love 'em.

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:19.242
- It tastes like fried eggs.

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:20.808
There's nothing--

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:22.780
- If you love fried eggs, there's no way

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.202
you won't love fried quail eggs.

00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:27.590
- [Mike] Yeah and it's fried
really well so the yolk

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.603
is not too runny, which I don't like.

00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:30.436
It's not too hard.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.318
- It's a little starchy.

00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:34.499
And then you can also taste, she added,

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.963
she sprinkled on some soy
sauce, like soy sauce.

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:39.142
And it's called maggi sauce.

00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:41.477
- [Mike] I feel like this
needs some chili, I don't know.

00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.529
- [Mark] Chili would be good.

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:45.883
Since we happen to be sitting at a table

00:03:45.883 --> 00:03:47.322
that has some chili
vinegar, we might as well

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.769
make use of our resources.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.749
- It's a little too sour for the egg but--

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:54.815
- That's a jolt of sourness.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:55.681
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.514
- That'll wake you up.

00:03:56.514 --> 00:03:58.097
- Maybe don't do that.

00:03:58.097 --> 00:04:01.017
But these fried fish cakes,
these are ridiculous.

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:01.878
- I really like both of them.

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:03.475
- Woah, woah, woah.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:04.334
Dare we?

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:06.346
- [Mark] Mike just had the brilliant idea

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.261
to combine the both snacks on one skewer.

00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:10.631
Did you get some basil in that bite, man?

00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:11.464
- [Mike] I'm gonna.

00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:12.520
- [Mark] Dude, dude--

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.797
- [Mike] I'm gonna get some basil.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:14.941
- [Mark] Fish in there,
man, fish in there.

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.774
Oh, there we go.

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:17.350
- [Mike] And I wanna dip
the egg in that sauce.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.544
- Cucumber on the tip?

00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:19.736
- Here's to innovation.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:21.569
- Oh yeah, cheers man.

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.676
- That's where it's at.

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:29.509
- That's a winner.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.025
I'm always a huge fan of
especially quail eggs.

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:36.415
Quail eggs are wonderful little
bite size of just pureness.

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:38.667
Can we try some of these?

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.984
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:46.849
This thing is called
(speaks foreign language0

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.262
and this is a snack that's not
all that common everywhere.

00:04:50.262 --> 00:04:53.762
And they're kinda like little curry puffs.

00:04:55.644 --> 00:04:57.160
- [Mike] They look like little dumplings.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.910
- Yeah, just little
perfect bite size snacks.

00:05:04.782 --> 00:05:06.734
- Why's the fish?

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:08.706
The fish is like jerky.

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:11.841
- Yep, I think it's dried fish.

00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:12.883
- [Mike] It's good.

00:05:12.883 --> 00:05:14.816
- It's kinda like a cross between

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.700
a dessert and a savory snack.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.053
It's like one of those
things that's kinda sweet

00:05:18.053 --> 00:05:21.085
but it's very oniony and
garlicy at the same time.

00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:22.114
- It's good, it's good.

00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:23.509
I don't know if I can eat
a whole bag full of those

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.029
but it's good.

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:26.878
- Me too, me too, it's okay.

00:05:26.878 --> 00:05:30.545
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.222
Yeah, we do need to definitely try this.

00:05:33.222 --> 00:05:35.892
Mike and I are stopping for the next snack

00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:38.942
and this is kind of a
Thai innovative snack

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:40.422
cause it has cheese on it.

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.889
So we've got scallops and
then it looks like she--

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.045
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:47.990
Cream cheese.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.847
- [Mike] Cream cheese.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:51.805
- Oh so there's cream cheese
and then there's fresh cheese.

00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:54.757
And then she grills them over the fire

00:05:54.757 --> 00:05:58.951
and then yeah, they're just
very very small scallops.

00:05:58.951 --> 00:06:01.505
This is more of a modern Thai snack,

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:03.551
a very modern Thai snack.

00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:04.384
And then she just said she's gonna

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.551
add on some seafood sauce.

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:13.891
She said we gotta eat it hot and fast

00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:17.382
so it's very hot in our
fingers, right off the grill.

00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:20.212
That cheese is all melty and oozy.

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.060
All right man, we just
gotta scrape it off.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.227
- Let's do it.

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:27.397
Oh.

00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:28.230
- Mmm.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.988
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:34.988 --> 00:06:37.747
- That's amazing, you are awesome.

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:39.997
- That is actually awesome.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.287
I got a little bit of
caramelized cheese on the shell.

00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:49.659
- That's my favorite, that's
my favorite right now.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.456
- We don't want any of
that to go to waste.

00:06:51.456 --> 00:06:53.513
- [Mike] One of the best
things I've had this week.

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.318
- [Mark] Wow, that's delicious.

00:06:55.318 --> 00:06:57.500
- Maybe it's because the
cheese is so gooey and good

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.632
and I'm partial to that but
that's scallops got some

00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:03.095
beautiful sweet flavor.

00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:05.352
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:09.064
So guys, remember Mr. Boy Scallops.

00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:10.247
Wow.

00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:12.497
- So yeah, Mr. Boy Scallop.

00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:17.121
This market is pretty packed, though.

00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:18.887
You will, when you come
here, you'll definitely

00:07:18.887 --> 00:07:21.437
be with a lot of people.

00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:24.033
It gets pretty sweaty in
some of these alleys as well

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:26.951
but you can smell all
the aromas of the food

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.701
and it's so worth it.

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:31.759
We've been snacking for awhile already

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.721
but we're only now making it
to the main canal, the Amphawa

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:39.405
canal and this is where the
floating market happens.

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:40.843
These are where the boats are.

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:42.767
So right along the
canal, within the water,

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:44.415
they have a number of different boats.

00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:46.268
Also, serving a variety
of different things.

00:07:46.268 --> 00:07:47.577
They have pad Thai, they
have different noodles,

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:50.416
they have different
seafood, just fresh seafood

00:07:50.416 --> 00:07:52.965
which is grilled and then they do have

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:55.471
sort of like, almost like stadium seating

00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:58.011
where you can, if you're
lucky, you can grab a seat.

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.362
It's kinda packed and
kinda tricky to get a seat

00:08:00.362 --> 00:08:02.944
but I think we'll be able to get a seat.

00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:05.527
(upbeat music)

00:08:10.353 --> 00:08:14.020
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.471
- We just got pretty much front row seats.

00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.701
It almost feels like
we're at a sports game.

00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:25.381
And these are bleachers and then they have

00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:27.691
all the boats serving
food but when Mike and I

00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.528
are ordering together, I think we got

00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:32.582
every seafood that is visible.

00:08:32.582 --> 00:08:37.013
We got the jumbo prawns,
we got squid, we got crab

00:08:37.013 --> 00:08:38.448
and we got a whole fish.

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:40.908
- Yeah, well, you don't want
any food regret, you know?

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:43.528
You wanna get everything you can.

00:08:43.528 --> 00:08:46.325
You'd rather get too much than too little.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.762
- You wanna get everything you see.

00:08:47.762 --> 00:08:49.565
- Yeah, otherwise you're like, man I wish

00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.416
I got that fish the other day.

00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:54.999
- Oh, I totally forgot
about the fish, man.

00:08:56.963 --> 00:08:57.845
- [Mike] This is bad.

00:08:57.845 --> 00:09:01.093
- We don't have any square
space of table left.

00:09:01.093 --> 00:09:03.144
- [Mike] This is an experience

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.977
that I needed to have in Thailand.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.732
- What do you wanna begin with?

00:09:08.732 --> 00:09:10.047
- I think we should do
the calamare because

00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:11.767
that's what the fly is attacking the most.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:12.600
- Oh yeah, all right.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.433
Let's do it.

00:09:13.433 --> 00:09:14.971
Man they grilled this squid up.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.654
You can see it on the boat,
just the big pieces of squid

00:09:16.654 --> 00:09:18.466
and what's cool about this piece of squid

00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:19.868
is that there's eggs in it.

00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:21.429
Can you see those squid eggs?

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.768
It's just stuffed with eggs.

00:09:23.768 --> 00:09:25.368
- [Mike] All right, so
dip it in the sauce.

00:09:25.368 --> 00:09:28.368
- All right, seafood sauce, dipping.

00:09:31.813 --> 00:09:32.646
Oh wow.

00:09:35.163 --> 00:09:36.757
- Oh my God, it's good.

00:09:36.757 --> 00:09:39.494
- [Mark] It's like a little
bit leathery in texture

00:09:39.494 --> 00:09:41.547
but it's not chewy and then the eggs

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:43.637
are almost like jellyish.

00:09:43.637 --> 00:09:46.376
- Yeah and they kinda
like give you that nice,

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:48.345
because usually when
you eat squid, it's like

00:09:48.345 --> 00:09:51.102
chewing all over the rubber
and all that's in your mouth.

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:52.407
That's the only texture you taste.

00:09:52.407 --> 00:09:54.624
But you got the nice beautiful soft eggs.

00:09:54.624 --> 00:09:56.145
Oh, that's glorious.

00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:58.852
How bout we get into
these big bad boys here?

00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:01.387
- Yeah, let's do this.

00:10:01.387 --> 00:10:03.730
These are river prawns here.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.832
Actually the heads are pretty big,

00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:08.004
but they are pretty decently sized.

00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:10.684
- [Mike] These are like river monsters.

00:10:10.684 --> 00:10:12.858
- I'm gonna break this guy
open, take off the head

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:15.906
and actually the best thing
about eating river prawns

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:16.970
is what's in the head.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.803
- [Mike] You gonna eat the head?

00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:20.141
- Oh yeah, but actually
you can almost break

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:23.097
off that head shell there.

00:10:23.097 --> 00:10:25.888
What I like to do is tear off
that outer shell and then just

00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:29.790
kinda suck up that head
butter juices, right in there.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.859
Look at that.

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.900
- I'm gonna take a lesson
from the master here.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.775
- Oh yeah man, that's the
good stuff right there.

00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:39.074
- Okay so what do we do, we
just put the sauce in there?

00:10:39.074 --> 00:10:40.262
- Just suck it.

00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:41.708
You can or you can just
taste the pureness of it.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:44.958
- Okay, I'll do, this is my first time.

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:50.186
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.895
- [Mike] It's almost very eggy.

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:55.292
- [Mark] It's shrimp pudding.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:58.959
It's a little bit bitter,
it's awfully good.

00:11:03.765 --> 00:11:04.598
Oh yeah.

00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:07.767
- Sweet succulent flesh, my friend.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:08.881
- Just so meaty.

00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.073
- [Mike] Let's jump on the crab.

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:11.776
What kind of crabs are these?

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:13.866
- [Mark] In Thai it's called
(speaks foreign language).

00:11:13.866 --> 00:11:15.261
- [Mike] It looks a
little like stone crab,

00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.505
at least the claws do, look
a little like stone crab.

00:11:17.505 --> 00:11:19.680
- This crab is one of my
favorite things from the sea.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.892
Look at the size of his claw, man.

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:22.725
- Yeah, it's awesome.

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:23.623
- It's pretty decently sized.

00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:25.697
- That's pretty.

00:11:25.697 --> 00:11:26.888
- [Mark] And they've cracked it already

00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:30.278
so should be semi-easy
for us to eat it all.

00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:32.285
Look at that drumstick.

00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:33.979
And you have to just
give this another dunking

00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:36.476
in the seafood sauce.

00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:40.643
Oh that works like a mitt to
scoop up some of that sauce.

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:48.428
- That's some sweet
crustacean right there.

00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:53.589
- All the like stringiness of the crab

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:55.684
while being silky at the same time.

00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:56.663
- That's fresh, that's fresh.

00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:59.366
You can tell that's fresh.

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:01.746
- [Mark] This is actually
just completely fantastic

00:12:01.746 --> 00:12:03.552
just sitting here eating
seafood with Mike,

00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:06.242
watching the boats, probably
such a relaxing to eat

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:08.706
'cause you can't really eat it too fast.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:10.184
- Well you know what it is.

00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:11.787
In China we have this saying called

00:12:11.787 --> 00:12:15.506
(speaks foreign language)
which means eating for fun.

00:12:15.506 --> 00:12:17.757
So the crab is one of those
foods that we consider,

00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:22.029
you don't eat it to get full,
you eat it to enjoy yourself.

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:24.745
Almost like as an entertainment.

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:28.912
- It's a good thing we decided
to get the two crab platter.

00:12:29.753 --> 00:12:30.989
- That is so sweet, man.

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:31.971
- It's really good.

00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:32.804
- So sweet.

00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:34.229
- And it's so meaty.

00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:36.075
So in Thai this is called pla pao.

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:39.321
And this is a, let me get a
look at his face real fast.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:43.603
It's a (speaks foreign language)
which is a barramundi fish.

00:12:43.603 --> 00:12:46.193
What they do is they salt
press it, they actually fill it

00:12:46.193 --> 00:12:48.533
with some herbs, there's
probably some lemongrass

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:52.700
and maybe some pandan leaves
within the cavity of the fish.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.949
And then they coat it in a
salt in a big layer of salt.

00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:59.795
And then they grill it on a fire.

00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:02.834
- [Mike] Look at this, look
how flaky the flesh is.

00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:06.165
Look how juicy that is, just falls apart.

00:13:06.165 --> 00:13:06.998
So tender.

00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:09.316
- [Mark] And then you gotta give this

00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:11.740
a nice bath in the chili sauce.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.490
- [Mike] Oh 100%, 100%.

00:13:19.688 --> 00:13:22.253
Well I feel like this does
really beat the shrimp.

00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.903
- [Mark] Yeah, it does.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.032
- And that adds so much to the fish,

00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:29.032
because there's so much more flavor.

00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:38.316
One of my favorite things in Thailand.

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:40.040
- I eat it a lot too.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.125
And also, not only is it good,

00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.640
but it's actually very very healthy.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.473
- Yeah.

00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:46.766
- It's just pure fish, there's no oil.

00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:51.377
There's no, it's just pure
fish so it's very healthy.

00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:52.727
- [Mike] There's no fishy flavor to it

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:53.837
whatsoever, whatsoever.

00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:54.951
It's so clean.

00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:57.540
- We also got a couple
plates of green papaya salad.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.490
This one is (speaks foreign language)

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.407
with crab and fermented fish sauce.

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.107
This was sort of just to change up

00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:08.287
the flavor of the seafood.

00:14:08.287 --> 00:14:10.499
- I mean you need something refreshing.

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:11.521
Well we gotta listen to our parents

00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:14.230
and get our veggies a little bit.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.549
- Yeah, that's pretty.

00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:18.095
We just finished with that seafood feast

00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:21.427
with the view of the boats
right from the boats.

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.017
The seafood was actually pretty good

00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:26.523
but the food is not gonna
be the best Thai food

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:28.537
that you have when you eat from a boat.

00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:31.203
You eat here mostly for the
atmosphere and the ambiance

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.340
and the novelty and the fun of it

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.471
which it definitely is very very fun.

00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:38.506
But the food is okay, it's okay.

00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:39.989
I think probably my
favorite thing was the crab.

00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:41.875
The crab was actually really really good,

00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:45.074
tasted quite fresh and
the meat was so sweet

00:14:45.074 --> 00:14:47.658
and natural and fantastic actually.

00:14:47.658 --> 00:14:50.241
(upbeat music)

00:15:00.244 --> 00:15:02.184
You can just grab chilis at your will.

00:15:02.184 --> 00:15:05.235
I cannot leave Thailand
without trying Miang kham.

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:07.370
- When I see people wrapping
something, I get excited.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.548
- And it's such a colorful variety

00:15:09.548 --> 00:15:12.097
of little tiny ingredients
that she chops up.

00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:13.416
There's a whole little wedge of lime,

00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:14.931
there's shallots in here, there's ginger,

00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:18.496
there's toasted coconut
and then she adds the,

00:15:18.496 --> 00:15:22.686
it's almost like a caramely
palm sugar dressing

00:15:22.686 --> 00:15:24.574
that she puts in here
to wrap it all together.

00:15:24.574 --> 00:15:26.785
- And I saw pieces of lime
in there, that's actual--

00:15:26.785 --> 00:15:29.579
- It's actually a wedge
of lime, no, no, no,

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:31.227
you eat the skin and all so you can expect

00:15:31.227 --> 00:15:34.514
like a jolt of sourness, citrusiness.

00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:35.828
- And we each got a pepper, what do we do?

00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:37.344
- We're gonna chase it with the chili.

00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:39.594
Let's eat one and chase it.

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.842
Wanna chase it with the chili?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.857
It's like vegetarian vegetable candy, man.

00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:54.690
- Woah.

00:15:56.402 --> 00:15:57.832
This is actually really remarkable.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.594
- [Mark] It's awesome.

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:02.314
- [Mike] It's fragrant,
it's sour, it's sweet,

00:16:02.314 --> 00:16:03.564
very flavorful.

00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:07.096
- And we need more chili, she has

00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:10.586
a whole bowl of chili over there.

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:11.814
- There you go.

00:16:11.814 --> 00:16:14.277
- Oh thanks man, red or green?

00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:15.444
I'll go green.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.333
It's refreshing too.

00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:25.166
- It's good stuff.

00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:27.576
- Yeah, that is sweet but
it's something you really

00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:28.970
have to try when you come to Thailand

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.610
because that mix of flavors,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.777
that's like Thailand in a single bite.

00:16:35.835 --> 00:16:38.292
(speaking foreign language)

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:39.891
You have a little thumb to ...

00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:41.906
Oh that's cute, that's cute.

00:16:41.906 --> 00:16:43.506
- I know this is not Thai food, Mark,

00:16:43.506 --> 00:16:45.229
but I saw this and I couldn't resist.

00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:47.691
It's got a little, look at
this, little thumb thing.

00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:50.231
- It's a little mitt of little
bite size ice cream cones.

00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:51.547
- One of my all time goals in life

00:16:51.547 --> 00:16:55.445
is to eat an ice cream cone in one bite.

00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:57.293
I'm just kidding, no one has
those goals like seriously.

00:16:57.293 --> 00:16:59.145
But this looks delicious.

00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:00.378
I'm gonna take a little green one.

00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:01.481
- Wait, what's your flavor?

00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:04.931
I'll go vanilla, maybe this is vanilla.

00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:07.155
Yeah look at this, little bite sized.

00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:08.220
- Oh, this is lime sorbet.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.053
- Okay.

00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:11.310
- Cheers to ice cream.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.482
- Cheers, man, one biters?

00:17:12.482 --> 00:17:13.315
- Yeah.

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:21.860
That was funner than I thought.

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:25.465
- It is pretty cool because you like smash

00:17:25.465 --> 00:17:28.595
the entire cone as you bite down.

00:17:28.595 --> 00:17:32.262
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:39.470
This is called (speaks foreign language)

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.688
which is a coconut milk custard.

00:17:41.688 --> 00:17:45.771
And then this one is more
of an egg yolk custard.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:47.897
That is very pretty.

00:17:47.897 --> 00:17:50.697
- [Mike] That's beautiful,
that is beautiful.

00:17:50.697 --> 00:17:53.560
- [Mark] So like the
traditional version of the snack

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.939
is served in little, almost
like bite size little

00:17:55.939 --> 00:17:59.792
cupcakes with banana
leaves so they've kind of

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:03.275
made this kind of trendy
kind of beautiful.

00:18:03.275 --> 00:18:05.700
And it's cool that you
get to keep the clay pot.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.319
- [Mike] That's what's really
awesome about this is that

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:12.486
look and this is something
you'll buy in the US at a store.

00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:16.721
What's the red stuff?

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:17.554
- [Mark] I have no idea.

00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:18.440
- [Mike] No one knows.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.666
- [Mark] Are you getting
some random pink stuff?

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:22.131
- [Mike] I'm getting the random pink.

00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.381
Under is green.

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:26.080
What is this green stuff?

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.947
- [Mark] There's the
tapioca on the bottom,

00:18:29.947 --> 00:18:31.373
tapioca and corn.

00:18:31.373 --> 00:18:33.919
- [Mike] Woah, look at
the tapioca bubbles.

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:36.054
- [Mark] You keep digging
further and you get new things.

00:18:36.054 --> 00:18:37.365
- [Mike] This is like an iceberg.

00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:40.644
Most of what you don't
see is on the bottom.

00:18:40.644 --> 00:18:42.077
- [Mark] Yeah look at the layers to that.

00:18:42.077 --> 00:18:43.744
- This is beautiful.

00:18:50.483 --> 00:18:51.547
I like it.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.049
I'll tell you what, I like it.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.882
- It is good.

00:18:54.882 --> 00:18:56.508
- I wasn't so sure in
the first couple bites

00:18:56.508 --> 00:18:58.485
when you're chewing it,
but you get the corn

00:18:58.485 --> 00:18:59.885
that's kinda salty.

00:18:59.885 --> 00:19:01.563
- [Mark] And they also add a lot of salt

00:19:01.563 --> 00:19:02.589
to the actual coconut
cause that brings out

00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:03.422
the flavor of the coconut.

00:19:03.422 --> 00:19:04.274
- Yeah, and I think this is something also

00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:06.941
that gets better as you chew it.

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:09.340
- [Mark] And there's also little pieces

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.916
within the bottom there,
there's corn and taro.

00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:13.142
- [Mike] Oh, I just saw the taro.

00:19:13.142 --> 00:19:14.829
- [Mark] Like little starchy
pieces of taro there.

00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:15.662
- [Mike] Oh that's crazy.

00:19:15.662 --> 00:19:16.556
- A lot of going on.

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:18.774
- There's tons of stuff going on here.

00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:22.173
I mean, I'm almost expecting
to find like a prawn down here.

00:19:22.173 --> 00:19:25.094
- [Mark] Oh man, that
would be a lucky bite.

00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:26.818
I would love that bite.

00:19:26.818 --> 00:19:29.244
- Little bit of a different
texture, little crunch.

00:19:29.244 --> 00:19:31.379
- I got a bunch of taro in that bite.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.212
- This is really good.

00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:42.030
- [Mark] We found some
horseshoe crab salad.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.302
In Thai it's called
(speaking foreign language).

00:19:46.302 --> 00:19:47.827
You can't really eat
the actual crab because

00:19:47.827 --> 00:19:51.994
it's rock hard shell, it's like
prehistoric looking creature

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.979
but what you eat are the
eggs from the backside

00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:58.534
and then they mix it with green mango.

00:19:58.534 --> 00:20:00.224
- [Mike] I see these on
beaches all the time.

00:20:00.224 --> 00:20:03.433
Like all the time and
okay so they're not edible

00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:04.709
in terms of their own flesh.

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:07.345
- [Mark] Grab one of those
nuggets on the side there.

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:09.112
- [Mike] I'm trying to actually avoid,

00:20:09.112 --> 00:20:12.195
like can I get just a little sampler?

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.313
Dinosaur, think dinosaur.

00:20:20.613 --> 00:20:21.691
- I love it.

00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:24.441
- I have no idea what I just ate.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.012
- They're almost like highly
concentrated egg yolks.

00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:31.271
- It's just like beans to me.

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:34.101
- Like they're really
condensed, really like,

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:36.768
almost chalky and kind of yolky.

00:20:37.745 --> 00:20:38.578
- [Mike[ It's not my favorite.

00:20:38.578 --> 00:20:41.172
I think I'm stopping at one.

00:20:41.172 --> 00:20:43.011
- [Mark] Oh man, I really love it.

00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:45.017
- [Mike] I was really
hoping to eat the crab meat.

00:20:45.017 --> 00:20:46.568
I mean I was hoping like
you'd crack this open

00:20:46.568 --> 00:20:48.446
and there's some like untold sweet

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:50.614
succulent tender crab
meat I didn't know existed

00:20:50.614 --> 00:20:54.781
and I just discovered like
a new wonderful crab but.

00:21:06.304 --> 00:21:08.288
- We have been eating all afternoon

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:10.348
and that was a lot of fun.

00:21:10.348 --> 00:21:11.992
What did you think about
the floating market, Mike?

00:21:11.992 --> 00:21:13.557
- Well, I loved the food first of all.

00:21:13.557 --> 00:21:14.908
And actually just be able to see it

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:16.274
because I never saw it before.

00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:18.246
I heard concepts of
it, I've seen pictures,

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:20.916
never seen it in person and
it was great experience,

00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:22.356
so thank you so much
for showing me around.

00:21:22.356 --> 00:21:25.389
- Big thank you to Mike
for hanging out and eating.
