00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.458
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.900
Good evening, and welcome to
the College of Science lecture

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.229
series.

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:26.520
You thought that it couldn't
get any better after Chris

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.480
Impey gave his
lecture last Tuesday,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.763
but you're in for a treat today.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.500
[CHEERING]

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.780
I want to thank the
underwriters of this lecture

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.710
series, the reason why you don't
have to pay $5 at the entrance.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.400
It is my pleasure today to
introduce Michael Turner,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.664
the speaker for today.

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:46.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.620
That's right.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.530
Michael Turner is a theoretical
astrophysics and director

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.380
of the Kavli Institute
for Cosmological Physics

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.330
at the University of Chicago.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.550
As an aside, I'd
like to remind you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.910
that this year, one of the
prize winners for the Kavli

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.160
Prize, which is a
sort of a Nobel Prize,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.890
was our own Roger Angel from
the astronomy department.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.636
But let's continue here.

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.170
Michael received his
Bachelor of Science

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.130
from Caltech, his masters of
science and PhD from Stanford.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880
He has helped pioneer the
interdisciplinary field

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.060
of particle astrophysics
and cosmology.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.050
Right.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.050
His scholarly
contributions include

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.200
predicting cosmic acceleration
and coining the term dark

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.530
energy, showing how quantum
fluctuations evolved

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
into the seat
perturbations for galaxies

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.500
during cosmic inflation,
and several key ideas that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.570
led to the cold dark matter
theory of structure formation.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.240
His honors include the
Warner Prize of the American

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840
Astronomical Society,
the Lilienfeld Prize

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.120
of the American
Physical Society,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.170
the Klopsteg Award for
the American Association

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.410
of Physic teachers, the
Heineman prize of the American

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.950
Astronomical Society and the
American Institute of Physics,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.720
and the 2011 Darwin Lecture of
the Royal Astronomical Society.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.060
He is currently chairman
of the board of the Aspen

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.520
Center for Physics and a
member of the governing

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.100
board of the National
Academy of Sciences.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.570
In 2013, Dr. Turner will serve
as a president of the American

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.630
Physical Society.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.880
How he ever made time
to be with us tonight

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.020
is one of the true great
mysteries of the universe.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.640
Please welcome our special guest
tonight, Dr. Michael Turner.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.431
Thank you very much

00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.500
It's a great pleasure
to be here tonight--

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.700
OK, there's my version--

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.880
--To talk about these big
mysteries of cosmology.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.370
And I understand that I was
given homework assignments

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.340
by both Chris Impey
and by Father Guy.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.580
Now, I'm not so
worried about Chris,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.380
because I think I can
hold my own with him.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.710
But when you've got
a Jesuit priest who's

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.262
closely associated
with the Vatican,

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:06.220
you have to be careful.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.320
So I'm hoping that--
I mean, I'm not

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.600
going to proceed
unless you all agree

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.790
to tell Father Guy that I
answered all the questions

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.182
that I was supposed to.

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.810
So let's see.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.130
Oh, there's the arrow.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.960
So I think the
reason that we have

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.410
so many people here is that
you all appreciate that we are

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.420
in a revolutionary period of
discovery about the universe

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.010
and our place in it.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.410
It's extraordinarily exciting.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.290
And I like to think
that it's powered

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.730
by powerful instruments.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.400
Now, you in Arizona
know a lot about making

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.840
instruments and mirrors.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.810
And I had the pleasure
of being there

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.440
when Roger Angel
received the Kavli Prize.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.852
By bold ideas.

00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:54.580
So I'm going to talk about
instruments, bold ideas.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.180
And what makes it most
exciting for scientists

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.640
are really big mysteries.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.020
Because science is
more fun when you're

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.890
trying to solve a puzzle.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.420
And so I'm going to be talking
about all three of these things

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.940
tonight.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.440
The powerful instruments, the
bold ideas, and the mysteries.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.649
Now, I'm just going to
back up a little bit.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.690
Well, I'm not going to
ask if everybody was here

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.394
for the other two
lectures, or if you

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.810
remember everything
that was said,

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.160
but I'll back up a little bit.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.230
Just to remind you of
what you've heard before,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.620
to put everything in context.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.160
The universe is very,
very big, and it's often

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.460
beyond the grasp of our
minds and our instruments.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.510
And so most of modern
cosmology doesn't even

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.280
date back 100 years.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.320
And so you heard about Hubble.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.420
And Hubble was the
one who pointed out

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.660
that the universe doesn't have
just one galaxy, but billions

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.900
of galaxies by
resolving the stars

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.910
in the nebulae on the sky.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.120
And he also discovered that
the universe is expanding.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.290
And probably Chris
and Father Guy

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.510
neglected to tell you that
Hubble got all of his degrees

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.992
at the University of Chicago.

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:11.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.550
And I am required
to tell you that.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.410
And I'll show you
Hubble's data here.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.260
Some people think
that Hubble is famous

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.750
because here was
a bunch of coffee

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.150
stains on a piece
of graph paper,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.776
and he was able to draw a
straight line through it.

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:28.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.660
But Hubble was a
great scientist.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.350
And Einstein played an
important role in this

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.840
because without Einstein's
Theory of Gravity,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.240
we wouldn't have the proper
interpretation for what's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.440
going on.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.060
It's not that galaxies are
actually moving away from us,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.430
it's that the
universe is expanding.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.390
So Einstein taught us that time
warps and space is flexible.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.670
And the best example
of space being flexible

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.560
is the expansion
of the universe.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.170
And so the galaxies are
just moving away from us

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.150
due to the expansion
of the universe.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.790
And so I have a little
simulation here to show you.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.330
I got a bunch of
galaxies on a slide here,

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.520
and through the
miracle of PowerPoint,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.860
I just blew up the space.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.290
And so the galaxies
are then further apart,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.850
and I did it again.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.770
And then let's look
at what this looks

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.020
like from the point of
view of our galaxy, which

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.100
is at the center of the
universe, of course.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.040
And so it looks to us
like other galaxies

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.940
are moving away from us.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.960
And the ones that
are farthest from us,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.230
cover more distance in a
certain amount of time, which

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.790
means they're moving faster.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.440
So it explains Hubble's law.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.180
And I'm sure both
Chris and Father

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.992
Guy explained that
actually, we are

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:43.950
at the center of the
universe, but everybody is

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.460
at the center of the universe.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.930
So if we picked any other
galaxy, say that one,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.360
and just looked at what it saw,
it sees exactly the same thing.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.490
So this expansion of space,
everybody sees the universe.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.280
Everybody sees all the other
galaxies moving away from it

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.740
and thinks that it's at
the center of the universe.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.710
And actually, that's
a Harvard phenomenon,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.362
but it really does
work in the universe.

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:11.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.170
And so this expansion
of space, the universe

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.760
is just scaling up.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.240
And then the discovery of the
cosmic microwave background

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.400
by Penzias and Wilson
in 1964 told us-- well,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.440
I should have said that the
implications of Hubble's

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.740
discovery was, in the beginning,
the universe was small,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.430
and it got bigger and evolved.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.510
And so there was a big bang.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.330
Penzias and Wilson
discovered that there

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.650
are billions of
microwave photons filling

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.250
the universe for every atom
and that this is the heat

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.140
leftover from the Big Bang.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.930
And that the Big Bang
was a hot Big Bang.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.610
And that changes everything,
because in the beginning,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.339
it was really hot.

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:58.130
And I'm going to use
a technical term here.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.874
It was hotter than hell.

00:07:59.874 --> 00:08:01.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:04.140
I think I'm allowed to do that
because Father Guy probably

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.594
said the same thing.

00:08:05.594 --> 00:08:06.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.210
And you know, when
you heat something up,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.120
you reduce it to
its basic elements.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.160
And so that means that
in the beginning--

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.730
--The universe was
a primordial soup.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:23.100
So this is 1964, Penzias
and Wilson, hot Big Bang.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.140
And so what is
primordial soup made of?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.680
And so in the 1970s,
we figured out

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.480
what the basic pieces, what the
basic building blocks of matter

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.260
are.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.360
And those are called quarks.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.059
And that was done
with experiments

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.530
at this linear accelerator
in Chicago, Illinois.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.310
The two-mile long
Stanford Linear-- or I

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.690
guess it's in California.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.160
Well, you know why Chicago
is called the Windy City,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.370
don't you?

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.556
It has nothing to
do with weather.

00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:58.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.960
So it was experiments done at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.650
that showed the following,
that-- so everybody knows

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.490
about atoms.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.310
And they have a nucleus made
of neutrons and protons.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.460
And these experiments showed
that the neutrons and protons

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.730
were made of smaller
entities called quarks.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.440
And so by knowing that and
combining that with the fact

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.860
that the universe was
hot in the beginning,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.100
we can figure out what
that primordial soup was.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.240
So I'm going to show
you a full-scale model

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.400
of the entire universe
that we can see today,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.402
what it would have looked
like at the beginning.

00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:39.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.410
And this is done to scale.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.930
I didn't say it's
the entire universe.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.000
It's everything
we can see, which

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.980
is 100-- I think Chris
Impey told you-- there's

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.640
100 billion galaxies all
fit in this soup can.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.000
And they were reduced to
their core constituents.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.520
OK.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.990
So this is what we know.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.410
We can now reconstruct the
history of the universe

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.260
from quark soup to us.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.240
And this reconstruction took
about 13.7 billion years,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.340
so I'm not just going
to step you through it.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.030
I'll speed it up
just a little bit.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.960
So when the universe was younger
than one 100,000th of a second,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.490
it was this quark soup.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.870
And as we follow it through,
it's expanding, it's cooling,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.230
layer upon layer of
structure is building up.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.090
And so when it was about one
100,000th of a second old,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.070
it was cool enough for
neutrons and protons to form.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.550
Now, I know all of you
took science classes,

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.260
and you all know
that protons are blue

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.810
and neutrons are green.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.090
And as it cooled, it became
cool enough for the neutrons

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.334
and protons to come together and
make the nuclei of the lightest

00:10:55.334 --> 00:10:57.000
elements in the
periodic table, and that

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.520
happened when the universe
was a few seconds old.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.200
When the universe was
a few seconds old,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.420
it was a nuclear reactor.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.450
And that nuclear reactor
made a lot of helium.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.390
It made a little
bit of deuterium.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.780
It made some helium three, so
that's a light form of helium,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.990
and it made a tiny
amount of lithium.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.020
The rest of the elements
in the periodic table

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.610
were made in stars.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.950
And I believe it's next week
that Phil Pinto is going

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.070
to tell you about how stars made
the rest of the periodic table.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:32.490
Now, I know that intelligent
design is a hot issue.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.874
And I want to use
you as a focus group

00:11:35.874 --> 00:11:37.290
here and give you
my best argument

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.390
against intelligent design.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.490
My best argument against
intelligent design

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.480
was the tiny amount of lithium
that was made in the Big Bang.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.550
If it was really
intelligent design,

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.050
the creator would
have known that we

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.341
needed much more lithium to
deal with our mental health

00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:53.401
problems.

00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:54.754
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:54.754 --> 00:11:56.107
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:57.340
OK.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.576
Well, the focus group
likes that argument.

00:11:59.576 --> 00:12:00.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.720
OK.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.610
So we now have nuclei.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.770
Universe is cooling
and expanding.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.040
And when it's about
400,000 years old,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.490
it's cool enough for the
nuclei to capture electrons.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.280
And now we have atoms.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.150
And once the atoms form-- this
is a very interesting time

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.840
that we'll come back
to-- once the atoms form,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.660
the light in the universe,
the radiation in the universe,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.380
travels long distances.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.836
And so this is the farthest
point that we can see back to.

00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:31.210
And I'll come back
to that again,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.160
and I bet Chris
talked about that.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.530
And then gravity took over.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.970
Gravity is the master builder.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.740
We'll talk more about that.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.490
And stars, and galaxies, and
so on and so forth were made.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.060
And so we can reconstruct
the history of the universe

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.580
from this early
time until today.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.400
And along the way,
we have tests.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.450
So this is not
just a nice story.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.350
This is a story that's
supported by scientific fact.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.650
So we predict how much
helium, deuterium, lithium,

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.930
and helium three
is made back there,

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.319
and ask if the most primitive
samples of universe-- that

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:11.860
is, samples of the universe that
haven't been through stars--

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.300
have that amount.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
And so we can test this theory
all the way back to about 10

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.490
to the minus five seconds.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.260
OK.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.570
So let me talk about some of
the measurements that we make

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.090
with the instruments
that we have today

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:33.520
that explore this vast universe,
vast both in space and in time.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.070
So the universe, the part
of the universe, we can see,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.650
is about 13 billion
light years across,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.020
and the universe is about
13 billion years old.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.480
These are numbers that are very
hard to get your head around.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.980
But we now have
instruments that can

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.710
take us all the way to the
edge of the visible universe

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.565
and back in time.

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.487
So let me show you some
of those instruments.

00:13:53.487 --> 00:13:55.570
Now, this slide I probably
don't need to show you.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.450
And probably, I'm in a little
bit of trouble for showing you,

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.540
because I think you all know
about big optical telescopes.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.324
And unfortunately, I don't have
any Arizona telescopes here.

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:07.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.006
OK.

00:14:12.006 --> 00:14:13.380
Well, actually,
let me talk about

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.030
these European
telescopes, because I

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.500
can tell another joke here so--

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.500
The Europeans have their
telescopes in Chile.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.980
These are four 8.2
meter telescopes.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.100
You need a special camera
to be able to photograph

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.780
all of these telescopes
when standing

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.310
on top of the mountain.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.100
And they had a recent
distinguished visitor

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.470
who visited Paranal, is
their observatory in Chile.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.070
I visited it.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.260
It's a really spectacular place.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.740
And this visitor
said, you know, this

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.310
is the way God would have
done it if he had the money.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.640
So this is really--
well, in Chicago,

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.420
we use Thorstein
Veblen, who just called

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.972
this conspicuous consumption.

00:14:58.972 --> 00:14:59.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.740
And this is the
Gemini telescope,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.440
and-- oh, actually, these
are Roger Angel mirrors.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.290
These are the Magellan
telescopes in Chile.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.330
So these are Roger
Angel mirrors.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.460
And then the two
biggest telescopes

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.320
in the world, the
Keck telescopes.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.140
And of course, we have
telescopes in space.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.660
We have our first space
telescope, the Hubble,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.007
but we also have the Chandra.

00:15:21.007 --> 00:15:23.340
Oh, let's see, Chandra was
at the University of Chicago.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.200
Hubble was at the
University of Chicago.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.440
And then we have the Fermi
Gamma Ray Observatory.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.600
Oh, Fermi was at the
University of Chicago.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.949
And then we have the Spitzer.

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:35.364
Well, Spitzer must have been
at the University of Chicago.

00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:36.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.061
Well, he never taught there, but
he did go through O'Hare once.

00:15:39.061 --> 00:15:41.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.290
And then I think all
of you are aware,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.570
everybody here in
the audience probably

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.480
has a digital camera in
their pocket or their purse.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.730
And these cameras that use
charged-coupled devices

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.050
are extraordinary
for two reasons.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.100
Number one, the old photographic
plates that Hubble used only

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.730
collected about 1% of the light.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:09.160
These CCD's collect
almost 100% of the light.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.920
And you can digitize
the picture.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.790
You can distort it.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.950
You can make it look
like anything you want.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.100
You can put it on the web.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.560
Actually, you can do really
good scientific stuff with it.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.000
And the cameras that we have
now, 100 megapixel are common,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.880
and the biggest ones
are a billion pixels.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.430
And this has changed
the way astronomy

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.380
is done for the better.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.740
So I want to show you the
most famous picture in all

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.680
of astronomy, and I also
want to congratulate you

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.810
on your good taste.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.670
So this is called the
Hubble Deep Field,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.710
or the Hubble point and shoot.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.480
How many people have seen this?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.030
I should ask, how many
people haven't seen this?

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:53.000
So this image of the
universe cost you $2 billion.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.350
And it was worth every penny.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:57.970
It was a bargain.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.400
So this answers the
age-old question,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.980
how far can you
see on a clear day?

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.130
So this is as far
as you can see,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.460
and the reason that you can't
see any farther than this

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.460
is you're looking
out so far in space

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.960
that you're looking
back to the time

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.510
when galaxies were being born.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.579
And if you looked out
any farther in space,

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.190
there weren't galaxies to see.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.210
So this truly answers, how far
can you see on a clear day.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.540
Just let me wax poetic a
little more about this.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.120
This is about 1/10
millionth of the sky.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.280
A tiny, tiny little
bit of the sky.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.120
It's such a small part of the
sky that there's only one star.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.000
Or let's see, is there two?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.020
Depends how you crop it.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.530
There's one.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.850
I think there's only one.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.140
The rest of the images in this,
all these other little funny

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.032
looking images, are galaxies.

00:17:50.032 --> 00:17:51.740
There are several
thousand galaxies here.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.830
If you multiply
that by 10 million,

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.290
you get the 100 billion number.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.810
100 billion galaxies
in the universe.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.830
And you'll notice that some
of these galaxies look funny,

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.800
and it's not that you
bought a crummy telescope.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.430
It's that you're looking back
to galaxies being formed,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.910
and so they don't look
like galaxies today.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.260
So this is what the Hubble did.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.390
This is one of
the-- you know, I'm

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.600
going to ask you to look at this
kind of like a Monet painting.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.840
So don't get scared
away by the graphs here.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.190
We can now construct-- we
live in an evolving universe.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.700
There weren't always stars, and
there won't always be stars.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.070
And so what we've been
able to reconstruct

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.740
is the star formation
history of the universe.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.260
So this is time.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.530
And don't worry about
these funny numbers here.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.650
So this is the Big Bang
back here, and this is now.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.390
So time moves from-- so think of
this as an Old Testament Bible.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.760
You have to read it
from right to left.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.310
And this is the rate at
which stars were forming.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.590
So start out really slow.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.330
And stars were really forming
a lot when the universe was

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.650
a couple billion years old.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.870
This is the time up here.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:12.990
And today, there's
hardly any stars forming.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.070
We're just about
done forming stars.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.490
And so this is the
star formation history

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.350
of the universe.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.170
And then the Hubble diagram.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.500
So we all laugh
at Hubble's data,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.720
but he was the one
who showed us that we

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.410
live in an evolving universe.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.770
So this is the best Hubble
diagram that we have.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.640
And so, this again,
is the velocity

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.979
of galaxies moving away from
us versus their distance.

00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:44.770
And now it actually
looks like these points

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.840
lie on a straight line.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.970
And let me show
you Hubble's data.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.290
So all of Hubble's data would
fit in this tiny little part

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.110
of the graph.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.150
And here is the data
that he would have added.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.160
And you know, his
data wasn't so good,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.200
and I won't tell you
what value he got.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.540
The correct value is about 70.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.450
The value Hubble got was 550.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.490
So this expansion
rate of the universe

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.010
is extremely important,
because the expansion rate

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.880
of the universe tells us how
long back to the Big Bang,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.650
among other things, and
how big the universe is.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.480
This also tells
us that girls are

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.040
better astronomers than boys.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.581
And this is why we tried to
keep them out of astronomy.

00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:33.545
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.348
We're not stupid.

00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:38.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.440
So the team that measured
the Hubble constant

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.836
was led by Wendy Freedman.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.540
Now, let's talk about how far
you can see with microwaves.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.290
And so this is the cosmic
microwave background,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.550
and this was a very
important discovery in 1992.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.710
NASA sent up a satellite
called, its friends

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.430
called it COBE, cosmic
background explorer,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.130
to carefully measure the
radiation from the microwave

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.120
background.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.230
And for the technical
buffs here, it

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.930
measured the spectrum of
the microwave background

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.050
and found it to be almost
a perfect black body

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:21.540
with a temperature
of 2.7255 5 kelvin.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.400
But what I really wanted
to talk about here

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.400
is this is how the intensity
of the microwave background

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.570
varies across the sky.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.510
So this is the
whole sky projected

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.360
on a piece of graph paper,
like when you went to school,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.610
they projected the whole
Earth on an ellipse.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.450
So that's the whole sky.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.170
And this is one of
these color diagrams.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.556
And so you might say, well,
this is really boring.

00:21:43.556 --> 00:21:45.930
Well, it is boring because
the intensity of the microwave

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.990
background is essentially
the same in all directions.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.220
If you look at it
very, very carefully,

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.450
it's slightly more intense
or hotter in one direction.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.020
This is towards the
constellation Leo.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.620
Yeah, I wish I could
stop that, but I

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.885
don't know how to stop that.

00:22:04.885 --> 00:22:05.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.160
And it's cooler in
the other direction.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.250
This is called the
giant dipole in the sky.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.960
Two poles, one
here and one there.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.910
And it tells us that with
respect to the cosmic rest

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.530
frame of the
universe, we're moving

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.250
at 620 kilometers per second.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.650
And that's interesting.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.450
But what was most
interesting, and what

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:33.020
resulted in the Nobel Prize
for Mather and Smoot was this.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.300
So if you take away
the dipole, there

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.780
are tiny fluctuations
in the intensity,

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.990
about a part in a 100,000--
or if you want it in kelvin,

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.340
about 18 micro kelvin-- that
were discovered by COBE.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.420
And I'm going to tell you
how important they are.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.630
This is not the belt
of the universe.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.800
So this is microwave
emission from our own galaxy.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.570
So you want to ignore that.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.500
That's not important.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.380
But it's these spots here
that are very, very important,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.760
that we're worth a Nobel Prize.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.130
And so let me explain why
they were worth a-- oh.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.960
First of all, testimonials.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.940
So Stephen Hawking, when this
announcement was made in 1992,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.740
said, "Greatest
discovery of all time."

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.890
Now, you know, the Brits are
not known for their reserve.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.950
They're way over exuberant,
and this may only

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.480
be a slightly overstatement.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.400
So a California boy was a
little more reserved in his--

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.860
"This was a very big discovery."

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.110
And the reason it was
a very big discovery

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.890
is that this was the
evidence for the lumpiness

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.500
in the distribution of
matter in the universe

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.930
that seeded all the
structure that we see today.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.060
And by structure, I mean
galaxies, and clusters

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.730
of galaxies, and stars, and us.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.540
So that's a really big deal.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.440
So let me come back and blow up
part of that earlier diagram.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.720
So here we are.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.930
We look out in space.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.780
We look back in time.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.950
And let's see, so here are
some of those galaxies that

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.880
were seen by the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.470
So we go back to
when the universe was

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.800
about a billion years old, and
then we can't see anything.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.710
As I told you before, that
the so-called dark ages,

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.600
where nothing was lit up.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.800
And the photons that come from
the greatest distance to us

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.530
come from this time
when the universe

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.980
went from being nuclei
and electrons-- we

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.030
call that ionized matter--
to be two atoms forming.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.720
And why that works, for
the technical people here,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.440
is ionized matter is
very opaque to radiation.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.960
And in fact, Joaquin, did
we get that waiver thing

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.750
so that we could turn
the room into a plasma

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.655
and then people wouldn't
be able to see me?

00:24:42.655 --> 00:24:43.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.488
We didn't get-- we
didn't get that.

00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:45.210
OK.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:45.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.289
Sorry.

00:24:46.289 --> 00:24:47.566
We can't do my demonstration.

00:24:47.566 --> 00:24:48.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.350
And so these microwave
photons go all the way back

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:59.350
to this time before stars when
the universe was almost uniform

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:05.410
mush with small variations in
the density of the universe.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:11.200
So some regions were about 0.01%
more dense and other regions

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.520
were less dense.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.510
And then gravity took
the more dense regions

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.510
and pulled in more material.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.760
And then their
gravity got stronger,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.920
and then more material fell in.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.220
And so during the
next 13 billion years

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.700
or so, galaxies and other
structures built up.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.080
And this model of how
structure formed by gravity

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.530
is, I think, a University of
Chicago Economics Department

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.340
model.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.760
So if you think about it,
where there was more matter,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.450
those regions got
even more matter.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.700
So the rich get richer.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.034
And where there's
less matter, you know,

00:25:49.034 --> 00:25:51.200
they lose their matter to
where there's more matter.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.110
So the poor get poorer.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.974
So this was a model
built by University

00:25:54.974 --> 00:25:55.890
of Chicago economists.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:01.300
But kidding aside, the
small variations that we're

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.200
seen in the COBE map-- so
these blue regions have

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.510
slightly more matter
and the red regions

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.280
have slightly less matter.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.180
And so this is a region
that will eventually

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.580
have-- well, actually, a
structure bigger than a galaxy.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.030
But this lumpiness is what
seeded all the structure

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.620
in the universe.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.250
OK.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.340
Well, this was so important that
a whole series of experiments

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.000
followed this up because
the COBE map-- coming back

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.700
to it here-- the reason that
the spots have this size

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.810
is that's all the resolution
that the COBE microwave

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.280
telescope had.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.940
And it wasn't that the
scientists and the government

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.780
didn't do a good
job building this,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.720
it's that that's
all the resolution

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.980
that they could afford.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.650
And so a series of
experiments followed this up

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.080
because you're seeing the
universe at an extraordinarily

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.160
simple time.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.180
And you know, science is
a fantastic adventure,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.890
adventure with a purpose.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.790
So the experiments
that followed this up,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.830
one was a balloon
that circumnavigated

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.230
Antarctica called Boomerang.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.480
Another one, this is the
Daisy experiment and Akbar

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.990
experiment, two experiments
at the South pole.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.840
And this is an experiment in
the Atacama Desert in Chile.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.660
And the ultimate experiment,
the best experiment

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.910
that we've done so
far at mapping out

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.940
this picture of the
infinite universe,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.560
is done by an experiment
called The Microwave Anisotropy

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.550
Probe, that was the brainchild
of David Wilkinson, a Princeton

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.999
professor.

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:42.290
Well, he came up with this
idea when he was at Chicago.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.750
And it was launched
here on 2001,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.360
and produced the
prettiest map that we have

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.610
of the microwave background.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.100
And it looks like this.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.280
And this is how you can tell
if you're a cosmologist.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.080
If you're a
cosmologist, this makes

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.838
your heart go pitter patter.

00:28:01.838 --> 00:28:03.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.930
Most people think that this
map just looks like noise, just

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.760
like random noise.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.730
And Stephen Hawking gets
very excited about this map,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.260
because actually this
map is just random noise.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.400
But look at that.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.220
S H.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:19.896
Stephen Hawking.

00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:21.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.140
And so what we're seeing-- let
me just wax poetic about this.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.090
What we are seeing
is the distribution

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.480
in the matter, this distribution
of matter in the universe, when

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.720
it was 380,000 years old.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.610
Not 380,000 years ago, but
when it was 380,000 years old.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.010
Before galaxies, before stars.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.060
And you know, when you do one
of these false color maps,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.650
it looks like, well, anybody
could have done this.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.330
Look how big the contrast is.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.100
We've got red, yellow, purple.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.320
The variations in the
intensity of the microwave

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:02.070
background that were measured
by these experiments are 0.001%.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:07.460
Does anybody know a good example
of what point a 0.001% is?

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.860
That's the difference between
the vote for Bush and Gore

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.140
in Florida in the year 2000.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:21.228
And if you do some fancy
mathematics to this,

00:29:21.228 --> 00:29:23.410
this is fancy
mathematics that you do.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.770
And I don't want to spend
much time about doing this.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:30.540
All of a sudden out of what
looks like noise, a signal

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.920
pops out.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.830
And we call these
acoustic oscillations.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.630
And the theory that I'm going to
tell you about predicted them.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.050
And from measuring
how high this one is,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.600
and how low that one
is with respect to it,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.640
and so on and so forth,
we can learn things

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.020
about the universe.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.010
Oh, and what I wanted to show
you is that for those of you

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.770
who knows multiple poles--
so this is basically

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.150
angular size on the sky.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.710
This goes out to
about 2,000 here,

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.500
and it's been measured
to almost 3,000.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.750
So you see lots and
lots of these bumps.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.830
And it tells you about the
universe at a simpler time.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.110
So let me summarize what
we know and then come

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.090
to these big mysteries.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.860
So what do we know?

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.140
What do we have
evidence to support?

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.650
So we have evidence to support
the history from lumpy quark

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.040
soup, to nuclei, to
atoms, to galaxies,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.890
and to even bigger structures
like clusters of galaxies.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.350
I'll show you those in a second.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.250
We know that the
universe is uncurved.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.240
Let me talk about that.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.720
I bet somebody-- I bet Chris or
Father Guy talked about that.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.340
So Einstein told us that there
are three shapes for space.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.520
And if we imagine a
two-dimensional universe rather

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.350
than our three-dimensional
universe,

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.020
we can picture these better.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.070
So the universe can
curve back on itself.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.250
That's a high-density universe,
one with lots of matter.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.380
It causes space to
curve back on itself.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.529
the universe can spring
out like a saddle.

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:01.820
Well, isn't this horse country?

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.210
You know about saddles.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:03.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.420
So that's the
low-density universe.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.310
Or it can just be uncurved.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.050
And what we found is that we
are the uncurved universe.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.760
So we're the flat universe.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.890
And then I'm going to be
talking more about this.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.180
The universe is
not only expanding,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.860
but the expansion
is speeding up.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.865
And the universe is made
of atoms, dark matter.

00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:25.490
So I'll tell you more
about dark matter

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.350
in a second, and dark energy.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.300
And I'll tell you a
lot more about that.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:33.410
And we have evidence for
what caused the Big Bang,

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.940
a process called inflation.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.380
And we can precisely
measure things,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.960
from the microwave background
and other measurements,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.240
that the amount of
matter in the universe

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.640
is 27 plus or minus
1.4% of-- we're

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.115
the uncurved universe that
has a certain density called

00:31:51.115 --> 00:31:53.170
the critical density.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.540
So that's 27% of the critical
density is in matter.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.490
Atoms, the kind of stuff that
the chemists try to peddle you,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.650
is 4.6%.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.890
The difference between these
two numbers is very important,

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.800
and cosmologists didn't used
to be able to discriminate

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.070
between 27 and 4.6.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.990
But now we can.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.840
And then there's a
ton of dark energy.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.760
And then we measure
the age and-- oh, I

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.260
see a mistake in this slide.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.430
13.75 billion years,
plus or minus 0.11.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.530
The mistake is that
this is a slide when

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.440
I gave the talk two weeks ago,
but I have to add in two weeks

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.680
to this.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.920
Well, actually, we don't
quite measure things

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.480
that accurately yet.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.750
But the term
precision cosmology,

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.740
if you went to your dictionary
and looked at oxymoron,

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.230
the first example was
precision cosmology.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.570
But we're now able to measure
things very, very precisely.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.415
And I want to talk
about making-- oh,

00:32:53.415 --> 00:32:56.340
and I talked about the
expansion rate of the universe.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.550
And I'm going to talk
a lot about the matter.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.650
Oh, here we have a picture.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:06.020
So here's the dark energy
that's most of the universe.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.780
Here is the dark matter,
or what I call-- it's

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.820
the stuff that's not atoms.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.890
We call that exotic dark matter.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.555
And then here is the atoms.

00:33:15.555 --> 00:33:17.430
And let's see, if you
want to feel very, very

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:22.140
small, the elements that
your bodies are made out of,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.880
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
iron, and uranium-- I just

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.310
can't remember the Tom Lehrer
song about all the elements,

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.070
so those are the only
ones I remember-- account

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.050
for 0.02% of the universe.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.660
And the rest is other stuff.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.910
So what's wonderful
about this picture

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.250
here is that we actually
know about atoms,

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.340
and they're about
4% of the universe.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.730
96-- we're patting ourselves
on the back for knowing a lot,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.770
by being able to
make this pie chart

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.610
where we say that 4% we know
of and the other 96% we've

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.920
been able to name.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.864
But I hope to convince you
by the end of this, that's

00:34:02.864 --> 00:34:05.280
the time you want to get in a
scientific field, when there

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.540
are really, really big puzzles.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.380
Because once it's all
known, it's not fun anymore.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:11.880
OK.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.620
We've already seen that slide.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.304
So from this accounting
of the universe,

00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:17.429
we got three big mysteries.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.449
What's the dark
matter made out of?

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.960
And the dark matter, just
coming back to this slide here,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.080
is so atoms can't account
for all the matter.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.449
If you subtract that number
from that number, you get 23.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.690
Well, actually maybe-- OK.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.340
Call it 23, please.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:38.620
And so we've got to explain
what is the dark matter.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.664
And then this one
gets even worse.

00:34:40.664 --> 00:34:41.830
So this is a technical term.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.223
What the heck is
the dark energy?

00:34:43.223 --> 00:34:44.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.280
And then, I have to tell you
about inflation and what it is

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.690
and what powered it.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:50.230
OK.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.354
So I'm on to the mysteries.

00:34:51.354 --> 00:34:53.699
So dark matter.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.909
So mostly we learn
about the universe

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.748
by looking through
telescopes made in Arizona.

00:34:59.748 --> 00:35:01.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.240
And a lot of them are
located in Arizona.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.230
For all I know, they're
all located in Arizona.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.019
So how can we see stuff
that doesn't give off light?

00:35:14.019 --> 00:35:15.560
And that's what I
want to talk about.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.230
We can feel its gravity.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.970
And the dark matter story
starts with Fritz Zwicky,

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.390
and he was a very,
very smart man.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.490
Oh, I think I forgot
something in this slide.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.440
So nowadays, he's
the kind of kid

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.560
who would get sent home
with a little tag on it,

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.682
does not play well with others.

00:35:35.682 --> 00:35:37.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.620
And here in this picture,
Fritz is describing

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.802
what a spherical bastard is.

00:35:44.802 --> 00:35:46.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.560
And a spherical
bastard is someone,

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.900
it's kind of like a dean.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.830
Nothing personal.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:52.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.770
You know, no matter what
direction you approach

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.394
this person, they're a bastard.

00:35:56.394 --> 00:35:58.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.510
And OK.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:03.200
Uh oh.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.250
I better, I better--
I didn't mean a dean.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.870
I meant a provost, of course.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.830
OK.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.170
So how did he
discover dark matter?

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.050
So he was the first
astronomer in the 1930s

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.390
to study clusters of galaxies.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:20.110
And these clusters of
galaxies are giant collections

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.110
of galaxies where you see
a whole bunch of galaxies

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.310
on a small part of the sky.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.330
This is the Hercules Cluster,
and every one of the smudges

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.860
is a galaxy.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.690
And so these
clusters of galaxies

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.990
might have 2,000
or 3,000 galaxies.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:41.410
And what Zwicky did was he
turned this beautiful picture

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.500
into this picture.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.950
He measured how fast
these galaxies are moving.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.590
So these galaxies are
not sitting still.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.090
They're actually moving.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.880
And he was able to measure
how fast they're moving.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.690
And they're moving thousands
of kilometers per second.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.650
And so he asked himself, well,
if they're moving so fast,

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.630
what keeps the cluster together?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.830
And the answer is,
should be gravity.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.270
Gravity is the universal glue.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.650
It holds things together.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:14.291
The planets in our solar system
move fast, not quite this fast,

00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:16.040
and it's the gravity
of the sun that holds

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.820
the solar system together.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.980
Except he found a
small, little problem.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.988
If you add up all the
gravity of all the--

00:37:24.988 --> 00:37:26.956
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.956 --> 00:37:31.476
You know, this slide was perfect
when I put it in this machine.

00:37:31.476 --> 00:37:32.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.735
It's this cheap
equipment you have here.

00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:35.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.340
So if you add up all the
gravity of all the stars in all

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.670
the galaxies, it's not enough
to hold the cluster together.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.450
It's off by a factor of 50.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.620
And so Zwicky was
bold enough to say,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.560
clusters must be held
together by the gravity

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.440
of unseen material.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.030
Dark matter.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.450
Now, there were
alternative hypotheses,

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.228
including that Fritz
Zwicky is crazy.

00:38:03.228 --> 00:38:04.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.750
One of the
alternative hypotheses

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.760
is, there aren't
really clusters.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.900
That was a chance passing
of galaxies in the night.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.290
And it was-- you know,
cosmology was young.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.750
Equipment wasn't good.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.130
The idea didn't catch on.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.630
But we now know that's true.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.110
And in fact, we can
image the dark matter.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.440
And let me show you another
wonderful Hubble image.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.790
So this is a
cluster of galaxies.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:34.015
So the orange galaxies
are in a cluster.

00:38:34.015 --> 00:38:35.489
Oh, you can't see
the phone number.

00:38:35.489 --> 00:38:36.030
That's right.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.821
We blacked it out
because some people would

00:38:37.821 --> 00:38:40.170
try to call it on their phone.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.960
So this is a
cluster of galaxies.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.380
And behind this
cluster of galaxies,

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.420
much farther away
in the universe,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.560
are very faint galaxies
called faint blue galaxies.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.490
We're really good
at naming things.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:54.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.420
And the light from these
faint blue galaxies

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.150
that I'm pointing at has
to pass through the cluster

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.320
to get to us.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.690
Now, one of the predictions
of Einstein's theory

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.330
is that gravity bends light.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.720
And anything that bends
light we just call a lens.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.450
So gravity acts like a lens.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.360
And what it does is
produce multiple images.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.750
So all of these
ring-like galaxies,

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.580
that's not a bunch of
galaxies that are twins.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.480
That's multiple images
of the same galaxy.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.450
And galaxy-- actually,
a gravitational lens

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.270
is not a great lens.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.860
It distorts.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.880
It shears.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.950
It stretches the image of
the galaxies behind it.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.250
But that's a really good thing
because we know how it does it.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.130
And by looking at the
pattern of multiple images

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.490
and distortions, you can
reconstruct the distribution

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:55.260
of mass in that cluster, and
that's what the next slide is.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:01.090
So these are the two coordinates
on the sky that you just saw,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.060
so this coordinate
and that coordinate.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:07.290
And the up coordinate is how
much mass at a given position.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.870
And so these spiky
little things tell you

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.730
how good this technique is.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.920
These are the
individual galaxies

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.320
that you saw in
that previous image.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.830
And you might say, well,
where's the dark matter?

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.760
Well, the dark matter
isn't quite so conspicuous,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.730
but it's this
smooth distribution

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.390
that goes on forever.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.800
So your eye is attracted
to these little spikes,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.380
but there's much more matter
in this smooth distribution.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.550
So we can actually image it.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.690
OK.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.120
In the 1970s-- again,
these damn girl

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.860
astronomers-- Vera Rubin
really convinced people

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.320
that this was an important
problem because she

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:51.690
showed that without dark matter,
galaxies would fly apart.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.910
So this is the Andromeda galaxy.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.120
And in a galaxy, stars
orbit around the center

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.710
of the galaxy.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.830
And so she carefully
measured the speeds

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:05.730
of the different
stars, stars close in,

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.090
stars farther away,
farther away, farther away.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.920
And the name of the
name of her result

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.880
is she found flat
rotation curves.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.890
And so what this meant was
there was a lot more to a galaxy

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.600
than that that meets
the eye, and let

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.510
me try to talk my
way through this.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.370
So if all of the
mass of a galaxy

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.230
were associated
with the stars, it

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.990
would be a bit
puzzling that when

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.720
you get to the rare star
or gas cloud way out here,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.550
it's moving just as fast.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:39.750
Because you know, gravity falls
off like 1 over R-squared.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:45.270
So what's holding this-- how
can these stars out here be

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.130
moving as fast as those stars?

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.380
And so what you can't
see with the telescope

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:54.270
is the enormous
halo of dark matter.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.240
OK.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.180
So let me talk about what
the dark matter is, and I

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.650
alluded to this earlier.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.020
The amount of matter in
the universe, the 27%,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.080
and the amount of atoms
in the universe, the 4.5%,

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.250
those numbers aren't equal.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.210
And to show you how
unequal they are--

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:17.860
so this is not 4.5% but
it's a different measure

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.850
of the amount of atoms.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.550
So here's the amount
of atoms on a ruler.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.650
It's 21 plus or minus 1.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:28.210
The total amount of matter
is a 130 plus or minus 5.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.640
And so those numbers are
just wildly different.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.660
So the dark matter
can't be atoms.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.060
It has to be a new
form of matter.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.880
And you know, Carl
Sagan reminded us

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.420
that we're made
out of star stuff,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.501
and we thought that
was really cool.

00:42:43.501 --> 00:42:45.250
But now I'm going to
tell you the universe

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.630
isn't made out of star stuff.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.500
It's made out of
this dark matter.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.210
So what is it?

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:51.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:55.620
So we don't know what it is.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:00.150
It's hard for a theorist
to say that, you know?

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.870
But here is our best hypothesis.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.750
In fact, this is our most
conservative hypothesis.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.180
I'm not saying it's right,
but this is the corner

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.090
we've worked ourselves into.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.010
That the dark matter
is made of a new kind

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.960
of particle of nature.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.640
And the three possibilities
when I drew this slide in 1990

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.592
were a particle
called the axion,

00:43:23.592 --> 00:43:25.800
a particle called the
neutralino, which I'll tell you

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.870
more about, and then
everybody in the room

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.730
has heard of neutrinos.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.790
And in 1990, we thought
that the dark matter just

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.722
might be neutrinos.

00:43:33.722 --> 00:43:36.180
We knew how many neutrinos
there were leftover from the Big

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.720
Bang, but it turns out that
their masses-- we've now

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.480
measured their masses
and they don't weigh

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.890
enough to be the dark matter.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.380
So they're a little
cosmic spice,

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.120
but they're not the dark matter.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.640
So let me tell you
about the neutralino.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.910
So this is a
hypothetical particle,

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:58.290
which is a fancy word that means
it doesn't exist as far as we

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.750
know, but we hope it exists.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.150
This is a particle
that, if it exists,

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:07.590
weighs 100, maybe 200, maybe
500 times what a proton does.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.470
This is a particle
whose existence

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.040
has been predicted by
particle physicists who

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.550
were working on a whole
different class of problems.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.040
Everybody's heard
of string theory?

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.750
Everybody's heard
of string theory.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.400
OK.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.816
Everybody's heard
of Brian Greene?

00:44:21.816 --> 00:44:22.820
Yeah.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:23.490
OK.

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:27.840
So if string theory is right,
for every particle we know,

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.610
there's a
super-symmetric partner.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.610
And the neutralino is the
lightest super-symmetric

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.330
partner.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.930
It's a particle whose existence
traces to string theory.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:41.790
And so you might ask, where
are these neutralinos?

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.270
Well, the answer
that Brian would give

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.064
is, we're about
to discover them.

00:44:47.064 --> 00:44:48.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.175
And I'll tell you why.

00:44:49.175 --> 00:44:50.550
And then there's
another particle

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.160
that I don't have time
to tell you about.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.560
Again, it's a
hypothetical particle

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.420
that solves a problem
in the subatomic world.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.310
And this particle
is called the axion,

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.680
and it couldn't be more
different than the neutralino.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.280
It weighs about a million,
million, million times less

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.890
than the neutralino, so there'd
have to be a lot of them.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.290
What's wonderful about
these particles is,

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.210
even though we don't know
whether or not they exist,

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.042
their predicted
particles allow us

00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:19.500
to calculate how
many of them would

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.270
be leftover from the Big Bang.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.980
And guess what the answer is?

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.780
Enough to be that dark matter.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.040
So this is where we are.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.870
This is an extraordinarily
bold hypothesis.

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.300
It might not be right.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.080
It's time to test it.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.480
And so I like to call this
the decade of dark matter.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.884
Let's see, do you have
a basketball team here?

00:45:39.884 --> 00:45:40.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.620
Did you guys know that
Hubble was a basketball star,

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.610
and that he led the University
of Chicago to three NCAA titles

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:48.734
in a row?

00:45:48.734 --> 00:45:49.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.888
Check that out,
that's a true fact.

00:45:51.888 --> 00:45:53.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.869
So one way you can
verify the dark matter--

00:45:56.869 --> 00:45:59.160
what do I mean that we have
the full court press on it?

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.730
One is that you could
produce it in an accelerator.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.590
Now, we hoped to
produce it at Fermilab,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.930
but Fermilab didn't
have enough energy.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:10.350
And there is a new accelerator
in Geneva, Illinois--

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.244
or no, maybe it's
Geneva, Switzerland.

00:46:12.244 --> 00:46:14.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.034 --> 00:46:15.450
It's one of those
Geneva's, called

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.220
the Large Hadron Collider.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.680
And if you ever visit the
Large Hadron Collider,

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.020
you go up on the wall
there and they say,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.940
wanted, dead or alive.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.480
The first picture is Osama bin
Laden and the second picture

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.360
is the neutralino.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.050
OK.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:36.720
If indeed the dark matter
is made out of particles,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.720
then we're swimming in
dark matter in this room.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.100
So in a coffee cup, there's
about one neutralino.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.920
And so if you built a
sensitive enough detector,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.110
you could detect
the neutralinos.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.270
The halo, sometimes
these neutralinos bump

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:56.010
into each other and annihilate,
you know, destroy each other,

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.635
and turn into particles
that we can detect,

00:46:58.635 --> 00:47:02.520
like photons, or
electrons, or positrons.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.790
And then it could be that the
very first generations of stars

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.810
were actually made
of neutralinos.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.170
So we feel like in
the next 10 years,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.350
we may finish this story of
dark matter, just in time

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.480
to start the next story.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.190
So what about the dark energy?

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:22.290
So this story starts in
1998 with the discovery

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.770
that the universe is speeding
up and not slowing down.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.410
And this was on the cover
of Science Magazine.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.790
And this was called the
breakthrough discovery

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.620
of the year.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:36.010
So let me remind you about
the expansion of the universe.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:40.740
So here's the size of
the universe versus time.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.140
And so remember that the
expansion of the universe

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.460
is just the stretching of space.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.780
And so this we call the
cosmic scale factor.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.090
And so as this green
curve gets bigger,

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.390
the universe is getting bigger.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.020
This is the Big Bang.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.150
And so one of the issues,
going back to Hubble,

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:03.260
is how much is the
universe slowing down?

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.690
Because gravity is
attractive, right?

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.560
And so your mother,
you all saw this.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.940
Your mother showed you
this curve on your knee,

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.930
on her knee, or maybe your knee.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.460
I don't know how that works.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.950
But you first heard about
this story from your mother.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.750
She said, the
universe is expanding.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.660
It's slowing down so that
these curves are droopy,

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.782
so they're getting
slower and slower.

00:48:25.782 --> 00:48:27.740
And if there's a lot of
matter in the universe,

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:32.470
the universe will halt expanding
and then fall back on itself.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:34.660
And if there's not very
much matter in the universe,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.160
the universe will
slow, and slow,

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.530
and then eventually
it won't slow anymore.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:42.220
And then there's a Goldilocks
universe that slows, and slows,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.810
and slows, and slows.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.180
And at an infinite time
after the Big Bang,

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.340
it stops expanding.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.150
And so one of the big
issues in cosmology

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.830
was to measure the
slowing of the universe.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.134
And this is very, very hard,
but you use the Hubble diagram.

00:48:59.134 --> 00:49:00.550
So here's the
Hubble diagram where

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.357
you plot the velocity of a
galaxy versus its distance.

00:49:04.357 --> 00:49:06.940
And now this is the one time I
really want you to concentrate.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.621
There is no joke coming,
so don't worry about that.

00:49:09.621 --> 00:49:10.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.370
So this is the Hubble diagram.

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:16.600
And if we measured velocities
and distances of galaxies

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.360
today, due to the fact that
the expansion of the universe

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.950
is just space expanding,
we'd get a straight line.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:26.476
But we cannot
measure those today.

00:49:26.476 --> 00:49:28.100
We cannot measure
the velocities today,

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.100
because when we look through a
telescope and we look at a very

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.060
distant object, we're
looking back in time.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.430
And so when we look at
the most distant objects,

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.650
we're not measuring
the velocity today.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.960
We're measuring the
velocity way back when.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.020
And if the universe is slowing
down, the number we measure

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.080
should actually be
above the straight line.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.210
And so going back to
Hubble, astronomers

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:52.510
have been trying to put
galaxies on this diagram,

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.440
on the Hubble diagram, ones
that are way far away, to see

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.330
the bending of the curve.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.320
And if the universe is slowing
down, it would curve upward.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.110
And the amount it curves upward,
like if it curved like that,

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.530
it's really slowing down
if just curves a little.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.880
So that was the goal.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.490
Now, in order to do this, you
need to accurately measure

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:14.720
distances.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.020
And to accurately measure
distances in astronomy,

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.367
you need an object whose
brightness you know,

00:50:21.367 --> 00:50:23.450
and then you measure its
apparent brightness here.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:25.880
And if it's very faint,
it's very far away.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.130
And so we call these
standard candles.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.320
And the best standard
candle that we know of,

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.870
the standard candle that
really makes this work,

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.450
is called a Type 1a Supernova.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.910
And it's basically
a star about 40%

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.570
more massive than our
sun that just blows up.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:45.410
So it's a 1.4 solar
mass thermonuclear bomb.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.950
And so you can see them
across the universe.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:52.310
So here's a very distant galaxy,
and here's a Type 1a Supernova.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.730
All of these are
distant galaxies,

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.856
and you can see the supernova.

00:50:55.856 --> 00:50:57.230
And I just want
to put in a pitch

00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.590
here because the person
who really pointed out

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.900
that these were good standard
candles and figured out

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.090
how they work is
Dave Arnett, who's

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.670
a professor here at the
University of Arizona,

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.290
and wrote the book
on supernovae.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:17.190
Now, actually, he did
this work while he was

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.266
at the University of Chicago.

00:51:19.266 --> 00:51:21.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:24.320
OK.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.250
So these objects, by
finding these supernovae,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:33.510
you can put data points on this
diagram, on the Hubble diagram.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:36.630
And here's what
was found in 1998.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.570
So all the points lay
below the straight line.

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:44.820
And if you followed the argument
about why this bends upward

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.890
if the universe is
slowing down, then you

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:50.450
would realize this means
the universe is speeding up.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.900
And a lot of measurements and
other data have been taken,

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.270
and the universe
really is speeding up.

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.300
And so how the heck
can that be possible?

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:04.190
And the reason is, is that
general relativity-- GR

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.980
stands for general
relativity-- allows

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.092
for gravity to be repulsive.

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:10.550
Now, I've got to
just explain this.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:12.290
I don't mean the
study of gravity

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:13.720
being repulsive and hard.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.090
I mean that gravity
can be repulsive.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.690
And so I'll just make a small,
little technical statement.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.250
One of the things
that you learned

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.240
in Newton's theory of gravity
is that the strength of gravity

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.240
that an object puts
off-- ugh, that

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.330
was a terrible construction--
that the strength of gravity

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.970
or the gravitational
force of an object

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.250
depends only on its mass.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.850
In Einstein's theory, it also
depends upon its composition

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:43.700
through the pressure.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.070
And so while we don't think
mass or energy can be negative,

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:53.390
pressure can be
something that's elastic.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.060
If you have a hot gas,
that's positive pressure.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.880
If you have a rubber sheet,
that's negative pressure.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.464
And so P can be negative.

00:53:00.464 --> 00:53:02.630
And if you have something
that's very, very elastic,

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:04.940
this combination
can be negative,

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.700
and the gravity that produces
instead of being attractive

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.050
is repulsive.

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.220
Are you with me?

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:10.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.219
OK.

00:53:11.219 --> 00:53:12.470
I think you are.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:17.660
And so, stuff that has repulsive
gravity is called dark energy.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.325
So cosmic acceleration is
caused by the repulsive gravity

00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:20.950
of dark energy.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:22.060
Are there any questions?

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.385
OK.

00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:27.510
Let me tell you a little
bit more about this stuff.

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.840
I should start at the bottom.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.390
This stuff is weird,
it's mysterious,

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.135
and it's extremely exciting.

00:53:34.135 --> 00:53:36.260
And if you're confused when
I'm done discussing it,

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.764
you have caught up
with the rest of us.

00:53:38.764 --> 00:53:39.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:40.340
OK.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.590
So it's not made
out of particles.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:45.050
It's highly elastic.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.540
It's gravity is repulsive,
and it is everywhere.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:49.850
So this is really weird stuff.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:51.510
We don't understand it.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:57.790
So here is our best explanation
for the dark energy.

00:53:57.790 --> 00:53:59.930
And as you'll see, it's
not a very good one.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.490
So this is the Zen
part of the talk.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:06.310
So this involves
asking, what is nothing?

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.790
So according to
quantum mechanics,

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.710
nothing is something.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.750
Actually, that sounds
like American economy.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:18.570
But anyway, according
to quantum mechanics,

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.450
the vacuum is filled with
particles living on borrowed

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.700
time and borrowed energy.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.410
And let me just show you.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.580
Time is running up.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.260
An electron and
its anti-particle

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.140
can pump out of the
vacuum for a little while

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.890
and then disappear.

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.390
And so we know the
vacuum is seething.

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.980
It's a sea of virtual particles.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.130
And in fact, Willis
Lamb, who I believe

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:44.550
spent part of his career here,
but he did the experiments

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.360
at Chicago.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.530
Actually, he did them
at Columbia University.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.800
Measured the effects of
these virtual particles.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.660
So they really are there.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.510
And this part I'm just going
to ask you to accept on faith.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:01.050
Otherwise, I'm going to put a
whole bunch of equations up.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:07.170
That if this vacuum energy--
if these virtual particles have

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.890
energy, we call it vacuum
energy-- if they have energy,

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:14.310
their pressure is equal to
minus their energy density.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.670
That is, they're
extraordinarily elastic.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:21.450
So that this combination of
row plus 3P is minus 2 row.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:23.330
Very, very elastic.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:24.330
OK.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.640
So how much does nothing weigh?

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.460
And this is where a theorist
just starts to babble.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:34.140
Because the truth is, we don't
know how much nothing weighs.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.690
In fact, to be really
honest, when we actually

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.230
try to add up how much all of
these virtual particles weigh,

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:44.180
we get infinity, which
is a little too big.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.160
When we use some
tricks that we're not

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.160
sure that are correct, then we
get almost the right answer.

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:54.530
We find out that the
repulsive gravity of nothing

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:57.380
is very close to
being the right amount

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.030
to explain the
accelerating universe.

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.816
It's off by about 10 to the 55.

00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:03.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.146
So it's kind of the same
size problem as our deficit.

00:56:07.146 --> 00:56:09.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:10.000
OK.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.910
So actually, this is
the part where I just

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.420
want to wax poetic and get
really excited, because this

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.190
is what science is all about.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:20.480
So we started with one puzzle.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.630
Why is the universe speeding up?

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.120
And now we have two puzzles.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.440
So the second puzzle-- oops--
the second puzzle is, why

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.630
does nothing weigh so little?

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.060
And by the way, what
about that first puzzle?

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.300
So this is what we live
for in science, is puzzles.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.240
And theorists really
like hard puzzles

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.060
because solving
hard puzzles often

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.820
requires a crazy new idea.

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.134
Now, I know you can
all find my email,

00:56:48.134 --> 00:56:50.050
and so I just want you
to carefully read this.

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.480
"Not every crazy idea is a
solution to a profound puzzle."

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.940
Most of them are just crazy.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.960
So OK.

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.940
So let's see, what
did I have to say?

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:03.900
Oh, here's my crazy idea.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.010
So not only did I invent
the term dark energy,

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:07.200
but you've got to
play both sides.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.366
You know, you have to hedge.

00:57:08.366 --> 00:57:09.520
It's a hedge fund.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.270
So I also wrote a paper saying,
there is no dark energy.

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:14.760
It's just a new
aspect of gravity.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.060
Einstein was wrong.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.060
And when the universe
gets really, really empty,

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.120
it accelerates.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.430
And our universe has gotten
really, really empty.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.130
So it's expanded
a long, long time.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:30.530
And so its density has
decreased by about 100 orders

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.220
of magnitude.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:36.940
Now, actually, I don't think
this idea works, but it might.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.182
Oh, here we go.

00:57:38.182 --> 00:57:39.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.740
So one thing that's
really important

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.890
is towards the end of a talk,
to wake people up, you have

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:46.852
to put some boy-girl sex in.

00:57:46.852 --> 00:57:47.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.490
And does anyone-- everybody
knows who this good looking guy

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.660
is, right?

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.410
Burt Lancaster.

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.522
What about her?

00:57:54.522 --> 00:57:55.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.540
Oh, OK.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.100
Good.

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:57.790
OK.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:58.892
So let's--

00:57:58.892 --> 00:58:00.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.100
Where did that
picture come from?

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:02.700
OK.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:04.530
I don't know where
that picture came from.

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.600
Oh, back to this picture.

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.211
So this is what your mother told
you when you were a little baby

00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.210
and you were on her knee
and she was telling you

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:13.360
about the Big Bang.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:13.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.590
And she told you about
the universe slowing down.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:20.100
And a universe that had
the Goldilocks density

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.860
and was flat, you
know, was slowing down.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.100
And that's our universe.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.370
But things are speeding up.

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.160
So now we have the
biggest dilemma of all.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.490
Was your mother wrong?

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.020
And the answer is, no.

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.930
Because as you were
falling asleep, she said,

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:37.070
this is the simplest
version of the story.

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.220
This is a story where
there's no dark energy.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.870
But if there's dark energy,
an uncurved universe

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.820
can actually be speeding up.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.730
And all I wanted to say
here is, until we understand

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.590
what the dark energy
is, we don't know

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.044
the destiny of our universe.

00:58:52.044 --> 00:58:53.960
We don't know if it's
going to be a big crunch

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.550
or expansion forever.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:57.640
OK.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.220
So I wander around the halls
at the University of Chicago

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.980
saying, dark energy may be the
most profound problem in all

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:07.840
of science, and it's really
good that other great minds

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.233
agree with me.

00:59:09.233 --> 00:59:12.191
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:14.656 --> 00:59:17.614
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.820
So I bet you all--
you know, that's

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.230
the thing about people today.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.612
They don't read the whole book.

00:59:26.612 --> 00:59:28.320
So the whole interview,
I bet none of you

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.790
watched the whole interview.

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:34.950
And the biggest question was,
Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin,

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:35.910
what about dark energy?

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:37.140
And she said, you betcha, Katie.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.181
I believe in dark energy.

00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:39.642
We can see it from Alaska.

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:40.449
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:40.449 --> 00:59:42.240
Now, of course, that's
the Northern Lights,

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.455
but she spelled it right.

00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:45.536
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:45.536 --> 00:59:47.160
And now I'm going to
show you something

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.720
that not so many
people have seen.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:53.520
This is going to be her
bumper sticker in 2012.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.184
OK.

00:59:58.184 --> 01:00:00.524
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:04.190
I'm getting the
sign from the dean

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.773
that I'm not getting
paid by the hour,

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:08.390
so I've to wind this
up here pretty soon.

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.990
So when are we going
to solve this puzzle?

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.594
I don't know, and that's what
makes this puzzle so exciting.

01:00:14.594 --> 01:00:16.760
And I hope there's some
young people in the audience

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.326
because I have a
feeling that we're not

01:00:19.326 --> 01:00:20.450
going to solve this puzzle.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.830
It's going to be
the next generation.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.410
Some kid in the audience here
is going to figure this one out

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:25.230
before I do.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.570
And if you have some good ideas,
come up afterwards and see me.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:29.360
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.082
And we can write
a paper together.

01:00:31.082 --> 01:00:32.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.620
OK.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.800
But there is going to be some
more information about how fast

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.960
the universe is speeding up.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.690
We hope to build a telescope
in the US called WFIRST.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.960
And those damn Europeans,
everything we do,

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.350
they try to copy.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:49.250
And we are building, for sure,
the Large Synoptic Survey

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.880
Telescope, which will
be Roger Angel mirrors,

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.680
but it won't be in Arizona.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.670
But that's not my fault.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:59.150
OK.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.330
Right, let me go on and
talk about inflation

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:04.310
and then finish up
with the multiverse.

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:10.620
So there was an idea
in the 1980s that

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.130
has been probably the
most influential idea

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:17.450
since the idea of the Big Bang,
and it's called inflation.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:20.015
And what it really is is
this brown sentence here.

01:01:20.015 --> 01:01:23.360
"A a very short period
of rapid expansion

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.060
driven by vacuum energy."

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.970
And in the 1980s, we were
afraid to call this accelerated

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.910
expansion because the idea
was so crazy that if we added

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:34.370
accelerated expansion,
which is what it really is,

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.630
nobody would have
listened to us.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.720
So how rapid?

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.610
In 10 to the -32
seconds-- for those of you

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.236
who don't know what that
is, we just call it a jiffy.

01:01:44.236 --> 01:01:46.589
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:47.130
I don't know.

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:48.840
I don't know powers
of 10 either.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.370
So in a jiffy, the universe
expanded by a larger factor

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:56.760
than it did in the
next 15 billion years.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.960
And our observable universe
began from an incredibly tiny

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.780
piece of the original universe.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.490
And that explains
why it's so smooth,

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.470
and also explains where
the lumps come from.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:12.300
So let me just run
you through that idea.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.350
So here is the
universe, very early on.

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.320
One of the big puzzles is why
is our universe so smooth?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.510
Why did the microwave
background look so smooth?

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.970
So a tiny, little
bit of the universe

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:26.820
blows up due to
this vacuum energy.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.430
And for those of you who
know a little more physics,

01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:32.970
you can look at this
picture up there.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:34.597
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:34.597 --> 01:02:36.430
Not that I understand
that picture up there,

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:39.520
but so this tiny, little
bit of the universe

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.290
blows up, creating a big,
smooth region of the universe.

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.300
And because it was
so tiny, it was flat.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.360
So creating a big, smooth
uncurved universe--

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.080
oh, that's what we have--
that all that we see today

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.610
can fit in.

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:58.130
And this is the
most amazing thing,

01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.780
and this is why
Stephen Hawking called

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.350
the discovery by COBE the
greatest discovery of all time,

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:07.290
is that this explains where the
seeds for structure come from.

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:12.200
So everyone knows that
at the subatomic world,

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.300
things are bouncing around.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.070
Things can't be smooth.

01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:18.410
We call them fluctuations.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:21.964
And so in the subatomic world,
you have these fluctuations.

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:24.380
And so you might say, oh, well,
that would be really good.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.080
So higher density here,
lower density there.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.960
But the size of these is less
than the size of an atom.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.640
So how could you make a galaxy?

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.770
This tremendous
expansion of the universe

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:40.137
stretches the fluctuations.

01:03:40.137 --> 01:03:41.220
Well, let me go back here.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:44.280
Just like it blows up this
piece and makes it really big,

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.260
it stretches the size
of these fluctuations.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.300
So that instead of being
less than the size of an atom

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.270
across, they're millions
of light years across.

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:56.880
And so you get more matter
here and less matter there.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.160
And so that makes the
lumpiness in the universe.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.580
And if that's correct, this--
what you see on the microwave

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.310
sky-- is quantum noise.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:10.450
And the biggest thing-- it
got blown up by inflation.

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.550
And the biggest things
in the universe,

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:17.740
galaxies, clusters of galaxies,
are made from subatomic quantum

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.795
fluctuations.

01:04:19.795 --> 01:04:21.420
Now, usually at this
point in the talk,

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.840
I look for the men in white
coats to be pulling me off.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.682
So that's an amazing idea.

01:04:26.682 --> 01:04:28.140
Since that didn't
happen, I'll show

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.580
you one more slide about this.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.010
So this means when you
look at the microwave

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:35.670
sky-- this is from
WMAP-- you are looking

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.600
at the world's largest IMAX.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.150
So you are looking
at the quantum

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:44.060
world projected across the sky.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.590
And what you see across 10
or 20 degrees of the sky

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.920
started out, at a
length scale, smaller

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.150
than a billionth of
the size of a proton.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.610
So that's amazing.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.479
And let's see, I don't
really have much time

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:01.270
to talk about this.

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:04.270
But this kind of lumpiness
plus the dark matter

01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:08.350
is called cold dark
matter scenario.

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:11.770
And this gives us a story
of how galaxies and clusters

01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:15.460
of galaxies were formed that we
can test with these telescopes

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.175
that we build with
Roger Angel mirrors.

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:25.630
And right now, so far,
the status of this theory

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.719
is really good.

01:05:26.719 --> 01:05:29.260
When I showed you those points
from the microwave background,

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.940
there was a curve through them.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.710
It wasn't a curve
that I asked my son

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.450
to draw to fit all the points.

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:38.090
That's actually what
theory predicted.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:38.880
OK.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.380
Now I'm going to
give you the part,

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.060
this is the hardest
part of the talk.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.890
This is the one that's really
going to keep you up at night.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.890
So if you're not a good
sleeper, close your eyes

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.680
and put your hands
over your ears.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.530
So inflation says that what we
used to think of as the capital

01:05:56.530 --> 01:06:02.350
B, capital B Big Bang was
kind of little b little b,

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.610
our Big Bang.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.620
It was the start
of our universe.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.890
Because according to
inflation, if it happened once,

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:10.780
it happened many times.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.670
Now, you know mathematicians
and scientists,

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:16.420
when they say many times, what
they really mean is infinity.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.420
But if they said infinity, it
would make you feel nervous.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:24.580
And so this leads to the idea,
the inflationary multiverse.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.160
And here is another
Monet painting,

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.250
and this has to do with--
here's the river of time.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:32.650
And in some ways,
there was no beginning.

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.080
There were an infinite
number of beginnings.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.940
And so each one of
these inflation events

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.520
creates a universe,
and these universes

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.260
are completely disconnected.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.280
They can't talk to one another.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.000
And so we call this
idea the multiverse.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And they might-- if you marry
this with string theory--

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.010
why you would do
that, I don't know--

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:57.020
but if you marry this
with string theory,

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.170
then these different regions,
these different pieces

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:02.490
of the universe, might
be very different.

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:04.490
Here's our beautiful universe.

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:07.820
Others might be empty or
have lower dimensions.

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.360
And this idea is either
the most important idea

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:17.700
since Copernicus or it's the
biggest headache of all time.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.680
Why is it a headache?

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.620
Because these different
pieces of the multiverse

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.210
can't communicate.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.400
And if they can't communicate,
how can we test it?

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.600
And if we can't test it,
how can it be science?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.440
And so that's why
this is a headache,

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.144
because it's a really important
idea that might even be true.

01:07:36.144 --> 01:07:38.060
But we can't test it,
and so it's not science.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.530
And I just want to go back.

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:43.460
What we can test is whether or
not our piece of the universe

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:48.110
happened from inflation,
and we are doing that.

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.190
So what do you do when
you get a cosmic headache?

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:52.842
Well, you drink a bottle
of multiverse beer.

01:07:52.842 --> 01:07:54.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:54.950
OK.

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.540
So let me just wrap up here.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.720
So I talked about our
understanding of the universe,

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.980
and we're very excited about it.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.580
We know a lot
about the universe,

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.010
but it's predicated on
dark matter, dark energy,

01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:08.270
and inflation.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.310
And these are mysteries.

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:15.980
And they all imply
physics or laws of nature

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.270
that we have yet to discover.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:20.106
Let me just explain that with
a very complicated diagram.

01:08:20.106 --> 01:08:21.229
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.020
So I'm just going to be quiet
for a minute or two while you

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.775
read this.

01:08:24.775 --> 01:08:25.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:26.660
OK.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:32.580
So what this is is, this
is an amazing summary

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.930
of what we know about the
world of the subatomic.

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:41.640
So here you see the word quarks,
and leptons, and everything

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.170
we know about it.

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.390
And if you study
this very carefully,

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:51.229
you will not find in it
dark matter, dark energy,

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:52.670
or inflation.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.830
So this is a
tremendous achievement,

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.140
but it doesn't include
dark matter, dark energy,

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.189
and inflation.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:01.790
And so that means that our
list of the laws of physics

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:05.120
and the fundamental pieces of
the universe is incomplete.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.729
And so this is the
most exciting thing

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:11.779
that there are deep connections
between the universe,

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:14.420
the biggest thing
that we can imagine,

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.580
and the elementary particles,
the smallest things.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.350
That's the purpose
of this picture.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.340
Here is the sky and these
are a bubble chambers

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.340
of elementary particles.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.010
So dark matter, when we
figure out what it is,

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:26.960
it's a new particle
in nature and it

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.710
might tell us how the forces
of nature are unified.

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:35.880
Dark energy, is it the
energy of nothing or-- oops.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.006
Yeah, you really do
have bad equipment here.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.080
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.240
Or is signaling that something's
wrong with general relativity?

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:44.960
And so on.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.060
So we have these
deep connections.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.160
Figuring out dark
matter is not only

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.410
going to help us
understand the cosmos,

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:55.730
it's probably going to help us
understand the subatomic world

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.760
and how the forces are unified.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.130
And we're going to get
clues from a whole bunch

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:05.840
of experiments, accelerators,
specialize-- this is a detector

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.890
to detect dark matter.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:09.080
And you see some
more telescopes here.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.830
And this is an
extraordinarily exciting time.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.770
And let me use some pictures
that my daughter helped me

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:18.590
draw when she was very young.

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.250
So we know much
about the universe.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.909
So I told you about inflation.

01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:25.700
I mentioned the word
string, so I'm allowed

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.590
to put string cosmology here.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.840
The Hot Big Bang,
massive neutrinos.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.800
We have all of this.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.890
We know a lot, but
we understand less.

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:38.680
And so the goal is to
put it all together.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.770
And this is big
stakes, very exciting.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.302
Because if we think we can put
the picture of the universe

01:10:44.302 --> 01:10:45.760
together, we're
also going to learn

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.820
about the fundamental rules
that govern the universe.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.830
And so I asked my daughter,
can you help me here?

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:54.350
What do we got?

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.990
And she said, daddy,
you have an elephant.

01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:58.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:05.580
And so the metaphor
here, the metaphor

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:09.900
here is the blind
man and the elephant.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.930
So we're the blind cosmologists
feeling the universe.

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:15.420
We feel these different
pieces, but we haven't

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.800
seen the big picture yet.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.340
And so that's the challenge
for the next generation.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.150
So it's very, very exciting, and
I thank you for your attention.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:25.950
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.500
