duty not to prosecute the person so we
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330
duty not to prosecute the person so we

that that are brought that I can't
believe they're brought in the first

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
believe they're brought in the first
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.319
believe they're brought in the first
place so it's hard to believe that

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329
place so it's hard to believe that
 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.759
place so it's hard to believe that
there's ones that are that are based on

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769
there's ones that are that are based on
 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.339
there's ones that are that are based on
even more spurious arrest but I I know

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349
even more spurious arrest but I I know
 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.020
even more spurious arrest but I I know
that there are because I've had clients

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030
that there are because I've had clients
 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.819
