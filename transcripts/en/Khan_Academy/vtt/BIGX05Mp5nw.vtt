00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.420
Let's take the number
7 and divide it by 3.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.029
And I'm going to
conceptualize dividing by 3

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.160
as let me see how many groups
of 3 I can make out of the 7.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.770
So let me draw 7 things--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.690
So let me try to
create groups of 3.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.370
So I can definitely create one
group of 3 right over here.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.170
I can definitely create
another group of 3.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.960
So I'm able to create
two groups of 3.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240
And then I can't create
any more full groups of 3.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.982
I have essentially this thing
right over here left over.

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:38.190
So this right over here, I
have this thing remaining.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.440
This right over
here is my remainder

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.740
after creating as many
groups of 3 as I can.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.110
And so when you see
something like this,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.330
people will often
say 7 divided by 3.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.520
Well, I can create
two groups of 3.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.060
But it doesn't divide evenly, or
3 doesn't divide evenly into 7.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.160
I end up with
something left over.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.390
I have a leftover.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.450
I have a remainder of 1.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.360
So this is literally saying 7
divided by 3 is 2 remainder 1.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.420
And that makes sense.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.990
2 times 3 is 6.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.840
So it doesn't get
you all the way to 7.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.720
But then if you have
your extra remainder,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.000
6 plus that 1 remainder
gets you all the way to 7.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.430
Let's do another one.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.850
Let's imagine 15 divided by 4.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.115
Let me draw 15 objects-- 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.570
12, 13, 14, 15.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.200
Now, let me try to divide
it into groups of 4.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.100
So let's see, that's
one group of 4.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.930
That's another group of 4.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.330
And then that's
another group of 4.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.050
So I'm able to create
three groups of 4.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.930
But then I can't create
a fourth full group of 4.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.520
I am then left with this
remainder right over here.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.490
I have a remainder
right over here of 3.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.010
I have 3 left over.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.560
So we could say that 15
divided by 4 is 3 remainder 3.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.950
4 goes into 15 three times.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.180
But that only gets us to 12.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.149
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.440
To get all the way to 15, we
need to use our remainder.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.360
We have to get 3 more.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.240
So 15 divided by 4,
I have 3 left over.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.120
Now, let's try to
think about this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.250
doing a little bit of our
long division techniques.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.310
So let's say that I have 4.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.580
Let's say I want
to divide 75 by 4.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460
Well, traditional long
division techniques.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.040
4 goes into 7 one time.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.600
And If you're looking
at place value,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.270
we're really saying the 4
is going into 70 ten times,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.450
because we're putting
this in the tens place.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.162
And then we say, 1 times 4 is 4.

00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:59.370
But really, once again,
since it's in the tens place,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.860
this is really
representing a 40.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.200
But either way, we
subtract 4 from the 7.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.420
We get a 3.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.580
And then we bring down this 5.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.214
And we say 4 goes into 35.

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:12.880
Well, let's see.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.420
4 times 8 is 32.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.840
4 times 9 is 36.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.500
That's too big.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.150
So it goes 8 times.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.830
8 times 4 is 32.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.190
You subtract 35 minus 32 is 3.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.770
And 4 doesn't go into 3 anymore.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.630
So here I have this 3 left over.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.490
I have a remainder of 3.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:42.340
So you could say that 75 divided
by 4 is equal to 18 remainder

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.734
3.
