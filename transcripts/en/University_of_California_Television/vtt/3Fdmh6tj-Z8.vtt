00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:31.320
- [Male] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked, large brained. Long the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.120
master of fire, tools and language but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.670
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.100
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.310
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:23.990
- [Charles Kennel] I am in fact literally
the bridge between the past and the future

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.370
in many different ways. This is the title
that I originally chose when I submitted

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.850
my first abstract. When I got to preparing
it I thought I would try something new

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.050
with the same material that I have been
working on for some time. So I've

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.260
re-changed the name now and that will be
"Of a Climate Regime Change." It's the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.530
same material basically but the hypothesis
is that we may be with our modern

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.150
instrumentation over the last 20 or so
years, we may be seeing a change in

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.580
climate that is something like those that
might have caused Jeff Severinghaus'

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.700
abrupt transitions. I'm going to go
through it with you. It is of course a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.090
very small version of very big events that
happened in the past. I first got

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.250
interested in this problem because of a
issue of public awareness and policy. The

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.870
public issue is called the paradox. The
triple hiatus paradox. If you cherry

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.930
picked your data as this article did, you
can find a time in 1997 and another time

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.050
in 2012 when the Earth's temperature was
the same that it had been. This led to the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.820
idea that the globe is not warming even
though the carbon dioxide is increasing. I

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.410
began to ask myself two other questions,
"What else was going while the global

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.630
temperature was constant? Was climate
change also disappearing?" I found of

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.620
course two other paradoxes. "Why are the
extreme events in climate increasing?"

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.240
Here's the key I show, "Why is the Arctic
warming even more rapidly?" Let's first of

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:27.830
all verify that this is the hiatus. It
started in the year 2000. During that time

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.240
the carbon dioxide has increased and
humans have added about 27 percent more

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.110
CO2 than they have since the beginning of
the industrial revolution and this should

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.880
have lead to increase in the warming rate.
In climatologist language, four tenth of a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.120
watt per meter. We were putting more
energy into climate but it wasn't turning

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.290
up in the global temperature. The question
was, "Where was that energy going?" Here's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.690
a longer perspective on the hiatus. This
is a record since 1880 and it shows the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.050
much shorter record than you've seen thus
far but it shows the global temperature

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.760
evolution. The first thing you notice is
that there was another hiatus about

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.650
between 45 and 75. They do happen. They
are features of climate models. They are

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.880
areas where the climate goes through a
reconfiguration. Our present hiatus

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.010
started with a bang. With a huge El Niño
in 1997 and 1998. My first year as

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.620
Director of Scripps when my office was
inundated. Then you can see the profile of

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.740
the slowing warming that we've seen
throughout the century. The global mean

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.800
temperature that the scientists calculate
is taken from data. Most of it is from

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.610
satellite observations of the sea surface
temperature and the sea covers 70 percent

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.850
of the Earth's surface. You would expect
that this computation will be dominated by

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:11.480
what's happening in the ocean. After many
gyrations the community came to realize

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.580
that it was the ocean. It's the behavior
of the ocean that was responsible for this

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.320
hiatus in warming because we knew from
earlier studies going back to the 1980s

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.370
that pacific ocean for example could
oscillate between two very extreme states

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.150
in which the temperature changes
dramatically. Do you notice that the El

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.820
Niño is a warm state and La Niña is a cool
state and so perhaps what was happening

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:49.090
was that we were switching from El Niño to
La Niña prevailing state thereof. Sorry I

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.920
have to tell you a little bit, just a
little bit about how the El Niño cycle

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.760
works. What you're looking at here is a
sketch taken from the pacific equator,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.850
stretching from the East in Lima to the
West in Darwin. You'll see in the top, in

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:15.450
the La Niña phase, the Trade Winds push
the wavy ocean towards the West and

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.930
that water heats up from the sun as it
goes. As it heats up it expands a little

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:28.020
bit so the winds have to push the water up
stream, uphill. It goes until it can't go

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:36.820
any further so you'll get a deep water in
the Western pacific that's warm and then

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.930
this circulation pattern pushes up cold
water in the East. That's the cooling

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.870
phase of the La Niña. The El Niño is a
little bit different. The Trade Winds can

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.260
suddenly stop for some reason and all this
water rushes downhill. The warm water gets

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.940
heated the second time as it crosses the
pacific slosh up against the North

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:07.710
American and South American continents.
What happened? Did the Trade Winds

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.700
increase? Where if the right sense to
create an El Niño, a La Niña? The answer

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:20.820
is from this remarkably difficult data set
to compile, a hundred years of the Trade

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:27.220
Wind stress on the ocean water in the
Central Pacific. You can see it oscillated

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.180
around until about the year 2000 when it
switched from El Niño sense, smaller Trade

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:40.020
Wind, to La Niña sense, larger Trade Wind.
Is continuing to get larger in the

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.630
negative direction that's the negative
part of this curve and it's

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.310
unprecedentedly large and it is not
included at present in contemporary

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.870
present climate models. But the Trade Wind
has been exceptionally large. Which means

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.950
then you would think if that were the
case, that in fact you were driving a lot

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:06.040
of heat energy into the ocean in the
Western Pacific. Here is a picture of a

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:13.030
ocean heat content that was published just
about six or seven months ago in science.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.790
But it looks like it solves the problem.
What Chen and Tang did was divide their

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:24.850
time that they looked at the data. From
before the hiatus on the right and after

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.960
the hiatus began on the left. You see two
plots. The bottom one is the one pertinent

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.960
to my argument about the El Niño and I'll
come to the top one in a moment. What you

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.810
see is a spread against longitude across
the Pacific. The red blob is the

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:49.690
distribution of ocean heat down to about
300 meters. You see this abrupt switch in

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:55.460
colors if you will. The same switch that
you saw in that earlier picture from Woods

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:02.660
Hole. What we do know is that at around
the time at the hiatus that Pacific ocean

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:08.730
state changed to a heat sequestering
state. But the other thing that happened

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:15.360
which actually took over after awhile
during this same period. Is displayed in

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.130
this plot on the left which is somewhat
different because it transect up the

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:28.770
Atlantic from South to North and it shows
you where new heat is being buried in the

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:35.440
North Atlantic. You can see basically that
the heat is being buried at pretty high

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:42.170
latitudes. This started at approximately
the same time. This little event here that

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.620
we are observing is a small version of the
events that Jeff Severinghaus was talking

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.430
about somewhat earlier where it was
possible to slow down the Atlantic

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:58.820
Meridian circulation. You can see the
strong different between the two states.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:07.430
This change took place across the large El
Niño that started the process off. What

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.940
else was going on during this time? The
oceans would tell you this spread all

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.400
around the Earth's ocean. That tells you
right away that we're doing with a

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.280
comprehensive change in ocean state and
you would expect then that there would be

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.830
other changes in the climate that occurred
at the same time. Other parts of this

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.540
restructuring. As you've probably have
understood from the pictures of polar

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:39.090
bears, there actually is an Arctic regime
shift in progress. This is first revealed

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:45.860
by two formal assessments. One in 2005
that used primarily data from before the

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.990
hiatus began and another one only seven
years later. They discovered a major

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.890
change in the distribution of Arctic
heating. During the hiatus has been

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:03.080
fastest in Spring and Autumn and before it
was fastest in Winter which was consistent

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.190
with the earlier greenhouse warming
models. It's now faster over the oceans

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:16.070
and the land. These change in patterns
suggested to you that the Arctic developed

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:23.940
a new warming source that was not as
strong in the previous period. Satellite

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:30.540
data first began to be collected with
great accuracy later on sea ice area in

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:39.530
79. Here is the curve that you can see of
the minimum sea ice extent which occurs at

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:45.020
the end of the warm season in September.
As a function of time, September after

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:53.980
September since 1979. What you can infer
from this plot is a break in behavior in

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.170
which the sea ice was slowly declining but
oscillating about a slowly declining mean.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:04.350
Suddenly there looks like a change in
state. Over this period of time, the sea

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:12.190
ice area has declined by about 40 percent
and the sea ice volume is down to 25

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:20.590
percent what it had been in 1979. Here is
the same data that was there in case the

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:29.320
movie didn't work. This shows you where
the timing of the sea ice decline. There's

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.260
one other thing that has happened during
the period of the hiatus which I think

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:41.390
will be interesting to Jeff and others.
It's a small analogue of the events that

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:48.330
slowed the meridional overturn in
circulation. During this hiatus and only

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:56.260
since about the year 2000, a new pattern
of winds developed over the Arctic ocean.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.270
It's called the Arctic Dipole Anomaly.
This pair of winds going in opposite

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:08.540
directions drives ice and sea and fresh
water in the Arctic into the North

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:15.120
Atlantic where it will shut off or it can
impede. The word collides basically with

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.460
the Gulf Stream. At that collision point
the water sinks to depth. We did see that.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:29.110
This is a small event of something that
actually happened in the historical record

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:36.400
8,000 years ago as the ice sheet was
retreating across North America. As it

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.190
retreated it left behind in the area of
Hudson Bay, a huge glacial lake that was

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.230
contained between the melting ice in one
hand and the moraine that had pushed up on

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.530
the front. These glacial moraines are
unstable and there was a huge outflow of

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:58.470
water that occurred all at once. There was
a 200 year period of cool climate that

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:04.290
then recovered. The Columbia River was
also formed this way. What the satellites

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:10.210
have observed is a great injection of
fresh water into this gyre here, Beaufort

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:17.150
Gyre, that began at approximately the same
time. That water is lighter and when it

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.020
gets to the saltier Atlantic, the saltier
Atlantic will sink. Here is the next and

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:29.630
most important point. This sea ice retreat
that I just documented is warming the

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:36.140
Arctic by a very simple mechanism. When
you replace white ice with blue ocean you

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:43.950
absorb much more solar energy. The sea ice
itself may reflect half back to space and

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:50.490
the ocean absorbs 93 percent of the energy
that's falling on it. As the sea ice

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:58.460
retreats it warms the Arctic. A recent
paper that came out from Scripps measured

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:06.830
the degree of warming since the satellite
era started in 79. They found that the net

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.750
sea ice retreat adds about six watts per
meter squared but two thirds of the

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:18.690
heating that took place in that period
occurred in the 10 years between 01 and

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:25.780
11. Arctic is small but if you average
this over the globe you get 0.21 watts per

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.520
meter squared. Which is about a quarter of
the increase that you would have expected

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.770
from the increase in greenhouse gas at
that time. You have added a new warming

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:45.620
mechanism that the climate at least in
recent times was not used to. This is a

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:51.390
picture of the geography of heat transport
in the climate. I put it on even though

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:57.770
it's complicated. Just to remind you that
the basic circulation of the atmosphere as

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.780
understood from the time of Edmond Halley
was it was heavy and strong warming of the

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:10.460
ocean and land over the tropics. This heat
was then transported to the North. It was

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:16.110
a North-South circulation. A North pole,
North equator to pole circulation that's

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:22.200
the fundamental feature of our climate
transport. If you suddenly add a new

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.000
energy, new heating source at the poles,
particularly the Arctic. Won't you change

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.980
the circulation of heat in the atmosphere
and will this not in fact lead to states

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:45.240
like the El Niño? What we do know and this
is a question still under active

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:52.050
investigation. What we do know is that we
have created a 17 or 18 year persistent La

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.950
Niña-like state in the Pacific Ocean and
also similar outflow on the North

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:04.870
Atlantic, that is lasting longer than most
typical La Niñas. Lasted the whole period

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:10.550
of time. What this have had an effect on
the climate down below. Because when

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:18.310
you're in a La Niña state, you bend the
jet stream as you see. You've seen many

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:23.050
many pictures recently. Anytime you look
at the weather you'll see the jet stream

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:31.750
dipping deep into Central United States.
We've remained in the state of La Niña

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:39.110
like jet stream. The weather patterns then
correlate with this. The question is

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:46.690
global temperature has been constant. You
would expect then that there would be very

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:53.130
many fewer heat waves right? Or at least
the same number as before. This is not

00:18:53.130 --> 00:19:00.410
proven the case. Here's a remarkable data
analysis generated in Spain where they

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:07.280
were able to compile the mean Summer
temperature in Europe for the last 500

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:14.250
years since 1500. What you see is, 5 of
the 10 years in the 2010 were the hottest

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:21.090
years in the 2010 decade with the hottest
years on record. You also hear about this

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:27.150
unstable... You hear this bending La Niña
like jet stream. You hear about it in

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:34.850
other context because in the winter it
brings Arctic air to the South and is then

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:41.580
responsible for the large snow storms that
we've seen in the past. We also know that

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:47.770
the La Niña state implies a very dry
climate in California. Something that we

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:54.490
are presently observing. Here were the
questions. I phrased the hypothesis as a

00:19:54.490 --> 00:20:00.000
set of questions. Did the Arctic warming
associated with the super-El Niño which

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
pushed the ice over the edge? Did it
trigger a continuing ice retreat when

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.790
Winter re-growth could not make up for the
previous year's loss? Did Arctic warming,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:16.680
by altering the North-South heat flow...
Did it strengthen the Trade Winds, create

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.600
the La Niña bias and enable the persistent
ocean heat sequestration that we've been

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.720
seeing? Did it warming, by altering the
heat flow caused the observed pattern and

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.010
enhancement of extreme event occurrence?
Then finally, how long can this kind of

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:40.580
thing go on? Will the present dynamical,
quasi-equilibrium be maintained until the

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:47.471
energy added to the climate system from
ice and snow retreat stops? Thank you.
