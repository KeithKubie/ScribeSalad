00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.348
Based on a true story,
my heinie!

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:18.718
This year's Oscar movies
are riddled with inaccuracies.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.486
Am I the only one
with standards?

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.989
Is Brian Williams
writing all these scripts?

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.392
I wish Hollywood had
half the integrity of<i> Tosh.0.</i>

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.327
And when I found out
how easy it is

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.730
to get into these press junkets
if you have a TV show,

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.299
I decided to confront
some of the biggest celebrities

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:36.269
face-to-face about all the fibs
in their films.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.838
The thing is, you only get
2 minutes with each person.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.507 align:start position:0%
Okay, Angie, this movie
was a giant lie

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.775 align:start position:0%
from start to finish.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:43.810 align:end position:100%
You know,
I think that's--

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.545 align:start position:0%
You left out the part
where he shook hands

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.381 align:start position:0%
with Adolf Hitler
after the 1936 games.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start position:0%
And you kind of
glossed over the fact

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.052 align:start position:0%
that he was an alcoholic
who verbally abused his wife

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.388 align:start position:0%
and didn't find God
until right before he died.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.457
Why are you a terrible director?

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.625 align:end position:100%
Oh, 'cause
I don't have...

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start size:34% position:66%
that skill.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.994 align:start position:0%
We agree on something.

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:02.962 align:start position:0%
Next!

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.566 align:start position:0%
Huh.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.402 align:start position:0%
Took some casting
liberties, I see.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.471 size:78% position:39%
I'm curious why the movie
would leave out the fact

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.005 align:start position:0%
that your mom
was happily remarried.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:15.341
Um...

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.276 align:start position:0%
And there was basically
a whole community of people

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.544 align:start position:0%
hiking the PCT.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.047 align:start position:0%
You were seldom alone
on that trail.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.548 align:start position:0%
Liar!

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.683 align:start position:0%
Next!

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.718 align:end position:100%
Oh, Cumberbatch,
where do I begin?

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:26.886 align:start size:47% position:53%
He knew German,

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.754 align:end position:100%
he never called his
computer Christopher,

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.590 align:end position:100%
and he was openly gay
the whole time

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.924 align:end position:100%
and constantly
hit on dudes

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.126 align:end position:100%
whether they
were gay or not.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.861 align:start size:72% position:28%
Oh, and Keira Knightley

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.396 align:end position:100%
did not get a job by
solving a crossword puzzle.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.397 align:start size:31% position:69%
So stupid.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.532 align:start size:16% position:84%
Next!

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.336
[haltingly]
Very nice to meet you, Stephen.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.404 align:start size:53% position:47%
I'm just kidding.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.106 align:end position:100%
How come you
left out the part

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.308 align:end position:100%
where the sexy nurse you
cheated on your wife with

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.776 align:end position:100%
abused you
for over five years?

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:51.911 align:start size:9% position:91%
Oh!

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.746 align:end position:100%
And you told Jane
you had ALS

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.581 align:end position:100%
before you
started dating,

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:57.717 align:end position:100%
your friend Brian
never existed,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.352 align:end position:100%
and you're the one
who decided

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.354 align:end position:100%
to get the tracheotomy,
not Jane.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.422 align:end position:100%
Also, I noticed
one of your formulas

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.991 align:end position:100%
was wrong on the blackboard
in the movie.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:07.527 size:84% position:58%
You're being awfully quiet.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.296 align:start position:0%
I guess if you fist-[bleep]
me, we'll be even.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.464 align:start size:16% position:84%
Next!

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:12.698 align:start size:78% position:22%
Let's start with the fact

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.267 align:end position:100%
that the real wrestler
this movie's about

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.969 align:end position:100%
tweeted
"Hate it. Hate it. Hate it.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.038 align:end position:100%
"Hate it.
Sue me all you want.

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.275 align:end position:100%
My integrity is worth more
than this bull[bleep] story."

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.043 size:81% position:41%
Yeah, all of those things.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.279 align:start size:53% position:47%
Why did they make
your nose bigger?

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.713 align:end position:100%
The character
you were playing

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:29.482 align:end position:100%
had a smaller nose
than your real nose.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.851 align:end position:100%
The real mystery
is why they left out

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.986 align:end position:100%
how du Pont was a
paranoid schizophrenic

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.888 align:end position:100%
who searched for Nazis
on his property

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start size:63% position:38%
and talked to rocks.

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.691 align:start position:0%
[sighs]

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.426 align:start size:75% position:25%
What the [bleep], Steve?

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.827 align:start position:0%
Well, I--as you said,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.031 align:start position:0%
I think there
was an added element

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
of--what's the word
I'm looking for?

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.100 align:start size:41% position:59%
Horse[bleep]?

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:49.635 size:78% position:39%
That's probably it, yeah.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:50.636 align:start size:16% position:84%
Next!

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.737 align:start size:66% position:34%
Sure, for the record,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.573
Chris Kyle didn't kill Mustafa.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:54.907 size:84% position:58%
He heard other snipers did.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.908 align:start size:41% position:59%
Stolen valor.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.610 align:end position:100%
And I don't care
that he claims

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.513 align:end position:100%
he was perched on top
of the Superdome after Katrina

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:03.249
to gun down 30 black looters
in cold blood

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.118
or that they left out the fact
that Jesse "The Body" Ventura

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:08.921 align:end position:100%
successfully sued him
for $2 million

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.356 size:88% position:56%
for defamation of character.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start size:63% position:38%
He's a goddamn hero,

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.227 align:end position:100%
and if you don't
believe and support

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.595 align:start size:78% position:22%
every word of this movie,

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.964 align:end position:100%
you are a threat
to our national security

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.799 align:start size:50% position:50%
and a terrorist.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start size:75% position:25%
And for what it's worth,

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.835 align:end position:100%
I thought your performance
was breathtaking.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.573
I know we ignored<i> Selma, </i>
but so did the Oscars.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.141
And if you need more proof

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.110
that the Oscars
are completely out of touch,

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:34.981
there was not one nomination
for the real best film of 2014--

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.383
Yeah,<i> John Wick.</i>

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.051
Did you see it?

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:41.087
Watch it!

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.155
The guy's got
way more confirmed kills

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:44.257
than that American sniper.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.325
I dare you to call John Wick
a coward.

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:47.793
Shame on you, the Academy.

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:48.826
Shame.
