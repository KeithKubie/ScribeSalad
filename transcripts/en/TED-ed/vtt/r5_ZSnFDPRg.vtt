00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:13.703
This is a song sung by a brown thrasher.

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:17.764
But that’s just one of the thousand 
or more that it knows,

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:20.905
and it’s not the only avian virtuoso.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:26.282
A wood thrush can sing 
two pitches at once.

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:32.296
A mockingbird can match the sounds 
around it, including car alarms.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.195
And the Australian superb lyrebird

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:41.744
has an incredible, elaborate song 
and dance ritual.

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:46.524
These are just a few of 
the 4,000 species of songbirds.

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:50.344
Most birds produce short, simple calls,

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:54.665
but songbirds also have 
a repertoire of complex vocal patterns

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.335
that help them attract mates,

00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:57.675
defend territory,

00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:00.653
and strengthen their social bonds.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:04.724
Each songbird species 
has its own distinct song patterns,

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:08.085
some with characteristic 
regional dialects.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:14.524
Experienced listeners can even distinguish
individual birds by their unique songs.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:18.152
So how do birds learn these songs 
in the first place?

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:21.930
How do they know to mimic the songs 
of their own species?

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.076
Are they born knowing how to sing?

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:30.643
A lot of what scientists know about bird
song comes from studying zebra finches.

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:36.142
A baby male zebra finch typically learns 
to sing from its father or other males,

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:40.535
starting while it’s still 
a fledgling in the nest.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.165
First comes a sensory learning phase,

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:48.555
when the baby finch hears the songs
sung around it and commits them to memory.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:52.523
The bird starts to vocalize 
during the motor learning phase,

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:55.789
practicing until it can 
match the song it memorized.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.815
As the bird learns, hearing 
the tutor’s song over and over again

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.882
is helpful—
up to a point.

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:06.055
If he hears it too many times, the
imitation degrades—

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:07.675
and the source matters.

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:09.871
If the song is played 
through a loudspeaker,

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.039
he can’t pick it up as easily.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.942
But hide the same loudspeaker inside 
a toy painted to look like a zebra finch,

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:19.375
and his learning improves.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:23.005
What if the baby never hears another 
zebra finch’s song?

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:27.144
Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway.

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:32.174
Isolated finches still produce 
what are called innate or isolate songs.

00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:34.366
A specific tune might be taught,

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:39.524
but the instinct to sing seems
to be hardwired into a songbird’s brain.

00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:42.953
Innate songs sound different from
the “cultured” songs

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:46.064
learned from other finches—at first.

00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:48.714
If isolated zebra finches 
start a new colony,

00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:52.155
the young birds pick up 
the isolate song from their parents.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:55.083
But the song changes 
from generation to generation.

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:57.314
And after a few iterations,

00:02:57.314 --> 00:02:59.668
the melody actually starts to resemble

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:03.815
the cultured songs sung 
by zebra finches in the wild.

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:07.483
Something about the learning process 
must be hardwired, too,

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:11.933
drawing the birds towards the
same song patterns again and again.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:15.485
This means that basic information 
about the zebra finch song

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:18.374
must be stored somewhere 
in its genome,

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:21.785
imprinted there by millions 
of years of evolution.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.634
At first, this might seem odd,

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:29.164
as we usually think of genetic code as a
source of biochemical or physical traits,

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:31.844
not something like a behavior or action.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.345
But the two aren’t 
fundamentally different;

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.861
we can connect genomes to
behavior through brain circuitry.

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.643
The connection is noisy and quite complex.

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:46.364
It doesn’t simply map single genes 
to single behaviors, but it exists.

00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:50.353
Genomes contain codes for proteins 
that guide brain development,

00:03:50.353 --> 00:03:54.535
such as molecules that guide the pathways
of developing axons,

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.664
shaping distinct circuits.

00:03:56.664 --> 00:04:00.225
Birds’ brains 
have so-called “song circuits”

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:02.874
that are active when the birds sing.

00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:07.164
These circuits also respond to the song 
of a bird’s own species

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.134
more strongly than
to other species’ songs.

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:14.705
So the theory is that a bird’s genes 
guide development of brain circuits

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.385
that relate to singing 
and the ability to learn songs.

00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:21.925
Then, exposure to songs 
shapes those neural circuits

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:26.304
to produce the songs 
that are typical to that species.

00:04:26.304 --> 00:04:30.604
Genetically encoded or innate behaviors 
aren’t unique to songbirds.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.283
They’re widespread in the animal kingdom.

00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:34.994
Spectacular examples include

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:39.784
the long-distance migrations 
of monarch butterflies and salmon.

00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.884
So what does this mean for humans?

00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:45.672
Are we also born with innate 
information written into our genomes

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:48.115
that helps shape our neural circuits,

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:51.585
and ultimately results 
in something we know?

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:53.135
Could there be some knowledge

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:57.063
that is unique 
and intrinsic to humans as a species?
