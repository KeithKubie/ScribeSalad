00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.600
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can take

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.466
the indefinite integral of
cosine of X to the third power.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.433
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:12.267
and see if you can figure
this out on your own.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:18.066
You have given it a go and
you might have gotten stuck.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.533
Some of you all might have
been able to figure it out,

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.167
but some of you all
might have gotten stuck.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.433
You're like, "Okay,
cosine to the third power.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.667
"Well, gee, if I only had a
derivative of cosine here,

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.000
"if I had a negative sign
of X or a sin of X here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
"maybe I could've used U substitution,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.933
"but how do I take the anti-derivative

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.334
"of cosine of X to the third power?"

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.900
The key here is, is to use

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.466
some basic trigonometric identities.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.967
What do I mean by that?

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:45.967
We know that sin squared
X plus cosine squared X

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.067
is equal to one, or if
we subtract sin squared

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:57.067
from both sides, we know
that cosine squared X

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.600
is equal to one, write
it this way, is equal to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
one minus sin squared X.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.966
What would happen if
cosine to the third power,

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.700
that's cosine squared times cosine.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.233
What happens if we were to take

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:16.333
that cosine squared?

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.433
Let me just rewrite it.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:19.500
This is the same thing as cosine of X

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.500
times cosine squared of X, DX.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.266
What if we were to take this thing

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.133
right over here, let me
do that magenta color.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.467
What if we were to take
this right over here

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.367
and replace it with this.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:35.501
I now what you're thinking.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.167
"Sal, what's that going to do for me?

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:41.633
"This feels like I'm making this integral

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.733
"even more convoluted."

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.733
What I would tell you, I would say,

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:50.166
"This might seem like it's
getting more complicated,

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.866
"but as you explore and you play with it,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.467
"you'll see that this actually makes

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.466
"the integral more solvable."

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.966
Let's try it out.

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.900
If we do that, this is
going to be equal to

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:06.838
the indefinite integral,
cosine of X times one

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:13.906
minus sin squared X, DX.

00:02:14.437 --> 00:02:16.333
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.567
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:21.433
let me do this in that green color.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.566
This is going to be equal to

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:26.366
the indefinite integral of cosine X.

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm just going to
distribute the cosine of X.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Cosine of X minus, minus cosine of X,

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:40.834
cosign of X sin squared of X, sin squared,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100
sin squared X and then I can
close the parentheses, DX.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.800
This, of course, is going
to be equal to the integral

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500
of cosine of X, DX, and we know

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.433
what that's going to
be, minus the integral.

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:02.866
I'll switch to one color
now, of cosine of X,

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:07.866
sin squared X, sin squared X, DX.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.567
Now, this is where it gets interesting.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:15.200
This part right over here
is pretty straight forward.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.133
The anti-derivative of
cosine of X is just sin of X.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:20.100
This right over here is
going to be sin of X.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.800
I'll worry about the plus C at
the end because both of these

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.433
are going to have a
plus C, so might as well

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.233
just put one big plus c at the end.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.933
That's sin of X and then what do we have

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.000
going on over here?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.466
Well, you might recognize, I
have a function of sin of X.

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:37.433
I'm taking sin of X and I'm squaring it

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.933
and then I have sin of X's
derivative right over here.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:44.933
This fits the, I have some
derivative of a function

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:49.000
and then I have another and then I have a,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.866
I guess you could say, a
function of that function.

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:53.466
G of F of X.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.800
That's a sin that maybe U
substitution is in order,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.166
or we've seen the pattern,
we've seen this show

00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:02.133
multiple times already,
that you could just say,

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:05.966
"Okay, if I have a function of a function

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:07.767
"and I have that functions derivative,

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:09.433
"then essentially I can just
take the anti-derivative

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.166
"with respect to this function."

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:15.300
This would be equal to, say, capital G

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.600
is the anti-derivative of lower case G.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.300
Capital G of F of X plus C.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.633
Now, if what I said didn't
make sense, then we could do

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:26.000
U substitution and go through it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.233
a little bit more step by step.

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.666
Let's just do that because
we want things to make sense.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.100
That's the whole point of these videos.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.100
We could say U is equal
to sin of X and then DU

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:44.066
is going to be equal to cosine of X, DX.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:49.067
This part and that part is going to be DU

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:52.433
and then this is going to be U squared.

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:54.200
This is going to be minus.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.200
We have the integral of U squared, DU.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.501
What is this going to be?

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.800
This is going to be, we're
going to have negative U

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.600
to the third power over three.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.933
Then, we know what U is.

00:05:09.933 --> 00:05:13.166
The U is equal to sin of X.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:16.933
We have our sin of X
here for the first part

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:21.534
of the integral, for the first integral.

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:26.256
We have the sin of X and then
this is going to be minus.

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:27.600
Let me just write it this way.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.334
Minus 1/3 minus 1/3.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:34.133
Instead of U to the third,
we know U is sin of X.

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:38.367
Sin of X to the third power.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:43.367
Then now, we can throw that plus C there.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.166
We're done.

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:47.600
We've just evaluated
that indefinite integral.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.068
The key to it is to just
play around a little bit

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:54.433
with trigonometric identities
so that you can get

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:56.800
the integral to a point that you can use

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.567
the reverse chain rule or
you can use U substitution,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.966
which is just really another way

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:04.633
of expressing the reverse chain rule.
