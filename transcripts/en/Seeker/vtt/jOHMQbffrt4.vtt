00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.460
The Sun produces more energy than we can can
comprehend.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.240
Its core reaches a predicted temperature of
15 million degrees Celsius or roughly the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.860
same temperature as an exploding hydrogen
bomb.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the scorching section of the Sun where
nuclear fusion occurs.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.510
The process releases massive amounts of energy
which eventually makes its way into space.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.100
But just a fraction of that energy reaches
Earth.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.750
If we were to harness the total energy of
the Sun, humanity would jump to Type II on

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.040
the Kardashev Scale, which is a method of measuring a civilizations level of technological advancement.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.420
Right now, humanity isn’t even on the scale.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.220
So, we need to harvest far more of the Sun’s
energy if we want any shot at universal dominance

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.460
or even just long term survival.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.180
This idea stems back to the mid 1900s.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.550
In a thought experiment, Physicist Freeman
Dyson (no connection to the vacuum) popularized

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.380
the concept of a structure that could trap
100 percent of a star’s energy.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.800
Dyson claimed that advanced civilizations
or extraterrestrials might use massive structures

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.910
to capture the power of their host star.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.610
He said that looking for signs of these structures
would lead us to other lifeforms.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.180
This concept inspired what later became known
as a Dyson Sphere - a hypothetical megastructure

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.300
that would surround the Sun, soaking up its
light and converting it into useful energy.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.090
Today, there are a few different Dyson inspired
designs.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.490
The classic Dyson Shell, for instance, is
often portrayed in sci-fi works.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.980
The solid structure, the size of a planetary
orbit, contains solar habitats, each powered

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.780
by their host star’s light.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.380
But this megastructure would be impossible
for humanity to pull off due to the fact that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.820
the materials needed to build it don’t exist.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.800
On top of that, environmental and gravitational
stresses of the Sun would destroy the shell.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.860
Instead, some astro engineers believe a Dyson Swarm is the most practical design for our solar system.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.280
This concept would require the construction
of an army of advanced solar panels which

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.379
would orbit the Sun, capturing its light from
all directions.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.810
The solar panels would collect the Sun’s
radiation and continuously transmit the energy

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.920
wirelessly back to Earth.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.860
Still, futurists say building a Dyson Swarm
would require extreme measures like mining

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.200
Mercury for materials - eventually destroying
the planet.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.730
But if we manage to successfully create a
sun sucking megastructure, it will extend

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.960
humanity’s survival in the solar system
and provide the power needed to colonize other planets.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.540
Considering all the advanced technology needed
to make this happen though, it will be a very

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.600
long time until any sort of Dyson Sphere takes
the leap from science fiction to reality.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.040
But, like Freeman Dyson, some people believe that aliens might already be using Dyson Sphere-like structures.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.200
And they point to a mysterious dimming star
- known as Tabby's star - as potential evidence.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.280
Believers say that the dimming is a sign of
a structure surrounding the star.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.920
While many astronomers say that the dimming
is likely just caused by dust.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.510
But in the far-fetched chance that there is
an advanced civilization out there soaking

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.460
up all the energy in the universe,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.579
let’s just hope that they’ll use their power for good, not evil.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.200
Space Crafts takes you through the depths
of the cosmos, explaining bizarre astronomical

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.580
phenomena and crazy plans for future exploration.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.000
In this episode, we explore how sci-fi inspired spacecraft could clean up our space junk.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.320
