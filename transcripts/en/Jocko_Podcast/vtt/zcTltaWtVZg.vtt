1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.050
Jocko,
I should have asked it in muster zeros or six.
Is there a dichotomy,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.570
dichotomy in the unmitigated,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.980
unmitigated daily discipline in all things.
And like I said,

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.890
this is why I put this question here because it's related to the question,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.330
the answer that I just gave,
which is yes,
you can,
you can overdo it.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.320
And there is a dichotomy.
You can put so much focus on working.

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.060
Um,
you can put so much working,

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.230
so much focused on working that you lose track of your family and everything

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.360
goes down town with your family.
Or you can do the opposite.

10
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:38.250
Put so much focus on your family that you lose track of that you don't do what

11
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.860
you're supposed to do at work.
Um,
so you need to back off a little.
Uh,

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
and you get people that waste time on things that don't matter.

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.241
This goes back,

14
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:52.920
remember the podcast we did where I was talking about how like a black belt when

15
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.460
a white belts globbing grabbing a black belt sleeve and it just doesn't matter.

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.110
There's people that think that it's important that I do this thing this certain

17
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.910
way and the reality is it's useless.
It doesn't matter.
You're being OCD,

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.620
right?
You're being OCD.
So,
or are you maybe not being full of,

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.580
but you're being borderline.

20
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.770
You've got to think about what's important and what's not important.

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.090
And if your disc,

22
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.090
if you generally or oftentimes people that are hyper disciplined about little

23
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.054
things,

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.260
a lot of times they're missing their discipline in other areas of their life.

25
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:31.590
And one of them,
and you,
we've talked about this before too,

26
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.370
which is somebody that just because someone is hyper disciplined in their

27
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.640
physical fitness doesn't mean that they're disciplined in their rest of their

28
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.870
life in many other ways,
whether it's financial,
whether it's their relationships,

29
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:45.060
whatever,
like everything that they can be screwing every,

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.180
they're super disciplined in weighing their food and doing macro calorie

31
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.920
counting and all that stuff.
Right?

32
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.310
And yet they haven't paid their phone bill or whatever and they've got financial

33
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.340
issues or they've got health like other health issues.

34
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.150
And so you need to,

35
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:11.130
you need to back off enough on the little things that don't matter that so that

36
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.200
the things that matter you can actually take care of.
Now,

37
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.260
the weird dichotomy in this is again,
it's always comes up,

38
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
the Russian soldiers in the Chechen war,
not shaving.

39
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.540
Is it really important that they shave?
Not really,

40
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
but what's really important is that they have discipline overall and when they

41
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:34.170
stop shaving,
they,
they let go of their discipline and that was the problem.

42
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.640
Now,
so you're there.
There is about,
that's what I'm saying.

43
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.410
There's a balance and it gets,
well,
let,
let me,

44
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.700
let me make that a little more clearly.

45
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.150
If we were in a war and what I was focused on was echo,

46
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.300
you better shave tomorrow.
That was my big focus.
Echo your uniform.

47
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:56.160
Better be squared away tomorrow like that.
That is not what the most important,

48
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.540
the most important thing is like echo.

49
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.880
Do you understand where the fallback positions are?
Echo,

50
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.700
do you understand what your field of fire is?
Echo.

51
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.750
Do you know what you're supposed to do when we start getting overrun?

52
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.480
Those are what's important and,

53
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.420
but if I focus on this little thing that doesn't really matter,

54
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.300
that can,
that can be a problem.

55
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.770
So I need to make sure that I'm focused on the correct things and in life.
Yes,

56
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.100
you can.

57
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.370
Unmitigated Day with discipline if you try to apply it to absolutely everything

58
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.800
in your life,
just like prioritize and execute.

59
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.360
If you try and solve all your problems at the same time,

60
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.220
you want people to solve any,

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.390
if you try and implement perfect discipline in every single thing that you do,

62
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.540
you won't be able to apply discipline to the things that are most important.

63
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.110
My garage gym floor is dirty.

64
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.780
I sweep it.
Sure,
of course.
I sweep it every third day.

65
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:50.740
I just sweep it out.

66
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.330
But I don't get in there with a bucket and a mop and try and clean the chalk off

67
00:03:55.331 --> 00:04:00.100
so it's perfect black.
Why?
Cause it doesn't matter.

68
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.870
Yeah.
So some things in life are like your gym floor.
Yeah.
It just,

69
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.280
it doesn't matter if there's chalk on it,

70
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.460
I'm going to put more chocolate in it later.
The chalk doesn't make me slip.

71
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.390
It doesn't make me sick.
It doesn't.
It doesn't,
but I don't care how it looks.

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.630
So don't worry about the chocolate,
the gym floor.
In fact,

73
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.690
there's gyms in the world where you're not allowed to have chalk cause they

74
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:23.920
don't want chalk on the gym floor.
The those places shouldn't exist in the world.

75
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.580
They should be.
They should be illegal.
There should be chalk everywhere.
Yeah,

76
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.370
the gym available.
Yeah,
you're right.
So don't focus on things that don't matter.

77
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.740
There you go.
You didn't pan.
It's the,

78
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.920
it seems like the whole discipline equals freedom thing in whether you agree

79
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:42.010
with it or not.
Actually,
you know,
I think you will agree with this.
It's a dance.

80
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.980
You know,
it's the dance with discipline and freedom.

81
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.100
Do you mean about a balance of a dichotomy?
Yes it is.
In fact,

82
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.840
I wrote a book about the other.
Thank you.

83
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.480
I appreciate you pointing that out to me.
So,
and it's going to be,

84
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.830
should take ownership too.
It just depends on who you are.
Like you,

85
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.580
the discipline is going to be taking the lead big time,
you know?

86
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.960
And when you exercise your freedom with,
I don't know,
I don't know.

87
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.590
[inaudible] is like what?
Mint chocolate chip ice cream or something like this.

88
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.630
When you exercise that freedom,
it's not going to be very often,

89
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:11.650
but when you do boom,

90
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.680
it's going to have benefits and that's when you see somebody that's,

91
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.040
let's just talk about this.
Well,
when you see somebody that's out of shape,

92
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.860
you could say,
you could say one of two things.

93
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.010
You could say not enough discipline.
Right.
Or You could say too much freedom.

94
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.680
Freedom.
We know it's one of those two things.

95
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.160
If you see someone that's having financial issues,
it's one or two things.

96
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.500
Not enough discipline or too much freedom.

97
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.920
They're getting out that credit card when they shouldn't be.
Right.
So yeah,

98
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.670
that goes without saying that it's a balance.
It's dichotomy.
That's correct.
Yes.

99
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.400
Even and also on top of that,
the discipline in all things.

100
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.260
Cause that's the question right at maybe you could put,

101
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.890
maybe you could write a book called the dance.
The dance.
Sure.
Of leadership.

102
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.950
I'll just copy the dichotomies.
But the,

103
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.970
in all things like discipline in diet,
discipline in,
um,
uh,
you know,

104
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:04.190
workouts and not slacking and whatever.

105
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.750
And that looks way different than discipline in like relationships for example.

106
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.180
Like if you're like a diff like to,
to,
you know,

107
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:14.360
the discipline not to lose your temper or the discipline to,

108
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.250
to respond to a maybe not disciplined person or something.

109
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.540
Let's say someone you love who's,

110
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:23.240
who's maybe emotionally different than you or whatever that looks and feels way

111
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.560
different.
You know,
if,
if you really think about it.
So if you're like,
Hey,

112
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.570
I'm not gonna,
I don't know,

113
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.990
I'm not going to go to the park with my wife because I'm working out.

114
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.360
That's my discipline.
I'm no slack,
you know,

115
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.010
kind of lacking the discipline to organize around your relationship.
Exactly.

116
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.250
Right.

117
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.030
With your relationship or you're lacking the discipline to make sure that your

118
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.920
wife understands that you're going to train.
Yeah,
cause I don't want to train.

119
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.740
But as far as we're like,
and now that's back on the training in.

120
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:56.510
But like with like your relationships,

121
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.840
unless your relationships are important to you,
which is,
I mean I would,

122
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.730
I would argue most times.

123
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.740
So there's some relationships in your life that,
that are going to be important.

124
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.490
I would argue that there should be,
I think so too.
Yes.

125
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.850
So for maintaining discipline in those relationships looks different.

126
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:19.460
So it might not be as obvious.
So when someone says,
Ma unmetered,

127
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.430
when you say unmated gated discipline in all things,

128
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.240
I don't think automatically right off the top of my head.
Like,
Oh,
you know,

129
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.080
my relationship with my wife,
you know,
or even the relationship with your kids.

130
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:33.320
Like when I think unmitigated daily discipline in all things,
including my kids.

131
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.210
So I'm gonna,
I'm gonna make sure they're disciplined.
Oh.

132
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:40.190
But the discipline of your,
of yourself dealing with the kids,

133
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.470
that's a whole different thing.
Seems saying true.

134
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.070
So you've got gotta kind of keep those in my,
well,
I've found,
I've found herself.

135
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.270
Yeah.
I find that when I,
when I keep that in mind,
it'll help.
And then,
yeah,

136
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:51.290
and do the dance with freedom.

137
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.470
You designate how much freedom you are going to uh,

138
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.830
exercise and then you do the dense.
Seems Sane.

139
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.390
You balanced the dichotomies.
What she do.
Yeah.
Yeah Bro.

140
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.170
You dance it.
And here's the thing,

141
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.240
here's the wrong thing.
What I made a mistake of at one point long time ago,

142
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.220
I looked at you and I was like,
shoot,
I need to do that.
I need to wake up,

143
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.390
I need to like do all this stuff,
whatever.
But if,
if I were to do that,

144
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.410
I jumped myself up.

145
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.020
So I can't like you can't use like the next person as the standards as far as

146
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:31.160
the balance goes.
Like you have to designate your own balance.
Yeah.

147
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:33.860
Cause you have to modulate for your life.
Yeah.

148
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.710
Whatever brought people don't just automatically know that.

149
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.390
I know I didn't check,

150
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.210
figured it out into you getting up at four 30 at any point though.
Yeah.

151
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:45.950
I tried to
check anyway.
