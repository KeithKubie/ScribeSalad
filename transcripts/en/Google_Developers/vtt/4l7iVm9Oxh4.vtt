RANI PARUCHURI: Hi,
I am Rani Paruchuri,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.310
and this is my first
ever talk on camera.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.470
Thanks to Google for
this opportunity.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.010
I am not an engineer, but
architected software products.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.270
I am not a trained
insurance professional,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.710
but designed insurance systems.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.090
I had never been to business
school, but, as a CEO,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.830
I am running my
own company, which

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.230
I started eight years back.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.920
These are, in short,
my achievements.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.320
How did I get here?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.230
Let me tell you my
long story in short.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.430
My determination to
achieve something

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.180
had started by seeing
my uneducated mother go

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.020
through hardships due to the
sudden death of my father

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.890
when I was 11 years old.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.150
My education was
supported by my uncle,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.810
who admitted me in computer
science education in 1989.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.880
My love towards
computers started

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.530
when I saw output of my first
basic language program, which

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.489
was addition of two numbers.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.130
In fact, I copied the
program from my friend.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.910
At the age of 22, as a married
woman and a mother of a child,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.300
I started my first business for
desktop publishing, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.960
Computers, in my living room.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
My first owned
computer was 80286,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.460
whose speed is I can start the
system, clean my [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.920
and come back, it
would have booted up.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.640
I started my
business, but did not

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.260
have the required
skills for designing.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.390
I taught myself tools
like Pagemaker, CorelDraw,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.060
to design brochures, business
cards, books, et cetera.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.190
Learning any new technology
those days was a humongous

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.560
effort, only available sources
were books and help manuals.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.810
Unlike now, where we are
flooded with thousands

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.310
of videos, forums, even
with source code directly.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.400
I expanded my business from
DTP into IT training and taught

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.520
hundreds of students and
professionals in various

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.480
technologies, like COBOL,
Pascal, C, C++, Java, SQL,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
PeopleSoft, SCAP, and
the list continued.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.610
At the age of 33, I left
my secure job with Intel

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.010
to pursue my dream of building a
product-based software company,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.550
and started Dream Tekis
software with my brother

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.640
and other partners.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.640
I built my first product
with great passion

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.040
by putting all my
experience in place,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.770
but failed miserably
in marketing

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.740
it, as I depended on a
partner company for marketing.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.550
The future became uncertain,
but I never gave up,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.720
waited for the
opportunity, came to know

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650
that there is a need for
a good insurance system.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.980
But I was totally new
to insurance, other

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.570
than having a couple of policies
and paying the premiums only

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.230
due to the force of an agent.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.280
All the while, I taught
myself technologies,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.940
but for the first time, I
taught myself insurance domain

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.360
and designed world class life
insurance product, Soham Life.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.560
This time, I did not take
a chance with marketing.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.500
I traveled across the globe
and marketed my products.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.200
I was told by our
local partners they

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.780
had never come across a
woman tech CEO traveling

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.840
to Africa for business.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.120
Probably, I was the first one.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.420
In past eight years,
every Dream Tekis employee

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.650
have shared the same dream as
ours, and built Soham products.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.530
Today, Dream Tekis is trading
with international clients

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.380
from seven different countries
whose insurance business runs

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.450
on Soham systems.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.480
I'm proud and privileged
to build products

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.150
with the tag of "Made in India."

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.500
My dreams and
aspirations continue.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.020
So what got me here
is sheer determination

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.280
to achieve something in life.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.310
I would like to take
this opportunity

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.970
to tell all the women
out there, if you

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.490
are determined to achieve,
nothing can stop you.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.250
Neither marriage, nor
technology, or circumstances.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.650
Turn every adversity
into an opportunity,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.300
and never give up
until you succeed.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.360
Keep going.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.714
Thank you.

00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:37.431
