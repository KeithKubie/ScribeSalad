00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.766
&gt;&gt;Peter: For whatever
reason, kids come to us

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.146
with some significant
gaps in their math.

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:12.136
But more important, they come to
us with some poor math habits.

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.286
What we're using Khan for,
basically, is it's a way

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:15.976
of reengaging them in the math.

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:31.176
&gt;&gt;I'll leave that up there, use
that as your model if you need it.

00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:37.366
Go into Khan System
Elimination 0.5.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.786
If you do that easily,
if you finish that,

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:41.556
move onto the 
Elimination 1.0.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:44.266
&gt;&gt;These are primarily sophomores;

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.116
they've taken algebra
before and did not pass.

00:00:47.396 --> 00:00:50.906
We started out with some
relatively easy problems,

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:51.886
systems of elimination.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:52.906
This is 0.5.

00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:57.686
There's a model on the board for them
to sort of follow, talk to each other

00:00:57.686 --> 00:00:58.596
if they need a little bit of help,

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.076
ask me if they need
a little bit of help.

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:03.626
When they're in Khan, basically
a problem is presented

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:06.116
and they can choose to watch a video

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:09.766
or more often what they'll
do is choose to see hints.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.586
The hints are basically the steps.

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:15.086
It's not uncommon for a problem to
be broken down into five or seven

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:19.946
or eight steps with some brief
explanations about what each step is.

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes, so what
I did was take a hint.

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:26.786
So like, what it basically says,
"Beginning by moving the Y term

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.996
in the second equation to the
right side of the equation..."

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:30.986
&gt;&gt;David: And you can ask for a hint.

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:32.566
You can watch a video.

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.536
You can ask a peer.

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:38.086
So you've got three opportunities
to try and help yourself and then

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.656
after that, you raise your hands.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:44.146
The teacher is working with the
students that he or she needs

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:45.486
to be working with at that time.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.526
And other kids, for the most part,

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:49.486
are engaged in doing
what they're doing.

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:52.596
So it really changes the
dynamic between the teacher

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:54.796
and students in the classroom.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.316
&gt;&gt;Peter: And I can see where they're
proficient and where they're not.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:03.886
&gt;&gt;The teacher has access to something
called Coach Mode and it allows us

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.206
to go in and see a variety of things.

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.956
At a glance, I can see it for
the whole class, you know,

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:11.306
how many exercises they've completed,
who's progressed and who hasn't.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:13.756
And there's a variety of
other ways I can go in

00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:15.816
and get a quick assessment
of where students are.

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:19.936
&gt;&gt;If I want to pick a particular
exercise, I can go in here.

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:23.866
And see this student
has some difficulty;

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.686
watched the video,
took a number of hints.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.226
&gt;&gt;When I'm working with a student
one on one, I can go even deeper

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:32.566
and see the specific
problems they've tried.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.256
I can see the steps that they took.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.096
I can get some sense of
where they went wrong.

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.446
&gt;&gt;Student: I could
definitely do the work.

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:38.906
&gt;&gt;Peter: So here.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:39.896
So write down the problem.

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.676
&gt;&gt;Historically, it was really
hard to get the kids engaged.

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.576
They couldn't get the help
right when they wanted it.

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:48.166
There was no immediate feedback
if it was right or wrong.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:52.276
It was easy for them to sort of get
lost and just sort of drift in class.

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.766
Well, now they have to keep moving
because they know we're keeping track

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:56.916
of the problems they're
finishing and they want

00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:58.256
to see the progress bar move;

00:02:58.256 --> 00:03:01.246
they want to see themselves become
proficient in the exercises.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:02.026
&gt;&gt;Student: I hope I'm getting two Ys.

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:03.366
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yes, you plug it in the...

00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:03.866
&gt;&gt;Student: I know.

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:04.716
&gt;&gt;Peter: Trust me, you got it.

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:05.656
&gt;&gt;Student: I know.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:07.906
&gt;&gt;Peter: Previously, we had a hard
time getting the kids to do homework.

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:13.146
Well, now with Khan, it's a little bit
easier to get them to do that work.

00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.396
There's less wiggle room
for them to sort of back

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.296
out because they've got hints they
can take or videos they can watch

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.126
and you're measuring
the work they're doing.

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:20.886
Student: I kind of don't know this...

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:23.266
&gt;&gt;Peter: And they're doing
many more problems this year

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:24.176
than they did last year.

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:26.556
And there's no substitute
for practice.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:29.876
&gt;&gt;Student: And the good thing about
it is it tells us when we need

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.406
to review it and we could
go back and take hints again

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:35.286
or we can just keep on going.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:37.896
&gt;&gt;Peter: Their behavior,
their habits were changing.

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:40.686
We started to notice these
kids were staying engaged.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:45.716
We'd look at screens of our coaching
data and see kids repeatedly trying.

00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:48.306
Watch the video here;
he's taking some hints.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:52.276
They're taking ownership and they're
developing more of an attitude

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:53.486
of "I'm going to figure this out."

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:55.476
&gt;&gt;Move on to adding segments.

00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:57.076
I'll pull one of those
up shortly too, okay.

00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:59.496
&gt;&gt;But then what we started to
notice too was a real difference

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:00.156
in their test scores.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:05.036
The average score is up about 30
to 40 percentage points and many,

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.756
many more students in
the advanced range.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.496
&gt;&gt;Multiplied by negative two.

00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.426
&gt;&gt; What is it about Khan that works?

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.076
Part of it is the fact
that it's simply a computer

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:19.286
and there's something engaging
about anything on computers.

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:21.616
I think that it's an important
part that it's one on one,

00:04:22.126 --> 00:04:26.836
the fact that they can get help right
now on this problem at this step.

00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:31.076
So that immediacy, that
individuality is a big part of it.

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:34.816
But I think something about the
design of Khan in particular,

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:38.106
you know, it's not multiple choice
so you can't guess your way through.

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:40.976
The problems are randomly
generated so you can't copy

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:42.936
from another student; you
would have to do the work.

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.086
&gt;&gt;Student: I was doing
the top one here.

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:45.206
&gt;&gt;Peter: Okay.

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:46.666
&gt;&gt;Student: But then I did
the bottom one right there.

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:49.006
&gt;&gt;David: It shows us that
every single student,

00:04:49.316 --> 00:04:51.446
when given the chance,
wants to learn.

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:52.566
They want to be successful.

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:55.746
We're seeing students just turn
on, you know, left and right.

00:04:56.026 --> 00:04:57.126
&gt;&gt;Peter: We see more focus.

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.166
We see more attentiveness.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.256
We see more engagement.

00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:03.946
We see the kids this year less
apt to give up in the first couple

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:06.246
of seconds and the basic
skills are also better

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:08.436
because they've been
engaged, they've done the work

00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:10.776
and that's the real magic.
