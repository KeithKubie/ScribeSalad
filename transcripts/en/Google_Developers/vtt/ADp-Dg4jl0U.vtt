00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to "I/O Live."

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.210
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I'm standing here

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.400
with Nile and with Shaza.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.467
And they built an
app using TensorFlow.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.050
We're going to talk
about it a little.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.310
Nile, could you tell
me what the app is,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.040
and how you came
up with the idea?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.873
NILE RAVENELL: Sure.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.530
So the app is actually a
plant classification app.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.250
You basically take your camera
and hold it over a plant leaf.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.810
The app then tells you
what type of plant it is.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.500
It tells you if it's healthy
or if it has a disease,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.810
and what the disease is.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.460
And we actually came up
with it one day in lunch.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.090
So Shaza had been talking
about wanting to create an app.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.730
And we were
brainstorming some ideas.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.500
And I thought about
my mom, who has had

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.560
a huge passion for gardening.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.700
About a year ago,
we ended up moving.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.480
And so she had to transport
her garden from a big backyard

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.760
to a tiny little
patio on an apartment.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450
Thus, all of her
plants were dying.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.080
So we ended up making the
app and helping her garden

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.170
flourish.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.432
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:07.220
Now, Shaza, what
was it like getting

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.036
started with machine learning?

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:10.120
SHAZA MEHDI: Hi, Timothy.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.680
I got started with machine
learning through a TensorFlow

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320
Codelab called
TensorFlow for Poets.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.020
And I learned all about
how machine learning works

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.080
and how to use convolutional
neural networks

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.724
on your own dataset
using the Tentacle API.

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:25.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Did you
find that challenging?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.750
SHAZA MEHDI: It was
very challenging.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.000
It took me a long time to
learn because it was my very

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.700
first programming experience.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.780
But I ended up doing a
really amazing project.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, what's next?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.770
Do you have any
ideas for new apps?

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.120
NILE RAVENELL: Yeah.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.620
So I definitely
want to do something

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.450
that has to do with women
in third world countries.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.540
I have a really close friend who
is actually a national leader

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.400
in the organization Girl Up.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.000
And so their topic is
just dealing with women

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.232
in third world countries.

00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:53.690
So we're definitely working
together right now on something

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.901
to benefit that.

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.590
OK, one last question.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.120
Do you have any
advice for somebody

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.578
out there who's looking to get
started in machine learning,

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:03.110
or even just computer science?

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.040
SHAZA MEHDI: To
someone who's looking

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.480
to get started in
computer science,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.730
I would tell them that it's
a lot easier than you think.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.479
And there are a ton
of resources out there

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.270
if you want to learn
about machine learning

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.580
or artificial intelligence.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.810
Thank you so much.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.080
And thank you for joining us.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.314
This is "I/O Live."
