00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:02.142
 Try to stop the video 

00:00:02.142 --> 00:00:06.645
 to calculate how much is 71 plus 24. 

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:08.968
 Okay, let's do that together. 

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:13.216
 Let's think what it means. 

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:15.795
 We have 1 in the order of the units. 

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.188
 Let it become clear. 

00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:21.413
 This is the order of the units and we have one unit. 

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:23.921
 This is this one unit. 

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:27.544
 And then in the order of the dozen 

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.887
 we have 7, which means we have 7 groups of 10. 

00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:36.506
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 groups of 10. 

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:41.289
 Therefore, this actually means 7 tenths and one unit. 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.888
 Here they are - 71 squares. 

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:48.370
 We will now add 2 tens. 

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.716
 We will add 2 tens, 

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:51.854
 you see them here. 

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:55.848
 One tenth, two tenths and four units. 

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.984
 And 4 units. 

00:00:57.984 --> 00:00:59.934
 So how much is it? 

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:04.206
 Let's first look at the units. 

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.900
 We have one unit and another 4 units. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.268
 This makes 5 units. 

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.381
 This makes 5 units, 

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.937
 and we can count them here. 

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.980
 Here are 5 units. 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.625
 One unit plus 4 units is equal to 5 units. 

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.552
 Now look at the dozens - 

00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:22.782
 7 tenths plus 2 tenths. 

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.289
 Or if we unite all these groups, 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.936
 if we unite all these groups, 

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.867
 we will receive 9 groups of 10. 

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.980
 We'll have 9 tens. 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.811
 7 tens and 2 tenths equals 9 tens. 

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.832
 So there are nine decades left. 

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:42.291
 As we can see here, there are 5 units. 

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.288
 And 5 units. 

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.308
 And how else could we say 9 tens 

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:47.771
 and 5 units? 

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:52.830
 We say that this is the number 95 and we are ready.
