In a world full of crime, one man

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.940
is determined to kill Batman once
and for all, his name...is director

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.180
Joel Shumacher.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.040
VOICE (CONT'D)
Batman &amp; Robin.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.880
VOICE (CONT'D)
Watch Academy Award-winning ladies

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.960
man George Clooney phone it in as
Batman. A hero capable of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.180
performing impossible
feats...except for moving his

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.570
neck...or body

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.640
VOICE (CONT'D)
Unfortunately he's not alone. In a

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.510
film full of way too many
supporting characters, he's

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.640
bringing even more:

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.880
VOICE (CONT'D)
Robin! A naggy sidekick you AND

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.880
Batman will both want to punch in
the face!

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.170
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Alfred's British niece Batgirl.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.850
Who talks like Cher from Clueless.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.350
VOICE (CONT'D)
Together they'll all awkwardly wait

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.250
for this movie to be over.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.500

Witness Shumacher's creepy rubber fetish, as his camera lingers on...

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.450

Poison Ivy wants to cover the world

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.299
in plants...Mr. Freeze wants to
cover the world in ice...They'll

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.690
team up even though their goals are
completely incompatible...

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.799
VOICE (CONT'D)
To make the most puns ever!

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.600
VOICE (CONT'D)
And their bad puns are just the tip of the iceberg...

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.310
VOICE (CONT'D)
OK that one didn't even make sense.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.540
VOICE (CONT'D)
So if you loved Adam West's Batman,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.980
but wish it was even more campy,
less fun, and full of grappling

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.419
hooks latching onto things...

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:29.419

If you don't believe us,

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.480
just ask

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.480
the people who worked on it...
