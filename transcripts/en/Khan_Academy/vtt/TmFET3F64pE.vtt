00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.339
Let's go into a little more detail on

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.111
the Treaty of Versailles.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.400
We've already talked about it helping

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.888
to establish the League of Nations,

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:10.666
but particularly with regards to Germany,

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.689
the biggest aspect of it was

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.356
its application of war guilt,

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:15.418
essentially putting the full blame

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:17.081
of the war on Germany.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:18.906
Maybe you could justify it by saying

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.000
Germany was the most aggressive actor

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.316
at the beginning of the war

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:23.979
declaring war on Russia and France

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.645
without much provocation, but then

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:27.751
the counter-argument would be

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.213
Austria-Hungary had already
declared war on Serbia.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:31.407
Russia had already mobilized,

00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:33.272
but then the counter-counter-argument,

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:35.142
well Germany gave a
blank check to Austria,

00:00:35.142 --> 00:00:36.558
said it would back up Austria

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.608
no matter what Austria had done.

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:40.337
Needless to say, this applied a lot of,

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:42.151
the Germans were not happy about

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.144
being assigned the full
blame of war guilt.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.676
On top of that, we've already talked about

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:50.544
the notion that it really diminished

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:51.558
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:53.395
really forced the German military

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:56.069
to be diminished dramatically down to

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.494
100,000 troops, which is really now

00:00:58.494 --> 00:01:01.071
more of a glorified police force.

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.672
It was also forbidden from forming

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.402
a union with Austria.

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:08.157
You might say why Austria in particular?

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:11.410
Well, Austria is a German-speaking state.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.811
You could imagine there's a lot of

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:15.607
ethnic affinity or linguistic affinity

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:17.261
between Germany and Austria,

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.979
so this is not allowed according to

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.904
the Treaty of Versailles.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:24.603
On top of that, Germany
loses its colonies.

00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:27.256
These colonies we've already talked about.

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:28.239
These are colonies in Africa,

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:32.337
colonies in Asia and
colonies in the Pacific.

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:34.587
On top of that, we have the reparations.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:38.400
We have the reparations estimated at

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.158
the equivalent in 2013 terms of about

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.006
$450 billion US dollars.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.977
That doesn't get fully paid, but it still

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.209
has a huge toll on the German economy,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.144
especially because the reparations

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.742
were not just paid in currency,

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:54.407
they were paid in resources.

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:55.804
To make sure that they were paid in

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:58.681
resources, the allies actually occupied

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.725
the Saar region, the Saar
region right over here

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.540
which was coal rich, and for the next

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.503
15 years, it would ship coal to France.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.906
The allies weren't just getting paid in

00:02:10.906 --> 00:02:13.612
currency, they were
getting paid in dollars.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.153
This would also have the effect as

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:18.319
Weimar Germany, the Weimar Republic,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.611
this is the government of Germany after

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.674
World War I, called the
Weimar Republic because

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:27.403
its constitution was drafted
in the city of Weimar.

00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:29.201
In order to try to pay
the currency portions

00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.698
of the reparations, left
the printing presses

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:33.874
go free, tries to convert
into other currencies,

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:36.079
and then you essentially
have hyperinflation

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.000
in Germany through the early '20s,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.538
through 1923.

00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:41.668
On top of that, once this hyperinflation

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:43.670
happened and they no longer can pay

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.343
the reparations, then in order to continue

00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:50.404
to extract resources from Weimar Germany,

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.501
France goes ahead and occupies

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.326
the Ruhr region, which
is right about here.

00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:58.006
It's also very rich in steel and coal,

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.433
and they began shipping the resources out

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:04.668
which was another huge humiliation for

00:03:04.668 --> 00:03:06.492
the Germans and on top of that,

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.674
it's crippling the German economy.

00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:09.166
They're taking all of the main resources

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.533
out of the German economy.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.666
This happened in 1923 as well.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.074
The combined effect of
one, just the humiliation

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:19.339
of World War I, the
shipping away of resources,

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.741
now this occupation of the Ruhr region

00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:24.070
which was never even
part of the already bad

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.670
Treaty of Versailles, from
the German's point of view,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.013
this helped bring support for fairly

00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:31.933
more and more extreme parties in Germany.

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:34.340
As you go into the end of 1923,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.267
it gave some energy for
Hitler's, at the time

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:39.649
fairly small national
socialist or their Nazis,

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.006
to attempt a coup d'etat
of the government,

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.827
attempt their Beer Hall Putsch.

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:46.017
It ends up failing, but does give a lot of

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.202
energy to what was before a very

00:03:48.202 --> 00:03:51.073
marginalized, or very small party,

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:53.342
because of this occupation, it allows that

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.275
party to grow by a significant amount.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:57.825
On top of that, let's talk about the

00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:01.735
actual territorial losses,
all of the territorial losses.

00:04:01.735 --> 00:04:04.829
You have this little region up here,

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.087
the north part of east Prussia,

00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:08.656
at first becomes a French protector

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:09.951
according to the Treaty of Versailles,

00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:12.323
but it's later taken over by Lithuania.

00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:14.857
We've already talked
about this whole region

00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:18.507
of Germany, of the former German empire

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:20.911
that's carved away in order to give it

00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.160
to the new state of Poland.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.133
Most of Poland is carved out of the former

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.871
Russian empire, part is carved out of the

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:29.252
former German empire
and also part is carved

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:33.008
out of the former Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:34.824
Then you have this
region right here inside

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:36.569
[Lejon], part of it goes to Poland,

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.842
part of it goes to Czechoslovakia.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:43.162
You have the famous Alsace Lorraine region

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:45.339
right over here, had been a cause of

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.599
contention between Germany and France

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.410
for many, many, many years.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.684
Now this goes back to France.

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:52.936
You have a little piece right over here

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:54.824
that goes to Belgium,

00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:57.584
and then you have the north [slushig]

00:04:57.584 --> 00:04:59.816
region, goes to Denmark.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.940
On top of that, as you can imagine,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.765
the diminished troops,

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.597
the taking resources away,

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.927
France really wanted to cripple Germany's

00:05:07.927 --> 00:05:09.811
ability to be able to invade

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:11.685
at any future point in time,

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:13.464
but on top of that, they also set up

00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:16.678
a demilitarized zone in the Rhineland.

00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:19.008
The Rhineland is included both ...

00:05:19.008 --> 00:05:23.798
The demilitarized zone included the

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:26.133
west bank of the Rhine River,

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.174
all of Germany that was west

00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:29.171
of the Rhine River, so this entire region

00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:31.331
right over here, and
then it was also occupied

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.330
by the allies.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.140
Germany was also forbidden from

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.902
militarizing or mobilizing troops

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:42.148
anywhere 50 km east of the Rhine River.

00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:45.403
East of the Rhine River as well.

00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:46.465
So, you see going out of

00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:48.202
Treaty of Versailles, every attempt

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:52.707
was made to attempt to cripple

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:54.955
Germany's war-making abilities.

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.049
They were forbidden from trading in arms

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:59.523
and they couldn't have a lot of

00:05:59.523 --> 00:06:00.989
many types of offensive weapons.

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:03.780
It really was to try to prevent Germany

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.119
from being able to do what they did

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.987
in World War I.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:07.460
As we see, in a large degree,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.726
it really was maybe a catalyst

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:11.462
for giving energy to more extreme

00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:13.251
elements in Germany and would be one

00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.105
of the things pointing to for Germany's

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:19.033
involvement in World War II.
