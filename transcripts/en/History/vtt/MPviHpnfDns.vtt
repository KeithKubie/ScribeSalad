NARRATOR: May 4th, 2015.

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:11.553
A tourist visiting the ancient
pyramid complex of Teotihuacan

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:16.516
takes a photograph featuring
the Pyramid of the Sun.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.727
He thinks nothing of
it, until he later

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:22.397
reviews the photo and
notices two strange objects

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:23.565
hovering over the pyramid.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:30.488
Upon closer examination,
they appear to be

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:34.200
silver, disk-shaped craft.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.870
What's strange about
the two UFOs photographed

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.622
above the Pyramid of
the Sun at Teotihuacan

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:45.211
is that only 10 seconds later,
a second photograph was taken,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.340
and those two objects were gone.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.178
So clearly we are not talking
about Mylar balloons here.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.346
There is nothing floating
in the sky anymore,

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.141
and if they would have
been Mylar balloons,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:04.898
well, they don't move that
fast to just disappear.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:09.027
There has been a long
history of UFO sightings

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:13.031
and unusual events
in Teotihuacan,

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.533
particularly around
the pyramids,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.952
which perhaps are
somehow attracting

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.079
UFOs and extraterrestrials.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.295
NARRATOR: Is there more
going on at Teotihuacan

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.588
than archaeologists realize?

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:34.844
Could there be secrets about
our extraterrestrial past

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:40.183
left for us to discover
at this ancient city?

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:45.563
At Teotihuacan, so far
only 10% has been excavated.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:49.943
That means there's 90%
that remains to be dug up.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.655
How much more is
there at the site?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.199
We have no idea,
but we have to ask,

00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:01.162
if we continue and press on,
might we find the artifacts,

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.457
the components, to start
to put the pieces together,

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:08.837
and perhaps lead us to a
much clearer concept of who

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.257
these beings were
who built this.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.883
DAVID CHILDRESS: We don't
know what they will find

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:16.177
in the future, but I
suspect they'll make

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.638
some startling discoveries.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:23.518
There's many things in our past
that we just don't understand,

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.645
but it's possible
that the answers--

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.646
some of them-- are
at Teotihuacan.
