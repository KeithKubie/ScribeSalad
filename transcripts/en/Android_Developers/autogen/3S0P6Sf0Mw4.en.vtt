device fragmentation on Android but what

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
device fragmentation on Android but what
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.100
device fragmentation on Android but what
I want to stress here is that this is

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110
I want to stress here is that this is
 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.160
I want to stress here is that this is
all still Android and by following the

obviously more targeted things you can

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190
obviously more targeted things you can
 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.310
obviously more targeted things you can
do for specific devices and form factors

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.230
do for specific devices and form factors
but today I'm just gonna focus on the

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240
but today I'm just gonna focus on the
 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.490
but today I'm just gonna focus on the
stuff in the middle there the best

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500
stuff in the middle there the best
 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.930
stuff in the middle there the best
practices they're gonna give you the

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940
practices they're gonna give you the
 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.510

which device your players are gonna be

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230
which device your players are gonna be
 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.290
which device your players are gonna be
playing on and you know you can do this

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300
playing on and you know you can do this
 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.250
playing on and you know you can do this
all with one apk and it's possible you

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:38.260
all with one apk and it's possible you
 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.900
all with one apk and it's possible you
don't have to do multiple apks you don't

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:39.910
don't have to do multiple apks you don't
 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.400
don't have to do multiple apks you don't
have to try to fit everything into one

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410
have to try to fit everything into one
 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.770
have to try to fit everything into one
apk and stay underneath some size limit

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780
apk and stay underneath some size limit
 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.620
apk and stay underneath some size limit
this is all possible with one apk and it

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.630
this is all possible with one apk and it
 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.180
this is all possible with one apk and it
starts with kind of changing your

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.190
starts with kind of changing your
 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.580
starts with kind of changing your
mindset you know I get it you're in

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590
mindset you know I get it you're in
 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.560
mindset you know I get it you're in
development there's features that cap

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.570
development there's features that cap
 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.120
development there's features that cap
the ship deadlines they have to be hit

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.130
the ship deadlines they have to be hit
 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.340
the ship deadlines they have to be hit
patches they have to be pushed and it's

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:56.350
patches they have to be pushed and it's
 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.810
patches they have to be pushed and it's
very easy for developers to kind of

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:57.820
very easy for developers to kind of
 

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.730
very easy for developers to kind of
start thinking about devices you know

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740
start thinking about devices you know
 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.650
start thinking about devices you know
I've got to fix I've got to fix this bug

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:01.660
I've got to fix I've got to fix this bug
 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.150
I've got to fix I've got to fix this bug
for these devices I've got to improve

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.160
for these devices I've got to improve
 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.580
for these devices I've got to improve
performance for these devices but you

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.590
performance for these devices but you
 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.650
performance for these devices but you
know as engineers we're kind of taught

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:07.660
know as engineers we're kind of taught
 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.020

to be adaptive and anticipate changes

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.030
to be adaptive and anticipate changes
 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.580
to be adaptive and anticipate changes
and make sure we handle a wide variety

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:11.590
and make sure we handle a wide variety
 

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.650
and make sure we handle a wide variety
of scenarios so I realize in the

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:13.660
of scenarios so I realize in the
 

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.540
of scenarios so I realize in the
fast-paced of game development you know

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:15.550
fast-paced of game development you know
 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.860
fast-paced of game development you know
it could be very hard to think about

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:16.870
it could be very hard to think about
 

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.159
it could be very hard to think about
that but for supporting all these

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:20.169
that but for supporting all these
 

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:21.720
that but for supporting all these
devices the key thing I want to stress

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:21.730
devices the key thing I want to stress
 

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.450
devices the key thing I want to stress
is to anticipate changes and be adaptive

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:24.460
is to anticipate changes and be adaptive
 

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.720
is to anticipate changes and be adaptive
and for example you know you might

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:27.730
and for example you know you might
 

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.250
and for example you know you might
change your assumptions that you're not

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.260
change your assumptions that you're not
 

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.130

might have a gyro available for input
and you might be playing on something

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:50.530
and you might be playing on something
 

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.350
and you might be playing on something
from a low-end phone all the way up to a

important to kind of get rid of the

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:00.910
important to kind of get rid of the
 

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.970
important to kind of get rid of the

luckily in Android if you're not aware
 

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.730
luckily in Android if you're not aware
there's this concept of configuration

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:17.740
there's this concept of configuration
 

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.430
there's this concept of configuration

Android tells your your game and your

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480
Android tells your your game and your
 

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.140
Android tells your your game and your
activity about things that have changed

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.150
activity about things that have changed
 

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.880
activity about things that have changed
with the environment you're running in

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:26.890
with the environment you're running in
 

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.310
with the environment you're running in
and that you might care about and adapt

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320
and that you might care about and adapt
 

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.050
and that you might care about and adapt
to so there's lots of different

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.060
to so there's lots of different
 

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.670
to so there's lots of different
configuration change events that are

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680
configuration change events that are
 

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.050
configuration change events that are
getting thrown around in Android when

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.060
getting thrown around in Android when
 

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.360
getting thrown around in Android when
things happens for example if a keyboard

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.370
things happens for example if a keyboard
 

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.460
things happens for example if a keyboard
gets attached or detached if the

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.470
gets attached or detached if the
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.770
gets attached or detached if the
orientation of the screen changes or

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:40.780
orientation of the screen changes or
 

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.080
orientation of the screen changes or
maybe the screen size resolution changes

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.090
maybe the screen size resolution changes
 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.490
maybe the screen size resolution changes
as well and so by default what's gonna

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:47.500
as well and so by default what's gonna
 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.110
as well and so by default what's gonna
happen is the Android OS is sitting

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120
happen is the Android OS is sitting
 

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.520
happen is the Android OS is sitting
there and it's listening for any of

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:50.530
there and it's listening for any of
 

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.350
there and it's listening for any of
these configuration changes and what it

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360
these configuration changes and what it
 

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.900
these configuration changes and what it
does by default is it'll ask you to

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:54.910
does by default is it'll ask you to
 

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.700
does by default is it'll ask you to
maybe save your game State it'll give

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:56.710
maybe save your game State it'll give
 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.920
maybe save your game State it'll give
you some method to kind of save custom

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:58.930
you some method to kind of save custom
 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.810
you some method to kind of save custom
data it's gonna restart your activity

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:00.820
data it's gonna restart your activity
 

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.760
data it's gonna restart your activity
and then it's gonna restart it and give

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:02.770
and then it's gonna restart it and give
 

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.560
and then it's gonna restart it and give
you back the data that you've saved to

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.570
you back the data that you've saved to
 

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.360
you back the data that you've saved to
try to re intense and and go back to

resource heavy applications and

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.650
resource heavy applications and
 

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.770
resource heavy applications and
especially games we do not recommend

especially games we do not recommend
 

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.020
especially games we do not recommend
that you let the Android OS do this for

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.030
that you let the Android OS do this for
 

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.740
that you let the Android OS do this for
you because in some cases you can get

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:19.750
you because in some cases you can get
 

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.050
you because in some cases you can get
lots of configuration change events even

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.060
lots of configuration change events even
 

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.120
lots of configuration change events even
across a couple of different frames so

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.130
across a couple of different frames so
 

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.030
across a couple of different frames so
for resource heavy games restarting the

for resource heavy games restarting the
 

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.530
for resource heavy games restarting the
activity and reallocating all your

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:28.540
activity and reallocating all your
 

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.180
activity and reallocating all your
resources is gonna slow down the system

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.190
resources is gonna slow down the system
 

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.370
resources is gonna slow down the system
it's gonna slow it on your game and it's

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:32.380
it's gonna slow it on your game and it's
 

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.600
it's gonna slow it on your game and it's
not going to give that seamless

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:33.610
not going to give that seamless
 

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.970
not going to give that seamless
experience that you want when players

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:35.980
experience that you want when players
 

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.810

are switching between different

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:36.820
are switching between different
 

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.870
are switching between different
configurations so there's another way in

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880
configurations so there's another way in
 

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.040
configurations so there's another way in
which you can handle configuration

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.050
which you can handle configuration
 

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.260
which you can handle configuration
changes and that's through handling them

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.270
changes and that's through handling them
 

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.660
changes and that's through handling them
yourself in your code so in your

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:45.670
yourself in your code so in your
 

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.370
yourself in your code so in your
manifest you can simply declare all

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:47.380
manifest you can simply declare all
 

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.230
manifest you can simply declare all
these different configuration changes

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240
these different configuration changes
 

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.700
these different configuration changes
that you want to handle yourself and

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:50.710
that you want to handle yourself and
 

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.000
that you want to handle yourself and
then in your activity it's going to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.010
then in your activity it's going to
 

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.830
then in your activity it's going to
instead of restarting your activity it's

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:55.840
instead of restarting your activity it's
 

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.960
instead of restarting your activity it's
going to invoke on configuration changed

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:57.970
going to invoke on configuration changed
 

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.400
going to invoke on configuration changed
and it's going to give you the new

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.410
and it's going to give you the new
 

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.230
and it's going to give you the new
configuration that you're running in so

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240
configuration that you're running in so
 

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.970
configuration that you're running in so
now you can do things like scale your UI

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:02.980
now you can do things like scale your UI
 

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.250
now you can do things like scale your UI
or your OpenGL content to match the new

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.260
or your OpenGL content to match the new
 

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.380
or your OpenGL content to match the new
resolution you can't argue your control

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.390
resolution you can't argue your control
 

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.180
resolution you can't argue your control
scheme to adapt to some

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:09.190
scheme to adapt to some
 

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.830
scheme to adapt to some
input device that was attached or

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:10.840
input device that was attached or
 

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.170
input device that was attached or
detached etc etc and so there's lots of

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.180
detached etc etc and so there's lots of
 

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.210
detached etc etc and so there's lots of
different configuration changes that you

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.220
different configuration changes that you
 

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.250
different configuration changes that you
can listen for but what I've done is

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.260
can listen for but what I've done is
 

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.170
can listen for but what I've done is
I've kind of boil it down into three key

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.180
I've kind of boil it down into three key
 

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.570
I've kind of boil it down into three key
areas that I you guys should be thinking

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.580
areas that I you guys should be thinking
 

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.580
areas that I you guys should be thinking
about and kind of looking at when it

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.590
about and kind of looking at when it
 

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.380
about and kind of looking at when it
comes to handling these different types

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.390
comes to handling these different types
 

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.330
comes to handling these different types
of configuration changes and they are

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.340
of configuration changes and they are
 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.760
of configuration changes and they are
screen considerations input

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:32.770
screen considerations input
 

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.980
screen considerations input
considerations and kind of how to build

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:34.990
considerations and kind of how to build
 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.170
considerations and kind of how to build
your apk and set it up in a way that

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.180
your apk and set it up in a way that
 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.660
your apk and set it up in a way that
it's going to be very adaptable across

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:39.670
it's going to be very adaptable across
 

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.510
it's going to be very adaptable across
all these different devices now

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:44.520
all these different devices now
 

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.770
all these different devices now
different devices mean that there are

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:46.780
different devices mean that there are
 

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.840
different devices mean that there are
certain configuration changes that will

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:48.850
certain configuration changes that will
 

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.580
certain configuration changes that will
happen more often or may be more

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:50.590
happen more often or may be more
 

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.210
happen more often or may be more
important to handle and be aware of but

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.220
important to handle and be aware of but
 

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.680
important to handle and be aware of but
again for the greatest baseline

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:55.690
again for the greatest baseline
 

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.930
again for the greatest baseline
compatibility which is what we suggest

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:57.940
compatibility which is what we suggest
 

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.670
compatibility which is what we suggest
everybody goes for you're gonna have to

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680
everybody goes for you're gonna have to
 

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.570
everybody goes for you're gonna have to
kind of look at all of them so that's a

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:03.580
kind of look at all of them so that's a
 

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.250
kind of look at all of them so that's a
quick overview on configuration changes

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.260
quick overview on configuration changes
 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.500
quick overview on configuration changes
now let's kind of jump into what are

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:07.510
now let's kind of jump into what are
 

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.240
now let's kind of jump into what are
some of the things considerations you

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.250
some of the things considerations you
 

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.620
some of the things considerations you
have around dealing with screen

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:10.630
have around dealing with screen
 

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.570
have around dealing with screen
configuration changes while you're

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:12.580
configuration changes while you're
 

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.430
configuration changes while you're
building out your game so you've got a

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440
building out your game so you've got a
 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.530
building out your game so you've got a
game and on devices like Chromebooks and

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:19.540
game and on devices like Chromebooks and
 

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.720
game and on devices like Chromebooks and
Samsung decks by default your game is

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:21.730
Samsung decks by default your game is
 

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.950
Samsung decks by default your game is
gonna be launched in a windowed

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:22.960
gonna be launched in a windowed
 

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.320
gonna be launched in a windowed
environment so this means that you have

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.330
environment so this means that you have
 

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.790
environment so this means that you have
a game window it can be dynamically

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800
a game window it can be dynamically
 

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.010
a game window it can be dynamically
resize to different aspect ratios and

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.020
resize to different aspect ratios and
 

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.880
resize to different aspect ratios and
resolutions and this is by default so

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:32.890
resolutions and this is by default so
 

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.080
resolutions and this is by default so
this is much different than what you'd

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.090
this is much different than what you'd
 

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.940
this is much different than what you'd
expect happening on a mobile device when

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:35.950
expect happening on a mobile device when
 

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.730
expect happening on a mobile device when
your game gets launched and now coming

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:38.740
your game gets launched and now coming
 

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.890
your game gets launched and now coming
soon on devices like foldables you've

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:40.900
soon on devices like foldables you've
 

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.170
soon on devices like foldables you've
actually got a much different aspect

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:43.180
actually got a much different aspect
 

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.000
actually got a much different aspect
ratio on the outer screen and when you

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.010
ratio on the outer screen and when you
 

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.250
ratio on the outer screen and when you
open up the player can open up the game

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:47.260
open up the player can open up the game
 

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.230
open up the player can open up the game
or the foldable at any point in time and

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240
or the foldable at any point in time and
 

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.850
or the foldable at any point in time and
your resolution and aspect race you're

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:50.860
your resolution and aspect race you're
 

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.620
your resolution and aspect race you're
gonna change yet again so you guys have

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:52.630
gonna change yet again so you guys have
 

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.890
gonna change yet again so you guys have
to be set up to handle that now each one

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:55.900
to be set up to handle that now each one
 

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.750
to be set up to handle that now each one
of these cases as I said is going to

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760
of these cases as I said is going to
 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.550
of these cases as I said is going to
fire off a non configuration changed

00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560
fire off a non configuration changed
 

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.880
fire off a non configuration changed
event so again the key all comes back to

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:02.890
event so again the key all comes back to
 

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.100
event so again the key all comes back to
handle these configuration changes and

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.110
handle these configuration changes and
 

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.660
handle these configuration changes and
make sure that your game is set up to do

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:06.670
make sure that your game is set up to do
 

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.180
make sure that your game is set up to do
so so in this example I've set up that I

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.190
so so in this example I've set up that I
 

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.620
so so in this example I've set up that I
want to handle screen size and

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.630
want to handle screen size and
 

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.570
want to handle screen size and
orientation configuration changes so now

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:15.580
orientation configuration changes so now
 

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.540
orientation configuration changes so now
if somebody's playing my game and either

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:18.550
if somebody's playing my game and either
 

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.850
if somebody's playing my game and either
one of those events happens I'm gonna

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:20.860
one of those events happens I'm gonna
 

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.590
one of those events happens I'm gonna
get a callback to my aunt

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600
get a callback to my aunt
 

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.720
get a callback to my aunt
configuration changed and now I can

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:24.730
configuration changed and now I can
 

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.480
configuration changed and now I can
scale my UI to matchin resolution I can

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.490
scale my UI to matchin resolution I can
 

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.780
scale my UI to matchin resolution I can
adjust my orientation I can adjust my

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:30.790
adjust my orientation I can adjust my
 

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.210
adjust my orientation I can adjust my
input areas because if your screen

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:33.220
input areas because if your screen
 

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.639
input areas because if your screen
resolution changes now your touch input

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:35.649
resolution changes now your touch input
 

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.999
resolution changes now your touch input
areas are gonna change as well so it's a

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:39.009
areas are gonna change as well so it's a
 

00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:40.530
areas are gonna change as well so it's a
pretty powerful function to be able to

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:40.540
pretty powerful function to be able to
 

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.360
pretty powerful function to be able to
do whatever you need to do that suits

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.370
do whatever you need to do that suits
 

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.519
do whatever you need to do that suits
your game and how you've built it to be

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:44.529
your game and how you've built it to be
 

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:45.930
your game and how you've built it to be
able to handle all these different

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:45.940
able to handle all these different
 

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.819
able to handle all these different
things that might be happening at any

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:47.829
things that might be happening at any
 

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:54.240
things that might be happening at any
point during gameplay now if your game

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.250
point during gameplay now if your game
 

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.430
point during gameplay now if your game
is always intended to be run in

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440
is always intended to be run in
 

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.650
is always intended to be run in
full-screen which for a lot of mobile

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:58.660
full-screen which for a lot of mobile
 

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.780
full-screen which for a lot of mobile
developers and Android developers they

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:00.790
developers and Android developers they
 

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.199
developers and Android developers they
expect this there is a way to lock your

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:04.209
expect this there is a way to lock your
 

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:06.030
expect this there is a way to lock your
game to full screen so in your manifest

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040
game to full screen so in your manifest
 

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.949
game to full screen so in your manifest
you can just simply declare resizable

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959
you can just simply declare resizable
 

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:10.199
you can just simply declare resizable
activity equals false and this will by

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:10.209
activity equals false and this will by
 

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:11.670
activity equals false and this will by
default launch your game in a

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680
default launch your game in a
 

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.550
default launch your game in a

at all however we don't recommend that

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:17.139
at all however we don't recommend that
 

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:18.240
at all however we don't recommend that
you do this

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.250
you do this
 

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.759
you do this
only as a last resort or if you're

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:20.769
only as a last resort or if you're
 

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:21.960
only as a last resort or if you're
trying to fix some bugs in the meantime

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:21.970
trying to fix some bugs in the meantime
 

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.990
trying to fix some bugs in the meantime
because what it does is it limits the

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000
because what it does is it limits the
 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.240
because what it does is it limits the
user experience on these windowed kind

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.250
user experience on these windowed kind
 

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.340
user experience on these windowed kind
of environments so for example now they

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.350
of environments so for example now they
 

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.259
of environments so for example now they
can't have like a chat application open

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:31.269
can't have like a chat application open
 

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:33.079
can't have like a chat application open
or YouTube or something like that and

or YouTube or something like that and
 

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:36.449
or YouTube or something like that and
actually on mobile devices as well it

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:36.459
actually on mobile devices as well it
 

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.519
actually on mobile devices as well it
prevents it from running in split split

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:38.529
prevents it from running in split split
 

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:41.579
prevents it from running in split split

foldables this becomes even more of a

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279
foldables this becomes even more of a
 

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:48.389
foldables this becomes even more of a
limitation for the user if you don't

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399
limitation for the user if you don't
 

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.699
limitation for the user if you don't
allow your game to run or to be the

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:50.709
allow your game to run or to be the
 

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:56.490
allow your game to run or to be the
resizable orientation so you should be

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:56.500
resizable orientation so you should be
 

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.429
resizable orientation so you should be
thinking about the default orientation

00:14:59.429 --> 00:14:59.439
thinking about the default orientation
 

00:14:59.439 --> 00:15:02.249
thinking about the default orientation
of the device you're running on so on

00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:02.259
of the device you're running on so on
 

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.590
of the device you're running on so on
phones it's portrait but many other

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600
phones it's portrait but many other
 

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.110
phones it's portrait but many other
devices it's not its landscape and

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120
devices it's not its landscape and
 

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.030
devices it's not its landscape and
actually a lot of these devices now

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040
actually a lot of these devices now
 

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.939
actually a lot of these devices now
we're seeing our convertibles so a pixel

00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:11.949
we're seeing our convertibles so a pixel
 

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:13.230
we're seeing our convertibles so a pixel
books and other Chromebooks are a great

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240
books and other Chromebooks are a great
 

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.059
books and other Chromebooks are a great
example where they can switch from a

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:15.069
example where they can switch from a
 

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:17.720
example where they can switch from a
clamshell landscape orientation to now

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:17.730
clamshell landscape orientation to now
 

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.900
clamshell landscape orientation to now
portrait tablet mode so it's really

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:21.910
portrait tablet mode so it's really
 

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.400
portrait tablet mode so it's really
important to make sure that you if you

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.410
important to make sure that you if you
 

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.769
important to make sure that you if you
haven't already specify the sensor

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:25.779
haven't already specify the sensor
 

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.230
haven't already specify the sensor
orientations at your game supports and

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240
orientations at your game supports and
 

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.059
orientations at your game supports and
so what this is gonna do is it's gonna

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:30.069
so what this is gonna do is it's gonna
 

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:32.670
so what this is gonna do is it's gonna
tell the OS what orientations your game

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680
tell the OS what orientations your game
 

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.740
tell the OS what orientations your game
runs in and you won't get into weird

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.750
runs in and you won't get into weird
 

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.150
runs in and you won't get into weird
situations where

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160
situations where
 

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.710
situations where
if somebody flips the device into a

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720
if somebody flips the device into a
 

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.720
if somebody flips the device into a
different orientation your game flips

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:39.730
different orientation your game flips
 

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.880
different orientation your game flips
upside down or it gets into some weird

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:41.890
upside down or it gets into some weird
 

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.520
upside down or it gets into some weird
orientation change loop and if you're

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:44.530
orientation change loop and if you're
 

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.290
orientation change loop and if you're
handling it in code make sure using

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:46.300
handling it in code make sure using
 

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.330
handling it in code make sure using
displayed I get rotation as this is

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:48.340
displayed I get rotation as this is
 

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.490
displayed I get rotation as this is
gonna get you the actual rotation of the

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:50.500
gonna get you the actual rotation of the
 

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.670
gonna get you the actual rotation of the
device but be aware that the rotation

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680
device but be aware that the rotation
 

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.860
device but be aware that the rotation
might be swapped the default values

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:55.870
might be swapped the default values
 

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.290
might be swapped the default values
depending on what the default hardware

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:58.300
depending on what the default hardware
 

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.600
depending on what the default hardware
orientation is so just be aware of that

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.610
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.150
now another thing with foldables to

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160
now another thing with foldables to
 

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.950
now another thing with foldables to
think about now is aspect ratio becomes

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:07.960
think about now is aspect ratio becomes
 

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.840
think about now is aspect ratio becomes
really important so as you can see

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:09.850
really important so as you can see
 

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.610
really important so as you can see
they're on the outer screen the aspect

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:11.620
they're on the outer screen the aspect
 

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.860
they're on the outer screen the aspect
ratio is much longer it's 21 9 to be

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:13.870
ratio is much longer it's 21 9 to be
 

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.160
ratio is much longer it's 21 9 to be
exact and so for supporting full screen

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.170
exact and so for supporting full screen
 

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.550
exact and so for supporting full screen
on that outer screen you kind of have

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560
on that outer screen you kind of have
 

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.200
on that outer screen you kind of have
three options just to make sure your

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.210
three options just to make sure your
 

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.450
three options just to make sure your
game is gonna handle this correctly the

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:24.460
game is gonna handle this correctly the
 

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.630
game is gonna handle this correctly the
first is the target SDK 26 and above

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:27.640
first is the target SDK 26 and above
 

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.760
first is the target SDK 26 and above
which for a lot of you if you're pushing

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:29.770
which for a lot of you if you're pushing
 

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.620
which for a lot of you if you're pushing
updates this is required by Google Play

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:31.630
updates this is required by Google Play
 

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.530
updates this is required by Google Play
Now so that's the first option make sure

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:34.540
Now so that's the first option make sure
 

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.630
Now so that's the first option make sure
you also set your resizable activity is

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:36.640
you also set your resizable activity is
 

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.910
you also set your resizable activity is
true so again letting the system resize

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920
true so again letting the system resize

your application as it needs to be done
and now if neither of those are an

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:43.750
and now if neither of those are an
 

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.260
and now if neither of those are an
option for you what you have to do then

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:46.270
option for you what you have to do then
 

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.020
option for you what you have to do then
is specify a max aspect ratio inside

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.030
is specify a max aspect ratio inside
 

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.510
is specify a max aspect ratio inside
your manifest so this needs to be set

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:51.520
your manifest so this needs to be set
 

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.480

underneath the application tag 2.4 will
handle values up the earth will handle

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:56.980
handle values up the earth will handle
 

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.900
handle values up the earth will handle
aspect ratios up to 21 9 so that ensures

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:00.910
aspect ratios up to 21 9 so that ensures
 

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.670
aspect ratios up to 21 9 so that ensures
that your game will run on these kind of

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680
that your game will run on these kind of
 

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.980
that your game will run on these kind of
different aspect ratios and of course

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:04.990
different aspect ratios and of course
 

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.319
different aspect ratios and of course
when you do this make sure that your UI

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:07.329
when you do this make sure that your UI
 

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.079
when you do this make sure that your UI
and everything behaves the way you would

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.089
and everything behaves the way you would
 

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:11.850
and everything behaves the way you would
expect it to on these different aspect

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:11.860
expect it to on these different aspect
 

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.929
expect it to on these different aspect
ratios now I talked a little bit about

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:15.939
ratios now I talked a little bit about
 

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:18.980
ratios now I talked a little bit about
split split view and unfold balls

interacting with it so now in key

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.590
interacting with it so now in key
 

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.440
interacting with it so now in key
there's this new feature called multi

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.450
there's this new feature called multi
 

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.320
there's this new feature called multi
resume which means that if both the OEM

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:01.330
resume which means that if both the OEM
 

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.050
resume which means that if both the OEM
and the game developer or application

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.060
and the game developer or application
 

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.620
and the game developer or application
developer opted in to this feature now

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:06.630
developer opted in to this feature now
 

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.450
developer opted in to this feature now
every top-level visible activity is

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.460
every top-level visible activity is
 

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.970
every top-level visible activity is
going to be in the on resume state so

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:11.980
going to be in the on resume state so
 

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.620
going to be in the on resume state so
essentially this means that users can

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:13.630
essentially this means that users can
 

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.570
essentially this means that users can
finally multitask on these larger

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:15.580
finally multitask on these larger
 

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.760
finally multitask on these larger
screens and they can have the game open

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:17.770
screens and they can have the game open
 

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.430
screens and they can have the game open
with a chat application or whatever so

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440
with a chat application or whatever so
 

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.860
with a chat application or whatever so
this again is really important that your

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:22.870
this again is really important that your
 

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.140
this again is really important that your
to tie it back to make sure your game

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.150
to tie it back to make sure your game
 

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.990
to tie it back to make sure your game
does support use cases like this because

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000
does support use cases like this because
 

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.090
does support use cases like this because
as more and more players pick up

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.100
as more and more players pick up
 

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.010
as more and more players pick up
foldable devices they're gonna expect it

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.020
foldable devices they're gonna expect it
 

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.720
foldable devices they're gonna expect it
something like this works it'll be a

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:33.730
something like this works it'll be a
 

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.550
something like this works it'll be a
disappointment to them if they download

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:35.560
disappointment to them if they download
 

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.470
disappointment to them if they download
your game and they find out they can't

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480
your game and they find out they can't
 

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.130
your game and they find out they can't
utilize it now to support multi resume

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.140
utilize it now to support multi resume
 

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.440
utilize it now to support multi resume
it's super easy again you just go in

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:43.450
it's super easy again you just go in
 

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.720
it's super easy again you just go in
your manifest and you add this metadata

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:45.730
your manifest and you add this metadata
 

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.110
your manifest and you add this metadata
in there so now if both the OEM and you

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120
in there so now if both the OEM and you
 

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.270
in there so now if both the OEM and you
have opted into multi resume your going

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280
have opted into multi resume your going
 

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.370
have opted into multi resume your going
to support it and for devices that don't

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:53.380
to support it and for devices that don't
 

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.530
to support it and for devices that don't
yet support multi resume it'll run

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:55.540
yet support multi resume it'll run
 

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.870
yet support multi resume it'll run
exactly as it does by default where only

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880
exactly as it does by default where only
 

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.480
exactly as it does by default where only
the last activity that the user

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.490
the last activity that the user
 

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.010
the last activity that the user
interacted with will be running in the

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.020
interacted with will be running in the
 

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.020
interacted with will be running in the
on resume state so it's really easy to

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.030
on resume state so it's really easy to
 

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.240
on resume state so it's really easy to
support it and if it does if the device

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.250
support it and if it does if the device
 

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.250
support it and if it does if the device
does not support it there's no risk

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:08.260
does not support it there's no risk
 

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:14.250
does not support it there's no risk
there for you now in general with more

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:14.260
there for you now in general with more
 

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.170
there for you now in general with more
pixels comes more flexibility as well

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.180
pixels comes more flexibility as well
 

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.950
pixels comes more flexibility as well
with HUD and UI design so if your

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960
with HUD and UI design so if your
 

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.450
with HUD and UI design so if your
players are playing on a larger screen

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:21.460
players are playing on a larger screen
 

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.900
players are playing on a larger screen
consider what UI elements they can add

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:23.910
consider what UI elements they can add
 

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.940
consider what UI elements they can add
expand change or adapt to suit that

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:26.950
expand change or adapt to suit that
 

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.810
expand change or adapt to suit that

away from the screen the larger that

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:32.830
away from the screen the larger that
 

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.890

makers of don't starve did a great job

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440
makers of don't starve did a great job
 

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.320
makers of don't starve did a great job
of handling this where they actually

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.330
of handling this where they actually
 

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.930
of handling this where they actually
give you the option of removing the

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:45.940
give you the option of removing the
 

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.200
give you the option of removing the
virtual joystick and the touch buttons

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.210
virtual joystick and the touch buttons
 

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.840
virtual joystick and the touch buttons
on the screen and you can also scale the

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:51.850
on the screen and you can also scale the
 

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.840
on the screen and you can also scale the
size of the UI and HUD to match what you

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:54.850
size of the UI and HUD to match what you
 

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.280
size of the UI and HUD to match what you
would expect or whatever device you

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.290
would expect or whatever device you
 

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.960
would expect or whatever device you
happen to be playing on so it's a great

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:57.970
happen to be playing on so it's a great
 

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.600
happen to be playing on so it's a great
example of giving users the choice of

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:00.610
example of giving users the choice of
 

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.320
example of giving users the choice of
setting up to

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:02.330
setting up to
 

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.600
setting up to
optimize for a certain screen size so

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.610
 

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.930
now let's talk about input and input I'm

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940
now let's talk about input and input I'm
 

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.550
now let's talk about input and input I'm
gonna throw up this line again because

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:13.560
gonna throw up this line again because
 

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.960
gonna throw up this line again because
input is a very this is where this comes

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:17.970
input is a very this is where this comes
 

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.670
input is a very this is where this comes
into play because input is very volatile

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:19.680
into play because input is very volatile
 

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.490
into play because input is very volatile
at any point during your gameplay a user

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500
at any point during your gameplay a user
 

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.650
at any point during your gameplay a user
can attach an input device they could

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660
can attach an input device they could
 

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.530
can attach an input device they could
remove an input device and so it really

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:27.540
remove an input device and so it really
 

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.960
remove an input device and so it really
comes down to again trying to anticipate

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:29.970
comes down to again trying to anticipate
 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.970
comes down to again trying to anticipate
that you're going to get some kind of

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980
that you're going to get some kind of
 

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.720
that you're going to get some kind of
input Hardware event and being adaptive

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:35.730
input Hardware event and being adaptive
 

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.650
input Hardware event and being adaptive
to what that is

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660
to what that is
 

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.810
to what that is
and by being adaptive that really means

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820
and by being adaptive that really means
 

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.730
and by being adaptive that really means
try to anticipate what the user might

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740
try to anticipate what the user might
 

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.150
try to anticipate what the user might
intend so obviously if somebody attaches

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160
intend so obviously if somebody attaches
 

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.770
intend so obviously if somebody attaches
a controller in the middle of gameplay

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780
a controller in the middle of gameplay
 

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.480
a controller in the middle of gameplay
they probably want to use that

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:47.490
they probably want to use that
 

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.220
they probably want to use that
controller so your game should just

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:49.230
controller so your game should just
 

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.760
controller so your game should just
naturally switch over to it and not only

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:52.770
naturally switch over to it and not only
 

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.560
naturally switch over to it and not only
doing that but allowing users to choose

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:54.570
doing that but allowing users to choose
 

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.420
doing that but allowing users to choose
what kind of input methods that they

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:56.430
what kind of input methods that they
 

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.790
what kind of input methods that they
want to use so you might find that

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:58.800
want to use so you might find that
 

00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.930
want to use so you might find that
there's a bunch of different input

00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940
there's a bunch of different input
 

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.580
there's a bunch of different input
methods that are attached to the device

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:01.590
methods that are attached to the device
 

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.740
methods that are attached to the device
that your game is running on you want to

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:03.750
that your game is running on you want to
 

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.480
that your game is running on you want to
give players the choice of picking which

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.490
give players the choice of picking which
 

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.660
give players the choice of picking which
one so it all comes down again to it's

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:08.670
one so it all comes down again to it's
 

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.160
one so it all comes down again to it's
not just a touchscreen there could be a

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.170
not just a touchscreen there could be a
 

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.780
not just a touchscreen there could be a
lot of other things attached to it as

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:11.790
lot of other things attached to it as
 

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.580
lot of other things attached to it as
well that the users want to play with so

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:16.590
well that the users want to play with so
 

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.260
well that the users want to play with so
again ties back to the configuration

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:18.270
again ties back to the configuration
 

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.870
again ties back to the configuration
changes and so here in this example I'm

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880
changes and so here in this example I'm
 

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.160
changes and so here in this example I'm
setting up that I want to handle

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.170
setting up that I want to handle
 

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.860
setting up that I want to handle
keyboard if being attached or detached

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:24.870
keyboard if being attached or detached
 

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.470
keyboard if being attached or detached
and also if the keyboard becomes

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480
and also if the keyboard becomes
 

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.690
and also if the keyboard becomes
unusable so that's that keyboard hidden

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700
unusable so that's that keyboard hidden
 

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.610
unusable so that's that keyboard hidden
flag right there and where that comes

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620
flag right there and where that comes
 

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.430
flag right there and where that comes
into play is on things like pixel books

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440
into play is on things like pixel books
 

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.930
into play is on things like pixel books
you might have a keyboard that's

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940
you might have a keyboard that's
 

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.620
you might have a keyboard that's
available in the hardware when you're in

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:38.630
available in the hardware when you're in
 

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.510

into the tablet the keyboards on the
back side and is no longer usable so

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:45.750
back side and is no longer usable so
 

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.270
back side and is no longer usable so
it's important to also not forget about

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280
it's important to also not forget about
 

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.250
it's important to also not forget about
the keyboard hidden configuration events

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260
the keyboard hidden configuration events
 

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:54.020
the keyboard hidden configuration events
as well and now a way to kind of

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.030
as well and now a way to kind of
 

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.930
as well and now a way to kind of
approach right this volatility of all

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940
approach right this volatility of all

approach right this volatility of all
these different input methods what I've

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.210
these different input methods what I've
 

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.170
these different input methods what I've
kind of done here is as an example right

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.180
kind of done here is as an example right
 

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.510
kind of done here is as an example right
trying to detect maybe a game startup or

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520
trying to detect maybe a game startup or
 

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.850
trying to detect maybe a game startup or
during my on configuration change loop

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860
during my on configuration change loop
 

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.860
during my on configuration change loop
trying to detect all the devices that

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:09.870
trying to detect all the devices that
 

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.630
trying to detect all the devices that
are available for me to control the game

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640
are available for me to control the game
 

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.180
are available for me to control the game
so I can use input manager here to kind

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.190
so I can use input manager here to kind
 

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.190
so I can use input manager here to kind
of loop through all the hardware

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200
of loop through all the hardware
 

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.290
of loop through all the hardware
and figure out what input devices are

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.300
and figure out what input devices are
 

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.940
and figure out what input devices are
attached to this particular device and

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:22.950
attached to this particular device and
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.590
attached to this particular device and
then once I do that I can loop through

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600
then once I do that I can loop through
 

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.050
then once I do that I can loop through
and kind of maybe check out and see is

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:27.060
and kind of maybe check out and see is
 

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.730
and kind of maybe check out and see is
there a mouse attached is there a

there a mouse attached is there a
keyboard attached is the keyboard usable

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900
keyboard attached is the keyboard usable
 

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.040
keyboard attached is the keyboard usable
and it comes down to kind trying to

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.050
and it comes down to kind trying to
 

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.320
and it comes down to kind trying to
assess the state of all the input

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.330
assess the state of all the input
 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.780
assess the state of all the input
devices that are currently available and

devices that are currently available and
 

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.940
devices that are currently available and
then in this case you know if I detect

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:40.950
then in this case you know if I detect
 

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.500
then in this case you know if I detect
that I have a mouse and I have a

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:42.510
that I have a mouse and I have a
 

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.840
that I have a mouse and I have a
keyboard and it's usable I now switch my

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:44.850
keyboard and it's usable I now switch my
 

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.820
keyboard and it's usable I now switch my

right so I've got WASD and maybe mouse

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:49.530
right so I've got WASD and maybe mouse
 

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.070
right so I've got WASD and maybe mouse
to click or something like that so it

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080
to click or something like that so it
 

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.590
to click or something like that so it
comes down to kind of trying to figure

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600
comes down to kind of trying to figure
 

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.390
comes down to kind of trying to figure
out what's available to you and what the

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400
out what's available to you and what the
 

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.540
out what's available to you and what the
user might want to use and this also

00:22:59.540 --> 00:22:59.550
user might want to use and this also
 

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.910
user might want to use and this also
ties in with what is your game play

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:01.920
ties in with what is your game play
 

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.710
ties in with what is your game play
right so obviously for a first-person

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720
right so obviously for a first-person

shooter type the game play mouse control
 

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.900
shooter type the game play mouse control
is going to be more important if you've

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:08.910

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.630
is going to be more important if you've
got a third-person camera maybe use the

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640
got a third-person camera maybe use the
 

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.090
got a third-person camera maybe use the
mouse to control that or using WASD to

mouse to control that or using WASD to
 

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.790
mouse to control that or using WASD to
control the player movement so adapt it

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:16.800
control the player movement so adapt it
 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.490

quickly as possible and luckily it's
pretty easy to do I've talked about that

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:52.750
pretty easy to do I've talked about that
 

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.800
pretty easy to do I've talked about that
if using unity 20 18.3 and above you can

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:56.810
if using unity 20 18.3 and above you can
 

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.420
if using unity 20 18.3 and above you can
simply just choose to build an app

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:58.430
simply just choose to build an app
 

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.660
simply just choose to build an app
bundle instead of an apk or if you're

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:01.670
bundle instead of an apk or if you're
 

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.030
bundle instead of an apk or if you're
using Android studio 3.2 and above you

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:04.040
using Android studio 3.2 and above you
 

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.860
using Android studio 3.2 and above you
can simply again choose to build an app

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:05.870
can simply again choose to build an app
 

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.290
can simply again choose to build an app
bundle instead of an apk and then once

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:08.300
bundle instead of an apk and then once
 

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.000
bundle instead of an apk and then once
you build that app bundle you just

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.010
you build that app bundle you just
 

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.140
you build that app bundle you just
upload it straight to the Google Play

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:11.150
upload it straight to the Google Play
 

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.410
upload it straight to the Google Play
Store now if you have a custom build

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:14.420
Store now if you have a custom build
 

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.780
Store now if you have a custom build
pipeline or something like that you can

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:16.790
pipeline or something like that you can
 

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.970
pipeline or something like that you can
use a great tool called bundle tool to

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:18.980
use a great tool called bundle tool to
 

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.860
use a great tool called bundle tool to
generate an app bundle from the command

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:20.870
generate an app bundle from the command
 

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.750
generate an app bundle from the command
line

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760

and another useful feature a bundle tool

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.280
and another useful feature a bundle tool
 

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.420
and another useful feature a bundle tool
is that not only will it generate an app

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:27.430
is that not only will it generate an app
 

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.200
is that not only will it generate an app
bundle for you to use it'll also let you

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.210
bundle for you to use it'll also let you
 

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.360
bundle for you to use it'll also let you
generate tests apks from that app bundle

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.370
generate tests apks from that app bundle
 

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.180
generate tests apks from that app bundle
so let's say you build your app bundle

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:36.190
so let's say you build your app bundle
 

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.700
so let's say you build your app bundle
and now you can generate specific apks

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:38.710
and now you can generate specific apks
 

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.440
and now you can generate specific apks
for different device configurations and

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:40.450
for different device configurations and
 

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.510
for different device configurations and
hand that off to your QA team or to your

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:42.520
hand that off to your QA team or to your
 

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.060
hand that off to your QA team or to your
automated testing solution such that you

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.070
automated testing solution such that you
 

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.470
automated testing solution such that you
know you get all the benefits of this

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480
know you get all the benefits of this

but you don't have any of the overhead

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:51.520
but you don't have any of the overhead
 

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.630
but you don't have any of the overhead
of trying to also generate apks to fit

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640
of trying to also generate apks to fit
 

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.230
