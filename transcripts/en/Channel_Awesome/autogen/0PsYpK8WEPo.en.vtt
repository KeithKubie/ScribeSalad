00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:54.770 align:start position:0%
think she does a really good job so it's
 

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.530 align:start position:0%
think she does a really good job so it's
one<00:09:54.920><c> of</c><00:09:54.950><c> those</c><00:09:55.040><c> where</c><00:09:55.190><c> I'm</c><00:09:55.340><c> just</c><00:09:55.490><c> like</c><00:09:55.670><c> yeah</c><00:09:56.510><c> I</c>

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:56.540 align:start position:0%
one of those where I'm just like yeah I
 

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
one of those where I'm just like yeah I
like<00:09:57.410><c> this</c><00:09:57.950><c> a</c><00:09:57.980><c> little</c><00:09:58.310><c> different</c><00:09:58.640><c> but</c><00:09:58.760><c> they</c>

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:58.850 align:start position:0%
like this a little different but they
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.250 align:start position:0%
like this a little different but they
pull<00:09:59.030><c> it</c><00:09:59.180><c> off</c><00:09:59.360><c> and</c><00:09:59.570><c> like</c><00:09:59.720><c> the</c><00:09:59.870><c> things</c><00:10:00.080><c> where</c>

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:00.260 align:start position:0%
pull it off and like the things where
 

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
pull it off and like the things where
they<00:10:00.380><c> do</c><00:10:00.440><c> switch</c><00:10:00.860><c> things</c><00:10:01.130><c> up</c><00:10:01.280><c> I</c><00:10:01.460><c> generally</c>

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:01.850 align:start position:0%
they do switch things up I generally
 

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.430 align:start position:0%
they do switch things up I generally
think<00:10:02.030><c> the</c><00:10:02.120><c> show</c><00:10:02.300><c> pulls</c><00:10:02.750><c> it</c><00:10:02.900><c> off</c><00:10:03.020><c> really</c><00:10:03.320><c> well</c>

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
think the show pulls it off really well
 

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.530 align:start position:0%
