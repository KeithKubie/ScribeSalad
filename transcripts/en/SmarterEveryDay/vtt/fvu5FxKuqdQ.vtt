00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.380
Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. A treadmill is a pretty simple device, right?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.760
You set the speed you want; you get on, you start moving.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:15.180
But you don't actually go anywhere. This technology people have realized for a really long time is perfect for virtual reality

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.020
Because you could walk somewhere and actually use your body but not leave the confines of your own home

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.960
Okay here we are in California. We are at a company called Infinadeck. This is a small engineering outfit

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.380
These guys make a 360 degree treadmill the one that's in the movie ready player one so the interesting thing is they're really small company

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.780
But they've got a really cool idea, so let's go check out how this thing works.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.760
All right, so this is George, and he owns Infinadeck right?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.210
Yeah

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.780
All right

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.669
And basically Infinadeck is a 360 degree treadmill technique. That is

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.179
Is it safe to say that we've got treadmills on top of treadmills here?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780
It's a treadmill made of treadmills

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.739
Okay. Treadmill made of treadmills

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.749
So you can think of it as you've got one axis of rotation here and each individual

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.620
Treadmill can move in this direction as well, right?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.180
Yeah

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.760
So how do you ?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.620
So it's a combination right obviously if you want to go X. This is our X direction. This is our Y

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.540
X is nothing, but a treadmill you know like any other treadmill the Y it's nothing, but the smaller treadmills

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.400
right now we're using the Vive tracker on you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.820
Right, so where is the, there they are right there.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.040
So your tracker's on your rear

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.120
We kind of artificially take you about

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.180
seven or eight inches in front of that to get the middle of your CG

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.580
And this tries to keep that middle of the CG in the middle of the treadmill right there.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.020
Oh I got you. So the, so the feedb-

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.660
that was one of my main questions is what is the feedback loop? It's a positional feedback loop.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.020
Yeah, it's fairly simple right now. We're making it better this that's the part

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.760
We're gonna just keep improving for ever, years and years and years

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.380
really? so the goal so you have an object and then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.080
Oh, I get it. It's this is, this is called

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.800
They're very visual

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.540
This is a semi autonomous command position sensor. That's the best

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.920
Specific way to say that, right?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.020
Now what we're also doing on this one is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.000
You put foot trackers on when you combine the foot trackers the headset and your and your hand controllers

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.239
You now have six different

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.120
Points that is tracked on you, and that's enough for us to give you an avatar

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.000
George Jr told me if I screwed this little VR tracker into the bottom of the camera

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.440
We can insert that camera into the virtual world

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.320
Which of course we had to do

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.240
So we're ready?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.800
Yeah

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.040
So I just I just get in?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.020
Yeah go ahead, so

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.540
Alright

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.940
Let me help you a little

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.700
Okay? So first let's do your feet

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.520
Alright

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.410
This is the CG you're gonna put that on.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.820
Make the tracker meet like directly behind your back

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.320
Okay

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
So go on, put your headset

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.060
This feels like I'm actually getting in the Oasis here

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.580
Oh wow I can see the camera, in the virtual world

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.280
If you look towards me you should see the two controllers?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.140
What the heck man!

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140
So we're gonna have you do now

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.380
Okay, okay. I'm trying to. This is just normal VR.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.300
So I can actually see the ring now

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.820
That's something I didn't expect, so I can, it's there

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.400
Yeah

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.480
Alright so now that's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.480
I see my body too - what's up with my body

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.560
So we're gonna sync that with you.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.000
So if I can have you stand with your legs straight down,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.140
and your arms straight out to your sides, like a T-pose?

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.460
Three two one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.220
Did it work?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.780
Oh I can see my body!

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.900
Wow

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.720
Alright

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.040
Okay, that's rad. That's really rad.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.180
Okay, gotcha so

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.000
So right now you're tracking the position of my hands and my feet

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.160
Dude that is messed up! This - I'd like him - Alright

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So I can see the camera, the tic-tac there, but what's more important is I can also see this ring

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.380
And Griffin why did you say you have this ring in here?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.920
So this is there to kind of lock you down in the real world without being too much of a burden to say

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.239
So this is like you know when you do an integral you get the plus C at the end

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.018
So this is a boundary condition for me to kind of lock my brain into both worlds

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.319
so this is like this tells me where I'm at virtually and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.200
Like actual my body, right?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.760
Absolutely

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.760
Okay so, are you ready to start walking?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.540
I'm ready to start walking

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.059
We're gonna recommend you have your hands on the range when you first try this just so you get used to

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.589
That's okay, so when you start. Yeah. I thought it would make sense for you for it to put me in the center, okay

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.130
So now right?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.659
What is trying to do is this trying to keep the CG of my back in the center of the ring, right?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.090
So I'm gonna touch this and as I walk

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.070
Okay, it takes just okay. I'm there. Okay. I don't want to hit that tree

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.070
So I'm gonna turn this way

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
Okay

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.559
So I can't really tell if I'm walking 90 degrees or not

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.830
Okay, so there's inertia in the rollers, okay? I thought there might be. So if I move backwards

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.020
It's gonna keep me there I move forwards

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.409
So it takes just a second

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.318
Just a couple seconds on the Infinadeck, and I instantly understood the problems that these guys have to overcome

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.220
It's pretty interesting

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.340
It seems pretty simple: whatever direction a person walks, the Infinadeck moves in the opposite direction, whether it be X or Y, at

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.340
the exact same velocity and acceleration. Think about a normal treadmill: your brain is doing all the processing. Your brain is constantly

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.700
Solving the equation a treadmill velocity plus body velocity equals zero if at any point

00:05:53.709 --> 00:06:00.909
You don't solve that equation correctly you start moving relative to the treadmill. This is a very similar problem, but it's much harder

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.629
It's harder because there's two dimensions

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.949
That's the obvious one

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.868
But it's also harder because the processing isn't happening in your brain. That processing is offloaded to the Infinadeck

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:12.869
which, oh by the way, can't read your mind.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.820
There's a delay time for the Infinadeck to figure out where your position is and try to change that...

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.340
Yeah. Yes.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.780
...and if it tries to

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.660
do it too quickly you know you can have an overdamped and under damped system is that correct?  Yeah.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.520
Is that the right terminology?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.140
So, yeah

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.720
So at the moment what we're currently doing we're trying to make it so that the acceleration on the user in

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.600
any way that they're not really tried experience is never more than 0.1 Gs got it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.180
Oh that seems to be about a good amount to not really be, you know disturbing for the user. Okay.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.219
We're trying to figure out where exactly that isn't how to do that if I walk forward

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.640
I'm gonna feel an acceleration in one direction on my body because I'm pushing against the floor, right

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.020
but then the floor is gonna move, and it's gonna move my body in the opposite direction, so I'm going to feel an

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.020
acceleration that's negative, which is strange for, you know, a normal walking around human. Then, once I hit a steady state velocity,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.940
I'm gonna level out that acceleration in my mouth. My body's gonna be cool with it right, but the moment I stop

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:15.699
That's a change in velocity and the Infinadeck has to accommodate for that. It has to move you back to the center

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.019
gracefully and one thing that happens is if it tries to move you back too fast

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:25.208
It'll overshoot, and then it has to correct. So this is a really interesting engineering

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.939
problem because it doesn't have

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.669
perfect knowledge of intent. Like, that

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.300
that's the difference with your brain you have intent and so when you're walking in a normal treadmill you get to

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.440
choose everything, right?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.980
but you have to understand over the last few years

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.740
we had to, you know, build and modify the Infinadeck too

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:52.148
along with the control system, and there's only a few of us, so. Well. It's been challenging all around.

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:55.299
This is why the problem is interesting because when you're walking in the world

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.169
Right now my acceleration is zero

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:03.249
And then when I stop I'm used to imparting acceleration to my body

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.249
But that doesn't happen till later

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:10.449
Yes, it's a work in progress how far you go back. It's

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:16.239
That's clever. That's it's a challenge. That's a that's a hard math problem one thing

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.709
I thought was really cool is you can use this to be a different size in the virtual world just by changing a

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.050
Constant right you can scale

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.349
How many steps it takes to get around in the earth?

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:37.088
Just by a scale factor, but literally a scaler, that's often. Oh, there's the same boat look at that

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.538
It's a dude. It's like

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.190
I want to jump

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.380
I'm just

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:50.589
Too small to get it

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.860
Too small to go to my boat and *laughs*

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.830
That's fun. That's really fun that the model... There's my bench. Look behind you, there's my bench before

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.089
In engineering we have these assignments called technology readiness levels

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:08.619
There's nine of them, and I would say this is somewhere between a six and a seven

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:15.099
Which means there's a working prototype that works, and they're just refining the subsystems they're about to go to production

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.860
So it's really cool to be able to walk on

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.939
This Infinadeck before it goes out into mainstream production and see the behind the scenes engineering things

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.599
they're having to solve. It's really interesting. So, it's clear George knows all this

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.810
I mean he instantly understands all the variables I asked him about

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.809
That how tall the person was like if you think about it your center of mass is at a different length and so that moment

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:43.359
arm is different you have to deal with inertia differently like from the bottom of it. It's really interesting anyway

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:48.219
This is me talking to George and you can tell he totally gets it. I I can imagine that the

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.180
the inertia

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.849
Overcoming that inertia is different for each person because if I'm 175 pounds and I move here

00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:57.769
It takes a certain amount of torque

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:03.929
I'll cut the deck off now.  It takes a certain amount of torque for these motors to move me and

00:10:04.869 --> 00:10:09.479
That's going to change based on the size of the person, is that correct?

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:13.289
That's correct that.  It's more about your acceleration than the inertia.

00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:18.779
The the deck is capable of moving a lot faster than you can move.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.509
So so we could pull your feet out from under you if we ever, you know, had it set to do so.

00:10:25.749 --> 00:10:31.738
So all the algorithms stuff will will have more to do with other variables,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.709
like your CG, CG imbalance.

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:40.318
And there's a moment arm between the distance from my feet to where my CG is, right?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:49.109
So, so the acceleration that you put there, there's gonna be this lag time in my brain where I try to counteract that, is that correct?

00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:50.339
Very much.

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:54.599
All right, this is the part of video where I tell you about the sponsor and, you know, a lot of people fast-forward through this part,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.480
but you know this is the important part because we wouldn't be doing this if I hadn't have listened to Ready Player One on

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:04.648
Audible.  I'm not gonna tell you about ready player one. You know that's old news at this point,

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:09.328
I'm gonna tell you about the new book that I'm listening to. The sponsor is Audible you can get a free book by going to

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.079
audible.com/smarter

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:13.948
or texting the word "smarter" to 500-500

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:20.219
The new book that I'm listening to is called "Twelve Rules for Life" by Jordan Peterson, "an Antidote for Chaos."

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.439
Now, I'm listening to this book because I heard some podcast with the author. There's a lot of people talking about this book

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:32.129
I wanted to check it out because he doesn't believe things that I believe in fact he takes a third party-like perspective

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:37.138
look at some of the things I believe and so that helps me get outside myself and grow a little bit

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.560
So I really enjoy it.  If you're not listening to audiobooks, you really should be.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.000
You're smart people; you know this part is a big deal for me,

00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:49.438
and I know this part can be a big deal for you, because audiobooks literally have changed my life.

00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:56.489
So, Audible.com/smarter, that's how you can support Smarter Every Day, or text the word "smarter" to 500-500.

00:11:56.489 --> 00:12:01.048
Thank you for considering that.  Last thing. I wanna say thanks to the guys at Infinadeck.

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:03.579
A treadmill made of treadmills, that is insane.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.379
You're there man, this is just a control systems problem at this point, isn't it?

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.780
We just need some control engineers.  We ought to hire a couple.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.020
That's what this is at this point.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.000
At this point, it's just computer stuff and math so this is doable

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.920
I hope you enjoyed this video enough to subscribe.  If you do there's a little bell beside the subscription button.

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:28.309
If you haven't enjoyed it enough to hit the bell to get a notification on your phone every time I upload, then don't.

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:34.909
That's completely okay. Anyway, I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. Thanks for learning with me

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:45.199
You're gonna fall. You fell. You jumped. Whatever. What are you doin'? Why you makin' noise?
