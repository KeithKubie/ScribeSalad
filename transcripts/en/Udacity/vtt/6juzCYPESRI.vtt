00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let me illustrate this again. For any sample, you know how to compute a confidence interval.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If the null hypothesis is inside the confidence interval of the observed sample,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
everything is okay and you believe null hypothesis.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Conversely, if the null hypothesis falls outside, you don't believe null hypothesis

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you accept the alternate hypothesis.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So simple is the hypothesis testing and you use confidence intervals instead of,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for example, the binomial distribution and that's really the common case.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let me just briefly summarize what we're doing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Given the sample of data, you compute the mean, you compute the variance,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you get the t-value at some desired error probability p

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and you have to make sure you pick the correct one if it's one-sided,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and pick a different one for the two-sided.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then the plus/minus term in the confidence interval is simply this number over here

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
times the square root of the empirical variance for N.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Then I would have to be really cryptic but I've just given it to you,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but by now, it should make a lot of sense and because we practiced every element of it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The mean, the empirical variance, getting a number from a table,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and then compute the size of the confidence interval which we then put into the plus/minus terms.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So µ minus this is the lower bound µ plus is the upper bound of the confidence interval

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
according to the confidence level specified for the error probability p.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Let's put this into action--a dance club operator advertised the fact

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that the average age of its client is 26.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You walk in and encounter the following people--four people are 21,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
six people are 24, seven people are 26, 11 people are 29,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and two people are actually 40 years old for a total of N=30.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now, compute for mean whether you know to trust the statement that the average was 26.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And let's do so. Obviously, the fact that there is two 40-year-olds is a little bit disturbing.

00:02:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do so in stages and I want to guide you through this. First, let's calculate the mean.
