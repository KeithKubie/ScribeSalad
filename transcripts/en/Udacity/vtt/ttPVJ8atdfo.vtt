00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.810
Alright, the next topic we're going to get into

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.990
is to nail down a concept called PAC learning.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.220
So to do that, we're going to delve into

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.620
what the error of a hypothesis is. And there's

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.410
two kinds of errors. There's the training error and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.590
the true error. So the training error is on

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.430
the training set. What is the fraction of those

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.830
examples that are classifieds by some given hypotheses H.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.410
&gt;&gt; Now H could be different

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.100
from the target concept. The target concept ought to have a training error

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
of zero. But some other hypothesis h might have some error. Okay?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.940
&gt;&gt; Sure, that makes sense.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the true error is actually the fractions

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.870
of examples that would be misclassified on a sample drawn from

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.400
D in essentially the infinite limit. So what is the, essentially the probability

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.120
that a sample drawn from D Would be mis-classified

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.680
by some hypothesis, h.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.410
&gt;&gt; And we can actually write that mathematically. Error with respect to some

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.780
distribution D of some hypothesis h, is the probability that if we draw

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.980
the input X from that distribution that you're going to get a mismatch between

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.400
the true label, according to the concept,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.240
and the hypothesis that we're currently evaluating.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.190
&gt;&gt; Right, so this sort of captures the notion

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.650
that it's okay for you to misclassify examples

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.090
you will never ever ever see.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.670
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. So we're only being penalized proportional to the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.590
probability of getting that thing wrong. So, for examples that we never

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.960
see, that's fine. For examples that we see really really rarely. We

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.420
get only a tiny little bit of contribution to the overall error.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, I can follow that.
