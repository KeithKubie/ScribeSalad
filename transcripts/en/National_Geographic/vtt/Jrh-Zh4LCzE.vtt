00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.535
(soft music)

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.426
[Gabriel] This is Huanchaco.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.094
This is my hometown.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.399 align:start size:84% position:16%
Huanchaco is a small
fishing village

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
that is north of
the city of Trujillo

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:39.272
and it's a very rich place
in archaeological sites.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.308 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
There has been a
continuous occupation

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.478 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
in this area for
more than 3500 years.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.284 align:start position:0%
Local fishermen are still
fishing in the traditional ways

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.988 align:start size:94% position:6%
using reed boats so it's
really something that

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.991 align:start position:0%
have that magic sense
for this town.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:02.095
One of the problems
we have in Huanchaco

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that we are losing that
traditional knowledge.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.266
If we lose these sites,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
you will never
learn what happened

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.337
three thousand years ago.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.444
I think that when I was
already seven or eight,

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:22.081 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was very sure that I wanted
to be an archaeologist.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.618
It was really a
very unique time.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.253
You play with your
friends on the beach,

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.788
you help the fishermen,

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:32.926
you just spend time walking
around archaeological sites.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.966 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are currently
working at seven sites

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.500
in the Huanchaco area

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.303
and the main goal
of this project

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:47.840
is to learn more about
how these common people

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.343
built up as a society

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.645
and transformed over the years.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.485
When you learn about Peru,

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.487 align:start size:81% position:19%
you always hear
about Machu Picchu

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.888
or the Nazca Lines.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.156
That's very important

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.660 align:start size:88% position:13%
but we want to learn not
in the big temples,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.497 align:start size:97% position:3%
we want to learn what
happened in the small house.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:14.533
You get a big picture
of how society worked

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.036
and that's what we want to do.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.405
One of the problems we have

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
is urban expansion is
really destroying many sites

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.744
and one of our goals
is actually to protect

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
and to study the sites
before they get destroyed.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.620 align:start size:94% position:6%
One of my dreams is to
have people from Huanchaco

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.324
becoming archaeologists
and working in the area,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.658
getting them involved,

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.160 size:88% position:44%
giving job opportunities

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.661
but at the same time,

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.399 align:start size:97% position:3%
feeding their own identity,
their own cultural background.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.137 align:start size:97% position:3%
It opens also an
opportunity for local people

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
to learn that protecting
archaeological sites

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:55.875
is very important.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.614
Coming back to a place like
Huanchaco and working here

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:04.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
is for me like
returning the favor.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start size:94% position:6%
We need spaces for people
to learn more about

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:08.555
their own past.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.758 align:start size:94% position:6%
The real importance about
these small sites

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.528
is that we can link the
past with the present.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.229 line:92%
We can really tell, you know, 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.165 align:start position:0%
you are not only
just a fisherman,

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.134 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're a person
living in that site

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.169
that has more than
three thousand years

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.071
of cultural continuity.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:29.008
That makes you very
unique in this world.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.444
