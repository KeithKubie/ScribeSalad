00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.650
Patricia? [Applause]

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.300
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
Thank you very much

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.500
for that introduction
and to all of the folks

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.200
in the Interpretive
Programs Office

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.900
who created this remarkable
exhibit that working on it was

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.190
such a pleasure and
I learned so much.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.880
And it's wonderful that it
will be here through December.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.280
So I hope if you haven't seen
it that you will go and see it.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.410
It's really, really terrific.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.060
Thank you all for coming and
I thank my friends for coming.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.780
Today, it's-- the Civil Rights
Act stands as a living monument

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.020
to the Civil Rights
Movement and that's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.840
so beautifully demonstrated
in this exhibit.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.940
The exhibit captures a broad
sweep in dynamic history

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.860
that culminated with the
Civil Rights Act in 1964,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.130
legislation that changed
America in fundamental ways,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.650
ending the racial class
system in the South

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.410
and expanding federal
protection of citizenship rights

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.090
that continues to
shape our lives

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.380
and create new opportunities.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.370
The exhibit also
documents a history

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.670
that is closely intertwined

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.630
with America's long
struggle with race.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.780
It includes a large flag,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.940
proclaiming a man was lynched
today, that would hang outside

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.340
of the NAACP's office
on 5th Avenue,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.290
documenting whenever a lynching
happened during the 1920s

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.010
and 1930s.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.830
And it's-- really to see it,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.130
I was with Julia Mum
[assumed spelling],

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.740
we saw it in the exhibit and
we both just froze to see it,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.400
it's gigantic, hung way up.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.260
And it's a summary reminder of
the depths of racial brutality

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.740
and national indifference
that has marked our history.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.610
Recent incidents
of police violence

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.340
and killings shine a light
on the persistent legacies

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.550
and manifestations of America's
ongoing racial dilemma.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.340
So, I welcome this opportunity
to talk with you today

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.320
about Robert Kennedy and
his history in relationship

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.820
to the Civil Right Act and the
movement that it grew from.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.070
Circumstances placed Robert
Kennedy in a unique position

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.520
to respond to the challenges
and opportunities created

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.520
by the Civil Rights Movement
at its most pivotal moment.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.550
First, some backgrounds
since I've been digging

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.290
in the archives to
get a chance to talk

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.560
about your project is dangerous,
you know, because you're--

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.990
yeah, but I think
it's interesting

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.730
to know what I've been
struck by, the combination

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.020
of individual characteristics
and experiences

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.670
that help explain more
about Kennedy's development

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.210
as a rare leader in
America's long struggle

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.130
for racial justice.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.350
He had the self-assuredness
and sense of entitlement common

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.220
to a son of privilege.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.430
He was fiercely ambitious,

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.950
though not for personal
recognition or advancement,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.120
and had a finely tuned
sense of right and wrong.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.600
Labeled a misfit by his
high school classmates,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.590
he did not hesitate to
go against the grain

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.720
of established practices.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.790
He was compassionate and
demonstrated an ability

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.290
to attract and cultivate people
who shared his dedication

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.490
to public service like Peter
Edelman who joins us today.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.600
Most significantly, I
think is what colleagues

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.780
and friends called his
experiencing nature.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.450
As one associate
recalled, he went,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.960
he saw, he listened, he grew.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.920
Born in 1925, Robert
Kennedy came of age at a time

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.310
when segregation was becoming
more deeply entrenched

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.920
throughout the country, even

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.440
as the NAACP mounted
the protracted challenge

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.620
of segregation in the
South that culminated

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.190
with the 1954 Brown Ruling.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.720
The 1950s, the decade

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.940
that Kennedy began
his professional life,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.860
marked the largest migration of
African-Americans from the South

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.200
to the North and
West, the culmination

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.500
of the great migration,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.250
which dramatically altered
the racial landscape

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.550
of this country.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.320
By 1960, an estimated 48%
of black Americans lived

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.120
in the North, trapped
in overcrowded housing,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.770
substandard schools,
minimal access to jobs,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.650
and aggressive policing.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.740
Prior to 1960, the year he's
run around for president,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.800
Kennedy said he never
thought much about race.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.700
He grew up learning that there
are people less fortunate

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.150
who had a difficult time,
both black and white,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.850
and that you had a
social responsibility

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.730
for doing something about it,
yet an early confrontation

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.570
with the color line
is revealing.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.940
In 1951, during his third year
in Law School at the University

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.810
of Virginia, Kennedy
invited Ralph Bunche to speak

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.020
at the university as a guest
to the Student Legal Forum.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.060
Bunche had just been awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize for his role

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.860
in the settlement of the
first Arab-Israeli war

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.090
and Kennedy had traveled to the
war-torn area in 1948 on the eve

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.760
of Israel's establishment.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.000
So that's I think what
attracted him to Bunche.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.820
Bunche accepted with
one condition,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.460
he would not address
a segregated audience.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.460
Segregation of public
gatherings was a law

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.690
in Virginia at that time.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.530
There was tremendous
opposition on campus

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.810
to such an arrangement, Kennedy
later recalled, and students

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.470
on the Legal Forum were
divided about what to do.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.740
Determined that Bunche
would visit and believed

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.510
that the policy was wrong,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.060
Kennedy wrote a letter appealing
directly to the president

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.150
of the university,
Colgate Darden,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.060
and I'm quoting for
that-- from that.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.590
"The segregation policy in
this instance," he wrote,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.120
"is legally indefensible
and morally wrong."

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.310
He cited the recent
Supreme Court decision,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.200
McLaurin versus Oklahoma,
a 1950 ruling

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.180
which barred racial
segregation of students

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.940
within the university.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.150
Kennedy advised,
"While the University

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.250
of Virginia offers a public
lecture open to citizens

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.210
of the state, it cannot
require college citizens

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.320
in attending these addresses to
be seated in segregated areas."

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.660
In his letter, Kennedy
explain that the audience

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.030
for the forum events ran
from 300 to 400 people

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.590
and that it wasn't
likely that more than 30

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.780
or 40 blacks would attend.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.300
Darden agreed to a temporary
suspension of the policy.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.850
On Easter Monday,
Kennedy introduced Bunche

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.670
to an overflow crowd of more
1,500 people in Cabell Hall

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.560
on the grounds of
the university.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.770
An estimated 500
of them were black.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.980
This was the first public
integrated meeting of its kind

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.730
on the grounds of the
University of Virginia.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.670
Also, there was no hotel
accommodation for Ralph Bunche

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.820
in Charlottesville so
he stayed with Bobby

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.400
and his new wife Ethel,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.870
and it was the beginning
of a long friendship.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.840
It was not until 1960 that
the issue of race moved

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.430
to the center of
Kennedy's attention,

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.010
the year that Kennedy
directed his brother's campaign

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.990
for the presidency.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.350
That year, as you know, the
sit-ins ignited student protests

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.850
and expanding activism
across the South,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.080
protests that would soon
turn national attention

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.930
to conditions in the region.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.570
However, for presidential
candidates John F. Kennedy

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.720
and Richard Nixon, the black
vote in electoral route

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.510
to northern and western
states vastly increased

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.120
by the migration of the
'50s was of primary concern

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.570
and offering the movement
some critical leverage.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.370
As he navigated the fault lines
dividing southern Democrats

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.830
and northern black voters,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.400
34-year-old Robert Kennedy
was exposed to social

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.740
and political realities
that had beyond--

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.910
had been beyond his
vision and concern.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.590
I just want to take a brief look

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.680
at several episodes
during the 1960 campaign

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.840
that reveal a sensibility
beyond political calculation,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.470
which was important.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.300
I forgot to show
you the picture.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.880
I'm not paying attention to
my notes, but there he is

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.660
with Ralph Bunche
at the university.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.120
And I like this picture
of the campaign

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.400
and he was a hard worker,
so this is probably

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.160
out of character, but
anyway, there he is.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:21.250
So, the Kennedy campaign created
the first Civil Rights division

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.690
affiliated with a major party
with an integrated staff

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.100
that included Marjorie Lawson,
an attorney and a columnist

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.910
for the Pittsburg
Courier and wife

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.990
for the Civil Rights attorney
Belford Lawson, Harris Wofford,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.340
a young constitutional
law professor

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.490
who had a personal acquaintance
with Martin Luther King

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.830
and was the first white person
to attend Harvard Law School,

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.620
and Lewis Martin, who had been
a leading labor organizer,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.380
NAACP activist and newspaper
publisher in Detroit.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.030
During the 1960 Democratic
Convention,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.970
Robert Kennedy approved
the Civil Rights Plank

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.400
that went far beyond
anything offered previously.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.900
It reads, it's three pages
long and reads like a blueprint

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.630
for the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.490
Harris Wofford and Chester
Bowles had drafted the

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.610
far-reaching in document
assuming it would be rejected

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.060
by Kennedy.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.460
A more modest version
was ready to go.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.760
They were surprise and delighted
when Kennedy endorsed the plank,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.820
leading strong and determined
to charge that it was

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.170
"the most extreme,
unconstitutional,

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.550
and anti-southern
platform ever conceive

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.690
by a major political party."

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.820
Even the NAACP has never
proposed more drastic steps.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.080
So there are several
interesting examples

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.360
that show Robert Kennedy
pressing at the edges

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.730
and his brother working to
placate southern Democrats.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.380
I want to mention
one in particular

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.740
and then one-- a
more familiar one.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.700
But one that I really think
is fascinating is an account

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.270
by George Peek who has worked on
the southern campaign for JFK,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.870
he was an aide to George
Smather, and recalls a trip

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.650
with Robert Kennedy
through Georgia to Savannah.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.950
This is Peek.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.410
The advanced man had
a route to the hotel.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.000
Bobby said, "Is it through
the black part of town?"

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.300
We said, "No."

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.120
He said, "Well, I want to go
through the black part of town."

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.500
So we did, we changed
the trip into Savannah.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.940
Then when we got there, the
first thing he asks me was,

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.520
find out how many blacks we're
going to have here tonight.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.420
Well, I knew we weren't
going to have any

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.790
because that hotel will not
have blacks in those days.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.980
I went back to him
and said we weren't.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.650
He said, well, we're not going

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.580
to have dinner unless you
get some blacks here, OK?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.950
So he went about inviting
some blacks that evening.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.550
He was very difficult to
work with, very difficult.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.640
[Laughter] Shortly
after that incident,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.720
and this is more well-known,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.110
this is really the
only thing people talk

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.470
about in relationship
to the 1960 campaign

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.190
as very significant, Martin
Luther King was arrested

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.700
and jailed following
a sit-in demonstration

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.250
in Atlanta just weeks
before the election.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.780
King, yet to be the major
national figure he would become,

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.670
was sent to a prison in
rural Reed Field, Georgia,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.930
and there was a great
concern for his safety.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.170
At the urging of Harris Wofford,

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.110
John F. Kennedy phoned
Coretta Scott King

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.230
to express his concern.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.600
Independently, Robert
Kennedy called the judge

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.890
who had denied King his
constitutional right to bail

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.180
and apparently chewed him out.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.060
RFK's call secured
King's release.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.640
On the Sunday before
the election,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.560
and Harris Wofford does a great
story about putting these fliers

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.600
on Graham buses and
shipping them all

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.400
over so they could be
distributed to black churches

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.230
on Sunday describing what
the Kennedy's had done

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.700
for Martin Luther King,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.840
many blacks including
Martin Luther King Sr. voted

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.020
for John F. Kennedy as a result.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.220
And it is likely, and Jonathan
also thinks this is true,

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.130
that the black vote provided
the margin of victory

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.550
for John F. Kennedy in the
closest presidential election

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.510
in American history
up to that point.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.400
Now this story would end there

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.090
if Robert Kennedy had not
yielded to the pressure put

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.340
on him by his father and
brother and accepted a position

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.420
in his brother's cabinet
as attorney general.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.060
This had major consequences
for the history of this era

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.220
and the circumstances
surrounding the Civil

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.520
Rights Act.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.620
The transformation of
the Justice Department

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.970
in relationship to the Civil
Rights Movement began on the day

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.170
that Robert Kennedy
met John Doar,

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.510
a [inaudible] Midwestern
lawyer and Republican holdover

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.790
who had joined and pledge

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.640
to the civil rights
division the previous July.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.590
No one else would take the job.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.930
He was the third
person they asked.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.120
It was the end of the
Eisenhower administration.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.420
The division had
been established

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.600
for the 1957 Civil Rights Act,
a water dam bill conceived

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.330
to remedy voting rights
abuses in the South.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.780
But it did give the Justice
Department some jurisdiction

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.610
in voting rights cases.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.180
Doar and a small group of
lawyers in the division worked

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.690
to develop a government
strategy capable

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.590
of effectively prosecuting
violations of voting rights.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.400
Reliance on FBI reports
were a problem.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.260
They didn't include any
facts, Doar complained.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.210
Frustrated by a flimsy report
on the mass eviction of blacks

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.520
who had attempted to register
to vote in Haywood County,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.840
Tennessee, Doar who had been
a personal injury lawyer

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.180
for 10 years decided to go
South and see for himself.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.370
Armed with a camera, he met
with the evicted sharecroppers,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.860
documented their stories, took
pictures, and filed a lawsuit

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.790
in federal court that September.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.980
This would mark an important
turning point in the work

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.550
of the Civil Rights division.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.710
On January 19th, 1960, the day
before JFK was inaugurated,

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.640
the Civil Rights division filed
a lawsuit regarding the case

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.920
of Joseph Francis
Atlas, a black farmer

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.590
in East Carroll Parish,
Louisiana.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.820
Doar again had gone South to
investigate this case and found

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.570
that Atlas had testified--

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.970
Before the Civil Rights
Commission in New Orleans,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.840
he was invited to testify
about the fact that no blacks

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.190
in East Carroll Parish voted.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.570
And after he was done,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.130
local ginners refused
to gin his cotton.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.430
He had about 100 acres.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.550
He and his wife had raised
and educated eight children

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.640
and they faced financial ruin.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.440
Robert, And this is Doar's
remembering, Robert Kennedy came

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.300
to my office the second or third
day after JFK was inaugurated

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.210
to find out what was
going on in the division.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.520
Doar told them about the
case of Joseph Francis Atlas.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.950
"He picked a bad place
to start," Kennedy said.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.250
"Well, that's where Atlas
grows his cotton," he said.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.980
And he explained how when Atlas
returned from the hearings

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.670
in new Orleans, the
sheriff met him at his door,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.860
he told the farmer not to
bring his cotton to any ginner

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.040
in East Carroll Parish.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.230
When Atlas asked why, the
sheriff responded, Civil Rights.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.100
For the next week or so,
Doar recalled, Kennedy worked

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.610
to persuade the ginners of
the parish to gin the cotton

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.960
and finally secured
an agreement.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.540
Doar advised that this
would not be sufficient.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.190
Without a court in junction,
the agreement would be ignored.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.200
Kennedy worked out an
arrangement whereby all

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.630
of the ginners would appear
before Judge Dawkins in Monroe,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.330
Louisiana and pledged not to
deprive Atlas of the goods

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.940
and services he needed
to run his farm.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.220
And he sent Doar to Monroe
to appear before the judge

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.680
and witness the agreement
on the part of the ginners.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.500
Think of it, Doar
recalled, 50 years later,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.060
the attorney general from
the first day put his mind

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.210
and his effort and his
energy and drive just

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.760
to help one cotton farmer
in East Carroll Parish,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.180
Louisiana gin his cotton.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.430
That was a good omen
for this country.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.390
Doar would play a
major role in building

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.430
and leading the Civil
Rights division,

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.100
working under the assistance
of the attorney general

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.010
for Civil Rights, the quiet

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.960
and enormously talented
Burke Marshall.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.600
On March 6th, Kennedy
presided over a total review

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.590
of the Justice Department's
approach to Civil Rights.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.620
There would be no immediate
legislation introduced given

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.450
congressional and
political realities.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.240
Energy effort and brains would
be dedicated to pushing as far

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.930
as they could on the current
Civil Rights legislation using

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.720
the persuasive and legal
pair of the administration

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.390
to secure compliance with
the segregation rulings

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.640
and voter registration laws.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.370
Immediate attention was given
to getting the government to,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.090
in Kennedy's words,
clean up its own act

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.160
and hire black employees.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.540
Robert Kennedy wrote to
all the major law schools,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.730
asking the deans "to
furnish me with the names

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.530
of qualified negro
attorneys of your acquaintance

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.590
who might be interested in
coming to the department.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.890
We're also interested

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.190
in encouraging promising
law students

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.490
to consider making
a career here.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.950
Voting was a top priority.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.050
Doar's get out the roadmaps and
go was a very Kennedy approach

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.740
and it appealed to Robert
Kennedy, and will be central

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.060
to the work that defined
a vastly expanded Civil

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.420
Rights division.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.170
Kennedy approved the
hiring of more lawyers

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.040
that he quadrupled the number
of lawyers in the division.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.920
And the division mounted what
was in effect a field operation.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.810
Lawyers spent weeks at a
time in the Deep South,

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.880
investigating court records
and registration documents,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.440
interviewing blacks, and
developing a relationship

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.340
with SNCC and local
Civil Rights activists.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.250
And this was Kennedy's idea,
they put a map up in the office

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.960
with colored pins, indicating
trouble spots and places

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.890
where cases have been filed.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.170
Doar recalled that RFK's mantra
was, you're not doing enough.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.430
He wanted cases in every
county in Mississippi,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.750
Louisiana, and Alabama.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.760
By 1963, the division
had filed 34 suits

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.760
against county registrars
for discrimination

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.900
in voter registration
and had 48 other counties

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.200
under investigation.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.900
It had filed 12 suits seeking
injunctions against intimidation

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.210
with another eight
under investigation.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.050
It had examined voter
registration records

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.080
in 27 counties in Alabama,
50 counties in Mississippi,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.610
and 27 counties in Louisiana.

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.860
Still, in the short-term,
accelerated efforts

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.110
on voting rights on
the voting rights front

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.100
and escalating battles around
racial segregation pressed

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.440
at the limits of federal
power and tested the capacity

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.810
of the Kennedy administration

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.530
to meet a mounting
crisis in the south.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.680
The state-sanctioned violence
that met the freedom writers

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.970
in the spring of 1961 was
Robert Kennedy's baptism.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.540
He soon found out that
the FBI had failed

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.980
to disclose information that
they had on plans by the clan

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.480
with the cooperation
of local police

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.980
to assault the writers
in Alabama.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.910
During a mass meeting at
the First Baptist Church

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.750
in Montgomery honoring
the writers,

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.350
a mob of several thousand
surrounded the church,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.260
trapped over 1,000 people inside
and threatened to burn it down.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.300
Robert Kennedy spent a tense
late night on the phone

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.000
with martin Luther king
who was inside the church.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.830
While his appeals to Alabama
Governor James Paterson,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.550
who had been a big supporter of
John F. Kennedy's, were ignored.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.710
At the very last minute, federal
marshals dispersed the mob,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.670
people with no experience
in mob control,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.810
barely averting an
unspeakable human disaster.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.810
As a result of the
freedom riots, Kennedy's--

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.110
Kennedy mandated that the ICC
enforce the Supreme Court ruling

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.150
banning segregation
on intestate commerce,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.800
interstate travel a minor
victory in an ongoing battle.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.660
And I just read recently
that Kennedy's never spoke

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.590
to John Paterson again.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.350
Efforts to implement
school desegregation

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.100
in the South was a further test.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.290
Kennedy's first speech-- public
speech was at the University

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.860
of Georgia where two black
students, Charleyne Hunter

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.250
and Hamilton Holmes that
integrated the university

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.400
that January, and he said
probably the first federal

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.910
official on southern
ground that Brown was a law

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.960
and the administration would
enforce Civil Rights laws.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.750
He spent his first
months in office working

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.960
with Louisiana officials
successfully

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.240
to avoid a school shutdown in
the face of school desegregation

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.720
in that state, and the
Justice Department filed a suit

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.540
against Prince Edward County

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.080
which had closed their
schools rather than desegregate

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.450
and transferred the public
money to support private schools

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.130
for white children, leaving no
schools for the black children

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.720
in that community since 1959.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.110
And Burke Marshall and John
Seigenthaler would go around

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.180
and meet with these
various communities and try

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:31.000
to persuade them to comply and
if not bring legal pressure.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.300
The limits

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.020
of the administration's approach
were amplified in a number

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.560
of ways, but especially in
Mississippi in October of 1962

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.660
where the actions of a defiant
Governor Ross Barnett incited

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.380
violent resistance through the
admission of James Meredith,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.830
leaving two people dead

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.450
and compelling the
Kennedy administration

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.690
to send federal troops
to restore order

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.120
and secure Meredith's admission.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:57.120
So by early 1963, it all
seemed like patchwork at best,

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.590
as the racial conflict

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.550
in the South escalated
towards a breaking point.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.910
Now during the same period,
Robert Kennedy's concern

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.440
about poverty and
racial segregation

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.910
that he apparently had witnessed
during the presidential

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.510
campaign deepened.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.970
After a CBS interview in
Midtown, Manhattan earlier

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.980
in '61, he walked up to
Harlem where he talked

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.390
with young people and
observed physical conditions

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.740
of the poor segregated
urban neighborhood.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.210
As Peter Edelman said to me
once, Bobby loved to walk,

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.670
and I love that example.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.750
In his speech given
shortly after that

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.620
to the National Committee for
Children and Youth Conference

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.950
of Unemployed Out-of-School
Youth in Urban Areas that may,

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.740
he commented on the
interrelated problems

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.960
of school dropout rates,
youth unemployment,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.670
and rising prison rates
for young people under 22,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.410
and emphasized the importance
of dealing with the sources

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.440
of delinquency as opposed
to the end results.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.260
That spring, Kennedy enlisted
his friend David Hackett

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.630
to coordinate a program
to study the cases--

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.740
the causes of juvenile
delinquency

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.430
and develop programs
to aid youth.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.940
This resulted in
the establishment

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.100
of the President's Commission
on Juvenile Delinquency,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.870
an interagency program housed
in the Justice Department.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.050
Hackett drew on the
expertise of social scientists

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.710
like Richard Cloward and
Lloyd Ohlin, and the work

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.300
of Kenneth Clark in Harlem
in fashioning a program

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.960
that funded locally
initiated pilot projects.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.970
The projects aim to mobilize the
resources of a particular city

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.390
to address the problems
of youth,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.550
problems that they concluded
was structural and historical,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.150
rooted in lack of access to
decent education and healthcare,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.400
rampant unemployment, poor
recreational facilities,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.440
racial discrimination,
and long-term poverty.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.300
During 1961 and '62, Robert
Kennedy visited each one

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.530
of these pilot projects and
there were an estimated 16,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.480
I'm still trying to
identify what they all were.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.120
Hackett recalled that neither
he nor Kennedy had ever been

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.550
involved up close with poverty
or with Negros prior to this,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.480
and they were shocked,
as they began

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.870
to see what the conditions
were like around the country.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.300
Urban poverty became the
focus of Hackett's group

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.140
and the concept of
community action

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.430
and empowering the
poor became central

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.710
to the anti-poverty program
that was in development--

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.300
in the developmental stage

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.460
when John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.180
By at the end of 1962 then,
Robert Kennedy began speaking

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.540
about racial segregation and
discrimination as a national,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.250
not a regional problem.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.690
In March of '63,
addressing the gathering--

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.350
the Commemoration
of the Centennial

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.580
of the Emancipation
Proclamation in Kentucky,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.830
he told the gathering
that the problems created

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.300
by racial discrimination
were massive.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.720
He continued, the results of
racial discrimination carry

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.490
on for generation
after generation.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.820
To face this openly and try

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.750
to meet it squarely is the
challenge of this decade.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.270
Martin Luther King had begun
his campaign in Birmingham

00:26:55.270 --> 00:27:00.340
and within weeks said that it
was edging towards what would

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.020
seem like a race war.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.700
During the first week of May,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.630
images of the city's
police assaulting hundreds

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.560
of protesting black
youth with dogs

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.640
and high-pressure fire
hoses blanketed the nation

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.480
and were beamed across
the world,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.890
thrusting America's
racial conflict

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.330
to the forefront of
public awareness.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.310
Police violence, mob
terror, and the bombing

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.210
of the hotel housing Martin
Luther King Jr. brought

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.750
thousands of blacks into
the streets of Birmingham

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.610
and ignited pent-up
despair and anger

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.640
in America's urban areas
across the country.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.690
A wave of mass demonstrations
amplified the prophetic warning

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.800
in James Baldwin's
"The Fire Next Time",

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.570
which had been published
several months earlier.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.630
Birmingham brought
urgent efforts

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:46.130
to push beyond normal channels
and find the nations capacity

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.810
to resolve a problem woven
deep into American life.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.830
On May 17th, Robert Kennedy and
Burke Marshall outlined plans

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.340
for a Civil Rights Bill.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.010
And the Justice Department
lawyers began

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.970
drafting legislation.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.440
Kennedy initiated and attended
endless rounds of meetings

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.850
in Washington and New York.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.770
At the same time, he lobbied
national business leaders

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.970
to voluntarily end segregation
in their southern-based stores,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.340
movie theaters, and
other public facilities.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.070
There were small private
meetings with national, civic,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.450
business, philanthropic,
and political leaders

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.950
to build support for a major
Civil Rights legislation.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.910
On May 24th, in a
highly unusual meeting,

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.820
he met with a small
group of black activists

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.980
and artists convened
by James Baldwin,

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.030
hoping to seek their
advice on what could be done

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.420
to counter the appeal of Malcolm
X and other militant groups.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.790
And, you know, you had a sense
when you're in this period

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.670
that things are on edge.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.400
The gathering-- And I've
spent a lot of time on this,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.980
but just a little bit, but it
quickly dissolved into an attack

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.430
on the failure of the Kennedy
administration to do more

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.180
and to effectively
address the depths

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.970
of the racial crisis
throughout the country,

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.650
racial discrimination.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.100
At several points,
he tried to intervene

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.220
and shift the conversation
and it didn't work,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.080
so he retreated into silence.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.630
By all accounts, the meeting, it
went on and they just unloaded

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.850
on him about everything.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.960
By all accounts, the meeting
was a remarkable display,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.180
and we don't pay enough
attention to this, of the divide

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.360
in experience and understanding
for someone even as--

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.470
well, you know, interested and
concerned as Robert Kennedy

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.410
and his black contemporaries.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.950
Kenneth Clark said, "We might

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.500
as well have been speaking
different languages."

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:40.130
"But," he added, "the
fact that Bobby sat there

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.730
through such an ordeal for
three hours," in his house,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.740
his apartment, Clark commented,
"proved that he was among,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.150
he was among," and this what
some Lorraine Hansberry said

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.250
to him, if you don't get
it, we're in big trouble

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.480
because you are among the best
white America has to offer.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.350
A week later, Robert Kennedy
was with the president

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.340
when John F. Kennedy decided
that he would go ahead

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.260
and introduce comprehensive
Civil Rights legislation,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.390
a tough decision that
Kennedy acknowledged--

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.570
John F. Kennedy acknowledged
as morally right and essential

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.210
to meeting this crisis.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.480
But he told his brother that
it would probably be his

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.780
political swansong.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.030
There's a real concern that
it will cost him the election

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.480
and all of his aides
thought that

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.700
and they told him not to do it.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.710
But he wanted to wait until
after the desegregation

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.200
of the University of Alabama

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.250
on June 11th before
acting on this decision.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.810
That afternoon, following
the peaceful inauguration

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:38.910
of the university, he decided
to go on television at 7 o'clock

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.070
and announce plans to
introduce the Civil Rights Bill.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.780
So there's much frantic activity
for several hours as he worked

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.080
with his brother

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.080
and Speechwriter Ted Sorensen
sketching out what he would say.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.620
President Kennedy's
June 11th speech,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.480
parts of it written down, most
of it spoken extemporaneously,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.290
reflected the strong
influence of his brother.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.220
There were echoes of Robert
Kennedy's South Carolina speech

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.220
and interestingly,
Kenneth Clark will stunned

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.160
and somewhat reassured to
hear phrases and concerns

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.270
that they had expressed
during their meeting

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.550
with Robert Kennedy woven
into the president's speech.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.180
It's an amazing, wonderful,
extraordinary speech

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.590
which everyone should read.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.140
The president described
the human toll

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.370
of America's racial past and
the lost futures of children

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.700
who are attending segregated
schools, nearly a decade

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.420
after the Brown Ruling.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.020
He spoke with deep conviction
about the urgency of the moment

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.270
"the fires of frustration
and discord are burning

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.700
in every city, North
that South."

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.170
And he insisted that there
was a moral imperative to act.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:47.070
This is a problem that faces us
all, not merely as presidents,

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.680
congressmen, or governors,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.010
but every citizen of
the United States.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.430
And again, just to
highlight this period,

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:59.090
just hours after he gave this
speech, Medgar Evers was gunned

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:04.220
down in his driveway and
killed in Jackson, Mississippi.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:11.060
On June 26, 1963, HR 7152
was introduced in the House

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.110
of Representatives and as head
of the Sponsoring Department,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.990
Robert Kennedy was
the first to testify.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.770
Burke Marshall recalled,
told Victor Navasky,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.150
when President Kennedy sent
up that Civil Rights Bill,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.600
every single person who spoke
about it in the White House,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.050
every one of them was against
President Kennedy sending

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.180
up that bill, against
his speech in June,

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.440
against making it a moral issue.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.270
The conclusive voice within
the government at that time,

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.470
there is no question
about it at all,

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.130
that Robert Kennedy was the one.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:51.970
He urged it, he felt it, he
understood it, and he prevailed.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.510
I don't think that
there was anyone

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.530
in the cabinet except the
president himself who felt

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.110
that way on these issues.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.860
And the president got
it from his brother.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.410
Now someone told me
that in the exhibit,

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.740
there's a film showing
Kennedy being--

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.060
deciding whether to make the
speech or not and the look

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.720
on his face and his
brother working with him

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.090
to bring him to agree
to do that.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:21.950
So it's right down that exhibit,
you can see how this plays out.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.900
So, work towards the bill--

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.400
the bipartisan collation for the
bill begins and the books by--

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.860
the Wayland's [inaudible]
book on the bill and Risen

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.410
and Todd Purdum, kind of getting
to the nitty-gritty of that.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.090
A lot of it happens
under the Kennedy watch,

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.500
they get McCullough
lined up immediately,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.960
and then just the tough work
of patching that together.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.600
But it's again important
to remember,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.700
as the bill moves forward, we
have the march on Washington

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:53.910
which captivates the nation and
King's "I have a dream" speech,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:59.240
and then on September 15th-- I'm
going to go to my PowerPoint.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.230
Sorry. I'm technically
challenged here.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.090
I want to move forward.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.090
That's '63, a rally that spring.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.980
But I don't want to
put that up there.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.890
The Klansmen bomb, it was right

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:17.950
after school desegregation
finally began in Alabama,

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:20.490
George Wallace tried to oppose
it, he couldn't stop it,

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.350
the schools are being
desegregated,

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.150
and Klansmen bombed the
16th Street Baptist Church

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.060
that September, killing
four girls aged 11 to 14.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.010
The day after the
bombing of the church,

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:36.350
the Prince Edward Country Free
School opened in Farmville,

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.690
fulfilling Robert
Kennedy's efforts.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.470
For the first time in four
years, 1,500 black children

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.670
in Prince Edward County
were able to attend school.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:50.080
Of course, as we know, President
Kennedy was assassinated

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.760
that November 22nd.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.810
Lyndon Johnson made passage
of the Civil Rights Bill,

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.120
John F. Kennedy's Civil Rights
Bill, his first priority.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.420
No memorial, oration, or eulogy
could more eloquently honor

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.040
President Kennedy's memory
than that earliest passage

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.250
of the Civil Rights Bill for
which he fought for so long.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.670
He failed to add with
the steadfast help

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.190
and work of his brother.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.560
The political master worked in
tandem with a remarkable array

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.650
of forces, most significantly
the team that Kennedy had built

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.060
in the Civil Rights division.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.970
I read an interview by Frank
Valeo, who was Secretary

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.120
of the Senate then and
he said, Burke Marshall

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.910
and Nicholas Katzenbach, I mean
they knew the bill inside-out,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.790
they lobby very effectively,
they were as important,

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.150
if not more important
than Lyndon Johnson.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.020
Now I don't think we
need to assign credit,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.930
but it's important to
think of this foundation.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.530
And I've heard it said
that they wouldn't have--

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.280
it wouldn't have passed
without Lyndon Johnson.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.910
Well, it wouldn't have been
a bill without the Kennedy's.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.870
And I think the work of
the Civil Rights division

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.270
that Robert Kennedy built
is enormously important

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.520
and overlooked to
a great extent,

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.260
and of course this remarkable
coalition that comes together

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:05.010
and helps to see this
bill pass a filibuster.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:11.210
The bill passed on-- passed
the Senate just about the end

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.850
of the day, its introduction the
previous June, and on July 2nd,

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.040
Lyndon Johnson signed
the Civil Rights Act,

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.420
one of the most important
and transformative laws

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.590
in the history of
the United States.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:28.190
Two weeks later,
a police shooting

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.140
of James Pal [assumed spelling],
a 15-year-old black teenager

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.190
in New York City, ignited
race riots in Harlem

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.680
and Bedford-Stuyvesant,
signaling a turn

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.330
that revealed the fragility of
the coalition that had grown

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.510
up during in 1960s
and preview to a new,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.920
even more challenging phase

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.980
of America's long
struggle with race.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.090
Shortly before he left the
department to run for Senate

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:57.140
in August of 1964, Robert
Kennedy met with Lyndon Johnson

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.970
and then he followed it up with
a memo urging the president

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.940
to convene a conference
of mayors and begin

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.460
to systematically address
America's city's, housing,

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.550
education, poverty,
criminal justice issues.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.620
Elected to the Senate
from New York that fall,

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.510
Robert Kennedy emerged
as a political leader

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.050
in his own right during
a transitional time

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.840
for the country and for
Kennedy in aftermath

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.010
of his brother's assassination.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.360
Jack Newfield has commented
or commented in his book,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.770
"Experience began to
stretch, Bobby Kennedy,

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.620
tragedy transformed him."

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.460
In ways similar to Martin
Luther King, Kennedy began

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.390
to concentrate attention
on the deep-rooted racial,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.960
economic inequities, and
injustices that had been exposed

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.190
by the Civil Rights Movement and
did not lend themselves to easy

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.210
or to clearer solutions.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.240
And they both worked
to cultivate

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.810
and expand upon the promise
of the Civil Rights years.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.110
This Kennedy speaking.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.710
"We have gone as for as goodwill

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.330
and even good legislation
will take us.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.260
We must now act to bring about
changes in the conditions

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.700
which breed intolerance
and discrimination",

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.130
he commented late in
the spring of 1965.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.910
In August '65, a riot
in the Watts section

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.510
of Los Angeles just five days

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.870
after Lyndon Johnson signed
the Voting Rights Act,

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.720
marked the most deadly
and destructive riots

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.250
in American history, once again
ignited by long-term problems

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.380
of police violence and abuses.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.480
Five days of rioting claimed
34 lives and $400 million--

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.340
$40 million in property damage.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.820
Kennedy and his aide,
Peter Edelman went--

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.300
traveled to Los Angeles,
where they confronted--

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.830
and I think I've got
this little phrase right,

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.200
what Peter Edelman described

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.410
as the warzone here
in our own country.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.260
Former President Eisenhower
echoed a growing refrain

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.120
claiming that the problem facing
American cities was the need

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.630
for greater respect for the law.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.930
I'll go back to this.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.560
All right.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.340
Kennedy countered,
there's no point

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.490
in telling Negroes
to obey the law.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.750
To many Negroes, the
law is the enemy.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.260
In Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant,

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.790
it has almost always
been used against them.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:16.050
In the aftermath of Watts, King
turns his head into Chicago

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.560
with his campaign to end slums

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.620
and Robert Kennedy
initiated plans

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.220
of what would become the
Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:27.270
Project, a bold experiment-- a
bold public-private partnership

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.610
which is much written about

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:32.370
and it's fascinating,
a remarkable effort.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.330
The first community development
corporation of the country,

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.290
it was organized around
a systematic attack

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.820
on ghetto conditions.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.730
Programs focused of job
training and creation,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.550
housing restoration
and construction,

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.750
health and recreation,
schooling, economic development.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.550
Kennedy said early on, you
know, problems in factions

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.720
and because the community
was directly, you know,

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.270
had full partnership in this
when they were fundraising,

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.570
people they raised money from,

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.030
government money,
philanthropists.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.180
So Kennedy said early on, I'm
not sure it's going to work

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.420
but it's going to
test some new ideas,

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.700
some new ways of doing things.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.840
Even if we fail, we'll have
learned, but more important

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.040
than that, something
must be done.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.790
People like myself can't go

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.350
around making nice
speeches all the time.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:23.300
We've got-- We have to do
some damn hard work too.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.060
Problems of race and poverty
and of faith in the capacity

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.180
of Americans to act
collectively to begin

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.320
to remedy these injustice--
injustices were at the center

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.840
of Robert Kennedy's
public life as a senator,

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.070
and his presidential candidacy.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.120
He traveled to cities
around the country.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.820
He exposed himself to the depths

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.240
of rural poverty
in the Deep South.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.890
Here he is with of Marian
Wright Edelman in Mississippi,

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.620
where he traveled
in '67 and horrified

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.940
by the poverty he saw there, and
to the conditions and struggles

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.310
against the poverty
in South Africa.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.320
In one of his last
speeches given the day

00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:00.110
after Martin Luther
King was killed,

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.620
and that's the night
King was killed,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.870
he gave an amazing speech
off the back of a truck,

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.490
which everyone should read.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.600
And the next morning,
he gave one more speech,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.580
the last until King was-- until
the funeral, but he wanted

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.650
to talk about what he called
the mindless menace of violence.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.090
And just to phrase from
that remarkable speech,

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.660
he spoke about the kind of
violence that was slower

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.890
but just as deadly, destructive
as the shot or the bomb

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.670
in the night, this is the
violence in institutions,

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.670
indifference, and in
action and slow decay.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.920
This is the violence
that affects the poor,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.750
and poisons relations
between men

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.330
because their skin
has different colors.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.950
This is the slow destruction
of a child by hunger,

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.270
and schools without books,

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.200
and homes without
heat in the winter.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.690
The question is whether we
can find in our own midst

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.600
and our own hearts that
leadership of humane purpose

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.060
that will recognize the terrible
truths of our existence.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:59.380
But I want to end on another
note that was equally part

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:03.400
of his approach and feeling
about the moment he was living

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.400
and working in, words

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.790
to the young anti-apartheid
activist he visited

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.780
in South Africa in June of 1966,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.760
which really I think
captured the spirit

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.880
of the Civil Rights
legacy-- Movement's legacy,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.700
as well as Robert Kennedy's.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.850
The road toward equality
and freedom is not easy

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.370
and great cost and
danger march alongside us.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:30.050
Still, even in the turbulence
of protest and struggle,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.000
there is greater hope for the
future as men learn to claim

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.930
and achieve for themselves
the rights formally petitioned

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.230
by others.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.030
Thank you.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:55.980
[ Applause ]

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.000
Some questions?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.850
Questions, comments?

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.150
Yes?

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:04.970
&gt;&gt; On the map you showed,
there was a lot of Department

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.130
of Justice action in
Mississippi and Alabama.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.600
And I was just curious
why not so much

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.630
in Georgia or South Carolina?

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.310
Why was that [inaudible]
chosen by Kennedy and--

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.570
&gt;&gt; That was actually all
throughout the South,

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.790
but they had a-- he wanted, you
know, cases in every country

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.370
in those three Deep
South states.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.760
I guess they will
consider it the, you know,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.440
the most resistant and toughest.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.750
And it was Mississippi who
had a major project going

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.380
on with SNCC.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.960
So, it wasn't that it weren't in
other countries but there was a,

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.100
you know, a concentrated
effort given their, you know,

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.810
resources and lawyer power.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.910
But I haven't read a
specific explanation of that.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.750
But I would assume that was it.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.860
And I'm sorry, I'll
repeat the question.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.840
That was a question about why
the Justice Department map,

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.940
the pins were concentrated
in three states

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.240
and whether the Justice
Department was active

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.540
in other states in the South?

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:07.730
Yes?

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:12.390
&gt;&gt; The Kennedy's did not
like President Johnson

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:15.290
or Vice President Johnson.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.230
What do you think Bob Kennedy
thought towards Johnson

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.900
after passing the
Civil Rights Act?

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.200
Did he change opinion?

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.320
&gt;&gt; You know, I think personally,
I mean-- as we all get older,

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.870
we know there are people
we don't get along with,

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.290
there are conflicts
and tensions.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.860
I think too much attention
in terms the relationship

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.910
between John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson,

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.910
I think we get too
caught up in that.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.630
I think that, you know, one
thing that really strikes me

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.980
after knowing this history more,
how cold Lyndon Johnson was

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.520
to him when he signed
the Civil Rights Act.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.010
Robert Kennedy made it
possible for Lyndon Johnson

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:49.450
to have that bill to sign.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.310
That is a fact of
history which--

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.640
And I think that's important.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.250
How they felt about each other?

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:58.100
That's deeply psychological,
personal,

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.330
it did not inhibit
this work, you know,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.120
and I think that's
important too.

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.050
But I think it's important for
scholars to really look at.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.530
And the other thing is that, you
know, as Robert Kennedy develops

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:14.790
and evolves and opens up
his concerns to the nature

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.950
of racial inequality and the
deep problem this country had,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.330
historically grounded
and structural.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:26.530
Lyndon Johnson, his response
to the urban violence,

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.680
his response, you know, we
had money going to the war

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.350
in Vietnam, poverty
funds shrinking,

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.780
so very different paths

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:37.170
that they both travel during
this post Civil Rights Voting

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.470
Rights period.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.320
And Robert Kennedy's leadership

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.740
and growth during this era is
very significant and important

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.740
in terms of thinking about his
role in the 1960s around these--

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.040
the struggles and issues.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.790
Peter.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.250
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little
bit more about the--

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.890
both President Kennedy
and RFK's relationship

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:07.030
to the Civil Rights Movement
in terms of finally handing

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:11.930
out to the president and making
the proposal for the '64 Act?

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.830
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan: The
relationship of John F. Kennedy

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.930
and Robert Kennedy to the Civil
Rights Movement, you know,

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.540
that's-- I hope to learn more
about that as I go forward.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.360
I think it's better than
we've been led to believe.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.850
And I also think historians
have been too quick to kind

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.100
of take the perspective of
the activist on the ground,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.250
which is important, you know,
what they're going through

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.650
and what they're experiencing.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.730
And not realizing
the-- what was--

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.180
they were trying to do at
federal level and the kind

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.500
of constraints that existed.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:51.160
So-- But I do know that
Robert Moses now talks

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.390
about John Doris, this lawyer.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:57.440
And he talks about, you know,
what it meant to have access.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.060
They had clear access

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.280
to the Civil Rights
Division at all times.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.210
And I interviewed
Thelton Henderson

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:08.610
who was the only African
American attorney hired to--

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.650
well, the first, and
this is something,

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.840
to work in the field,
on this field team.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.200
And he told me-- he got
to know, of course, King.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.060
He had to stay in the hotels
where a lot of the-- in--

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.680
especially in Birmingham,
the Gaston.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.400
That he felt that movement
people knew the Kennedy

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.860
administration was
responsive and that helped

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.790
to generate the momentum
of the movement.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.950
So I think that's a
great question and I hope

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.910
that the work I'm doing will
help open it up and sort

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.090
of contextualize it a
bit more than looking

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.470
at this side, that side.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:40.770
Our country.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:45.050
I mean the segregation-- you
know, the way people felt

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:48.520
about this issue, how
deeply entrenched it was,

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.540
and this is democracy, right?

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.470
The political challenges
were huge.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:57.970
And when they were debating
that bill, what was happening

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.170
in the north around the World's
Fair and all, at one point,

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.240
McCullough says the deal was
off if they protest at the--

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.560
you know, blocked traffic
to the World's Fair.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.000
So the context is very fragile.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.390
And I think what you see with--

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.250
in the Kennedy administration
is this,

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.550
especial the Civil
Rights Division

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.300
and Robert Kennedy pushing,
trying to find ways to go.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:22.570
But that relationship I think, I
hope I can take a closer look at

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.350
and have something
fresh to say, thanks.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:30.380
&gt;&gt; The video clip from
the exhibit was used a lot

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.440
because it's very reflective
of that relationship,

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.040
the Kennedy relationship.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.000
Bobby was the only
one that spoke up

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.850
and said you have
to give a speech.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:47.730
And it's a fly on the
wall documentation.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.030
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
That's right.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.330
&gt;&gt; Of the relationship.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.130
And then the subsequent
clip of the speech itself

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:57.580
when Kennedy [inaudible] went
contemporaneous without a script

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:04.280
for four minutes and that speech
on live TV in a convincing way.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.580
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
Oh yeah, he --

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.520
&gt;&gt; Without mentioning the act at
all, but focusing on community

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:16.180
and activity in the community
and the need for racial justice.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.390
That is a real key.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.130
For those that haven't
seen that,

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.240
[inaudible] taken
a moment of that--

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.540
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
That's right.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.210
&gt;&gt; -- that fly on the
wall, why they were there

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:26.510
with that camera at that time.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:31.150
I just don't see
that insider view.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.650
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
You know, I think that--

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.110
I think that's so terrific
that there's a film

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.040
of this discussion about should
he give the speech that night.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.000
The-- I think that's what
you call crisis and sort

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.890
of a cinema verite
where a camera

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:47.540
who follows George Wallace all
that day and Robert Kennedy.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.170
And I think maybe they
were the ones who filmed

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.630
that episode in--
when they were talking

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:54.060
about whether to
give the speech.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.560
I'm going to run and go and see.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.180
&gt;&gt; I can go back and see that--

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.930
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan: Yeah.

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.740
&gt;&gt; -- because I think that's
real key to that relationship

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.600
and how things proceeded.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.900
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
No, very important.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.360
It's wonderful that it's here.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:11.060
And that-- Can that be
obtained online as well?

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.360
&gt;&gt; I think it's online.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.660
&gt;&gt; Not yet.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.960
&gt;&gt; We're working on it.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.260
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan: OK.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.560
That would be great.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.860
I mean for teaching, it would
be terrific for teaching.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.060
Yes. OK.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.580
&gt;&gt; I wonder if there was
that three-hour meeting

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.920
with intellectuals and artists,

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:30.010
was it a one time
only conversation

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.020
or did these conversations

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.560
with those people
continue [inaudible]?

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:41.160
If not, [inaudible] they
still opened up a dialogue.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.120
Or was it just that one time?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.420
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
That's a great question.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.310
If-- The people that Robert
Kennedy met with James Baldwin,

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.950
Harry Belafonte [assumed
spelling], Lena Horne,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:57.970
number about 10 people in
the end of May of 1963.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.800
He and Belafonte continued.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.640
I mean he felt that Belafonte
didn't step up, you know,

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.940
during that discussion.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.060
He thought that Belafonte
knew him.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.370
But-- So it was just
so divisive.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.740
But I don't have any
evidence that he and Baldwin--

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.900
They weren't, you
know, they met and all.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.500
And again, this period,
it's so intense.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.830
I think Kenneth Clark, Kenneth
Clark really respect Robert

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.730
Kennedy and he thought he got it

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:24.160
about education and
about children.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.360
So-- But I should
trace that out.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.930
I don't know for sure, yup.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.230
Yes.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.680
&gt;&gt; What do you think are
the most important lessons

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.980
for young advocates who are
still working on the issues

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:43.280
of racial discrimination

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.610
and police brutality [inaudible]
could learn from Robert Kennedy?

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.910
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
What are the lessons

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:51.280
for people working today around
issues of police brutality

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.630
and violence that we're seeing?

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.540
What can they learn
from Robert Kennedy?

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.720
I think first of all, what,
people even facing issue, right?

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.880
I mean just facing the issue
and trying to understand it.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.120
You know, going,
talking to people,

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.000
and trying to build a
collective response.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.810
You know what I mean,
to deal with the abuses

00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:14.450
and the violations of law.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.000
But then how do we
organize ourselves locally,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.460
starting locally,
and as a country

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.240
because these are the issues

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.430
that we're left in
the late '60s.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.860
I mean it's really
eerie to think

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.610
about how similar they are.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.050
But I think that's-- And to
understand too the long haul.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:37.600
That's what I tell my
students, it's the long haul.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.900
It's really.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.170
What-- We've been-- We've
lived with a lot of this,

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:43.730
but we have had tremendous
change.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:48.110
And Robert Kennedy, how he lived
his life and faced the issues

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:52.380
and worked actively to do
his part and work with people

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.610
to begin to make some changes,

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:58.950
not just around criminal
justice issues but education.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:02.610
All these things are
connected, that he was concerned

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.480
about in this part of his life,

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.780
so to work on the
various community issues

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.750
that also are such a problem.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:14.100
Do you have a thought
about that though yourself?

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:19.170
&gt;&gt; I think, you know,
we still face--

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:25.080
I think that the
perception of what happens

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.340
in the police brutality issues.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:35.610
I think that it's still
very racially divided based

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.620
on experience because
people are [inaudible].

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.570
I think that in terms of
domestic transportation issue,

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:40.870
that's another racially
divided issue because I think

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:42.170
that the perception of
people who don't deal

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:43.470
with racial conflict on a
day-to-day basis is that--

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.770
well, the people who deal
with those isolate events.

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.070
They're isolated.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:50.120
You know, they only
happen sometime,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.760
it's because of their
characters,

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.060
because they're [inaudible].

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.290
But then when you
think of the holistic,

00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:58.740
like what you're saying
about education and community

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.420
and environment, there's so many
different reasons why people may

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.720
end up in those type
of situations,

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.050
whether it'd be going to jail or
being suspended by the police.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.080
And I think that
lack of perception,

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.170
that lack of knowledge
and that lack

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:12.910
of experience just
creates an unwillingness

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.130
to accept what's
happening for people

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:16.430
who don't live in
those situations.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:17.730
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
You said-- That's--

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.030
Thank you for that,
lack of knowledge,

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:22.650
lack of experience,
lack of caring too.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:25.970
That litany he read
or said at his--

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.850
and he said that in a number
of places about the difference

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:33.770
between the gap between what
African Americans and whites,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.070
you know, in all areas.

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:41.290
Like, that continues the measure
of, you know, of the difference

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:45.490
in economic opportunity,
educational access, income,

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:47.330
you know, dealings
with the police.

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.110
So, you know, we need
to look at our history

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.690
and understand who we are.

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.990
You know, and that's
what he said.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:56.940
He said when he spoke after
King, who are we as a country?

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.240
And people really need to look

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.200
at our history to
understand that.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.260
And where do we want
to go, you know.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:08.160
And I think looking at this
in this larger context can add

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.540
to that in this moment.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.840
Yes?

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.140
&gt;&gt; I think that one

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:17.100
of the lessons was people
should take more walks.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.330
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
I think that's true too,

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.630
take more walks.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:22.930
Yes. Marilyn.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:24.230
&gt;&gt; Just one.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:28.510
First, thank you so much--

00:55:28.510 --> 00:56:51.820
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
That's-- Yeah.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.940
That's-- And that
really is what's

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.630
at the center of their concern.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:03.260
And Peter Edelman, not
to put you on the spot

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.650
but I've read there's
several places that--

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.130
I mean, thinking about--

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:10.710
I've been really interested in
how King and Kennedy are kind

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.350
of moving in very
similar directions.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:13.980
They didn't see a lot
of each other and all,

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:20.470
but they're really-- and the
Poor People's Campaign that you

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:26.550
and Marian had been visiting
with Robert and Ethel Kennedy

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.820
and he suggested to
Marian that she'd tell King

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.010
to bring the poor
people to Washington

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:33.880
and stay there until--

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:37.090
and Marian goes to the
SCLC Convention that summer

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:39.420
and the Poor People's
Campaign is launched.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.700
So, maybe Dr. King
was thinking about.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.310
But the important thing is
they're thinking along the

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:46.770
same ways.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:50.290
And that thing about
yourself, people have got

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:52.180
to make demands, right?

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:57.560
I mean, who represents poor
people, poor people, right?

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.230
That's a huge-- Would you
like to speak to that point

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.570
that Marilyn made
about what to do?

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.590
I mean, you teach
a poverty seminar

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:08.500
about the current
economic crisis

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.510
and how that affects-- Yeah.

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:29.770
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.910
No, that's important.

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:35.660
&gt;&gt; And going back to
the act side of it,

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.970
the ways in which the
inequality has just exacerbated

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:45.420
so many other, other problems.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.510
And I do think that there's
a-- just like you said,

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:54.160
like there's a-- sort of
a disconnect with-- of--

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.150
at least we'll see what
comes out of these current

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:04.050
and recent events but it's a
very [inaudible] while we're

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:07.510
at it, talking about gender.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.810
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan: Right.

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.110
Race and gender.

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.910
Yes. Great.

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:23.610
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:26.760
I think-- What's the
legacy of Robert Kennedy?

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.080
I think it's that-- well, the
work he was doing right then

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.620
at the end of his life is left
for us to do now, you know.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.440
I mean, that he was doing it.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.460
And, you know, that experiencing
nature, I love that note,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:39.210
she lived in his world.

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:40.580
And, you know, he
said at one point,

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.500
you don't make the
world, you inherited it.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.160
You inherit, but you
live in it, and you need

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.460
to do what you can while
you're here, you know.

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.500
So, you didn't create
the problems, fine,

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.070
but you're living here now.

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:57.620
And I think that approach
and that sort of civic sense

00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.380
of responsibility and a real--

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.570
a faith in democracy not in
a naïve way, but in that--

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:08.470
what it takes to address these
issues and to be part of trying

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:09.770
to move things forward.

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:14.150
It's a living legacy
because he kept growing.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.240
He just kept throughout
his life.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.960
And during this extraordinary
decade when public service

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.440
and people really felt they
could change things, many people

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.150
and dedicated themselves
to trying to do that,

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.420
but that's always available
and it's really the only way.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:33.380
&gt;&gt; I think one of his famous
quotes every man can make a

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.340
difference and each
man should try.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.640
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
That's good.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.160
Every man can make a difference
and each man should try.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.570
Yeah. Should we take one more?

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.370
Yeah?

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:58.200
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.640
At his death, were there any--
this is a question for Peter.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.860
I don't know, but I think it's
evident in what he was saying

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.640
and doing and-- like the
Bedford-Stuyvesant project,

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.940
other things.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.240
You know, the question
is, what--

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.770
any indication of what his
policies would have been going

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.710
forward, what his plans were.

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:20.210
&gt;&gt; Oh I could-- Number one,
end the war in Vietnam.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.040
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
Yes, end the war.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:30.500
&gt;&gt; Absolutely number one, but
as far as these issues of praise

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:37.210
and poverty together,
the thing--

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:43.090
he was very three-dimensional
in terms of things

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.930
that he pushed forth and so on.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:49.200
So-- But the thing,

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.540
it was certainly also
the top for him was jobs.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.840
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
Jobs, OK.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.460
&gt;&gt; And of course that very much
you were talking-- asking--

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.990
talking about Dr.
King that was--

01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:04.820
he had gone in that
direction as well.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:10.500
And specifically,
the whole question,

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.340
I heard somebody say this
morning and where I was

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:19.620
that that you can tell
person's life expectancy

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.110
by their zip code.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:27.120
And that he certainly when you
talked about Bedford-Stuyvesant,

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.020
he was-- again, there would
have been many other ideas

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:37.310
but very much in the forefront
for him was the question

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:40.370
of what are we going to do

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:41.820
in this neighborhood
[inaudible] as well.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan: Right.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.190
&gt;&gt; Where there's so many
people who were in poverty

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:47.900
who were all packed together.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.850
And I think that was
on the domestic side

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.520
and the questions
have raised on poverty

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.060
about which he was absolutely
have them conjoined in his mine.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.020
Particularly, King with the
focal point on the question

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:04.770
of concentrated poverty.

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.330
&gt;&gt; Patricia A. Sullivan:
Concentrate, thank you.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:07.630
Thank you.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.230
That's great explanation.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.040
OK. Anything else?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.340
OK. Thank you.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.570
Thank you [applause].
