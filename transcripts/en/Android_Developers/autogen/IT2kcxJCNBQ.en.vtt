00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.577
 Developing games for me 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.875
 Similar to the need to breathe 

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.471
 Sunlight, air intake, drinking water and toys 

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:10.666
 I wanted to achieve something from a young age. 

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.585
 It is a strong desire, such as breathing and life needs. 

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.648
 Some believe that developing games alone makes me feel lonely 

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.991
 But this is not true at all 

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.662
 Because developing games on my own allows me 

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.622
 An opportunity to work with authors and vocal talent from around the world 

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:28.294
 In order to offer our product to players from all over the world. 

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:30.524
 This is what happened in the previous game I developed 

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:33.306
 Which has been installed 5 million times on Google Play 

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.493
 I got 16,000 comments. 

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.848
 I love electronic music 

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:39.635
 And some geometric shapes. 

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.520
 With the addition of mathematics and physics 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.484
 Magnetized, for example 

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:46.800
 Enjoy the old fashioned style with a little dancing music. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.502
 Beat Stomper has modern EDM music. 

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:53.893
 The music of the game "Push &amp; Pop" resembles the music of the 1980s 

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:56.462
 With the addition of 2.5D optical pattern. 

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:59.555
 The three games may look alike 

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:02.204
 But that's the fun part of gaming development 

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:03.902
 The use of limited resources 

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:06.126
 To explore unlimited opportunities. 

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.124
 When I was young, I was playing with my brother 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.875
 All the classic games of the time. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.426
 My favorite game was a shooting game from a spaceship. 

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.444
 We were looking for this kind of great shooting games for a long time. 

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.426
 Finally, I decided with my brothers to develop a game by ourselves. 

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.715
 That's why we called the workshop the name "Uwan". 

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.026
 At first, we used Java to develop games. 

00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:28.293
 At this time, there were no global platforms 

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:30.133
 So, I was marketing my toys locally only. 

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.493
 Then we launched our first mobile game 

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.693
 "Lightning Fighter 2" 

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.280
 Which was downloaded more than a million times after launch. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.995
 Thanks to Google Play Store Store Experiences 

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:44.943
 The "Lightning Fighter 2" installation rate has increased to 91% in Indonesia. 

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:46.662
 As well as Lightning Fighter 2 

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:50.195
 We also designed a strategic correction game "Lightning Rangers" 

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.786
 Which require more server-related technologies. 

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:57.813
 So, we decided to use Google Cloud, which helped us a lot in developing the game. 

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:01.537
 We used Labs in the Google Play Alpha Beta 

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:05.884
 For ratings comments in numbers from the players before launching the product 

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.932
 As well as to improve game quality. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.622
 The goal of developing games is to touch the hopes of every player 

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.542
 This is the ultimate goal. 

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.742
 OPUS came up with exploration and stories. 

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:20.364
 Every Saturday night, we hope the players can 

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:23.937
 From enjoying touching stories by exploring the games we offer. 

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:27.697
 This experience is like reading a wonderful novel. 

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:31.528
 Using a background service like "Google Play Services" 

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.715
 We can update games more quickly 

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.275
 To provide the best aspects of our games to all users. 

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.084
 For average revenue per user and successful referral rate, 

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:40.604
 OPUS Earth Project developed 

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:44.624
 By more than 200% in a very short period. 

00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:48.240
 This is for an independent gaming developer like me 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.324
 Consider a great help.
