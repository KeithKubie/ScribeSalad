00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.336
I tell our students

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:03.212
to push the limits,

00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:04.004
make it go faster,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.339
make it lift heavier things,

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.632
and I tell the students

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.634
to break the robot.

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:09.426
Because if the robot

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:09.885
doesn't fall

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:11.011
and doesn't break...

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.637
Very nice

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:13.639
You don't get to learn anything.
