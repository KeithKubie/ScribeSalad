00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.110
the main reason why oil prices are

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120
the main reason why oil prices are
 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.379
the main reason why oil prices are
falling is that we had a stretch of time

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389
falling is that we had a stretch of time
 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.930
falling is that we had a stretch of time
where we had rising supply from North

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
where we had rising supply from North
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.919
where we had rising supply from North
America matched by falling supply from

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
America matched by falling supply from
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019
America matched by falling supply from
other places because of developments in

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
other places because of developments in
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.140

Libya developments in Iraq developments

Libya developments in Iraq developments
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.589
Libya developments in Iraq developments
in Iran and the run of bad supply

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
in Iran and the run of bad supply
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.250
in Iran and the run of bad supply
developments has largely stopped and the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
developments has largely stopped and the
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080
developments has largely stopped and the
positive supply developments in the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
positive supply developments in the
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170
positive supply developments in the
United States have continued and the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
United States have continued and the
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240
United States have continued and the
expectation that that will continue in

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
expectation that that will continue in
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209
expectation that that will continue in
the future is leading to a significant

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
the future is leading to a significant
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.020
the future is leading to a significant
decline in the price of oil my guess and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
decline in the price of oil my guess and
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420
decline in the price of oil my guess and
guesses about oil prices are highly

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
guesses about oil prices are highly
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.819
guesses about oil prices are highly
problematic is that they're going to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
problematic is that they're going to
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340
problematic is that they're going to
stay down since it seems to me there's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
stay down since it seems to me there's
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.130
stay down since it seems to me there's
probably more room for positive supply

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
probably more room for positive supply
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.310
probably more room for positive supply
surprises from here than there is for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
surprises from here than there is for
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200
surprises from here than there is for
negative supply surprises no one really

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
negative supply surprises no one really
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.560
negative supply surprises no one really
knows the price sensitivity of tight oil

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570
knows the price sensitivity of tight oil
 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.999
knows the price sensitivity of tight oil
shale type oil in the United States my

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
shale type oil in the United States my
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.149
shale type oil in the United States my
best guess would be that at prices above

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
best guess would be that at prices above
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.670
best guess would be that at prices above

$60 the broad trend towards increasing
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.710
$60 the broad trend towards increasing
u.s. supplies will continue and so I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
u.s. supplies will continue and so I
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.270
u.s. supplies will continue and so I
think we are making progress towards

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280
think we are making progress towards
 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.460
think we are making progress towards
energy independence though I think

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
energy independence though I think
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.859
energy independence though I think
energy independence is a somewhat

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
energy independence is a somewhat
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.330
energy independence is a somewhat
complex goal and may mean less than

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
complex goal and may mean less than
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310
complex goal and may mean less than
presidents of the United States have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
presidents of the United States have
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.649
presidents of the United States have
often implied that it means Japan and

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659
often implied that it means Japan and
 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.870
often implied that it means Japan and
Europe remain dependent on Middle East

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
Europe remain dependent on Middle East
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.260
Europe remain dependent on Middle East
oil and it is hard to believe that we

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
oil and it is hard to believe that we
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.480
oil and it is hard to believe that we
could ever allow a situation to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
could ever allow a situation to
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.700
could ever allow a situation to
materialize where there was a vast

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
materialize where there was a vast
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.730
materialize where there was a vast
difference in price between the price of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
difference in price between the price of
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.790
difference in price between the price of
oil in Japan and Europe and the price in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
oil in Japan and Europe and the price in
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.610
oil in Japan and Europe and the price in
the United States and so if one asks the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
the United States and so if one asks the
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.850
the United States and so if one asks the
fun

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550

mental question is the world price of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
mental question is the world price of
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640
mental question is the world price of
oil vulnerable to what happens in the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
oil vulnerable to what happens in the
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860
oil vulnerable to what happens in the
Middle East the answer to that question

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
Middle East the answer to that question
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050
Middle East the answer to that question
is probably somewhat less than it was

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
is probably somewhat less than it was
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.720
is probably somewhat less than it was
but it is still very vulnerable to what

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
but it is still very vulnerable to what
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.820
but it is still very vulnerable to what
happens in the Middle East and in that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
happens in the Middle East and in that
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.150
happens in the Middle East and in that
sense even if the United States stops

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160
sense even if the United States stops
 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.300
sense even if the United States stops
being a net importer of oil it will

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
being a net importer of oil it will
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.690
being a net importer of oil it will
still be very vulnerable and can't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
still be very vulnerable and can't
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.520
still be very vulnerable and can't
really be said to be energy independent
