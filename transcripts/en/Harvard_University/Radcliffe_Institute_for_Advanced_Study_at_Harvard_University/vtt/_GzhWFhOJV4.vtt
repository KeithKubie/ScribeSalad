PLEASE ALSO JOIN ME IN CONGRATULATING THE

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.319
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:54.610
RADCLIFFE COLLEGE WAS FOUNDED IN 1879 BY VISIONARIES
WHO DARED TO IMAGINE THAT WOMEN COULD AND

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:03.599
SHOULD UNDERTAKE SERIOUS SCHOLARLY INQUIRY
AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD OF IDEAS AND ACTION.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.299
NEARLY A CENTURY LATER ANOTHER VISIONARY,
RADCLIFFE PRESIDENT MARY INGRAM BUNTING, ESTABLISHED

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:17.019
WHAT BECAME THE BUNTING INSTITUTE TO GIVE
EXCEPTIONAL WOMEN THE RESOURCES THEY NEEDED

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.380
TO REACH NEW PROFESSIONAL HEIGHTS.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.180
TODAY THAT BOLD RADCLIFFE SPIRIT IS ALIVE
AND WELL.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.399
SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS, AND ARTISTS COME FROM
AROUND THE WORLD, ACROSS THE COUNTRY, OVER

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:40.700
THE RIVER FROM BOSTON, AND UP THE STREET FROM
HARVARD YARD TO BE PART OF THE RADCLIFFE INSTITUTE.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:48.080
THESE WOMEN AND MEN PURSUE NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT
THE EXISTENCE OF EXTRA SOLAR PLANETS, THE

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.890
IMPACT OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES ON MEDIEVAL
ARCHITECTURE,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.919
THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN COOPERATION,

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.729
THE FORM AND FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN,

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.130
AND HOW TO PUT BIG DATA TO WORK.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.450
THEY DELVE INTO THE PAPERS OF ORDINARY AND
EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.880
THEY WRITE AMBITIOUS NOVELS AND POETRY COLLECTIONS.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.390
THEY IMPROVE PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN,
INVESTIGATE THE FUTURE OF NAVIGATION, AND

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.590
DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING HUMANITARIAN
CRISES.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:30.010
THEY WORK ALONE IN THE SANCTUARY OF AN OFFICE,
OR IN THE SCHLESINGER LIBRARY READING ROOM.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.640
THEY WORK TOGETHER IN RESEARCH TEAMS AND WRITING
GROUPS.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.510
THEY WORK WITH TALENTED AND CURIOUS HARVARD
UNDERGRADUATES THROUGH THE WONDERFUL RADCLIFFE

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.570
RESEARCH PARTNERS PROGRAM.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.150
THEY PRODUCE NEW ART.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.710
ALONG BRATTLE STREET, IN THE WALLACH GARDEN,
YOU CAN SEE A JUST-UNVEILED INSTALLATION BY

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.500
CHRISTINA LEE GEROS OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL
OF DESIGN, WHO WON OUR STUDENT PUBLIC ART

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.409
COMPETITION. PLEASE RETURN AT NIGHT, IF YOU
CAN, TO SEE IT IN ITS FULL GLORY, BRILLIANTLY

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.330
LIT.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.810
IN THE JOHNSON-KULUKUNDIS FAMILY GALLERY,
IN BYERLY HALL, YOU CAN SEE A TREE AS YOU’VE

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.469
NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE, FROM BENEATH THE ROOTS.

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:25.490
AND THIS FALL, IN FRONT OF FAY HOUSE, WE’LL
BE INSTALLING AN INSPIRING NEW SCULPTURE BY

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.220
PHLYSSA KOSHLAND, CLASS OF 1971.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.930
 
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WE INVITE THE PUBLIC

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.200
TO LISTEN, LEARN, AND ENGAGE AT EVENTS THAT
ARE FREE AND INCREDIBLY DIVERSE.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.080
JUST TO MENTION A FEW HIGH POINTS, THIS PAST
YEAR WE HEARD PROVOCATIVE REMARKS FROM

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.470
THE CREATOR OF THE GIANT SUGAR SPHINX IN BROOKLYN,
ARTIST KARA WALKER;

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.430
GEOLOGIST DAVID MONTGOMERY WHO EXPLORES THE
INTERSECTION OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION;

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.690
JAY SMOOTH, THE FOUNDER OF NEW YORK'S LONGEST
RUNNING HIP-HOP RADIO SHOW;

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.640
AND MAJOR GENERAL GINA M. GROSSO, THE DIRECTOR
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.240
FOR THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.370
VIDEOS OF THESE PAST EVENTS, AND MANY OTHERS,
ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:25.010
BUT LET’S ALSO LOOK AHEAD.
I INVITE YOU TO RETURN FOR A CONFERENCE ABOUT

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.339
“CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN AND THE ARCHIVES”
IN JUNE,

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:34.020
FOR AN EXHIBITION ABOUT SISTER CORITA KENT
IN AUGUST,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:40.630
FOR A LECTURE BY SOUTH AFRICAN ACTIVIST DR.
MAMPHELA RAMPHELE IN SEPTEMBER,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.370
AND FOR A SYMPOSIUM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF DNA
IN OCTOBER.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:50.180
AND THAT’S ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT’S IN
STORE IN THE YEAR AHEAD.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.890
THE INSTITUTE'S FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT NOT ONLY
BECAUSE OF THE IDEAS THAT ARE ILLUMINATED

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:02.370
HERE AT THE INSTITUTE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE
RADCLIFFE CAMPAIGN IS GOING VERY WELL.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.769
I'M PLEASED TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE NOW REACHED
63% OF OUR $70 MILLION GOAL FOR A TOTAL OF

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:12.440
$44 MILLION.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.839
SO FAR 6,000 HOUSEHOLDS HAVE GIVEN TO THE
RADCLIFFE CAMPAIGN.

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:22.099
AND I'LL LET YOU APPLAUD FOR THAT.

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:24.089
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:28.209
I REALLY AM PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THIS WIDESPREAD
PARTICIPATION.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.459
AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR GENEROSITY.

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:37.760
WITH YOUR ONGOING SUPPORT, RADCLIFFE WILL
GROW EVEN STRONGER.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:46.580
WHAT UNITES THE RADCLIFFE COMMUNITY IS A BELIEF
IN INQUIRY, IN EXPLORATION, AND IN INNOVATION.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:54.010
THIS YEAR'S RADCLIFFE MEDALIST IS AN INDIVIDUAL
WHOSE LIFE AND WORK REPRESENT THE VALUES THAT

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.850
RADCLIFFE WAS FOUNDED UPON AND CONTINUES TO
UPHOLD TODAY.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.360
RUTH BADER GINSBURG, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.180
CHALLENGED AND CHANGED EXPECTATIONS THROUGHOUT
HER LIFE.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:16.720
MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT SHE WAS BORN AND
RAISED IN BROOKLYN.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.540
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT HER CHILDHOOD
NAME WAS KICKY.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.260
BUT FEW OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT SHE
WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED BATON TWIRLER IN HIGH

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.150
SCHOOL.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.780
HER PEP SQUAD WAS CALLED THE GO GETTERS

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:39.560
AND THAT IS AN APT DESCRIPTION FOR A WOMAN
WHO GRADUATED FIRST IN HER CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.130
FIRST IN HER CLASS AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AT
CORNELL AND FIRST IN HER CLASS AT COLUMBIA

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.470
LAW SCHOOL.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:53.230
TALK ABOUT A GO GETTER.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:00.250
AND JUSTICE GINSBURG IN HER COLLEGE YEARS
WAS MORE THAN STUDIOUS.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:05.360
AT CORNELL SHE BECAME FAST FRIENDS WITH THE
OTHER WOMEN ON HER FLOOR.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.970
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES KHLABIJ, AN ACRONYM
OF THEIR FIRST NAMES, STARTING WITH KICKY

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.980
AS THE "K."

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:19.900
THAT GROUP OF FRIENDS, SIX OF THEM NOW, HAVE
GOTTEN TOGETHER AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:27.840
WHILE NOT EVERYONE HAS AN ACRONYM FOR THEIR
ROOMMATES, THE TENT TODAY IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.590
WHO STARTED FRIENDSHIPS IN COLLEGE HALLWAYS,
AND WHO CONTINUE TO STAY CONNECTED AND TO

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.520
BE IMPORTANT FOR ONE ANOTHER.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.380
FOR THE WOMEN OF KHLABIJ, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT OUR WORLD IN WHICH THREE

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.480
WOMEN SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT, A WOMAN
IS THE PRESIDENT OF HARVARD HARVARD HARVARD

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:56.770
UNIVERSITY, THE CEOS OF GENERAL MOTORS, IBM,
AND PEPSICO ARE WOMEN. A FEMALE FORMER SECRETARY

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.440
OF STATE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.380
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES INCLUDES FOUR WOMEN
WHO HAVE ATTAINED FOUR STAR RANK.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:15.470
AND HALF THE JUNIOR FACULTY HIRED THIS YEAR
AT HARVARD ARE WOMEN.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:21.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.250
THE FIRST TIME GENDER PARITY HAS BEEN REACHED
ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:33.210
MIGHT NOT HAVE EASILY BEEN FORESEEN. BUT MANY
OF YOU HERE TODAY IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IN

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.930
DIFFERENT MOMENTS HELPED MAKE THEM HAPPEN.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:43.150
AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO HONOR HOW ONE PERSON,
OUR HONOREE, RUTH BADER GINSBURG, KNOCKED

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:49.750
ON CLOSED DOORS, OPENED THEM, AND THEN HELD
THEM OPEN FOR OTHERS.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.040
WHEN JUSTICE GINSBURG GRADUATED FROM COLUMBIA
LAW SCHOOL, IT SEEMED UNLIKELY SHE WOULD GET

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.330
A CLERKSHIP, DESPITE HER CLASS RANK.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.480
IF YOU WERE HERE THIS MORNING, YOU HEARD MICHAEL
KLARMAN TELL THIS STORY.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.320
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S
SUCH A GOOD ONE.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:10.561
IT WASN'T JUST THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN, BUT SHE
WAS ALSO A MOTHER. WHO WOULD HIRE HER? PROFESSOR

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:16.880
GERRY GUNTHER, THEN ON THE COLUMBIA FACULTY,
RECOMMENDED JUSTIVE GINSBURG TO MANY, MANY

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.430
JUDGES. HE EVEN PROMISED THESE PERSPECTIVE
EMPLOYERS, THAT IF SHE DIDN'T WORK OUT HE

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.970
WOULD FIND A MALE LAWYER TO REPLACE HER.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:33.240
WITH THAT PROMISE, JUSTICE GINSBURG WAS FINALLY
HIRED BY JUDGE EDMOND PALMIERI OF THE SOUTHERN

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.440
DISTRICT.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.300
AND HOW DID IT GO?

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:44.790
SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT THE NEXT CLERK HIRED
BY JUDGE PALMIERI WAS A WOMAN. JUSTICE GINSBURG

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.940
THEN OPENED OTHER DOORS IN OTHER WAYS.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:54.010
AS THE COFOUNDER OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHT PROJECT
OF THE ACLU, SHE CHALLENGED INEQUALITY BY

00:12:54.010 --> 00:13:02.060
CHANGING LAWS PIECE BY PIECE, CASE BY CASE,
WORKING WITH AND FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE TO ADDRESS

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.320
EVERYDAY INJUSTICES.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.560
SHE WON FIVE OF THE SIX CASES SHE BROUGHT
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.900
HER VICTORIES LED TO IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS
IN THE LIVES OF WOMEN AND MEN AND THEIR FAMILIES.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:21.340
SUCH AS SECURING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS
FOR FATHERS, OBTAINING SPOUSAL BENEFITS FOR

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:28.850
WOMEN IN THE MILITARY, AND ELIMINATING GENDER
BASED JURY SERVICE EXEMPTIONS IN PART BY ARGUING

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:35.610
THAT OPTIONAL JURY DUTY FOR WOMEN TREATS WOMEN'S
SERVICE ON JURIES AS LESS VALUABLE THAN MEN'S

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.380
AND THREATENS WOMEN'S RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A
JURY OF THEIR PEERS.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:46.850
BEGINNING IN 1980, RUTH BADER GINSBURG SERVED
ON THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.850
COLUMBIA.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:54.750
SOME FEARED THAT SHE, A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE
FOR THE COURTS WOULD INTENSIFY A INTENSIFY

00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:01.920
WHAT WAS ALREADY CONSIDERED A HIGHLY POLARIZED
COURT. AGAIN SHE DEIFED EXPECTATIONS.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.960
SHE WAS PARTIAL TO IMPARTIALITY.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.750
SHE SOUGHT CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE
IMPORTANT WORK OF THE APPEALS COURT.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:18.150
AS A JUDGE, SHE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT
NOT TO GENERATING HEAT, BUT TO SHEDDING LIGHT.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:24.550
WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON APPOINTED RUTH BADER
GINSBURG TO THE SUPREME COURT IN 1993, SHE

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:30.420
JOINED SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR AS ONLY THE SECOND
WOMAN ON THE COURT IN ITS HISTORY.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:37.339
IT WAS AN INSTITUTION SO MALE THAT A POPULAR
HISTORY OF THE COURT WAS ENTITLED THE BRETHREN.

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:43.350
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN JUDGES,
AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE PAPERS WE'RE GRATEFUL

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.420
TO HAVE IN THE RADCLIFFE SCHLESINGER LIBRARY,
AND WHOSE MEMBERSHIP IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:55.290
HERE TODAY, BRILLIANTLY UNDERSCORED THE POINT
BY GIVING JUSTICE O'CONNOR A T SHIRT THAT

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:04.150
SAID I'M SANDRA, NOT RUTH. AND JUSTICE GINSBURG
GETS MADE, I'M RUTH NOT SANDRA.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.610
JUSTICE GINSBURG WAS HARDLY INTIMIDATED.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:14.670
IF SHE WAS, NO ONE WHO OBSERVED HER ASKING
QUESTIONS FROM THE BENCH, ENGAGING COLLEAGUES

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.300
OR ISSUING QUESTIONS COULD DETECT IT.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.950
A SELECTION OF MAJORITY OPINIONS SHE WROTE
INCLUDES ELIMINATING THE BAN ON WOMEN AT THE

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:29.330
VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE. ENABLING A PARENT
TO TRY TO REGAIN CUSTODY OF HER CHILDREN DESPITE

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.990
HER INABILITY TO PAY COURT FEES.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:38.360
STRENGTHENING THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL EPA
TO ENFORCE THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.850
DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL
DISABILITIES TO LIVE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.120
AND NOT BE INSTITUTIONALIZED.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.490
UPHOLDING THE RIGHT OF A DEATH PENALTY DEFENDANT
TO TURN TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:58.670
AS A COURT OF LAST RESORT, AND SHIELDING CITIZENS
FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:04.100
A DOZEN YEARS AGO JUSTICE GINSBURG WAS PART
OF THE MAJORITY OPINION ALLOWING RACE TO BE

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:09.170
A PART OF FACTOR IN LAW SCHOOL ADMISSIONS
IN RECOGNITION THAT DISCRIMINATION LIVES ON

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.230
IN AMERICA DESPITE OUR HOPES AND IDEALS TO
THE CONTARY.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:20.910
WHILE SOME IN THE MAJORITY FORECAST THAT RACE
BASED CONSIDERATIONS WOULD SURELY NOT BE RELEVANT

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:28.560
25 YEARS AFTER THE DECISION, JUSTICES GINSBURG
AND BREYER TOOK A LESS SANGUINED VIEW.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.810
THESE DAYS THEIR DOUBTS SEEM ALL TOO PRESCIENT.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:38.760
EVEN WHEN JUSTICE GINSBURG WAS NOT IN THE
MAJORITY, SHE SHAPES THE WAY WE LIVE AND WORK.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.010
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE LILLY LEDBETTER EQUAL
PAY CASE, THE MAJORITY DECISION AND PRACTICE

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.420
ALLOWED PAY DISCRIMINATION TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.380
WHEN JUSTICE GINSBURG DELIVERED HER DISSENT,
SHE CHARGED CONGRESS WITH CORRECTING HER COLLEAGUE'S

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.470
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:04.020
WITHIN 18 MONTHS, WHICH IS RECORD SPEED IN
OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, CONGRESS PASSED

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:11.040
THE LLILY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT, AND IT WAS
SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.959
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:23.510
JUSTICE GINSBURG'S ACCESSIBLE, INCISIVE DECISIONS
AND POWERFUL DISSENTS HAVE CHALLENGED ASSUMPTIONS

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.750
AND CHANGED ACTIONS.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:32.230
WHAT ANIMATES ALL HER OPINIONS IS A QUALIFIED
COMMITMENT TO FAIRNESS, AND A WILLINGNESS

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.830
TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT THE FOUNDER'S VISION
OF EQUALITY MEANS TODAY.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:44.330
IN ADDITION TO SHAPING LAW, PUBLIC POLICY,
AND PUBLIC OPINION, OUR HONOREE IS IN FULL

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.160
BLOOM AS A CULTURAL ICON.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:54.040
SHE, OR RATHER A DIVA WHO WILL BE PERFORMING
AS JUSTICE GINSBURG, WILL SOON STAR IN THE

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:03.850
OPERA SCALIA/GINSBURG RECENTLY WRITTEN BY
DEREK WANG, HARVARD CLASS OF 2006. IT'S NOT

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:10.750
ONLY THE FIRST OPERA ABOUT THE HIGHEST COURT
IN OUR LAND, BUT IT ALSO HAS MORE FOOTNOTES

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.790
THAN ANY OTHER LIBRETTO.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:20.740
IN FACT, ONE ARIA, SUNG BY JUSTICE GINSBURG,
OR THE DIVA, IS ANNOTATED WITH 50 FOOTNOTES.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.860
NOW THAT'S A LOT.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:32.420
BUT GIVEN THAT THE ARIA IS SUNG TO JUSTICE
SCALIA AND IT'S CALLED "YOU SIR ARE WRONG

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:39.390
HERE" THAT IS PERHAPS FEWER FOOTNOTES THAN
ONE MIGHT EXPECT.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:48.120
YOU NEED NOT BE AN OPERA CONNOISSEUR TO APPRECIATE
JUSTICE GINSBURG'S PLACE IN OUR CULTURE TODAY.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.650
SHE IS A POP ICON.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:57.990
WHILE STAYING ON THE BENCH, SHE HAS ALSO MOVED
ONTO FACEBOOK, TUMBLER, INSTAGRAM, T SHIRTS,

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.130
MUGS, YOU NAME IT, EVEN HALLOWEEN.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:09.210
KIDS ALL ACROSS AMERICA, NOT JUST IN CAMBRIDGE,
MASSACHUSETTS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. DRESSED

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.730
AS JUSTICE GINSBURG FOR TRICK OR TREATING.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:19.710
THE MOST POPULAR IMAGE ONLINE WAS OF A BABY
WITH THE EARRINGS, THE GLASSES, THE ROBE,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.260
AND A CERTAIN STEELY LOOK.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.160
I DON'T KNOW HOW OUR HONOREE FEELS ABOUT THIS
LEVEL OF FAME.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:35.081
BUT I HOPE SHE TAKES ENORMOUS PLEASURE AS
WE ALL SHOULD IN THE FACT THAT THE BABY WHO

00:19:35.081 --> 00:19:43.780
WON THIS HALLOWEEN CONTEST DRESSED AS RUTH
BADER GINSBURG WAS A BOY.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:55.660
THAT LIKE SO MANY OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S
EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS A SIGN OF

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.650
THE PROGRESS SHE HAS ACHIEVED FOR WOMEN, FOR
MEN, AND FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.490
MAKING EQUITY AND FAIRNESS A REALITY FOR ALL.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.600
WE WILL HEAR FROM JUSTICE GINSBURG SHORTLY
WHEN SHE ENGAGES IN CONVERSATION WITH KATHLEEN

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.590
SULLIVAN, A BRILLIANT LITIGATOR AND CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLAR WHO HAS BEEN ON THE FACULTIES OF HARVARD

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.670
LAW SCHOOL AND STANFORD LAW SCHOOL, WHERE
SHE WAS ALSO DEAN.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:28.429
KATHLEEN IS A PARTNER IN THE FIRM THAT SOME
REFER TO AS QUINN EMMANUEL BUT WE PREFER TO

00:20:28.429 --> 00:20:34.170
CALL IT BY ITS FULL NAME: QUINN EMMANUEL URQUHART
&amp; SULLIVAN.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:40.030
AND WE ARE DELIGHTED AND GRATEFUL TO HAVE
KATHLEEN SULLIVAN JOIN US TODAY.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:46.420
BUT FIRST JOIN ME IN WELCOMING JUSTICE DAVID
SOUTER TO THE PODIUM.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:48.630 --> 00:21:05.370
HE SERVED ON THE SUPREME COURT FROM 1990 TO
2009, INCLUDING MORE THAN 15 YEARS ALONGSIDE

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.370
JUSTICE GINSBURG.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:12.870
WHEN WE ASKED JUSTICE SOUTER TO SPEAK ABOUT
HIS PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL REGARD FOR JUSTICE

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.240
GINSBURG HE SAID WE WERE HONORING HIM, AND
I QUOTE, MUNIFICENTLY.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:26.590
WITH A VOCABULARY LIKE THAT, DO I EVEN NEED
TO SAY HE WAS HARVARD GRADUATE? OF THE COLLEGE

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.250
AND ALSO A GRADUATE OF HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:44.740
JUSTICE SOUTER HONORS US ALL AND JUSTICE GINSBURG
MUNIFICENTLY BY JOINING US HERE TODAY.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:53.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:11.221
&gt;&gt; DAVID SOUTER: THANK YOU.

00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:12.221
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:14.790
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:21.690
DEAN COHEN AND MEMBERS OF THE HIERARCHY TODAY,
JUSTICE GINSBURG, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:26.740
ACTUALLY I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GOING TO BE
SAYING GENTLEMEN, BUT AS I LOOK OUT OVER THE

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:33.020
AUDIENCE, I REALIZE THAT THIS IDEA OF RUTH'S
OF GENDER EQUALITY SEEMS TO HAVE CAUGHT ON

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.020
HERE.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.500
IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:42.490
AS THE DEAN SUGGESTED, I'M RATHER A TRANSITIONAL
FIGURE HERE TODAY.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:51.030
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRY, I WAS NOT AUTHORIZED
TO TRY TO RECAP EITHER JUSTICE GINSBURG'S

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:58.030
LITIGATING EXPERIENCE OR THE SUBSTANCE OF
HER DECISIONS.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:03.720
I WAS ASKED AT LEAST AS BEST I COULD FIGURE
IT OUT TO BASICALLY PROVIDE SOME PERSONAL

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.429
ATMOSPHERE. THAT AT LEAST WOULD BE CONSISTENT
WITH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING AND PROBABLY

00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:14.700
WILL HEAR A BIT MORE OF BEFORE THE AFTERNOON
IS OVER.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:22.260
AND IN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO SUM UP SOME
OF THE ATMOSPHERICS THAT I WANT TO GET INTO,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.990
I THOUGHT OF A PERFECT QUOTATION FROM LEARNED
HAND.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:37.290
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT JUDGES AND LAWYERS,
I ASSUME THERE ARE SOME, NEED TO KNOW ONLY

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:43.870
THAT LEARNED HAND WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMMINENT
JUDGES IN THE ANGLO AMERICAN TRADITION.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:51.240
HE WAS ON THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CICUIT WHICH BASED IN NEW YORK.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:58.190
AND ONE THING LEAS TO ANOTHER. ONCE I THOUGHT
OF THE HAND QUOTE THAT I WANTED TO WORK IN

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:04.090
MY REMARKS, I STARTED THINKING ABOUT OTHER
THINKS BY AND ABOUT LEARNED HAND.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:09.710
I'M GOING TO START WITH A STORY THAT HE TOLD
ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.590
HE TOLD IT IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE, AND THERE
ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IT.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.980
BUT THIS IS THE BASIC STORY.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:23.240
IT'S A STORY OF HIS FANTASY OF HIS FIRST DAY
IN HEAVEN.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.090
AND IN THE MORNING THERE IS, THERE IS A BASEBALL
GAME.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:38.640
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE
NINTH AND HAND'S TEAM HAS NOT HAD A RUN.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.620
THE OPPOSING TEAM HAS HAD THREE.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:48.470
BUT THE BASES ARE LOADED AND HAND IS UP AT
BAT AND HE HITS A HOMER AND ALL FOUR COME

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.620
IN AND HE IS IDOLIZED AS THE HERO OF THE MORNING.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:59.620
AND AFTER LUNCH THAT DAY THERE IS A FOOTBALL
GAME.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:06.559
AND AS HAND WOULD TELL THE STORY, IT WAS THE
FOURTH QUARTER WITH THREE MINUTES LEFT TO

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:10.620
PLAY AND THE GAME WAS SCORELESS.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:17.250
AND SOMEHOW BACK ON ABOUT THE 30 YARD LINE
HAND GOT THE BALL AND HE MIR MIRACULOUSLY

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:25.460
MADE HIS WAY DOWN ACCROSS THE GOAL LINE AND
OF COURSE THE COMPANY OF HEAVEN ERUPTED IN

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.800
RAPTURE IN WHAT HE HAD DONE.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:35.970
AND THAT EVENING, THE CROWNING EVENT OF THE
DAY WAS A FORMAL DINNER FOR THE GREAT PHILOSOPHICAL

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.830
INTELLECTS OF ALL TIME.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.010
PLATO WAS THERE.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.370
ARISTOTLE WAS THERE.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:56.520
AQUINAS, LOCKE, HUME, BERKELEY, AND THE SPEAKER
FOR THE EVENING WAS VOLTAIRE.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:04.210
AND SO THE TIME CAME AND VOLTAIRE GOT UP AND
BEGAN HIS REMARKS.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:10.350
BUT AS HE SPOKE, THOUGH, THE GREAT THINKERS
THERE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND A LITTLE BIT, AND

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:15.370
THEY NOTICED THAT THEIR NEWEST MEMBER HAND
WAS THERE.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.910
AND THE AUDIENCE BEGAN TO BECOME A LITTLE
BIT RESTIVE.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.400
AND AFTER A WHILE MURMURING WAS HEARD.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.140
AND FINALY THE MURMURING GAVE WAY TO SORT
OF OUT SPOKEN COMMENT AND SOMEBODY YELLED

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.580
SAID SHUT UP VOLTAIRE.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:39.280
ANOTHER PERSON GOT UP AND SAID SIT DOWN VOLTAIRE!
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM HAND.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.919
WELL, I REALIZE THAT AS THE MAN WHO IS STANDING
BETWEEN YOU AND HEARING JUSTICE GINSBURG...

00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:47.919
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:48.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:48.919 --> 00:27:01.000
I 
KNOW THE SPOT THAT VOLTAIRE WAS IN.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.970
BUT I'M GOING TO, I'M GOING TO RELY ON YOUR
INDULGENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES TO HELP ME GET

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:14.910
OUT OF THE SPOT THAT I'M IN BY LETTING ME,
LETTING ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:23.669
SORT OF THE DRIVE THAT LIES BEHIND THE DRIVE
AND THE PERSONALITY THAT LIES BEHIND JUSTICE

00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:25.590
GINSBURG'S EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:32.650
WHAT I REALLY I GUESS AM GOING TO DO IS SORT
OF GIVE YOU SOME TIPS FOR THINGS TO LOOK FOR

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.620
AND LISTEN FOR BEHIND WHAT SHE IS SAYING THIS
AFTERNOON.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:47.730
AND MY FIRST TIP FOR YOU IS DON'T BE FOOLED
BY THE FORMALITIES OF PROFESSIONAL DISCOURSE

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:54.720
THAT WILL PROBABLY GO ON BETWIXT HER AND KATHLEEN
SULLIVAN.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:05.429
DON'T BE FOOLED BECAUSE ALONG WITH EXTRAORDINARY
AND UNFAILING NATURAL COURTESY, JUSTICE GINSBURG

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:15.380
SEEMS TO FIND IT COMPATIBLE TO HAVE AN ENORMOUS
STORE OF THE GUMPTION TO SPEAK UP AND TO SPEAK

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.380
OUT.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.630
YOU WOULD EXPECT THIS SIMPLY FROM WHAT YOU
ALREADY KNOW ABOUT HER.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:26.770
AND YOU WOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT IT THE MORE
AFTER YOU HEAR FROM HER.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:33.090
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF
STORIES THAT ILLUSTRATE THAT FACT TO SET IT

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.400
IN YOUR MIND.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:42.049
AND THE FIRST OF THEM TAKES ME BACK TO THE
VERY FIRST MORNING THAT I SAT ON THE BENCH

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:52.280
OF THE SUPREME COURT WITH JUSTICE GINSBURG
BACK IN OCTOBER OF 1993. BECAUSE SHE WAS THE

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.360
NEWEST JUSTICE SHE WAS SITTING TO MY LEFT
ON THE BENCH.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.080
AND TO MY RIGHT WAS HER FRIEND AND MY FRIEND
JUSTICE SCALIA.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:09.460
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH JUSTICE SCALIA
AND I TEND TO BE ACTIVE QUESTIONERS OF THE

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.010
LAWYERS WHO ARE ARGUING BEFORE US.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:18.980
WE WANT TO GET THE ARGUMENTS TO THE ISSUES
THAT ARE TROUBLING US ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:24.700
QUESTIONS THAT GO TO THE CASE OF THE LAWYER
WHO WAS ARGUING.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.490
AND WE TRY TO GET RIGHT TO IT.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:35.919
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT MORNING NEITHER
JUSTICE SCALIA NOR I WAS EXPECTING ANY SERIOUS

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:43.669
COMPETITION FROM THE NEWCOMER IN INTERROGATING
THE LAWYERS.

00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:47.300
BUT WE WERE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:55.610
JUSTICE GINSBURG WAS OFF THE MARK WITH THE
FIRST QUESTION BEFORE JUSTICE SCALIA AND I

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.860
HAD OUR MOUTHS OPEN.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.190
AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT SHE KEPT IT UP!

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.120
AND EVERY TIME HE OR I WOULD GET READY TO
ASK A QUESTION, THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER ONE

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.540
FROM THE JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE COURT.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:16.700
AND FINALLY AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF FRUSTRATED
SILENCE JUSTICE SCALIA LEANED OVER TO ME AND

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:28.690
WHISPERED AND HE SAID YOU AND I MAY HAVE ASKED
OUR LAST QUESTIONS IN THIS COURTROOM.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:36.830
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT HE AND I BECAME SOMEWHAT
MORE NIMBLE OVER THE YEARS AND WE WERE ABLE

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.930
TO GET IN A FEW OF OUR OWN.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:46.850
AND I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY
THAT OF SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TO

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.380
ME VERY OFTEN.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.160
BUT IT HAS HAPPENED.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:56.809
JUSTICE GINSBURG AND I, SO FAR AS STATISTICS
GO, IN OUR YEARS TOGETHER, TENDED TO COME

00:30:56.809 --> 00:31:03.520
OUT WITH A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF FREQUENT AGREEMENT.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.580
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:15.270
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF YOU ARE DISSENTING
FROM AN OPINION OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S, OR

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:23.320
SHE IS DISSENTING FROM AN OPINION OF YOURS,
THE ONLY THING FOR YOU TO DO IS CANCEL ALL

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.610
OTHER PLANS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:31.620
BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE AT IT FOR A LONG
TIME.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:39.590
JUSTICE GINSBURG TO ADAPT A PHRASE THAT HAS
BECOME COMMON, JUSTICE GINSBURG IS A TIGER

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:45.110
JUSTICE.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:55.070
THOSE TWO, THOSE TWO QUALITIES OF SORT OF
INTELLECTUAL INITIATIVE AND BOTH INTELLECTUAL

00:31:55.070 --> 00:32:02.409
AND EMOTIONAL STAMINA ARE THE QUALITIES THAT
MADE ME THINK OF THAT QUOTATION FROM LEARNED

00:32:02.409 --> 00:32:05.490
HAND THAT I ELUDED TO BEFORE

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:12.580
THEY ARE THE QUALITIES THAT GO INTO THE MAKING
OF A GREAT JUSTICE, AND A GREAT JUSTICE IS

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.809
WHAT JUSTICE GINSBURG IS.

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:25.030
AND LEARNED HAND WAS LECTURING ONCE A GOOD
MANY YEARS AGO ONCE OVER AT THE LAW SCHOOL.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:34.179
AND HE WAS DESCRIBING WHY IT WAS THAT HE STILL
REVERED THE PROFESSORS WHO HAD TAUGHT HIM

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:35.400
LAW THERE.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.710
AND THIS IS THE PHRASE HE USED TO SUM UP.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.490
IN THE UNIVERSE OF TRUTH, THEY LIVED BY THE
SWORD.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:49.480
WELL, SO DOES JUSTICE GINSBURG.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:58.440
AND IN ADDITION TO DOING THAT, THERE IS A
GRACE THAT ALSO MUST BE NOTED.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.840
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HER.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:12.280
WHEN I WAS, WHEN I WAS THINKING OF WHAT I
MIGHT SAY THIS AFTERNOON I WENT TO MY FILE

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:18.590
CABINET AND I PULLED OUT THE NOTES THAT I
HAD MADE OF THE ARGUMENTS AND OUR DISCUSSIONS

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:27.640
OF THE CASES THAT FIRST WEEK THAT SHE SAT
WITH US BACK IN 1993. AND MY NOTES FOR THE

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.309
LATTER PART OF THE WEEK INCLUDED THIS STATEMENT.

00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:32.210
AND I QUOTE MYSELF.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:46.750
I CAN'T RESERVE CAUTION IN MY DELIGHT WITH
RUTH.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:55.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.809
GET YOURSELVES READY TO FEEL THE SAME WAY.

00:33:57.809 --> 00:34:01.030
LUNCH IS BEHIND US.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:10.790
AND WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE A FEAST IN THE
COMPANY OF JUSTICE GINSBURG AND KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.829
IT'S WHAT LEARNED HAND MIGHT HAVE CALLED A
DOUBLE HEADER.

00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:27.450
AND I HAVE, I HAVE KNOWN MISS SULLIVAN BOTH
IN HER CAPACITY AS A LECTURER, AND IN HER

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.319
CAPACITY AS A LAW SCHOOL DEAN.

00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:35.169
I KNOW HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A PROFESSOR.

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:41.799
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE HONORS ALL OF
US BY JOINING WITH US TO HELP US HONOR RUTH

00:34:41.799 --> 00:34:43.489
GINSBURG TODAY.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:55.550
AND AS I MAKE WAY FOR THE TWO OF THEM, LET
ME JUST ASK YOU TO REMEMBER ONE THING.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.950
YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING THEM FOR MAYBE
HALF AN HOUR.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:06.539
I HAVE KNOWN AND LISTENED TO EACH OF THEM
FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS.

00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:10.480
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET THEM.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:24.539
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO ENVY ME.

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:30.529
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:30.529 --> 00:35:36.519
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:36.519 --> 00:35:55.029
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, AND DEAN COHEN, AND JUSTICE
SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, MARVELOUS AND DISTINGUISHED

00:35:55.029 --> 00:36:01.249
ALUMNAE OF RADCLIFFE, MANY CLASSES STONG,
IT IS SUCH A DEEP HONOR AND PERSONAL PRIVILEGE

00:36:01.249 --> 00:36:06.170
FOR ME TO CONDUCT THIS CONVERSATION WITH JUSTICE
GINSBURG.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:12.950
YOU'VE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER LIFE TODAY
AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, A STONE'S THROW AWAY

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:22.069
FROM HERE, TO HER CAREER AS A LAWYER, TO HER
TIME AS TIGER JUSTICE, TO HER BEING THE STAR

00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:29.999
OF AN OPERA, SCALIA/GINSBERG, AND KNOWN IN
RAP CIRCLES AS NOTORIOUS RBG.

00:36:29.999 --> 00:36:32.259
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:32.259 --> 00:36:37.040
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE US BACK TO THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO IN THIS MORNING'S

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.309
MARVELOUS PANEL, YOUR LIFE AS A LAWYER.

00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:44.260
IT'S NO SECRET TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE BEFORE
THE SUPREME COURT, AND FOLLOW THE SUPREME

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:51.180
COURT, THAT JUSTICE GINSBURG IS NOT JUST A
JUDGE'S JUDGE, OR A JUSTICE'S JUSTICE, SHE

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.039
IS A LAWYER'S LAWYER,

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:56.890
THE ONE WHO WRITES PERHAPS THE MOST OF THE
CIVIL PROCEDURE CASES.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:03.479
AND WHO FORGED A CAREER AS A BRILLIANT LITIGATOR
FOR THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS PROJECT OF THE ACLU

00:37:03.479 --> 00:37:08.440
BACK IN THE EARLY '70S. AND AT A TIME WHEN
THERE WAS NO EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:14.569
NO UPDATE TO THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION
IN THE 14TH AMENDMENT IN 1868 THAT SAID NO

00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:18.299
STATE SHOULD DEPRIVE ANY PERSON OF EQUAL PROTECTION
OF THE LAWS.

00:37:18.299 --> 00:37:24.219
BUT NO CLEAR EXTENSION OF THAT PRINCIPLE,
TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SEX EQUALITY.

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:29.309
JUSTICE GINSBURG MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE FORGED
THAT DEVELOPMENT IN THE LAW.

00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:33.930
JUSTICE GINSBURG, I WONDER IF WE COULD START
BY GOING BACK TO THE '70S, AND HAVE YOU TALK

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:40.049
ABOUT THE TURNING POINT CASES, THE CASE OF
REED V. REED. THAT YOU WORKED ON, OR FRONTIERO

00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:41.049
V. RICHARDSON.

00:37:41.049 --> 00:37:43.839
CAN YOU TAKE US BACK AND TELL US ABOUT THOSE
CASES?

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:52.829
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: KATHLEEN, BEFORE I
DO THAT LET ME SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:59.519
BEEN A HIGHER NOTE THAN THERE WAS THIS MORNING
AND WITH MY DEAR COLLEAGUE JUSTICE SOUTER.

00:37:59.519 --> 00:38:03.039
I LOVED IT ALL AND I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT.

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:07.559
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A P.S. TO SOMETHING
MY COLLEAGUE SAID.

00:38:07.559 --> 00:38:15.529
IN THE YEARS WE SERVED TOGETHER, JUSTICE SOUTER
AND I VOTED ALIKE MORE THAN ANY TWO OTHER

00:38:15.529 --> 00:38:20.180
JUSTICES, EVEN MORE THAN JUSTICE SCALIA AND
JUSTICE THOMAS.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:30.849
I MISS HIM, BUT I OCCUPY THE CHAMBERS THAT
WERE HIS WHEN HE WAS ON THE COURT.

00:38:30.849 --> 00:38:34.700
THEY LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:44.569
BUT I THINK OF HIM WITH GREAT APPRECIATION
FOR WHAT A WONDERFUL COLLEAGUE HE WAS.

00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:47.239
ANYWAY, SALLY REED.

00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:58.710
SALLY REED IS A WOMAN FROM BOISE, IDAHO AND
SHE HAS HAD A TRAGIC OCCURRENCE IN HER LIFE.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:07.619
SALLY WAS CHILDLESS FOR YEARS AND THEN SHE
AND HER HUSBAND ADOPTED A BABY BOY AND THEN

00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:11.059
THEY HAD A FALLING OUT SO THEY SEPARATED.

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:20.460
AND THE YOUNG BOY WAS GIVEN TO SALLY AS PRIMARY
CUSTODIAN BECAUSE THE CHILD WAS WHAT THE LAW

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.910
CALLED OF TENDER YEARS.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:30.470
WHEN THE BOY REACHED HIS TEENS, FATHER APPLIED
FOR CUSTODY.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.490
HIS ARGUMENT WAS NOW THE BOY NEEDS TO BE PREPARED
FOR A MAN'S WORLD.

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.519
THE JUDGE SAID YES.

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:38.759
SALLY OPPOSED IT.

00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:44.049
SHE THOUGHT THE FATHER WOULD NOT BE A GOOD
INFLUENCE ON THE BOY.

00:39:44.049 --> 00:39:48.290
AND SADLY SHE PROVED TO BE RIGHT.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:56.059
ONE DAY THE BOY WAS SORELY DEPRESSED AND HE
TOOK OUT ONE OF HIS FATHER'S MANY GUNS AND

00:39:56.059 --> 00:39:59.299
HE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:05.990
SO SALLY WANTED TO BE APPOINTED ADMINISTRATOR
OF HIS ESTATE.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:11.710
THE PROBATE COURT JUDGE TOLD HER I'M SORRY
SALLY, BUT THE LAW IS CLEAR.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:21.940
THE IDAHO PROBATE CODE SAYS AS BETWEEN PEOPLE
EQUALLY ENTITLED TO ADMINISTER'S A DESCENDANTS

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:28.880
ESTATE, MALES MUST BE PREFERRED TO FEMALES.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:38.509
IT WAS THE PERFECT STATUTE TO ATTACK AS DISCRIMINATING
ARBITRARILY AGAINST A WOMAN.

00:40:38.509 --> 00:40:45.680
BUT WHAT SALLY REID'S CASE BROUGHT HOME TO
ME WAS THAT THIS IS A WOMAN WHO WAS HARDLY

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.380
SOPHISTICATED.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.549
SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T CALL HERSELF A FEMINIST.

00:40:49.549 --> 00:40:53.279
SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE WORD
MEANT.

00:40:53.279 --> 00:41:00.430
BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE SUFFERED AN INJUSTICE
AND THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM COULD MAKE IT RIGHT.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:05.480
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY COUNTRIES THAT WOULD
BE SO.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:10.880
SO SALLY WENT THROUGH THREE LEVELS OF THE
IDAHO COURTS.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.989
SHE LOST THE FIRST TIME, WON THE SECOND TIME,
AND LOST THE THIRD TIME.

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:23.010
THE SUPREME COURT HEARD HER CASE AND FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THAT COURT THEY

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:32.930
SAID THAT A GENDER CLASSIFICATION VIOLATED
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.930
LAWS.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.789
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: AND THAT WAS QUITE REMARKABLE,
BECAUSE THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT, WHICH

00:41:37.789 --> 00:41:43.559
HAD BEEN ENACTED IN CONGRESS NUMEROUS TIMES,
BUT NEVER RATIFIED BY THE STATES WAS NOT YET

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:44.559
ENFORCED.

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:48.710
SO YOU HAD TO MAKE NEW LAW WITH THE EXISTING
LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.940
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.319
HOW DID YOU CONVINCE THEM THAT THE LAW IN
IDAHO WAS IRRATIONAL TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:55.319
MEN AND WOMEN.

00:41:55.319 --> 00:42:00.259
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: WE WENT THROUGH EVERY
EQUAL PROTECTION DECISION, THERE WEREN'T THAT

00:42:00.259 --> 00:42:02.989
MANY OUTSIDE OF THE RACE AREA

00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:12.099
AND PICKED UP THE BEST LANGUAGE THAT WE COULD
FIND.

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:18.869
AND IT WAS JUST THE LIFE STORY OF THIS WOMAN
AND THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE LAW.

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:27.829
NOW THE LAW, IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE
IT WAS COPIED BY IDAHO FROM CALIFORNIA.

00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:33.890
IT WAS MIDDLE 19TH CENTURY LAW.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:41.349
THE THINKING WAS THAT WOMEN ONCE THEY MARRIED
LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO CONTRACT IN THEIR OWN

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:46.910
NAME, SUE AND BE SUED IN THEIR OWN NAMES,
HOLD PROPERTY.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:54.810
SO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, IF YOU HAD A CHOICE
BETWEEN A MAN WHO WAS COMPETENT AND A WOMAN

00:42:54.810 --> 00:43:00.099
WHO WAS UNDER THESE LAW IMPOSED DISABILITIES,
YOU WOULD PREFER THE MAN.

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:05.960
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: NOW A NUMBER OF THE
LAWS THAT YOU CHALLENGED DURING THIS PIVOTAL

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:14.260
PERIOD WITH THE ACLU WOMEN'S RIGHTS PROJECT
WERE ACTUALLY LAWS THAT GAVE A PARENT PRIVILEGES

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.660
TO WOMEN OVER MEN.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:23.359
LAWS THAT ASSUMED THAT MILITARY WIVES WERE
DEPENDENT ON THEIR SERVICE MEMBER'S, HUSBAND'S

00:43:23.359 --> 00:43:24.359
INCOME.

00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:30.589
OR SOCIAL SECURITY CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ASSUMED
THAT WIVES WERE DEPENDENT ON HUSBANDS, BUT

00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:37.469
HUSBANDS WOULD HAVE TO PROVE DEPENDENCY TO
GET BENEFITS EARNED BY THEIR WIVES.

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:43.039
YOU MIGHT SAY THEY WERE LAWS THAT WERE SEX
DISCRIMINATION, BUT NOMINALLY IN FAVOR OF

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:44.039
WOMEN.

00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:45.829
AND YET YOU TOOK THOSE CASES ON, AS WELL.

00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:50.970
IN CASES LIKE FRONTIERO, AND LATER IN CASE
LIKE WIESENFELD.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:56.299
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY YOU
CHALLENGED ON BEHALF OF MEN SOME OF THESE

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:58.619
APPARENT PRIVILEGES FOR LADIES?

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:05.269
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: THE OBJECT WAS TO
GET AT THE STEREOTYPE THAT HELD WOMEN BACK

00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:11.170
FROM DOING WHATEVER THEIR TALENT WOULD ALLOW
THEM TO DO.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:15.789
THE NOTION WAS THERE WERE SEPARATE SPHERES
FOR THE SEXES.

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:21.450
MEN WERE THE DOERS IN THE WORLD OF COMMERCE.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:29.920
AND WOMEN WERE THE STAY AT HOME TYPES WHO
LOOKED AFTER THE HEARTH AND THE CHILDREN.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:36.339
AND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WAS
TO GET RID OF ALL LAWS BASED ON THAT STEREOTYPE

00:44:36.339 --> 00:44:43.749
SO PEOPLE, WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN COULD BE IN
THE WORDS OF A SONG POPULAR IN THE EARLY '70s,

00:44:43.749 --> 00:44:45.730
FREE TO BE YOU AND ME.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:56.509
STEPHEN WIESENFELD'S CASE WAS A TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:44:56.509 --> 00:44:59.809
HE WAS MARRIED TO A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER.

00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:05.660
THEIR DIVISION AT HOME HE WAS THE PRINCIPLE
HOME BODY, AND SHE WAS THE PRINCIPLE EARNER.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:11.039
SHE HAD A HEALTHY PREGNANCY, SHE WAS TEACHING
INTO HER 9TH MONTH.

00:45:11.039 --> 00:45:13.809
SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO GIVE BIRTH.

00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:21.450
THE DOCTOR CAME OUT AND TOLD STEPHEN YOU HAVE
A HEALTHY BABY BOY, BUT YOUR WIFE DIED OF

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.450
AN EMBOLISM.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:30.180
SO STEPHEN VOWED THAT HE WOULD BE THE CARE
GIVING PARENT.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.660
HE WOULD NOT WORK FULL TIME UNTIL HIS CHILD
WAS IN SCHOOL FULL TIME.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:40.440
AND HE COULD MANAGE THAT, HE THOUGHT, BY WHAT
WERE CALLED CHILD AND CARE SOCIAL SECURITY

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440
BENEFITS.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.229
HE COULD EARN UP TO THE EARNINGS LIMIT, WHAT
HE EARNED, PLUS THE SOCIAL SECURITY.

00:45:47.229 --> 00:45:51.469
HE COULD MANAGE TO CARE FOR HIS CHILD AND
HIMSELF.

00:45:51.469 --> 00:45:58.940
SO HE WENT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE TO
ASK FOR THESE CHILD IN CARE BENEFITS AND WAS

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:06.029
TOLD THIS IS A STATUTE, YOU SEE, IT SAYS MOTHER'S
BENEFITS.

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:08.489
THEY WEREN'T AVAILABLE TO THE FATHER.

00:46:08.489 --> 00:46:16.400
AND HOW THE CASE BEGAN, STEPHEN WROTE A LETTER
TO THE EDITOR OF HIS LOCAL NEWSPAPER IN EDISON,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.670
NEW JERSEY.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:24.410
THE LETTER SAID I HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT
ABOUT WOMEN'S LIB.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.579
LET ME TELL YOU MY STORY.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:34.650
THE TAGLINE AFTER HE SAID I DON'T GET THESE
BENEFITS AS A PARENT.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:37.410
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.009
DOES GLORIA STEINEM KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:46:41.009 --> 00:46:42.019
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:50.210
WELL SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THE SPANISH FACULTY
AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY, AND A FRIEND, CALLED

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:55.989
ME AND SAID THIS ISN'T RIGHT, IS IT?

00:46:55.989 --> 00:47:02.839
SO I SUGGESTED THAT STEPHEN WIESENFELD CALL
THE NEW JERSEY AFFILIATE OF THE ACLU.

00:47:02.839 --> 00:47:08.000
AND WE TOOK THAT CASE FROM THE DISTRICT COURT
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.710
I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS BECAUSE WE GOT THE
DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT BEFORE JASON,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:14.710
THE BABY, TURNED THREE.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:19.750
AND THAT'S A RECORD, REALLY A RECORD!

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.089
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:33.450
ANYWAY, IT WAS A UNANIMOUS JUDGMENT, BUT THEY
DIVIDED THREE WAYS ON WHO WAS THE VICTIM OF

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.160
THE DISCRIMINATION.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.199
THE MAJORITY SAID OF COURSE IT'S THE WAGE
EARNING WOMAN.

00:47:38.199 --> 00:47:44.699
SHE PAYS THE SAME SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES AS
A MAN PAYS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GIVE

00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:50.229
HER FAMILY THE SAME PROTECTION IT WOULD GIVE
TO A MAN'S FAMILY.

00:47:50.229 --> 00:47:56.420
AND THEN IT WAS DISCRIMINATION A COUPLE OF
THEM THOUGHT AGAINST THE MALE AS PARENT BECAUSE

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:05.630
HE WOULDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE
PERSONAL, PRIMARY CAREGIVER OF HIS CHILD.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:13.839
AND THEN THERE WAS ONE WHO LATER BECAME MY
CHIEF WHO SAID IT'S TOTALLY ARBITRARY FROM

00:48:13.839 --> 00:48:15.849
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE BABY.

00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:24.209
WHY SHOULD THE BABY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
THE CARE OF A SOUL SURVIVING PARENT ONLY WHEN

00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:27.799
THAT PARENT IS FEMALE, NOT MALE?

00:48:27.799 --> 00:48:34.209
PEOPLE WERE ASTONISHED BECAUSE IT WAS THE
FIRST TIME THAT THEN JUSTICE REHNQUIST HAD

00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:39.000
EVER FOUND A LAW OFFENSIVE TO THE EQUAL PROTECTION
PRINCIPLE.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.029
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: SO THAT WAS A REMARKABLE
DECISION TO HAVE IT COME DOWN UNANIMOUSLY.

00:48:46.029 --> 00:48:51.900
AND IT WAS A WAY OF SAYING THAT A LAW THAT
SEEMS TO GIVE WOMEN SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:57.849
PROTECTION CAN ACTUALLY BE DISCRIMINATORY
AGAINST WOMEN WAGE EARNERS AND SERVICE MEMBERS,

00:48:57.849 --> 00:49:02.969
AND DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST MEN WHO ARE PLAYING
THE ROLE OF PARENT OR CARETAKER OF THE CHILDREN

00:49:02.969 --> 00:49:09.249
AFTER A SPOUSE HAS DIED, AND IT CREATES THESE
STEREOTYPES, AND THAT'S NO DOUBT WHAT LED

00:49:09.249 --> 00:49:16.329
JUSTICE BRENNAN, AND THE CONCURRENCE IN THE
FRONTIERO CASE THAT YOU WON SPECTACULARLY,

00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:22.559
WHAT LOOKS LIKE BEING PUT ON A PEDESTAL MAY
SOMETIMES BE A CAGE IMPRISONING WOMEN IN OLD

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.749
STEREOTYPES.

00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:31.670
SO BETWEEN REED AND FRONTIERO AND WIESENFELD
YOU REALLY LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE LAW

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:37.849
THAT STARTED TO BREAK DOWN THOSE ARCHAIC STEREOTYPES.

00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:41.150
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT
THIS.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:47.679
WHAT WAS THE ROLE OF POPULAR OPINION OR THE
EVOLVING SOCIAL CONSENSUS IN THOSE DECISIONS?

00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:50.719
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

00:49:50.719 --> 00:49:58.959
THE LITIGATION IN THE '70s WOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE IN THE '60s. LET ME GIVE YOU AN

00:49:58.959 --> 00:50:00.410
EXAMPLE.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.819
JURY DUTY WAS MENTIONED THIS MORNING.

00:50:02.819 --> 00:50:09.150
THERE WAS A CASE IN 1961, THESE WERE THE YEARS
OF THE QUOTE LIBERAL WARREN COURT.

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:14.569
THE CASE INVOLVED GWENDOLYN HOYT.

00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:18.930
TODAY WE WOULD CALL HER A BATTERED WOMEN.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:27.279
SHE ONE DAY HAD BEEN HUMILIATED TO THE BREAKING
POINT BY HER PHILANDERING, ABUSIVE HUSBAND.

00:50:27.279 --> 00:50:35.440
SHE TURNED TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THERE
WAS HER YOUNG SON'S BASEBALL BAT.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:42.400
AND SHE TOOK IT AND HIT HER SOUSE OVER THE
HEAD AND HE FELL AGAINST THE STONE FLOOR,

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:49.460
END OF THEIR ALTERCATION, AND THE BEGINNING
OF THE MURDER PROSECUTION.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:58.950
THIS OCCURED IN HILLSBORO COUNTY FLORIDA,
AND AT THOSE DAYS WOMEN WERE NOT ON JURY ROLLS.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:05.599
THEY COULD COME TO THE CLERKS OFFICE AND SIGN
UP, BUT OTHERWISE THEY WEREN'T THERE.

00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:12.900
SHE WAS TRIED BEFORE AN ALL MALE JURY, AND
SHE HAD THE NOTION NOT THAT NECESSARILY SHE

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.199
WOULD BE ACQUITTED IF WOMEN WERE ON THE JURY.

00:51:16.199 --> 00:51:23.519
BUT THE CHOICE BETWEEN MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER,
THE WOMEN ON THE JURY MAY HAVE SWUNG IT TO

00:51:23.519 --> 00:51:26.569
THE LESSER CRIME OF MANSLAUGHTER.

00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:31.140
SHE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER BY AN ALL MALE
JURY.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:37.430
WHEN HER CASE GOT TO THE SUPREME COURT IN
1961, THE VIEW WAS, WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.430
COMPLAINT.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:43.630
WOMEN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, THEY CAN
SIGN UP IF THEY WANT TO, BUT IF THEY DON'T

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.640
WANT TO SERVE, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:54.560
THE POINT THAT OUR LAWYERS TREID TO MAKE TO
THE SUPREME COURT WAS KEEPING WOMEN OFF THE

00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.960
JURY ROLLS SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE STATE
REGARDS ITS CITIZENS.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.089
CITIZENS HAVE OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS RIGHTS.

00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:08.959
AND ONE OBLIGATION IS TO BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION
OF JUSTICE.

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:15.660
SO A LAW THAT SAYS WOMEN AREN'T ON JURIES
UNLESS THEY VOLUNTEER IS SAYING THAT WOMEN

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.660
ARE EXPENDABLE.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.880
WE DON'T NEED THEM IN THIS JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.160
IF THEY WANT TO, WE'LL ALLOW THEM.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.690
THE MEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE ESSENTIAL.

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:32.249
SO WE CAN'T GIVE THEM EXEMPTIONS FROM JURY
DUTY.

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:42.249
THAT WAS GWENDOLYN HOYT'S CASE IN 1961. THERE
WAS A SEA CHANGE IN ATTITUDE BY THE '70s.

00:52:42.249 --> 00:52:45.640
MORE AND MORE WOMEN WERE IN THE WORKFORCE.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:58.119
IT BECAME INCREASINGLY EASIER TO CONTROL,
A WOMAN TO CONTROL HER REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY.

00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:01.709
PEOPLE WERE LIVING LONGER.

00:53:01.709 --> 00:53:06.140
AND THERE WAS QUITE A HIGH DEGREE OF INFLATION.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:10.209
SO THE TWO EARNER FAMILY BECAME THE IDEAL.

00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:19.700
IT WAS THAT CHANGE THAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED
IN SOCIETY THAT LED THE COURT AT LAST TO CATCH

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.079
UP TO THAT CHANGE.

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:26.440
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: AND I THINK IT'S WORTH
STOPPING TO NOTE HOW REMARKABLE IT WAS THAT

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.079
YOU WON THOSE SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES IN
THE EARLY '70s, AFTER JUST A DECADE THAT THE

00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:36.509
SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO FIND IT DISCRIMINATION
TO KEEP WOMEN OFF THE JURY ROLLS.

00:53:36.509 --> 00:53:40.440
SO THAT'S A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN A SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME DUE VERY MUCH TO ADVOCACY AS WELL

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.259
AS SOCIAL EVOLUTION.

00:53:42.259 --> 00:53:49.059
BUT YOU FAMOUSLY SAID ONCE THAT THE COURT
CAN'T GET OUT TOO FAR AHEAD OF SOCIAL CONSENSUS

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.410
AND POPULAR OPINION.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:59.619
MAYBE THE NATION NEEDED MORE TIME TO PERCOLATE
BEFORE ROE VS. WADE WAS DECIDED. HOW DO WE

00:53:59.619 --> 00:54:06.209
KNOW WHEN POPULAR OPINION AND SOCIAL CONSENSUS
HAS COME FAR ENOUGH? WHEN DO WE LOOK TO?

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:12.709
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: IT WASN'T SO MUCH
THAT ROE WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME.

00:54:12.709 --> 00:54:16.449
IT WAS REALLY THE WAY THAT THE COURT DECIDED.

00:54:16.449 --> 00:54:20.059
IT WAS AN UNUSUAL DECISION IN THIS RESPECT.

00:54:20.059 --> 00:54:28.019
IN ONE FELL SWOOP THE COURT MADE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
EVERY ABORTION LAW IN THE COUNTRY.

00:54:28.019 --> 00:54:33.910
EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL STATES DIDN'T SATISFY
THE STANDARDS SET IN THAT CASE.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.920
SO THE COURT HAD DONE IT ALL.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:46.499
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ADVOCATING FOR A WOMAN'S
ABILITY TO CONTROL HER OWN DESTINY, THEY RETIRED,

00:54:46.499 --> 00:54:48.920
WHILE THE OPPOSITION MOUNTED.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:54.119
NOW THEY HAD INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FIGHT IN
THE TRENCHES STATE BY STATE, SOMETIMES WINNING,

00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:58.680
SOMETIMES LOSING, THEY HAD THIS ONE SINGLE
TARGET TO AIM AT.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.670
THIS DECISION.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:05.839
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY THING TO DO, TO
DECLARE THE TEXAS LAW THAT WAS IN FRONT OF

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:12.440
THE COURT UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THE ONLY
GROUND FOR ABORTION IN TEXAS AT THE TIME WAS

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.039
THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN.

00:55:14.039 --> 00:55:18.170
NOT HER HEALTH. HER HEALTH COULD BE DEVASTATED
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.529
JUST HER LIFE.

00:55:19.529 --> 00:55:20.980
THAT WAS TOO EXTREME.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:26.359
THE COURT COULD HAVE SAID THAT AND PUT DOWN
ITS PEN AND THEN LET THE POLITICAL SYSTEM

00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:27.380
REACT TO THAT.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:32.140
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: SO SOMETIMES THE NATURE
OF THE DECISION AND THE RATE OF CHANGE IS

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:36.779
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE COUNTRY'S READINESS
FOR CHANGE.

00:55:36.779 --> 00:55:41.289
MAYBE WE COULD FAST FORWARD NOW TO THE TIME
YOU HAD ON THE BENCH.

00:55:41.289 --> 00:55:46.160
YOU HAD THE REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE OF NOT ONLY
ARGUING AS AN ADVOCATE AND WINNING SOME OF

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.420
THE MOST IMPORTANT SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES
IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.630
YOU THEN SITTING ON THE COURT HAD THE CHANCE
TO AUTHOR SOME OF THEM.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:59.449
I WONDER IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US SOME OBSERVATIONS
ABOUT WRITING THE OPINION FOR THE COURT IN

00:55:59.449 --> 00:56:04.010
THE VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE CASE, WHICH
HELD THAT WOMEN COULDN'T BE EXCLUDED FROM

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:10.910
A PUBLIC MILITARY INSTITUTE, NOT EVEN IF THERE
WAS ANOTHER SCHOOL FOR GIRLS NEARBY.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:23.809
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: PERHAPS I SHOULD START
WITH A CASE THAT WAS 20 YEARS EARLIER.

00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:29.279
IT WAS SUSAN VORCHHEIMER'S CASE AGAINST THE
PHILADELPHIA BOARD OF EDUCATION.

00:56:29.279 --> 00:56:34.930
THERE WERE TWO HIGH SCHOOLS FOR GIFTED CHILDREN
IN PHILADELPHIA.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.599
THE NAMES OF THE SCHOOLS I THINK TELL THE
STORY.

00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:39.809
ONE WAS GIRLS HIGH.

00:56:39.809 --> 00:56:43.779
AND THE OTHER WAS CENTRAL HIGH.

00:56:43.779 --> 00:56:45.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:51.180
A YOUNG GIRL NOTICING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THESE TWO SCHOOLS SAID I DON'T WANT TO GO

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:57.359
TO THE GIRLS HIGH, I WANT TO GO TO THE CENTRAL
HIGH WHERE THEY HAVE BETTER SCIENCE AND MATH

00:56:57.359 --> 00:57:01.240
FACILITIES, A MUCH BETTER LIBRARY.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:09.189
OF COURSE INFINITELY BETTER SPORTS FACILITIES.

00:57:09.189 --> 00:57:17.049
SO SHE STARTED HER CASE IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT
COURT AND SHE WON.

00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:23.549
IT WENT UP ON APPEALS, AND THE COURT OF APPEALS
REVERSED TWO TO ONE.

00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:31.420
SHE PETITIONED AND THE SUPREME COURT SPLIT
FOUR TO FOUR.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:39.979
THAT MEANS YOU AUTOMATICALLY AFFIRM THE DECISION
OF THE COURT ONE STEP BELOW.

00:57:39.979 --> 00:57:44.249
WRITE NO OPINION, IT HAS NO PRESIDENTIAL VALUE.

00:57:44.249 --> 00:57:53.110
THE FEDERAL COURTS WERE EVENLY DIVIDED WITH
TWO IN THE LOWER COURTS ON EACH SIDE AND THE

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:56.809
SUPREME COURT FOUR TO FOUR.

00:57:56.809 --> 00:58:00.119
I HAD WRITTEN THE BRIEF IN THE VORCHHEIMER
CASE BUT IT WAS ARGUED BY LOCAL COUNSEL.

00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:09.520
AND WHEN THE VMI DECISION CAME OUT, MY DEAR
HUSBAND SAID TO ME WELL RUTH IT TOOK YOU 20

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.859
YEARS TO WIN THE VORCHHEIMER CASE, BUT YOU
FINALLY DID IT.

00:58:12.859 --> 00:58:13.859
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:13.859 --> 00:58:17.369
BUT THE CHANGE IN THE TIME IS INTERESTING.

00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:22.180
BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE VMI CASE IS UNITED
STATES AGAINST VIRGINIA.

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:32.779
SO IT WAS OUR GOVERNMENT URGING THAT NO PUBLIC
INSTITUTION COULD EXCLUDE ON THE BASIS OF

00:58:32.779 --> 00:58:35.650
GENDER.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:41.950
THE GOVERNMENT TAKING UP THE CLAIM OF THE
WOMEN WHO WANTED TO BE ADMITTED TO VMI.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:51.339
SOME PEOPLE SAID TO ME ABOUT THE VMI CASE,
WELL, WHY WOULD WOMEN WANT TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL?

00:58:51.339 --> 00:58:55.630
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT TO.

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:59.319
PERHAPS, YOU, A MAN WOULD NOT WANT TO EITHER.

00:58:59.319 --> 00:59:04.930
BUT THERE ARE SOME WOMEN WHO SEE THAT AS THE
RIGHT PLACE FOR THEM.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.289
AND WHO ARE FULLY EQUIPPED TO SURVIVE THE
RIGOROUS REGIME.

00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:16.219
WHY SHOULD THEY BE HELD BACK SIMPLY BECAUSE
THEY ARE WOMEN?

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:26.469
AND SO THE VMI CASE WAS VERY SATISFYING IN
MANY WAYS.

00:59:26.469 --> 00:59:31.349
FOR ONE THING, THE VMI FACULTY WAS VERY MUCH
IN FAVOR OF THE ADMISSION OF WOMEN.

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:34.079
THE REASON SHOULD BE OBVIOUS.

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:44.450
IF THEY COULD INCLUDE WOMEN IN THEIR APPLICANT
POOL, THEY WOULD UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF THEIR

00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.969
STUDENTS.

00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:47.499
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:47.499 --> 00:59:55.789
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: WELL THAT WAS A REMARKABLE
DECISION AND ONE OF MANY IMPORTANT ONES YOU

00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:56.789
WROTE ON THE COURT.

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:58.259
I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT ALL
OF THEM.

00:59:58.259 --> 01:00:03.400
BUT MAYBE WE COULD TALK A BIT MORE BROADLY
ABOUT THE COURT ITSELF AND ABOUT THE COLLEGIALLY

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.579
WE SAW ON THAT MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY WE SAW
TODAY IN JUSTICE SOUTER'S REMARKS ABOUT YOU

01:00:09.579 --> 01:00:14.609
AND YOUR REMARKS IN DUET WITH HIM ABOUT HOW
MUCH YOU ENJOYED BEING HIS COLLEAGUE.

01:00:14.609 --> 01:00:18.069
BUT THE TWO OF YOU DID AGREE QUITE A BIT.

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:23.440
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S AN OPERA CALLED
SCALIA/GINSBURG THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.199
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOU AND JUSTICE SCALIA.

01:00:26.199 --> 01:00:28.239
AND YET YOU'RE GREAT FRIENDS.

01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:32.630
AND YOU GO TO THE OPERA TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE
COLLEGIATELY THAT I THINK YOU'VE DESCRIBED

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:39.209
AS BEING TRUE OF ALL THE MEMBER OF THE COURT.
SO HOW CAN IT BE THAT AS THE CLOSING DUET

01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:45.359
OF SCALIA/GINSBURG GOES YOU CAN BE ON THE
COURT WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY TO EACH OTHER, AS

01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:47.749
YOU AND SAID TO SING TO EACH OTHER.

01:00:47.749 --> 01:00:50.569
WE ARE DIFFERENT, WE ARE ONE.

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:51.710
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:58.619
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN
FIRST WHY THIS OPERA IS CALLED SCALIA/GINSBURG,

01:00:58.619 --> 01:01:04.630
BECAUSE SOME OF MY FEMINIST COLLEAGUES HAVE
SAID YOU COME FIRST ALPHABETICALLY! IT SHOULD

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:15.349
BE GINSBERG/SCALIA. I EXPLAIN THAT IN THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SENIORITY IS VERY

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:16.479
IMPORTANT.

01:01:16.479 --> 01:01:27.079
SCALIA WAS APPOINTED IN THE '80s. SO HE'S
A FEW STEPS AHEAD OF GINSBURG.

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:30.599
BY SENIORITY, IT'S SCALIA, GINSBURG.

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:41.279
THE CLOSING ARIA, WHAT IT PORTRAYS IS WE HAVE
DIFFERENT VIEWS ON HOW OUR CONSTITUTION SHOULD

01:01:41.279 --> 01:01:43.189
BE INTERPRETED.

01:01:43.189 --> 01:01:53.339
BUT WE REVERE THE COURT AND WE WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE DON'T DO ANY DAMAGE TO IT.

01:01:53.339 --> 01:02:01.920
SO DIFFERENT IN OUR VIEWS, BUT ONE IN OUR
REVERENCE FOR THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.859
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: DO YOU WANT TO TELL
PEOPLE HOW THE OPERA OPENS?

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:08.069
WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE?

01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:13.819
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: WELL THE OPERA IS
BORROWED FROM MANY LONG DEAD COMPOSERS.

01:02:13.819 --> 01:02:16.969
LONG DEAD BECAUSE THERE'S NO COPYRIGHT PROBLEMS.

01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:24.380
SO SCALIA'S OPENING ARIA IS HANDELLIAN. IT'S
A RAGE ARIA.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.839
IT GOES THIS WAY.

01:02:28.839 --> 01:02:30.299
THE JUSTICES ARE BLIND.

01:02:30.299 --> 01:02:34.180
HOW CAN THEY POSSIBLY SPOUT THIS.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:41.209
THE CONSTITUTION SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT
THIS.

01:02:41.209 --> 01:02:55.739
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT MY ANSWERING
ARIA, IT IS YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR BRIGHT LINE

01:02:55.739 --> 01:03:04.559
SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT DON'T HAVE EASY
ANSWERS BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT OUR CONSTITUTION

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.819
IT CAN EVOLVE!

01:03:06.819 --> 01:03:07.859
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:07.859 --> 01:03:25.730
AND THEN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENES,
AND I'M EAGER TO SEE THIS PERFORMED, IS JUSTICE

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:32.039
SCALIA HAS BEEN LOCKED UP IN A DARK ROOM BEING
PUNISHED FOR EXCESSIVE DISSENTING.

01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:33.039
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:46.359
AND I COME TO HIS RESCUE ENTERING THROUGH
A GLASS CEILING.

01:03:46.359 --> 01:03:48.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.970
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:58.069
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: WELL I THINK THIS IS
A FITTING NOTE ON WHICH TO END OUR CONVERSATION.

01:03:58.069 --> 01:04:03.069
BECAUSE A REALLY IMPORTANT NEXT STEP NEEDS
TO OCCUR, THE AWARDING OF THE RADCLIFFE MEDAL.

01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:07.450
THERE ISN'T A GLASS CEILING YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:14.049
AS BRILLIANT PROFESSOR, AS ORIGINATOR OF AN
ENTIRE LINE OF SCHOLARSHIP, ON GENDER DISCRIMINATION,

01:04:14.049 --> 01:04:15.839
AS BRILLIANT LAWYER.

01:04:15.839 --> 01:04:17.209
ALL WITHOUT ROLE MODELS.

01:04:17.209 --> 01:04:22.700
THERE WEREN'T WOMEN FEDERAL JUDGES BEFORE
1949. AND THEN OF COURSE AS THE SECOND WOMAN

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:29.119
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT AND A GREAT JUSTICE,
THANK YOU FOR THE INSPIRATION YOU HAVE GIVEN

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:38.289
TO ALL OF US WHO ARE PRIVILEGED TO HAVE BENEFITED
FROM THE PATHWAYS YOU HAVE FORGED IN THE LAW.

01:04:38.289 --> 01:04:42.249
AND LET ME JUST CLOSE BY ASKING YOU TO SAY
ONE LAST THING ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD SAY TO

01:04:42.249 --> 01:04:47.890
THE YOUNG WOMEN OF TODAY, IF SO MUCH COULD
CHANGE IN YOUR CAREER AND THROUGH YOUR CAREER,

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:51.569
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL
MESSAGE YOU HAVE FOR THEM?

01:04:51.569 --> 01:05:00.420
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: YOUNG WOMEN TODAY
HAVE THIS GREAT ADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.430
NO DOORS, NO MORE CLOSED DOORS.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:07.719
THAT WAS BASICALLY WHAT THE '70s WERE ABOUT.

01:05:07.719 --> 01:05:10.749
OPENING DOORS THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED TO WOMEN.

01:05:10.749 --> 01:05:23.679
SO MY ADVICE, WHAT IS MY ADVICE, IS FIGHT
FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT.

01:05:23.679 --> 01:05:34.839
BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT WILL LEAD OTHERS TO
JOIN YOU.

01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:37.150
THAT IS, ONE VITAL ASSET

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:43.869
IS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:05:43.869 --> 01:05:50.449
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PUTDOWNS I HAVE TURNED
AWAY THAT WAY.

01:05:50.449 --> 01:05:59.549
THE REMARK WAS MADE ABOUT THEN JUSTICE REHNQUIST
SAYING AT THE END OF THE MISSOURI JURY CASE.

01:05:59.549 --> 01:06:04.979
SO MRS. GINSBERG YOU WON'T SETTLE FOR SUSAN
B. ANTHONY'S FACE ON THE NEW DOLLAR?

01:06:04.979 --> 01:06:13.400
A PERFECT ANSWER WHICH I DIDN'T THINK OF ON
THE SPOT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO, JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.530
TOKENS WON'T DO.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:16.530
&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU TO JUSTICE GINSBURG.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:20.569
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO DEAN COHEN.

01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:37.359
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:48.559
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:56.819
I WILL SPEAK I THINK FOR EVERYONE IN THIS
ROOM, IN THIS TENT, TO THANK YOU KATHLEEN

01:06:56.819 --> 01:07:04.460
SULLIVAN FOR BEING SUCH A SPECTACULAR TEACHER
AS JUSTICE SOUTER TOLD US YOU ARE.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.650
AND FOR BEING PART OF ANOTHER RADCLIFFE DAY,
YOU WERE ON THE PANEL WHEN WE GAVE THE MEDAL

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:16.630
TO MARGIE MARSHALL, AND FOR SHARING YOUR INTELLIGENCE,
YOUR WHIT, YOUR CHARM WITH US.

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:23.490
WE HAVE SEEN TODAY THAT YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS
AS IMPRESSIVELY AS YOU CAN ANSWER THEM.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.359
AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR BOTH.

01:07:25.359 --> 01:07:28.459
SO THANK YOU.

01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:30.969
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:30.969 --> 01:07:40.039
AND OF COURSE TO JUSTICE GINSBURG, THANK YOU
FOR GIVING US SUCH A MARVELOUS DAY.

01:07:40.039 --> 01:07:45.799
YOU SO GENEROUSLY SHARED YOUR TIME, YOUR INSIGHTS,
AND YOUR WISDOM.

01:07:45.799 --> 01:07:51.920
IT IS NOW THE MOMENT TO CONFER ON YOU THE
2015 RADCLIFFE MEDAL.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.999
HERE IS THE CITATION.

01:07:54.999 --> 01:08:03.650
SHE IS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR EQUALITY
AND A DISPASSIONATE JURIST FOR JUSTICE.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:10.829
WHETHER IN THE MAJORITY OR THE MINORITY, SHE
ILLUMINATES A PATH TOWARD A SOCIETY OF GREATER

01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:13.589
FAIRNESS AND DIGNITY.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:21.460
SHE ELEVATES THE WORK OF THE COURT BY RESPECTING
HER OPPONENTS WHILE HOLDING STEADFAST TO HER

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.040
CONVICTIONS.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.230
JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG, I BESTOW UPON
YOU THIS RADCLIFFE MEDAL WITH THE DEEPEST

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:35.400
ADMIRATION FOR A LIFETIME OF BRILLIANT SERVICE.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:47.780
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:08:47.780 --> 01:09:00.160
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.350
[MUSIC]
