&gt;&gt; Rishi Chandra: So to talk a little bit
more about our partnerships as well as the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.009
overall Google TV mission, I'd like to introduce
Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.009
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.740
Thank you.
Thank you, Rishi.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.160
Thank you, Vincent.
20 years ago, I sat in the equivalent of this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.449
room, and people talked about the notion of
getting your television guide integrated with

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.030
the television.
Ten years ago, WebTV and other companies of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.680
its kind said, "Maybe we should find a way
to integrate the way you communicate and the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.550
way you use the Web onto your television."
We've been waiting a long, long time for today.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.980
It took a lot to make this happen.
Let's start with what it took.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.980
It took the Internet, it took extraordinarily
fast CPUs, DSPs, a whole new architecture

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
around software, the winning of open source,
and all of the platforms that you've seen.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's much harder to marry a 50-year-old technology
and a brand-new technology than those of us

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.940
from the brand-new technology area thought.
Of the things that we did and that you saw

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.409
in the demo, you saw the full potential of
cloud computing.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.409
You saw the ability to actually go from the
server to the client, in this case, the television,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.030
and you could even program it, and program
it using the powerful tools that we all use

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.720
every day.
There was one other thing that we needed,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.710
and it turned out to be fundamental.
We needed a whole ecosystem of partners.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.390
What I'd like to do is to bring the CEOs of
some significant partners that made this happen

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.780
on stage right now.
First, Paul Otellini, CEO of Intel.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.500
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you very much, Paul.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.369
You want to go ahead and have a seat.
Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.369
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you very much, Howard.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.939
Serious crowd.
They're engineers, Howard.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.479
They're our customers.
Jerry Quindlen, Logitech.

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:28.479
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Charles Ergen is the CEO of

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.209
the DISH Network.
[ Applause ]

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.209
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Hi, Charlie.
Nice to see you.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.650
And Brian Dunn, the CEO of Best Buy.
Thank you.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:59.469
And Shantanu Narayen, the most interestingly
controversial person in the last few weeks,

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.700
certainly involving Flash, the CEO of Adobe.
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.700
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you.
What I thought I would -- what I thought I

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:17.499
would do is ask a few questions of everybody,
and we sort of run over -- I think it was

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:21.700
just a phenomenal, phenomenal set of demos
and announcements.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.989
Paul, you and I have talked a lot about the
future of Intel, the things that you're doing,

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.680
the Atom processor turns out to be really,
really key in all of this.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.939
What is it that the Atom processor actually
is doing here?

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.669
Why is it so special?
Why is it not just a generic Intel processor?

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.730
&gt;&gt;Paul Otellini: Well, there's two things
about this chip that are inside the TVs and

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
the boxes that you described.
One is that it is a version of Atom.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.059
So we bring the full processing capability
of Intel that you expect, the software compatibility,

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:57.779
the Web compatibility is all there.
But the performance of a -- today's netbook,

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.709
notebook kind of products.
But we put around the Atom a bunch of specialized

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.319
circuitry for these devices that are the things
that are expected in high-performance consumer

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.029
electronics, HD video, encoding, decoding,
very high-performance graphics and so forth.

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:22.029
The combination of the two gives you the ability
to have that Internet experience, but also

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.210
the CE experience.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Did -- When you all built

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.900
the Atom processor, was this the use that
you intended?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.210
Was it a broader video platform that you foresaw?
&gt;&gt;Paul Otellini: It was one of the uses.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.210
We have 2,000 applications around Atom today
their popping up, from televisions to smartphones

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.199
to smart cars.
The microprocessor, Eric -- our view of the

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.289
microprocessor is, it's a transformational
technology.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.870
It makes the things it goes into smarter.
And when you combine that with -- that capability

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.509
with the Internet and wonderful software,
you get new capabilities that are -- that

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.789
will change the industries in ways that we
haven't seen before.

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.470
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So in this sense, it's an
extension of the Intel platform strategy.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.449
&gt;&gt;Paul Otellini: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: At a fundamental level.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.220
Shantanu, we've had a lot of fun in the press.
You've been on the other side of an awful

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.560
lot of stuff.
Flash, roughly, is used by 100% of the Web,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.560
but might be 99.97%.
So why is Flash so important to this?

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.810
What is Flash going to be used for in this
new platform?

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.470
Why are we fighting for Flash?
&gt;&gt;Shantanu Narayen: Eric, first, I think it's

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.110
tremendously exciting announcements here.
Thanks for having us.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.259
I think it really is all about engaging experiences
on the Web.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:50.159
And as was discussed, really, the convergence
of getting that content and applications to

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.919
any device that people wish to consume those
content and applications on, whether it's

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.530
a smartphone on Android, whether it's TV,
or whether it's a PC.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.069
And as far as we're concerned, this is really
about trying to create family Harmony.

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:09.139
So if Rishi's family can get Elmo when they
want and the NBA when they want, it's all

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.039
in Flash.
And it works as advertised across all of these

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.599
different devices.
I think for all of the content creators here,

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:21.139
we'd love to give them an opportunity to be
able to express their creativity and get it

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.069
across all of the set of devices.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What is it that's special

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:30.569
about Flash in this platform?
There's clearly hardware acceleration.

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:36.909
Is there something that Flash does special
here that makes this more interactive, zippier?

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.879
You know, what's the technical thing that
happens as a result of why you're using Flash?

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.120
&gt;&gt;Shantanu Narayen: We're working on 10.1.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Flash.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.389
&gt;&gt;Shantanu Narayen: We announced today we
are going to have a public beta on Android.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.669
What we had to do, really, was take into account
some of the key issues to get it to really

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.099
sing on these devices, so things like battery
life, things like performance, and really

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.939
getting the entire power of the Web, whether
it's high-definition video, or whether it's

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.789
casual gaming, where you know most of the
casual gaming on the Web is on Flash on your

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.569
particular platform.
So it's been a ton of work with Sony and with

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.080
Google to really make sure that it's optimized
for the respective platforms.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.110
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So how -- so, Sir Howard,
when you think about Sony and you think about

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.599
 -- to me, Sony is television.
So --

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:33.110
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: God bless you.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So are people going to go

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.259
out and buy new televisions because of this?
What is, in fact, the state of the television

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:44.569
industry, the breadth of this, from my perspective,
now having seen the full demo, including some

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:50.639
Bluetooth issues, it's much broader than I
thought, because it's maybe possible that

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:56.069
people will spend as much time or more watching
something other than television on their televisions.

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:02.050
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: Yeah, I think it is thrilling.
And I agree with you.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.629
I mean, I was watching the demonstrations
here today, which were -- which showed what

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:09.129
can be accomplished.
I mean, it was stressful with all -- everybody's

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:13.009
Bluetooth on and phones on and so forth.
So it was a fairly stressful experience.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:19.590
But when you put all of this, as we've done
for the full, into the world's first Internet

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.879
television, all of that will be simplified
and made seamless so that the opportunities

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:31.669
that you demonstrated are just mind-boggling.
It's essentially evolving all the time.

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:36.010
It's upgradable all the time.
The more you found out -- you find out about

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:41.780
the Internet, the more entertainment you find
for yourself, not just existing content, but

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.790
reality content, what you can do with each
other, your families, and so forth, the good

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.170
and the bad and the ugly.
And all of this is plausible on this feature.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.880
And when we launch it in the fall with everything
 --

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.340
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Did I just hear that?"
When we launch this in the fall"?

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.480
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: Fall.
That will be this year.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.940
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This year.
[ Applause ]

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.890
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which, by the way, might be
for the Christmas buying season?

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.500
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: Pardon?
That's why we're being very kissy to Best

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.240
Buy at the moment.
[ Laughter ]

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.500
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: We appreciate the love, Howard,
we really do.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.080
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: May it be returned.
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: Indeed.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.100
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So, you know, Sony is -- 
and we -- at Google, we always use Sony as

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.840
sort of the definition of an innovative company,
just one interesting idea after another, sometimes

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.620
hugely successful, sometimes not as successful.
But a passion of innovation that started from,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.760
literally, the founding of the firm.
Do you foresee using this kind of a platform

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.180
more broadly?
How will you in fact take Sony forward with

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.520
some of this new technology that you've seen?
And not just the Google TV, but the integration

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.340
with all the devices and things like that?
You already did, for example, the Sony Ericsson

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.030
product.
We talked about that.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:06.020
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: I wanted to plug Sony Ericsson
after that HTC wonderful plug you gave.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.100
Sony Ericsson phone is not available in the
United States yet in great numbers.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.580
But it is already, thanks to your platform,
dominating Japan.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.250
It is --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We never use the word "dominate,"

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.380
Howard.
It is the most successful in Japan.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.500
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Significant market share.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.210
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: When you beat Apple, you
 -- it's a new definition.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.550
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You guys will get your turn.
Trust me.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:37.330
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: No.
This is a wonderful relationship that we expect

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:44.150
to expand into other hardware and beyond.
We are fairly giddy with excitement at this

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.730
new relationship.
You're a partner with whom we have no fear.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.070
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: With whom you have no fear.
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: That's fairly unusual in

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:58.640
our business.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Jerry, so for the people who

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.230
are not going to run out to Best Buy and buy
a brand-new Sony television or whatever it

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:09.390
is Howard is up to with these guys, what was
interesting in reading about Logitech, you

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.270
guys are the largest manufacturers of remotes,
among other things?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:19.270
I think of Logitech as my keyboard, my mouse.
You're a much bigger ecosystem than I had

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.930
thought.
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: Yeah, I think it's probably

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.940
a safe bet that everyone in the room still
probably knows us best for these kind of products,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.230
keyboards, mice, webcams.
But we've actually been innovating in the

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.020
living room for several years now, in a lot
of products and in a lot of areas, but most

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.750
notably through our lines of remote controls
called Harmony, which I think probably --

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.330
 there you go.
Thank you.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.450
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We have some customers in
the room.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.110
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: And we have been very successful.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.030
But, you know, we felt that the biggest opportunity
in the living room, as excited as we are about

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.360
how well we've done with Harmony, we have
felt for a long time the biggest opportunity

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.550
in the living room is really what Rishi was
talking about, which is, it's this combination

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.840
of TV content and the Web and bringing it
all together in a seamless, open platform.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.210
That's why we're so excited about Google TV.
Obviously, what we're looking at, frankly,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.990
Eric, is the opportunity to do what we've
done successfully for 25 years around the

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.530
PC, which is create a whole new ecosystem
of peripherals around Google TV.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.350
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Do -- Now, you're going to
ship this box; right?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.770
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: Right.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What will I do with the box?

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.160
Tell me -- I want this now, as you know.
We had this conversation.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.010
What do I do with the box?
I just plug it?

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.940
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: Yeah.
I mean, so we will be providing -- as was

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.810
called out earlier by Rishi -- a companion
box.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.770
And with that companion box, you will get
a controller.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.450
And the controller integrates a keyboard 
--

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.070
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Is this a controller that's
going to work better than the one we used

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.380
today?
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: Yeah.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.390
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I hope so.
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: You get a controller with

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.930
a keyboard and it has remote control capabilities
basically integrated into it.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.420
We will ship that in the fall, as Sir Howard
 --

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.570
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which year?
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: This year.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This year.
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: In time for Christmas.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.320
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Just getting it on record.
&gt;&gt;Gerald Quindlen: But what you will need

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.030
to do, we've made it very simple.
Basically, if you're one of the 60 million

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.330
HD TV households in the U.S., you are a target
for this product.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.990
Basically, all you need is an HDMI input.
And it's pretty easy to set up and get going.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.340
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'm going to come to Christmas
at the end with Best Buy.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.980
Let's ask Charlie, you've -- I think you've
been in this industry, the video distribution

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.720
satellite industry for 25 or 30 years?
&gt;&gt;Charles Ergen: It will be 30 years.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.010
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: 30 years.
You're the fastest-growing satellite network

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.790
in the United States right now.
&gt;&gt;Charles Ergen: Actually the fastest pay

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.030
TV provider in the United States, that includes
all cable, phone companies, and satellite.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.110
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Wow.
Congratulations.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.940
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So, to some degree, you represent

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.780
both the traditional structure, as well as
this new structure.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.050
How will this technology -- how will these
devices and so forth, how will they change

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.010
the viewing experience?
How will they change your business?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:10.860
You've obviously bet big-time on this.
You must believe that it's going to be a big

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.390
phenomena, right, for your subscribers.
Presumably, you'll continue your even higher

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.380
growth rate as a result.
Tell me how it plays out for you.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.290
&gt;&gt;Charles Ergen: Well, we think it's going
to grow our business, and we think it opens

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.550
opportunity.
We always felt that good business is giving

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.810
 -- giving our customers what they want or
what they may not know they want, but we believe

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:35.600
they want and kind of get ahead of it.
So we already know our customers watch TV,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.560
and then they go to another room, to their
study or their office or somewhere else in

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.120
the house and they watch stuff on the computer.
So we know that they wanted to combine those

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.190
two things in a seamless way.
So one of the things we've been -- we've been

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:52.510
thinking about this for about ten years.
We started with WebTV, which ultimately was

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.260
bought by Microsoft and built the first DVR
and a Web experience that was a dialup.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.040
So it was just ahead of its time.
When Google.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.370
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But in many ways, I think
it showed the path.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.440
&gt;&gt;Charles Ergen: It kind of showed the path.
When we started working with Google about

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:13.440
three years on advertising and viewer measurement,
as you guys started looking at Google TV over

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.500
the last couple of years, we were happy to
get involved in the process pretty early on

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.820
so that that seamless experience is going
to be more seamless with DISH Network than

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.340
with any other video provider.
So that means your DVR is going to function

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.630
in a more seamless way, you're not going to
have -- it's going to be a much easier process

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.610
so that you don't know when you switch from
the Web to linear TV.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.340
People are still going to watch the world
series or the Super Bowl or a 3D movie.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.920
They're still going to watch that from satellite.
But when they want something more specific,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.210
they're clearly going to want to be able to
do the Web.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.450
So we're just going to integrate that into
a better product.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.600
If we build a better product, hopefully, good
things happen.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.650
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It's interesting that one
of the things that your company and ours did

00:15:54.650 --> 00:16:00.550
was focus on the analytics of television,
which had not really been explored before.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:06.260
And this strikes me as an analytical platform
at a whole new level in terms of measurement,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.430
accountability, advertising.
Do you see that?

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.110
How do you -- what are some of the things
that you've learned in running an analytical

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.240
television business as opposed to just the
traditional ones?

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.490
&gt;&gt;Charles Ergen: I think the Analytics do
two things for us.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.460
One is it allows us to give a better product
to our customer so we can make recommendations,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.880
right.
So you watch a Jimmy Stewart western movie

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.200
and maybe we'll put up a Glenn Ford movie
because we know those two go together.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:32.200
The second thing we know is, from an advertiser
point of view, who are also all of our customers,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.530
they want to reach customers out there, that
we can give them a better path where they

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.850
actually get a return on their investment
and we can show them they get a return on

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.630
their investment to reach customers, that's
going to be better for customers, because

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.680
I'm not going to watch a diaper ad, I'm going
to watch a Lexus ad that might be for appealing

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.490
to me, or whatever.
So I think all of those things go hand in

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.450
hand.
And I think it's important that at DISH Network,

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.170
we want to work with everybody in this room.
Many of the applications we saw here today,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.900
there's no question they're going to be hugely
popular applications.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:11.280
But I would predict that this room out there,
people out there will invent new applications

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.760
that will be even superior to what we saw
today.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.810
And we're going to make sure that you can
work with DISH Network so you can do that

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.959
in a more seamless way.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which is in fact why we're

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:26.130
announcing all of this now.
So, Brian, what I particularly like about

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:33.130
you all is that you are the surviving and
strongest and growing national retailer in

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.360
the things that every single person in this
audience cares about.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.940
Literally, every single person here is a huge
customer.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.100
Right?
When you think about the -- and as I understand

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.190
your industry, the profits really do come
at Christmas; right?

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.800
The -- it really is a relate business in the
 --

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.840
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: It is certainly disproportionate.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: -- in sort of the most brutal

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.130
kind of way.
And these businesses are often mature now.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.400
So do you see -- How do you see this playing
out?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.880
Do you see this driving new traffic?
Do you see this setting a new price point?

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.350
It's a whole ecosystem.
It's more than -- it's more than a spot on

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.290
your -- on your aisle.
It's really sort of a whole new aisle, if

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.060
you will.
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: A couple things.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.490
One, Eric, we share your enthusiasm for the
fact that we're a survivor.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.160
We feel really great about that.
That's one.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:31.320
Two, we have a saying inside Best Buy that
this is the most important holiday Christmas-selling

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.490
season in the history of the company, and
it's true every single year.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:40.140
What we're really enthusiastic about with
what we've seen with Google TV and what we

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:45.000
think it means, is, you're right, it's not
just a new aisle, we think of it as an entirely

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:52.000
new category, the smart TV, which we think,
when properly demonstrated and properly explained

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.070
to customers, is going to solve real challenges
they face today.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.900
Let me give you an example of what happens.
And I think this is absolutely how people

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.730
are living today.
So you're sitting in your family room or your

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.490
home theater, or wherever it is you watch
and sitting with the people you care about

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.500
and watching a basketball game.
Invariably, in my house, anyway, I'm sitting

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.300
there with my laptop, my sons have their laptops,
and we're arguing the age-old question, Kobe

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.780
versus LaBron, and we're having a spirited
debate and everybody is pulling up the facts.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:30.780
This is really the first seamless experience
I have seen that actually allows the source

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.570
to be absolutely agnostic behind the television,
and you're able to pull up the things you

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.260
care about real-time, and I think it is absolutely
compelling, and I think there's going to be

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:47.290
an enormous consumer appetite to do this.
And, again, I think it opens up an entirely

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:52.680
new category.
And from a Best Buy perspective, we're pretty

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.480
excited.
We have 180,000 blue shirts out there that

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.700
are pretty fired up about this new category.
And we've got 20,000 geeks in case everything

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.040
doesn't work perfectly, as we know, even with
the greatest technology in the world, it doesn't

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.470
always work seamlessly.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Again, one of the reasons

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.970
why you all have done so well is because of
what you call the blue shirts and the service

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.210
quality is phenomenal in the stores.
My sense in watching this is that it will

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.530
be such a new idea for people that you're
going to have to actually demonstrate it to

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.010
them.
You have to actually see it to get excited

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.200
about it.
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: You do.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.990
In fact, I was fortunate enough to get an
in-depth demo last Friday.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:36.620
And when it is explained to you and you actually
see what it is you can do and experience it,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.570
it's compelling.
In fact, I need one.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.540
And it is a reoccurring theme.
Right now, Howard, I need one.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.640
We have to talk about that.
But I do think it is going to be broadly accepted.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.450
Because it does address how people are in
an ad hoc fashion enjoying and consuming media

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.250
right now.
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: Yeah.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.059
You hit the nail on the head, because we haven't
talked about third-party developers and so

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:06.360
forth.
I mean, the opportunity to expand this universe

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.250
above and beyond, I mean, it's -- it's evolutionary,
because it will continue to evolve.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.680
And it's upgradable.
So you think of it in a whole new way.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.320
It's active television.
It's not only interactive, it's pro active

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.980
as it grows and grows and grows and creates
opportunities for people in America and ultimately

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.230
all over the world.
It really is a very big deal.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.809
I can't stress that enough.
&gt;&gt;Brian Dunn: And it is utterly -- you can

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:39.520
personalize it, make it your experience in
a way that I think is going to be very, very

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.650
compelling.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'm getting the hook from

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.710
Vic.
We're having such a good time.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.080
&gt;&gt;Sir Howard Stringer: He had a long time on the
stage.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.660
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The reason we wanted to do
this announcement here and with all of our

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:57.660
partners is that we need you to take this
platform and build extraordinary things that

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.809
we have not yet conceived of.
We now have the tools.

00:22:02.809 --> 00:22:06.100
We have the volume.
We have the economics.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.000
And we have the scale.
All we need now are your ideas, your precious

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.070
time to build this set of applications I think
to really not just define television in a

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:22.280
new way, but ultimately, to define how people
entertain themselves and learn in what has

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.140
historically been a medium that never, ever
changed.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.450
This is a very, very exciting, from my perspective,
beginning.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.309
And I want to thank everybody for spending
so much time here, the commitments from your

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:36.520
companies, and all of the work you guys are
going to do with all of us to make this happen.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.280
So thank you, all.
