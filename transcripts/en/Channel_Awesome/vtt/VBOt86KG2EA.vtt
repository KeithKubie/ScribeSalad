00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.120
So I'm not going to lie

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.700
one of the few Disney sequels

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.280
that piqued my interest

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.800
a liiitle bit was Little Mermaid II.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.360
Aside from Return of Jafar

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.740
I never saw any of the Disney sequels

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.900
They just didn't pique my interest

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.780
and I think I was a little too old for 'em

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.380
but when I saw the commercials for this one

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.100
about Ariel's daughter who is a human

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.320
who wants to become a mermaid

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.220
I thought... That's kind of a clever idea

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.340
...Okay I wasn't expecting much

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.000
I know it's a Disney sequel but..

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.020
I thought there were some possibilities in this.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.120
I popped it in gave it a watch

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.080
and....

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.140
Yyyyyeah... It sucked....

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.980
Okay maybe that's too strong a word

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.880
but they just felt like an hour and a half of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.880
Nothing.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.200
This story should be so easy to make interesting

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.820
but instead you just felt like they're going through the motions.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.740
The motions that, we gotta see these character again.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.220
We gotta do at least five dumb kid's movies cliches

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.460
that you've seen everywhere

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700
and we have to in no way make the characters feel like

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.880
their decisions  are making the story flow.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.340
Doing what the story says they have to do.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.360
And it's a shame, because

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.700
like I said, I thought this was a good idea.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Ariel and Eric have given birth to a little girl named Melody.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.820
She's about to be introduced to her grandfather, Triton

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.600
but then, Ursula's crazy sister...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.340
Interrupts and threatens to kill Melody

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.800
Unless Triton hands over his his magic trident.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.300
She's defeated but they decide to follow Frozen parent's logic

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.080
and just keep her away from the thing that she would obviously be very drawn to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.000
instead of finding about a million other ways around  this.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.720
So she can never be told about merpeople or the sea or anything like that.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.280
In fact they even build a wall in between the kingdoms.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.820
[Insert Trump joke here.]

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340
But Triton tells Sebastian to keep an eye on her

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.280
Because......Yeah..that makes sense...

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.520
And twelve years pass, but everybody acts like it was just twelve minutes..

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.140
No

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.660
really.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.460
Twelve years later Sebastian is like.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980
"Oh, look after her he said.."

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.720
But... Wait.. Why are you acting like he just said that, when it was twelve years ago?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.960
Also Ursula's sister is trying to turn this little guppy

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.840
back into a shark, that was just transformed into a guppy

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.940
Why are you still doing this twelve years later and acting like it just happened a few minutes ago?!

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.700
Th th...This is the kinda logic this movie runs on!

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.600
Melody constantly sneaks under the wall and goes into the sea because she loves it so much.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.160
She..

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.240
doesn't question the fact that she can talk to crabs and fish 'n seagulls

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.160
but apparently every one else does and sees her as kind of weird.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.060
When Sebastian  accidentally gets loose during a party

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.020
and causes a big scene

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.200
she thinks she's to blame, even though...

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.960
Nobody said she's to blame.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.480
And this ruins her big night.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.620
That.. I guess could've possibly gone awkward anyway.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.400
You see Ariel cross her fingers, though we don't know why.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.880
She's afraid to dance with this boy, though we don't know why

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.720
She looks down at her feet like she doesn't know how to dance

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.700
but this was never addressed...

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.120
Yeah, we're not even at the meat of the story yet.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.580
And nothing is adding up!

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.800
She finds her old magical locket that shows that the underwater city is real

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.860
and this convinces her that it's totally rational to leave her home and try to find it.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.520
Yeah.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.780
Again, kinda crazy.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.920
She comes across Ursula's sister who turns her into a mermaid

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
but sadly she says she doesn't have enough magic to keep her that way.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.200
The only thing that does enough magic, is King Triton's trident.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.560
Who she now says he stole from her.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.160
Because Melody has succumbed to stupidly written kid's syndrome, like in all bad scripts.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.360
she believes her thinks Triton is the bad guy and goes and tries to steal from him.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.300
Along the way, she comes across sea Timon and Pumbaa

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.480
Yeah, I'm sure they have other names, but it's just Timon and Pumbaa underwater

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.940
And she even totally 100% betrays her mother.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.760
While also simultaneously dooming the world.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.420
[The sound of a man who is dead inside]

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.760
God is this movie stupid

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.420
Every second there's another

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.360
dumb thing that doesn't add up

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.900
or something that just makes a character look selfish or idiotic

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.880
When Melody finds out that her mother has been lying to her

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.100
and that her life is a lie

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.740
Look at this!

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.280
She runs right past her dad!

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.880
The dad doesn't even give a shit!

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.220
Oh hey Ariel! What's up?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.480
[Distressed critic noises]

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.020
Tend to your daughter you idiot!

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.320
He doesn't even go with Ariel to go find her, he stays behind and says 'good luck!'

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.360
Even Jasmine threw a punch in Aladdin three

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.560
This guy just does nothing!

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.020
The only characters very occasionally of interest

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.720
Are either Melody, or the evil sister

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.720
Once and a while they do a good expression on them

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.040
And hey, Pat Carrol's back

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.000
to do the voice.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.300
She could read the phonebook and make it sound deliciously evil

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.120
Even the animation is just...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.900
Generic..

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.620
I can't say it's bad...

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.260
But..

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.920
Nothing really stands out about it either.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.520
I remember the incredible expressions that they gave Ariel in the first one

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.480
Even when she couldn't talk the animation on her face was just so passionate and so well done

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.500
Here she just feels like a robot.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.580
Look kinda happy.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.040
Look kinda sad.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.140
Look kinda worried.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.720
Look kinda whimsical.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.100
It's like talking the notes instead of singing the notes.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.360
The Disney sequels that had generic animation always had something that stood out about it.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.360
Pocahontas II had a lot of great expressions, and some good nature shots

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.760
Beauty and the Beast II has nice winter colors and that awesome organ.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.240
This just seems like it's there to do it's job.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.180
And that's it.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.640
I can't totally blame them, I'm sure they were rushed and had get it out fast.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.660
But it's just so weird that nothing.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.280
Freakin' nothing

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.720
stands out about it..

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.520
Even the songs are forgettable

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.120
I don't remember a single one!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.240
I dunno.. I guess I shouldn't be shocked.. I mean..

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.160
It's a Disney sequel this is what were supposed to expect...but..

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.680
I really like this idea!

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.480
I wanted to see more of Melody longing for the sea.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.060
I wanted to see more conflict between her and the parents.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.840
I wanted her when she finally gets into the ocean to see what spectacular world it is!

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.620
Like her life is starting anew!

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.440
...But instead of feeling any of that you're just kind of shown it...

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.340
You're told what's going on and not experiencing it.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.640
I guess it's not awful especially compared to other Disney sequels

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.500
it's just..

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.100
Bland..

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.640
And not very memorable

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.600
and for an idea like this, especially being a sequel to  such a passionate film

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.900
You would think even a rushed sequel off of something so passionate would leave some kind of impact

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.080
I guess it's fine and corny enough for little kids

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.420
But for someone who really loved the beauty and energy and elegance of the original.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.660
For me... this definitely... Flounders.
