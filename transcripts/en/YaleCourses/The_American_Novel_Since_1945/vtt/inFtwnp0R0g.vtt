1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.470
All right,

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.730
I from I've put two quotations on the board for your consideration.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.590
The first is from Norman mailer.
This is from advertisements for myself.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.240
Um,
he says,
Jack Kerouac lacked discipline,
intelligence,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.910
honesty and a sense of the novel.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.590
Of course some people might apply those adjectives to male or himself,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.250
but um,
that's what mailer said on the road.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.830
This is from a critic named George [inaudible].

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.900
This is from a 1974 article about on the road is a love story,

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
not a travel log and certainly not a call to revolution.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.120
So,
uh,

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.170
I put these up here to sort of sit in the background of what I'm going to talk

13
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.620
to you about today,

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.980
about the ultimate payoff for Kerouac's effort and the beats effort more

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:59.211
generally to imagine a language that is the adequate analog to experience a

16
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:08.241
language that is itself a kind of experience and further that is an ecstatic,

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.440
mystical kind of experience.

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.250
Last time.
In addition to introducing that idea of language to you,

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
I conducted a reading of the first part of the novel where I suggested that

20
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.170
Kerouac tells us a story that is not so much about the escape from an American

21
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.050
consumer culture of the postwar period.
Um,

22
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
as it is a story about the absolute immersion in a culture of consumption.

23
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.010
So what sal paradise consumes on the road,

24
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.101
uh,

25
00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:01.101
extends from Pi as I demonstrated to you by the multiple references,

26
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.473
um,

27
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.660
the simple food that the body needs and wants to girls.

28
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.030
All the women that he tries to sleep within that Dean tries to sleep with,
um,

29
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:20.031
over the course of the novel to money and the consumer goods that come with it

30
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
in order to build a middle class American life with his aunt in New York.

31
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:29.400
Remember,
he buys the icebox,

32
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.760
the first electric icebox of their family,

33
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.290
the first refrigerator of their family when he comes back from his first road

34
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:42.291
trip to a kind of mystical access to America,

35
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.330
a history of Jazz.
There's a whole set of mystical,

36
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.493
um,

37
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.190
cultural artifacts that sal paradise and his friends consume over the course of

38
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.764
this novel.

39
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.870
So I want to begin just by pointing to you,
uh,

40
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.210
on page 297

41
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.800
<v 1>okay.</v>

42
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.930
<v 0>Uh,</v>

43
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.820
someone more complex example of what this looks like towards the end of the

44
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:17.654
novel.

45
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.110
<v 0>This is at the bottom of that page.
They're driving out of Mexico,</v>

47
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.450
so,
and dean
and they meet um,

48
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.560
indigenous people along the road as we climbed the air group cooler and the

49
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:49.550
Indian girls on the road warrior shawls over their heads and shoulders.

50
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:50.990
They hailed us desperately.

51
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.730
We stopped to see they wanted to sell us little pieces of rock crystal.

52
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.380
They're great brown,

53
00:03:57.381 --> 00:04:02.381
innocent eyes looked into ours with such soulful intensity that not one of us

54
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:06.830
had the slightest sexual thought about them.
Moreover,
they were very young.

55
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.270
Some of them 11 and looking almost 30.
Look at those eyes.
Breathe Dean.

56
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.930
They were like the eyes of the virgin mother when she was a child.

57
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.350
We saw in them the tender and forgiving gaze of Jesus and they stared on

58
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:25.340
flinching into ours.
We rubbed our nervous blue eyes and looked again.

59
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:29.810
Still,
they penetrated us with sorrowful and him nautic gleam.

60
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.430
When they talked,

61
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.460
they suddenly became frantic and almost silly in their silence.

62
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.360
They were themselves.

63
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.760
They've only recently learned to sell these crystals since the highway was built

64
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.370
about 10 years back.
Up until that time,

65
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:51.260
this entire nation must have been silent.
That's dean

66
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.980
in this fantasy about the indigenous girls.

67
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.310
What you see is a commitment to language and the activity of selling,

68
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.650
buying and selling entirely entwined with one another.

69
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.160
So the fantasy here is that it's selling and buying that produces in them a

70
00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:21.971
language that looks very much like the language that's frequently attributed to

71
00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:26.630
dean.
Frantic and silly,
almost silly.
You remember as the,

72
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.780
as the novel goes on and dean gets more and more hyper sort of wigged out,

73
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.580
his language becomes more and more frantic and more and more actually silly.

74
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.300
So this is here,
attributed to them.

75
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.260
There are other fantasies at work here,
obviously.
Um,

76
00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:51.261
one is that they are reading a kind of Christian essential ism into these

77
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.450
people,
into their eyes.

78
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.370
They see the Virgin Mary and they see Jesus,
um,

79
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.610
there's a whole mystical objectification of these people that's going on that's

80
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.000
lie to the religious strains of this novel,

81
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.920
which I'm going to pick up again,
um,
a little bit later on in my lecture today.

82
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.310
<v 0>So this is a more complex and sort of dance example of how that consumer,</v>

84
00:06:20.611 --> 00:06:25.611
that push to consume that consumer sense drives and motivates the novel and

85
00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:30.360
plays out in what they see when they're on the road.

86
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.920
<v 0>In that passage that I read to you,
um,</v>

88
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.360
when they're in the mountains in Colorado drunk yelling,

89
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.800
they call themselves mad drunk.
Can Americans,
well,

90
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:51.660
what does America mean in this novel and what does it mean to be an American in

91
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.470
this novel?
So that's the question I'd like to take up today.

92
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.360
First
coming from Lolita,

93
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.430
the vision of America and on the road looks quite different in Lolita.

94
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.890
The vision of America is my new toy.
It's detailed.

95
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.330
It's concrete.

96
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

97
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.670
<v 0>Remember,
for example,</v>

98
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.730
the comfy cabins that novakof gives us as Lolita and Humbert tour around the,

99
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.970
the painful Luminis tiny detail of all that they see on the road.

100
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.020
Think to yourself.
Do you see any of that kind of detail in this book?

101
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.250
I see shaking heads.
No,
we really don't.
What do we see instead?

102
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.890
What America do we see,
um,

103
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.720
I'm going to look back to a passage I talked about in a different vein last time

104
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.250
on 26 and 27 just for one quick example.

105
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.841
This is,

106
00:07:55.841 --> 00:08:00.841
remember when he's hitched a ride in this truck and it's a truck bed full of uh,

107
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:06.270
men who have hitched rides and he's talking with Mississippi gene.

108
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.980
This is at the bottom of 26.

109
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.190
There was something so indivisibly reminiscent of big slim hazard in Mrs. Slip

110
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.990
sippy genes,
demeanor that I said,

111
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:22.210
do you happen to have met a fellow called big slim hazard somewhere?
And he said,

112
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.530
you mean that tall fellow with the big laugh?
Well that sounds like him.

113
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:31.120
He came from Ruston Louisiana.
That's right.
Louisiana slim.
He's sometimes called.

114
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:31.990
Yes sir.

115
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.730
I sure have met big slim and he used to work in the east Texas oil fields.

116
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.520
East Texas is right and now he's punching cows.

117
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.350
And that was exactly right and still I couldn't believe Jean could really have

118
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:48.310
known slim,
whom I'd been looking for more or less for years.

119
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

120
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.970
<v 0>In this scene,</v>

121
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.390
big slim hazard is an type just as Mississippi gene is himself.

122
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.780
Their names tell you that they're almost cartoonishly,

123
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.330
uh,
American types.

124
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.410
The fact that Mississippi gene knows this vague person,

125
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:18.411
big slim hazard gives you the feeling that America is a tiny community in which

126
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:23.580
these types loom large,

127
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.770
that anyone from anywhere,
if he's the right kind of American,

128
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.980
will know the other members of that American tribe of types.

129
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.340
So Mississippi gene knows the America that sound knows,

130
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.050
and it's America populated by these larger than life figures.

131
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.030
The very vagueness of the description,

132
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.080
you mean the tall fellow with the big laugh?

133
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.230
How many people can we imagine who might fit that description?

134
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.250
It's like telling your horoscope,
if you're general enough,

135
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.540
you're going to make a match.

136
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.590
So Sao is convinced,

137
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.750
he wants to be convinced.

138
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.360
He desperately wants to be convinced that Mississippi gene knows big,

139
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:19.290
slim hazard.
Let's look at another example

140
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.850
on page 59

141
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.970
this is something else sal wants.

142
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.170
I wanted to see Denver 10 years ago when they were all children.

143
00:10:37.961 --> 00:10:42.760
That's Chad and dean and the other Denver natives they have among them in their

144
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.970
gang and in the sunny cherry blossom morning of springtime in the Rockies,

145
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.630
rolling their hoops up.
The joyous alleys full of promise,

146
00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:57.631
the whole game and dean ragged and dirty prowling by himself in his preoccupied

147
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.830
frenzy.
There's a nostalgia here,

148
00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:05.740
not for the past of the old west.

149
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.960
It's important that Denver's in the West.

150
00:11:07.961 --> 00:11:11.980
It's the nostalgia here is not for the the old west,

151
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.140
but for the young west.

152
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.080
The West in on the road is an area of youth.

153
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.050
It's always in American lore,

154
00:11:23.051 --> 00:11:28.051
been an area of adventure and imagination.

155
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.440
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.190
<v 0>but this is well after the end of manifest destiny.</v>

157
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.320
There is no border in the west.

158
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.500
So sal has to reinvent one and in some sense it's a border of time.

159
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:48.101
It's a spring of youth that's inaccessible somehow to sell that these men he's

160
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.483
with,

161
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.140
who are so exciting to him as their own kind of western American type that they

162
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:06.301
blossomed and grew in this particular place and he wants to have been there with

163
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.010
them.
So in a way,

164
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:14.011
by longing to be where they were when they were children,

165
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.660
by longing to inhabit that time as well.
He wants to become them.

166
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.080
So this is just one of the ways that sal longs to assimilate them to himself.

167
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.820
The other big way of course is through Dean's language,
but this is another way.

168
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.850
It's a vision of the West as a place of a generally male.
You

169
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.303
<v 1>okay?</v>

170
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.160
<v 0>When he's back in New York,
this is on page one 25</v>

171
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.770
his New York friends meet his road friends and are delighted by them.

172
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.860
This is one of his friends.

173
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.950
So where did you find these absolutely wonderful people.

174
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.690
I've never seen anyone like them.
I found them in the west.

175
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.290
So there's that sense of the West as a source and what he's going to do is take

176
00:13:18.301 --> 00:13:19.500
them back east.

177
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.100
So the West is a fountain of youthful energy that sal continually draws back to

178
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:30.720
the east,
to New York.

179
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.770
Sal's never really going to be gone from New York that long.

180
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.990
He never really wants to leave and one sign of it is that icebox,

181
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.130
but the other side of it is that he continually returns and takes these people

182
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:44.964
with him

183
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.440
and part of the pleasure for him is to do that transaction to enliven the old

184
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.430
east with the young west.

185
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.470
These are all stereotypes of America,

186
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.850
but sal really believes them and really inhabits them.

187
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.850
Now look on one 72

188
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:11.963
<v 1>okay.</v>

189
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.690
<v 0>This is sal in one of his major moments of vision.</v>

190
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:29.230
He's in New Orleans and he's on market street.

191
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.460
Oh,
sorry.
He's sorry.
He's in San Francisco and he's on market street.

192
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

193
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.350
<v 0>This is the middle of one 72</v>

194
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.980
I looked down market street.

195
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.700
I didn't know whether it was that or canal street in New Orleans.

196
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.620
It led to water ambiguous,
universal water just as 40 street.

197
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.790
New York leads to water and you never know where you are.

198
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.020
I thought of Ed Duncan's ghost on Times Square.
I was delirious.

199
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.180
I wanted to go back and layer at my strange Dickensian mother in the hash joint.

200
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.060
I tingled all over from head to foot.

201
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.630
It seemed I had a whole host of memories going back to 1750 in England and then

202
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:18.830
I was in San Francisco.
Now only in another life and in another body.

203
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.580
No,
that woman's seem to say would that terrified glance don't come back and play

204
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:27.320
your honest,
hardworking mother.

205
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.680
You are no longer like a son to me and like your father.

206
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:34.490
My first husband air this kindly Greek took pity on me.

207
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.040
The proprietor was a Greek with hairy arms.

208
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.170
You are no good inclined to drunkenness and routes and final disgraceful robbery

209
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:45.740
of the fruits of my own belabors in the habitat,
Sri.
Oh son.

210
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.510
Did you not ever go on your knees and pray for deliverance from all your sins

211
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:55.190
and scoundrels?
Acts lost boy depart.
Do not haunt my soul.

212
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.840
I have done well for getting you reopen.

213
00:15:57.841 --> 00:16:02.841
No old wounds be as if you had never returned and looked into me to see my

214
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:03.561
laboring.

215
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:08.510
Humility is my few scrub penny's Hungary to grab quick to deprive,

216
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:12.860
sullen on loved mean minded son of my flesh son,

217
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.873
son.

218
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.800
It made me want to think of old of the Big pop vision and Grit.
Grit,
no,

219
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:21.500
with old bowl.
And for just a moment,

220
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.670
I had reached the point of ecstasy that I always wanted to reach,

221
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:31.030
which was the complete step across chronological time into timeless shadows and

222
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:36.260
wonderment in the bleakness of the mortal realm and the sensation of death

223
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.470
kicking at my heels to move on with a phantom dogging it's own heals and myself

224
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:46.910
hurrying to a plank where all the angels dove off and flew into the holy void of

225
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:48.290
uncreative emptiness.

226
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:53.180
The potent and inconceivable radiants is shining and bright mind essence,

227
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.010
innumerable lotus lands falling open in the magic mouth swarm of heaven.

228
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.190
That language at the end there is pure Alan Ginsburg.

229
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:02.900
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.130
<v 0>so that's that incantatory beat mysticism.</v>

231
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.720
It's mysticism of emptiness in the end,

232
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:17.350
but what fills that emptiness as we lead up to that moment is this fantasy of

233
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:23.441
trans historical existence that he can somehow embody a whole human story across

234
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:25.904
time.

235
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.520
Where's that story coming from?
Well,

236
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.770
this is a Dickensian mother.

237
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.770
It's dickens in part,

238
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.343
<v 1>that</v>

239
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.420
<v 0>stereotype of old London of the urban working class.</v>

240
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.650
But it's not just dickens.
Moby Dick is here too.

241
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.310
If look at that litany of streets that lead down to the water.

242
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.020
Uh,
any of you who have read Moby Dick will recall that Ishmael talks at the

243
00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:00.510
beginning before he gets on the p Quad,

244
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:05.511
he talks about how streets that lead to water draw you inevitably.

245
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.720
And he talks about all the streets in New York that ended in water and he has

246
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:14.070
this long meditation on that aspect of city geography.

247
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.400
Well here's Sao having that meditation too.

248
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.850
So what you see in this passage is not only a sort of mystical trans historical

249
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:24.660
fantasy,
but a literary one.

250
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.500
He's getting his mythology not just from the cupboard of stereotypes that are

251
00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.510
proper to American self conception.

252
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.400
He's looking back to literary stories too that he can assimilate into his

253
00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:50.630
experience and read through experience through.

254
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.950
So that every little thing he experiences like this moment of abandonment,

255
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.990
Dean has gone off with Camille.
Mary Lou is off somewhere else.

256
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.770
He starved.
He doesn't have any place to go,

257
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.450
but it becomes a moment of vision and it can be a moment of vision because he

258
00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:16.451
has these ways of layering over that experience with mythic and literary

259
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:19.370
significance.

260
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

261
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:27.170
<v 0>Finally on one 47 we have another example of this and it shows us,</v>

262
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.570
uh,
something even a little different

263
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.860
or it pushes the point further.
This is in New Orleans.

264
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.460
<v 0>There was a mythic Raith the fog,
this is in the middle of that big paragraph</v>

266
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.190
over the Brown waters that night together with dark driftwoods and across the

267
00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:52.300
way New Orleans glowed orange bright with a few dark ships at her,

268
00:19:52.301 --> 00:19:57.301
him ghostly fog bound Serino ships with Spanish balconies and ornamental poops

269
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.130
till you got up close and saw they were just old freighters from Sweden and

270
00:20:03.131 --> 00:20:06.400
Panama.
The ferry fires glowed in the night.

271
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.580
The same negroes plied the shovel in saying old big slim hazard had once worked

272
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:16.660
on the Algiers ferry as a deck hand.
This made me think of Mississippi gene too.

273
00:20:16.661 --> 00:20:20.170
And as the river pour down from mid America by starlight.
I knew,

274
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.350
I knew like mad that everything I had ever known and would ever know was one

275
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.640
strange to say too,

276
00:20:27.641 --> 00:20:32.641
that night we crossed the ferry with bully a girl committed suicide off the deck

277
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.960
either just before or just after us.
We saw it in the paper next day.

278
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.273
<v 1>Okay,</v>

279
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.870
<v 0>here you get a dream,</v>

280
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.070
not just of trans historical time,

281
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.850
the Spanish ships that turn out just to be freighters from Sweden and Panama.

282
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.770
You get another nod to Melville Serino ships.
Benito.

283
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:01.180
Serena is one of,
um,
Melville Melville's famous novels.

284
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.673
Um,

285
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.820
we were all that everything I would ever know was one.

286
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:09.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.650
<v 0>The oneness that he's looking for is partly that oneness of mystical emptiness</v>

288
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:16.480
that we saw in the last passage.

289
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:22.110
But here we get the sense of the racial oneness that comes out in some of the

290
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:27.040
other parts of the novel,
the,
uh,

291
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.400
the negroes plying the shovel and singing another American type.

292
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.270
But this is a type with which sell longs to merge.

293
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:43.050
And this is how on 71 79 and one 80 this is how he imagines a way out of

294
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:49.894
himself.

295
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.900
So this is on one 79 so I'm moving from the question of what does America look

296
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:12.060
like?
What's the mythic vocabulary that sal is using to,

297
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.780
how does he find his identity as an as an American?

298
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.280
So first he makes America mythic rather than specific.

299
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.330
If we compare him back to Novaka off,

300
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.020
and then he enters into that mythology through acts of identification.

301
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.480
And here's one of the most important.

302
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.190
At dusk,
I walked,
I felt like a speck on the surface of the sad red earth.

303
00:22:41.191 --> 00:22:45.540
I pass the Windsor Hotel where Dean Moriarty had lived with his father in the

304
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:47.700
depression thirties as of your,

305
00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:51.210
I looked everywhere for the sat and Fabled Tin Smith of my mind.

306
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.280
Either you find someone who looks like your father in places like Fontana or you

307
00:22:56.281 --> 00:23:01.110
look for a friend's father where he is no more.
At Lilac evening,

308
00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:05.190
I walked with every muscle aching along the lights of 27th and Welton in the

309
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:08.340
Denver colored section wishing I were a negro.

310
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.410
Feeling that the best the white world had offered was not enough ecstasy for me.

311
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.280
Not enough life.
Joy Kicks,
darkness,
music.

312
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.320
Not Enough night.

313
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.940
He goes on in this vein for that whole paragraph.
Or if you just skimmed down,

314
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.160
uh,
I was only myself,
Sal Paradise,
sad,
strolling in this violet dark,

315
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.240
this unbearably sweet night,
wishing I could exchange worlds with the happy,

316
00:23:39.241 --> 00:23:42.420
true hearted,
Ecstatic Negros of America.
Well,

317
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.480
this is hugely stereotypically the stereotypical hugely appropriative Sao wants

318
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:57.071
to take the entire life experience of a group of people and suck it into

319
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:01.520
himself.
Now you want to ask yourself,

320
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.300
what is the sadness that motivates this appropriation?

321
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.100
Why does he want to become the Negro?

322
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.090
He says in another moment,
I was Mexican.

323
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.830
He's always trying to be more exotic than himself

324
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.930
than simple sal paradise.
Well,

325
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.670
Baldwin had something to say about this.
James Baldwin,
um,

326
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.940
characterize this passage as a absolute nonsense and offensive nonsense at that.

327
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.230
And yet there is real pain in it and real loss,
however thin.

328
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.150
And it is thin,
thin because it,
uh,
it,

329
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.100
uh,
site.
Uh,
let's see.
Sorry,
there's a Typo in my note here.

330
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:57.050
Some,
uh,
it,
uh,
resides a,
does not refer to reality,
but to a dream.

331
00:24:57.051 --> 00:25:00.740
That's what it is.
It does not refer to reality,
but to a dream.

332
00:25:00.741 --> 00:25:01.880
And he says of his own writing,

333
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:07.090
I had tried to convey something of what it felt like to be a negro and no one

334
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:10.900
had been able to listen.
They wanted their romance.
Well,

335
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.160
I think that's a pretty clear,

336
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.760
clear eyed view and a clear indictment of what Carol is doing through the

337
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:20.690
character of sal.

338
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.160
Sal in this moment becomes so naive,

339
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.520
naive of history of actual lived history of his own country.

340
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.820
But as you've seen,

341
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:36.440
the mythic quality of America has pushed all of that aside.

342
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.530
So there's not just the comfy cabins that we don't see.

343
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.880
It's the whole history of slavery.
And he goes,

344
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.170
when he goes picking in the cotton fields,

345
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.520
he imagines that he could be a slave.

346
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.450
And then he makes some comments about how well he could never pick cotton fast

347
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:59.630
enough.
He's just not able to do it as,
as black men are.

348
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.870
So it ma,

349
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.900
it's motivated by a huge blindness about the racial history of the United States

350
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:13.640
in any of its detail.
That sense of the oneness,

351
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.700
I think points to why and how he makes that illusion,

352
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.090
the oneness.
He felt that it was all one.

353
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.920
The oneness is elevated from this sense of appropriation to a mystical level.

354
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.470
So that oneness looks something like the Buddhism that Kerouac studied for a

355
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:40.634
time.

356
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.630
It looks like something than the effort for sal just to be something exotic.

357
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.140
It looks like by entering into that oneness,

358
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:57.141
by adopting all these different identities that sal participates into some

359
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:03.000
larger mystical body,
but what is that logical,

360
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.650
larger mystical body?

361
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.650
We've been given one candidate that it's America,
that it's somehow America.

362
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.920
And I want you to keep this in mind and make a note to yourself.

363
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:18.360
Think about this vision of an American mystical oneness.

364
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:23.100
When you go to read cry of lot 49 cause you're going to see something quite

365
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:24.000
similar there.

366
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.300
There's actually a wonderful episode and on the road that is nearly a carbon

367
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:35.331
copy of what you'll see later in crying of lot 49 where Dean looks down on Salt

368
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.730
Lake City at night and he looks at the pattern of the lights down below him at a

369
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:44.610
pub,
Moss in crying of lot 49,
we'll sit up,
uh,

370
00:27:44.611 --> 00:27:49.611
on on a bluff overlooking San Narcisso and she'll look down at the pattern of

371
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:53.760
lights and she'll,
it's,

372
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.870
it's an important moment in that novel moment of,
of religious revelation.

373
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.070
But what's being revealed remains in pension,

374
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.270
quite difficult to pin down here.
It's,
it's equally vague.

375
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.450
So on five,
back to that question,

376
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:15.750
what can motivate this kind of effort?

377
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.350
On page one 81 he says,

378
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:21.320
<v 1>yeah,</v>

379
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.880
<v 0>there was excitement in the air,</v>

380
00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:27.590
was filled with the vibration of really joyous life that knows nothing of

381
00:28:27.591 --> 00:28:32.120
disappointment and white sorrows and all that.

382
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.960
The Old Negro man had a can of beer in his coat pocket,

383
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.300
which he proceeded to open in the old white man enviously I'd the can and groped

384
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.300
in his pocket to see if he could buy a Cantu.
How I died.

385
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.010
I walked away from there.
And then this wonderful transition,

386
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.550
I went to see a rich girl.
I knew in the morning,

387
00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:55.370
she pulled a hundred dollar bill out of her silk stocking and said,

388
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.490
you've been talking of a trip to Frisco.
That being the case,

389
00:28:58.491 --> 00:29:03.380
take this and go have your fun.
So all my problems were solved.
Um,

390
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.850
Sao needs the rich girl

391
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.330
to keep his vision fueled,

392
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.670
but the white sorrows are part of what it pays for.

393
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

394
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.520
<v 0>The rich girl provides him with in a way with these white sorrows,</v>

395
00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:30.330
she funds them.
You can have white sorrows,

396
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.770
whatever those really are.
You can have white sorrows.

397
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.150
If you have the hundred dollar bill to send you off on one of these odysseys,

398
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.970
you're not pinned down to a place working for a living.

399
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.140
<v 1>Yep.</v>

400
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.510
<v 0>I'm not going to talk about,
um,</v>

401
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.180
about jazz and the way it figures,

402
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.390
but I hope that you will have a chance to talk about that in section because

403
00:29:55.391 --> 00:29:57.530
that brings together,
um,

404
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.370
several elements of what's important in the novel.
Um,

405
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.420
I want to focus now on the sadness.

406
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.040
I don't know if you noticed how often that adjective appears in the novel.

407
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:13.420
Did any of you notice that?
Sadness,
sadness,
sad night.

408
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.270
One of the saddest things after Dean and sal get into their own leave fight

409
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.710
really is the uneaten food on Dean's plate.

410
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.990
The sadness of the uneaten food.

411
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:32.460
What sad in this novel I think is the way the specificity of persons push back

412
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:40.321
against that general collapse into mystical communing with one another.

413
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.610
What sad.
Dean's wife,

414
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.420
Camille and their baby,
it's sad.

415
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.040
He abandons them and she's left with them.

416
00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:00.090
All the women in Dean's life call him to the carpet and tell him of all his

417
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:05.260
sins.
That's a sad moment in the novel.

418
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:09.550
A moment of difficulty.
A moment of specificity.
Also,

419
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.400
what else is sad?

420
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.790
It's sad when Dean leave Sao feverish in Mexico,

421
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.600
he's off.

422
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.370
He has his girls to chase his wife to go back to,

423
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.830
to divorce,
whichever one is which.

424
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.350
He has all these machinations to attend to.

425
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.460
The friendship between the two in the end doesn't seem to mean very much,

426
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.000
or at least in that moment,
it doesn't seem to mean very much

427
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.083
<v 1>if</v>

428
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.740
<v 0>George [inaudible] is right,
that this is a love story.</v>

429
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.270
It's the love story between sal and dean.
And I hope as you were reading,

430
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.810
you notice that chapter opening where once again,

431
00:31:59.811 --> 00:32:04.070
dean appears at the door when sal shows up and he's totally naked.

432
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.410
Hope you noticed that it's the third time that we see that.

433
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:14.860
So there's an eroticism between them and there is this heartbreaking love that

434
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:16.760
sal has for dean.

435
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.960
And if you track that through the major turning points in the second two thirds

436
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:28.901
of the novel are moments when sal makes it clear to dean that he actually cares

437
00:32:32.151 --> 00:32:36.800
about him.
And I can point you to some of these pages.

438
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.050
Um,
this is on one 89.

439
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.450
I'm not going to do them all because there's something else I want to show you

440
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:42.284
today.

441
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.273
<v 1>Okay?</v>

442
00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.870
<v 0>This is,
um,
after,</v>

443
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.780
after Dean has been sort of called to the carpet.
Uh,

444
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.960
and he says,
um,
the song,
the thumb,
this is on one 88,

445
00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:01.540
the thumb became the symbol of Dean's final development.

446
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.810
He no longer cared about anything as before,

447
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.220
but now he also cared about everything in principle.

448
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.720
That's such a great encapsulation of not caring about any specific thing,

449
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.210
but still being incredibly invested.

450
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.700
But this is mirrored by sounds very specific investment in Dean.

451
00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:24.670
And this is on the bottom of the facing page on one 89

452
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.130
resolutely and firmly,
I repeated what I said,
come to New York with me.

453
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.990
I've got the money.
I looked at him,

454
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.200
my eyes were watering with embarrassment and tears still.

455
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:42.050
He stared at me.
Now his eyes were blank.
And looking through me,

456
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.570
it was probably the pivotal point of our friendship when he realized I had

457
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:52.571
actually spent some hours thinking about him and his troubles and he was trying

458
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:58.031
to place that in his tremendously involved and tormented mental categories.

459
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.940
So he finally realizes that Sao actually has a specific love for him not caring

460
00:34:07.721 --> 00:34:12.460
about him somehow.
In principle,
which is the way of course that,
that um,

461
00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:13.510
dean cares.

462
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.880
So this is the sadness of the novel.

463
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.540
It's this unrequited love dean is never capable of loving sow in the same way

464
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.000
that sal loves dean.

465
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.870
And at the very end when sal has to leave Dean on the street,

466
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.580
I actually I love how this works.

467
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:43.650
He's in the back of a Cadillac.

468
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

469
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.780
<v 0>His friend Remy is taking him in the limousine to a concert,</v>

470
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.240
a Duke Ellington concert,
which is important by the way.
Um,

471
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.920
and I'll leave you to think about why that might be important.
Um,

472
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.830
Remy won't have dean in the car.

473
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:05.831
So the car drives on sow is with a new girlfriend,

474
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:10.250
Laura,
about whom to whom he's told all about dean,

475
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:17.120
Dean ragged and a moth eaten coat overcoat he bought specially for the freezing

476
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:20.150
temperatures of the east,
walked off alone in the last I saw of him,

477
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:24.230
he rounded the corner of seventh avenue eyes on the street ahead and bent to it

478
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.940
again.
Pour a little Laura,

479
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:30.920
my baby to whom I told everything about dean began almost to cry.

480
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:36.170
Oh,
we shouldn't let him go like this.
What will,
what will we do?
Old Deans gone.

481
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:37.800
I thought out loud.
I said,

482
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:42.630
he'll be all right and off he went to the sad and distinct and off we went to

483
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:46.230
the sad and disinclined concert for which I had no stomach,
whatever.

484
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.150
And all the time I was thinking of Dean and how he got back on the train and

485
00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:56.151
rode over 3000 miles over that awful land and never knew why he had come any way

486
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.580
except to see me
in that moment.

487
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.920
South supplies the answer for why Dean came,

488
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.260
never knew why he had come anyway.

489
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:14.410
And then south supplies except to see me and his own pain and tears are routed

490
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:17.024
through Laura.

491
00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:22.330
It's Laura who cries at deans abandonment while he maintains this,

492
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.910
uh,
this composure,
this masculine composure,

493
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.230
he'll be all right.

494
00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.090
But the sadness here is surely Sal's

495
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.723
<v 1>okay.</v>

496
00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:44.200
<v 0>By the end,
the language of experience.
This is on three Oh four.</v>

497
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:49.590
The language of experience that dean represents is completely exhausted.

498
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.980
This is how dean talks at the very end.

499
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.853
<v 1>Okay?</v>

500
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.030
<v 0>He couldn't talk anymore.
He hopped and laughed.</v>

501
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:04.500
He stuttered and flooded his hands and said,
ah,
ah,
you must listen to hear.

502
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.840
We listened all ears.
But he forgot what he wanted to say.
Really.

503
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:14.580
Listen,
look,
dear south,
suite lower,
I've come,
I've gone.
But wait.

504
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.720
Ah,
yes.
And he stared with rocky sorrow into his hands.

505
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:22.620
Can't talk no more.
Do you understand that it is or might be.

506
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.890
But listen,
we all listened.

507
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.330
He was listening to sounds in the night.
Yes,
he whispered with all,

508
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.770
but you see no need to talk anymore.
And further

509
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:41.250
Dean's language has gone from this sort of quasi academic jibberish of the

510
00:37:41.251 --> 00:37:44.850
beginning of the novel to this completely fragmented,

511
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.030
broken version of the yeses and Aahs and wows of those early ecstatic days.

512
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:58.010
So Sal's language by the end has absorbed some of this and yet gone on to honor

513
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.480
a kind of coherence that dean cannot inhabit anymore.

514
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.760
Or maybe the d never inhabited.

515
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:10.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

516
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.110
<v 0>So the last sentence of the book,</v>

517
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:21.200
um,
which I want to read to you.
I think I have time just because it's,

518
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.150
this is the language that sal comes out of it with or that Kerouac comes out

519
00:38:26.151 --> 00:38:31.151
with as the payoff for opening language in the ways that Dean's language of

520
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:33.650
immediacy represents.

521
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.940
So this is one sentence,
page three Oh seven the last paragraph.

522
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.010
So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old broken down river pier

523
00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:51.680
watching the long,
long skies over New Jersey,

524
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.010
and since all that raw land that rolls in,

525
00:38:55.011 --> 00:39:00.011
one unbelievable huge bulge over the west coast and all that road going,

526
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.550
all the people dreaming in the immensity of it.
And in Iowa,

527
00:39:04.551 --> 00:39:08.600
I know by now the children must be crying in the land where they let the

528
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:09.590
children cry.

529
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:14.830
And tonight the stars will be out and don't you know that God is Poo bear.

530
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.930
The evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

531
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.220
which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth,

532
00:39:25.221 --> 00:39:30.200
darkens all rivers,
cups the peaks and folds the final shore in.

533
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.220
And nobody,

534
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:36.370
nobody knows what is going to happen to anybody besides the four Lauren rags of

535
00:39:37.071 --> 00:39:40.610
growing old.
I think of Dean Moriarty.

536
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:45.290
I even think of old Dean Moriarty,
the father we never found,

537
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.140
I think of Dean Moriarty.

538
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.880
So he's co he's blasted open the syntax of that sentence piled clause upon

539
00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:01.170
clause upon clause phrase on phrase

540
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:07.170
to include that whole road in the one sentence.

541
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:13.070
So if the dream of cure wax language is to pour experience into language and

542
00:40:14.371 --> 00:40:15.810
make language immediate,

543
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:22.370
this sentence is a very fine example of the payoff.

544
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.570
There's a kind of goofiness at the center of it.
God is Poo bear.

545
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:35.530
What does that mean?
God is just a toy.

546
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.110
God is a children's story.

547
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.820
But then there's that lyrical elegiac always sad sense of longing and the excess

548
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:51.190
of the end.
Dean Moriarty,
Dean Moriarty's,

549
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:55.000
father,
Dean Moriarty.
You can't just say it once.

550
00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.240
You have to try to fill that void by saying it two times and by invoking his

551
00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:02.800
father a third time.

552
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.820
So the excess and the longing are,

553
00:41:06.821 --> 00:41:10.750
they're each trying to drive or satisfy the other.

554
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.530
Now if we had any doubts that on the road is mythic in itself.

555
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.410
I just want to show you quickly two things.

556
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.320
In 2007 on the road had its 50th anniversary of publication.

557
00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:30.940
It was written in 1951 and it was published in 1957 by Viking.

558
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.630
So,
uh,
last year we were treated to these two,

559
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.940
uh,
these two books.

560
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.600
One thing that fascinates me about them is that they are examples of how

561
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:50.321
publishing houses rely on known names for making money.

562
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.560
So Viking owns,
uh,
the,

563
00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.360
it has has on the road in their back list so they can make new copies of this.

564
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.060
The pagination of this is exactly the same.
All they did was bind.
They,

565
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:09.770
they made a retro cover and they bound the original book review from the New

566
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:10.880
York Times into the front.

567
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.270
They just printed that in and then they just reproduce the text again.

568
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.320
So it becomes a sort of keepsake book.
Um,

569
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.290
I'm not sure that a lot of people are going to read this book,

570
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.590
but a lot of people might buy it as a keepsake.

571
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.610
This is the original scroll version.

572
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.950
This is like the Sop to scholars.

573
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.820
This is for the scholarly buyer is for people like me or not like me.
Um,

574
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:36.830
this is the,

575
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.510
the original typescript put into pages.

576
00:42:41.511 --> 00:42:43.940
But as I think I mentioned in my first lecture,

577
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.420
Kerouac wrote the manuscript for on the road on one long hundred and 20 foot

578
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:55.400
roll of paper.
He's stuck in the typewriter,
no paragraphs,

579
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.230
no nothing.
He just went.

580
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.940
So this book reproduces that just breaking it as the pages demand instead of

581
00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.000
actually giving us a scroll,
which would be pretty cool.

582
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.130
But what else they do is they lard it with scholarly articles.
There are,

583
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.230
let's see,
uh,

584
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.230
three scholarly articles and then there's a note on the editing of the text and

585
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:25.970
there's suggestions for further reading.
It makes it into a real literary object,

586
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.190
sort of like a modernist texts.

587
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.330
And what I love here is that apparently the very,

588
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.550
very beginning of the scroll,
um,

589
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.400
cure plaque made a typo

590
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.400
and the editor says,

591
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.040
I read it,
I let the Typo stand here.

592
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.150
Does the editor Howard canal,

593
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.890
because it's so beautifully suggest the sound of a car misfiring before starting

594
00:43:54.891 --> 00:43:59.840
up for a long journey.
I have left uncorrected the manuscripts opening line,

595
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.470
which is
I met,

596
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.830
met Neal not long before my father died.

597
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.980
There's the fantasy that the writing approximates the actual car trip met met.

598
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.020
Oh,
it sounds like a car starting.
I'm going to leave that in there.

599
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.920
So the editors just by completely by

600
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.600
the techs own mythology and produce all this apparatus around it to help us,

601
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.600
uh,
help us believe it too.

602
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.420
Now the last thing I want to show you is on a less skeptical note.

603
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

604
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.280
<v 0>If you ever doubt</v>

605
00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:46.080
that the legend and the dream of on the road is alive and is powerful in art,

606
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.090
literary art and visual art today,

607
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.940
all you need to do is look at um,

608
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:56.623
<v 1>okay.</v>

609
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.310
<v 0>A very recent,</v>

610
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.390
<v 1>yeah.</v>

611
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.220
<v 0>Work of digital art.</v>

612
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:02.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

613
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.970
<v 0>This is young.
Hey Chang,
heavy industries,</v>

614
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
which is a collaboration of an American man and a Korean woman who create online

615
00:45:11.401 --> 00:45:16.401
digital artworks and this is one of them from 2002 called Dakota.

616
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.000
And I think you will see immediately,
um,

617
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.760
how and why it is related to on the road.

618
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:28.761
It's also related to Ezra pound's Cantos but I'm not going to burden you with

619
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:31.230
that right now.
What I want you to do is just think about this.

620
00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:34.740
It runs about six minutes.
Um,
so I'm going to let that go now.

621
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.770
All right?
Okay.

622
00:45:38.771 --> 00:45:42.130
So if you ever doubted that the dream of,

623
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.280
of an immediate language that is somehow the correlate to jazz and experience,

624
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.830
that's,
that's your dream living on.
Okay.
