What job that does not exist today do you think will be one of the world's "top 10" jobs in 10 years?

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:08.486
Well, right now, the thing that scientists

00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:12.287
and I think a lot of businesses also need

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.816
that's really hard to find

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:16.849
is somebody who is sophisticated about data

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.444
and knows how to manage

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:20.890
large quantities of information

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.255
and distill out something that's important

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:27.521
and actionable from all those details.

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:30.703
So, I think that's going to be a very important skill.
