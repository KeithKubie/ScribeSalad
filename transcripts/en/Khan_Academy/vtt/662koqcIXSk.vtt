00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:02.223
- [Voiceover] We've been giving a lot of attention to our

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:05.961
old friend glucose, the monosaccharide glucose

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:09.526
that is the building block of things like glycogen

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:11.824
and starch and chitin,

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:14.146
and what I want to do in this video is give a little

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.525
attention to another fairly prominent monosaccharide,

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.114
and that is fructose.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:23.678
That is fructose, often known as fruit sugar,

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.756
and on its own, as a monosaccharide,

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:29.727
it is actually the sweetest of all the sugars, fructose,

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.573
and so let's compare the two.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.187
So the first thing that might jump out at you,

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:34.487
and I encourage you to do this actually.

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.123
These two molecules, these would be helpful ones

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.584
to actually just be able to draw on your own because

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:41.987
you will see these many, many, many times

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:44.681
in your biological and in your chemistry and your

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.061
organic chemistry careers,

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.882
but if we just compare these two, we see that they both

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.761
have six carbons, so for both of them,

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.491
the chemical formula, you would have

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.520
six carbons and then you see that they both have,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.852
they both have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.825
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:05.927
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:07.912
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:10.919
They both have 12 hydrogens,

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:14.356
and to round it all out, they both have six oxygens,

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.295
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.826
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:22.692
So they both have six oxygens.

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:25.919
So they are, they have the same chemical formula

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.834
but they are different molecules, so that makes them

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.550
isomers, and as we will see, they are structural isomers,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.187
the different constituents, these,

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:36.055
the constituent carbons, hydrogens and oxygens

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:37.576
are bonded in a different way,

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:39.352
which makes them structural isomers,

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:41.384
and when you inspect it a little bit, there's a,

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:44.054
there's one main thing that jumps out at you.

00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.225
On the glucose molecule, when it's in its

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:47.525
straight chain form,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:48.686
we're gonna think about it,

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:51.322
think about them both in their cyclical forms in a second,

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:54.526
but when they're in the straight chain form,

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:57.185
the glucose molecule has a carbonyl group

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.517
at the number one carbon, if we start numbering up here.

00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:04.917
So if we start numbering one, two, three, four,

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.818
five, six, the glucose straight chain has a carbonyl group

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:12.127
at its one carbon while the fructose molecule

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.159
has a carbonyl group, let's see,

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.060
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.952
at the number two carbon.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.158
Remember, carbonyl group is just a carbon double bonded

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.850
to an oxygen, so it has a carbonyl group bonded at its

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.417
number two oxygen,

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:29.252
and that's the main structural difference,

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:31.852
even if you look at the way that I've drawn these,

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:34.811
a hydroxyl group, you have three hydroxyl groups on,

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.951
on the right side,

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:37.855
then you have one on the left, three on the right,

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:38.923
one on the left,

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:43.126
and so the main difference is just what we did over here.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.726
And just to get a little bit more experience with our,

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.420
with our names for our different functional groups,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.626
when we studied glucose we knew that, look, if you have

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:53.284
a carbonyl group that's at the end of a carbon chain,

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:55.688
so, this carbon in the carbonyl group is bonded

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:59.728
to a hydrogen and then the rest of the carbon chain,

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:01.957
you would call this, right over here,

00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:04.616
you would call this an aldehyde functional group.

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:08.209
Aldehyde, aldehyde functional group and it makes,

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.283
it makes the entire molecule,

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.918
it allows it to be categorized as an aldehyde.

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:15.199
Over here, where the carbon in the carbonyl group isn't

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.723
at the end of the chain, it's in the middle of the chain,

00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:19.755
or its in the midst of the chain, so to speak,

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.589
it's not exactly in the middle, but it's,

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.842
this carbon is bonded to two different carbons.

00:03:23.842 --> 00:03:25.781
We call this molecule a ketone,

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.452
and this would be a ketone functional group

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:28.579
because it's bonded,

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.922
it's bonded to two carbons, so this fructose,

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:33.919
fructose, would be,

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.984
fructose would be considered a ketone,

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.784
and now let's think about how it might form

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:42.128
a cyclical form, and as we've talked about before,

00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:44.345
the straight chain and the cyclical form, they can be

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:47.120
in equilibrium if they are in an aqueous solution.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.954
And what I'm drawing here, these aren't the only

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.323
forms that glucose takes on, but if you were to look it up

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:52.925
in a text book or on the internet,

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:55.293
you will most typically, this is what is most prevalent

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:57.046
in nature as well when you're talking about the cyclical

00:03:57.046 --> 00:04:00.494
forms, find glucose in a six,

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:02.921
in a six-member ring right over here,

00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.022
where five of them are carbons and then you have

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:06.125
an oxygen,

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.817
while fructose is most typical in a five-member ring,

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.406
where four of them are carbons and then one of them

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:13.521
is oxygen.

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:15.750
Glucose can form a six-member ring,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.957
when you have a six-member ring,

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.684
when you have a carbohydrate that involves a six-member

00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:22.809
ring where one of the items is an oxygen like this,

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.549
you call this a pyranose.

00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:28.951
Pyranose, so that's a carbohydrate ring where it has

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:31.180
six members, one of which is oxygen,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.259
and when you have five members,

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.860
one of which is oxygen, this is called a furanose.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.554
Furanose ring.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:41.350
And actually, fructose can be found in either a furanose

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.322
form or a pyranose form, but the furanose form

00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:46.424
is the one that's most typical and when people think

00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:49.419
of fructose as a ring, they most typically think of it

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.812
in this form.

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.054
Well how does this form,

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:53.947
how does this form form?

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:57.047
Especially in comparison to what's happening in glucose?

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.254
Well when we saw,

00:04:58.254 --> 00:04:59.984
what we saw in glucose,

00:04:59.984 --> 00:05:02.387
in both cases, what you're going to do is have an attack

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:05.150
on the carbon that's part of the carbonyl group,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.925
so, over here, that is the number one carbon.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.794
This is the number one carbon here,

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:12.186
and over here, this is the number two carbon.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.288
This is the number two carbon.

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:16.981
The number two carbon, right over there,

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.489
and in both cases, you have,

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.091
if you want to form these forms,

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:22.693
over here we have the,

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:25.341
we had the oxygen that's in,

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.558
the oxygen in the hydroxyl group attached to

00:05:27.558 --> 00:05:28.974
the number five carbon.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.658
The oxygen in the hydroxyl group attached to

00:05:30.658 --> 00:05:31.981
the number five carbon.

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.451
This is the one, two, three, four, five carbon.

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.959
This oxygen is what does,

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:40.851
is what forms the bond,

00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:44.148
is what forms this bond up here when you were talking

00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:46.447
about glucose, and over here,

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:49.559
on fructose, once again, we look at the number five,

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.203
the oxygen on the hydroxyl group on the number five

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.841
carbon, so we look at this hydroxyl group right over here,

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.826
that's this hydroxyl group right over here,

00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:58.487
and this oxygen,

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:00.623
this oxygen does,

00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:01.993
forms a bond,

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:04.582
forms a bond with the carbon in the carbonyl group,

00:06:04.582 --> 00:06:07.775
and when that happens, that allows one of these,

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:10.747
that allows one of these bonds in these double bonds

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:11.989
or one of the two double bonds

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:15.187
to instead be released from the carbon and then essentially

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:16.726
form a bond,

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.385
form a bond with a proton floating around.

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.125
That proton is actually likely to be involved

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:24.481
in a hydronium molecule.

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:26.293
And the same thing would've happened in glucose

00:06:26.293 --> 00:06:27.256
right over here.

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:30.286
This, one of the two double bonds could now be used

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:32.086
to form a bond,

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:35.488
to form a bond with a hydrogen proton,

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:38.019
and so it's essentially the same mechanism.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.223
The reason why this is a five-member ring involving four

00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:44.474
carbons versus a six-member ring involving five carbons,

00:06:44.474 --> 00:06:46.854
is just the carbonyl group is on a,

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:50.395
is kind of one further down the chain than it is

00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:54.036
in the glucose, and so that's why this forms this,

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:57.187
this pentagonal shape right over here,

00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:58.684
and we've talked about it in other videos.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.405
Fructose will, I've already talked about it in this video,

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.619
fructose is the sweetest of all of the monosaccharides,

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.719
the sweetest sugar, and when we talk about table sugar,

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.760
the sugar that you might put into your tea or your coffee,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.489
that table sugar, that's called sucrose.

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:15.287
Sucrose, sucrose,

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:20.221
and it's a disaccharide made up of glucose and fructose,

00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:23.054
and the way that you form the bond, it's still happening

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:26.885
through our dehydration synthesis,

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.719
where you have the,

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.554
where you would have the oxygen

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:33.491
on the number one carbon in glucose,

00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:34.594
this one over here,

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:37.218
let me do this in a color that I have not used yet.

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:40.155
See I've used almost every color, so this is difficult.

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.222
But I will, well I'll just use this green.

00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:45.519
This oxygen, essentially, can form a bond,

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.422
can form a bond with the,

00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:52.787
with the number two carbon on the fructose,

00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:56.189
and when it forms that bond, then this guy,

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:58.058
this bond right over here, can be,

00:07:58.058 --> 00:08:00.461
let me do that in a different color,

00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:03.155
this bond can be then,

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:06.127
it can then go back to the oxygen or if you really want

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.857
to think about it in another way,

00:08:07.857 --> 00:08:10.225
it can then be used to form a bond,

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:14.474
it can be used to form a bond with some hydrogen proton

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:16.251
floating around, so essentially,

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.851
it's gonna be a carbon bonded to an oxygen

00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.311
which is then going to be bonded to another,

00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.587
which is then going to be bonded to another carbon,

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.328
and then someone else can, you know,

00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:29.022
some other water molecule

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:32.052
might be able to sop up this hydrogen proton right over here

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:33.294
and then you would have,

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:34.827
you would have your bond,

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:36.452
that type of bonds that we're familiar with,

00:08:36.452 --> 00:08:39.552
these glycosidic linkages that we have when we have

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:42.420
dehydration synthesis, these linkages that are really

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.287
the basis for how we start with monosaccharides

00:08:45.287 --> 00:08:47.052
and we, and we create,

00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.119
and we create disaccharides, and if we keep going,

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:52.868
we could create polysaccharides, so sucrose,

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:55.318
sucrose is, one way to think about it,

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:56.619
if I have my,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.894
if I have my glucose up here,

00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.425
if my glucose,

00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:03.155
actually let me just draw it this way,

00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:05.291
so you have a glucose,

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:06.255
whoops,

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:09.123
you have your glucose,

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.350
glucose forms,

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.218
forms a glycosidic bond

00:09:15.218 --> 00:09:17.250
with your fructose,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.194
with your fructose,

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.984
with your fructose right over here

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:25.260
and that's what sucrose is,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.791
and to really visualize it properly, you kind of have to

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.880
flip this fructose over and then move it up here

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.808
and then they could,

00:09:31.808 --> 00:09:32.528
they could,

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:35.524
this character can then form a bond with this carbon

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:37.434
right over there.
