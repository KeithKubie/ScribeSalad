00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.840
We embarked upon the "Cocoa supplement

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.680
and multivitamin outcome study" otherwise

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.750
known as COSMOS to evaluate whether

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.030
taking a supplement daily that has

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.980
cocoa flavanols in it over the course

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.900
of four years of treatment and follow-up

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.060
would reduce the risk of major

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.460
cardiovascular events over time.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.980
Well the cocoa flavonols are not the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.699
same thing as chocolate. Chocolate is a

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.449
wonderful treat but it's not a reliable

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.109
source of cocoa flavanols so there are

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.170
cocoa flavanol products available that don't

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.989
have the sugar, the fat, or the calories

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.879
and these are the products that have

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.420
been tested in many of the recent

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.549
small-scale randomized trials

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:52.479
suggesting benefits for reducing risk of

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.269
heart disease and stroke and also

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.269
avoiding memory loss. One of the

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.219
advantages of the COSMOS trial is the

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.989
amount of cocoa flavanols that we're

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.030
testing, which is about 600 milligrams

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.670
per day, would not be easily translatable

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.200
into something that you can get through

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.120
diet alone and in fact the amount of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.770
cocoa flavanols that we're testing in

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.530
the COSMOS trial would result in such

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.200
high chocolate intake you'd be eating too

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.360
much chocolate and other forms of cocoa

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.370
products to try and get that equivalent

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.050
amount of cocoa flavanols which we

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.390
believe the bioactive component of the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.940
cocoa bean, the cocoa powder that matters

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.440
the most in terms of vascular health.
