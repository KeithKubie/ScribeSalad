a series of chemical reaction at the

a series of chemical reaction at the
 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.780
a series of chemical reaction at the
level of the synapse and and this series

level of the synapse and and this series
 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:26.140
level of the synapse and and this series
of reaction leads to changes in the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150
of reaction leads to changes in the
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.210
of reaction leads to changes in the

include both the the SA changes in the

synapses such that this is a receptor
 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.500
synapses such that this is a receptor
respond in a different way

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510
respond in a different way
 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.150
respond in a different way
and change in the release of

and change in the release of
 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.139
and change in the release of
neurotransmitter of the synapses and

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149
neurotransmitter of the synapses and
 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.319
neurotransmitter of the synapses and
eventually changes in the the level the

eventually changes in the the level the
 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.750
eventually changes in the the level the
morphology of the synapse such that

morphology of the synapse such that
 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.109

their synaptic response becomes much

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119
their synaptic response becomes much
 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.150
their synaptic response becomes much
much stronger and even an addition to

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160
much stronger and even an addition to
 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.010

that for this memory to last long there
 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.080
that for this memory to last long there
have to be changes in the at the level

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090
have to be changes in the at the level
 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.030
have to be changes in the at the level
of the genes that

that a part of our DNA and that are long
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.540
that a part of our DNA and that are long
lasting so there are genetic changes

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550
lasting so there are genetic changes

like you know so if you associate

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
like you know so if you associate
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.259
like you know so if you associate
something with a particular old or I

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269
something with a particular old or I

make sure an example and then that odor

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189
make sure an example and then that odor
 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.839
make sure an example and then that odor
comes then the memory comes up just

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849
comes then the memory comes up just
 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.020
comes then the memory comes up just
those are tricks also to remember

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.540
well I mean obviously I bet that smell

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550
well I mean obviously I bet that smell
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.550
well I mean obviously I bet that smell
is much more important for a dog named

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
is much more important for a dog named
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.190
is much more important for a dog named
from humans although there are humans

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
from humans although there are humans
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.120
from humans although there are humans
who exercise their sense of smell and a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
who exercise their sense of smell and a
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.010

further probably much better than I am

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020
further probably much better than I am
 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.870
further probably much better than I am
to remember using smell

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880
to remember using smell
 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.449
to remember using smell
I mean there is differences different

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459
I mean there is differences different
 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.699
I mean there is differences different
between senses a way of learning

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709
between senses a way of learning
 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.390
between senses a way of learning
according to the people and we're not

the same it's like a door that same

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930
the same it's like a door that same
 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.560
the same it's like a door that same
people is more open one door than

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570
people is more open one door than
 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.650
people is more open one door than
another so or so they use in one

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660
another so or so they use in one
 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.570
another so or so they use in one
particular way more than others so there

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580
particular way more than others so there
 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.510
particular way more than others so there
are differences but if we accept to the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520
are differences but if we accept to the
 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.840
are differences but if we accept to the
way in which the memory gets in the

way in which the memory gets in the
 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.900
way in which the memory gets in the
chemical process that once these things

get away they are very very similar

get away they are very very similar
inside the brain they are very very

inside the brain they are very very
 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.600
inside the brain they are very very
similar for a different call input of

similar for a different call input of
 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.729
similar for a different call input of
memory coming from different way through

memory coming from different way through
 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.500
memory coming from different way through
different mechanism they're very similar

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510
different mechanism they're very similar
 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.190
different mechanism they're very similar
in humans and they are very similar in

in humans and they are very similar in
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.160
