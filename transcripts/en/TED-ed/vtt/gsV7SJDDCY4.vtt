00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:11.685
In 1895, a physicist named 
Wilhelm Roentgen

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:14.850
was doing experiments
with a cathode tube,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.124
a glass container in which a beam of
electrons lights up a fluorescent window.

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.472
He had wrapped cardboard around the tube

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:24.914
to keep the fluorescent 
light from escaping,

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:27.541
when something peculiar happened.

00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:32.426
Another screen outside the tube
was glowing.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:36.634
In other words, invisible rays
had passed through the cardboard.

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:41.962
Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were,
so he called them X-rays,

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:46.711
and his discovery eventually won him
a Nobel Prize.

00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.130
Here's what we now know was happening.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.982
When high energy electrons
in the cathode tube

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:54.132
hit a metal component,

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.737
they either got slowed down
and released extra energy,

00:00:57.737 --> 00:01:01.780
or kicked off electrons
from the atoms they hit,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.436
which triggered a reshuffling
that again released energy.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:11.377
In both cases, the energy was emitted
in the form of X-rays,

00:01:11.377 --> 00:01:13.854
which is a type 
of electromagnetic radiation

00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:19.348
with higher energy than visible light,
and lower energy than Gamma rays.

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.300
X-rays are powerful enough
to fly through many kinds of matter

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.351
as if they are semi-transparent,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.915
and they're particularly useful 
for medical applications

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:33.507
because they can make images of organs,
like bones, without harming them,

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:35.363
although they do have a small chance

00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:37.813
of causing mutations 
in reproductive organs,

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:39.900
and tissues like the thyroid,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.404
which is why lead aprons are often
used to block them.

00:01:43.404 --> 00:01:47.800
When X-rays interact with matter,
they collide with electrons.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.492
Sometimes, the X-ray transfers all of its
energy to the matter and gets absorbed.

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:55.775
Other times, it only transfers 
some of its energy,

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:57.718
and the rest is scattered.

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.598
The frequency of these outcomes

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:03.832
depends on how many electrons
the X-rays are likely to hit.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.010
Collisions are more likely 
if a material is dense,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.163
or if it's made of elements
with higher atomic numbers,

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.244
which means more electrons.

00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:17.454
Bones are dense and full of calcium,
which has a relatively high atomic number,

00:02:17.454 --> 00:02:19.952
so they absorb X-rays pretty well.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:23.488
Soft tissue, on the other hand,
isn't as dense,

00:02:23.488 --> 00:02:26.700
and contains mostly lower 
atomic number elements,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.423
like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:35.074
So more of the X-rays penetrate tissues
like lungs and muscles,

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:37.226
darkening the film.

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:40.892
These 2-D pictures are only useful
up to a point, though.

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:43.006
When X-rays travel through the body,

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:46.196
they can interact with many atoms 
along the path.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:50.843
What is recorded on the film reflects
the sum of all those interactions.

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:56.756
It's like trying to print 100 pages
of a novel on a single sheet of paper.

00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:58.684
To see what's really going on,

00:02:58.684 --> 00:03:02.865
you would have to take X-ray views
from many angles around the body

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:06.165
and use them to construct
an internal image.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.442
And that's something 
doctors do all the time

00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:13.579
in a procedure called a CT,
Computed Tomography scan,

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.288
another Nobel Prize winning invention.

00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:18.438
Think of CT like this.

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:20.073
With just one X-ray,

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:25.187
you might be able to see the density
change due to a solid tumor in a patient,

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:28.560
but you wouldn't know how deep
it is beneath the surface.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.766
However, if you take X-rays
from multiple angles,

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:35.687
you should be able to find
the tumor's position and shape.

00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:41.245
A CT scanner works by sending
a fan or cone of X-rays through a patient

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:43.775
to an array of detectors.

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:46.960
The X-ray beam is rotated 
around the patient,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.854
and often also moved down 
the patient's body,

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:53.607
with the X-ray source tracing
a spiral trajectory.

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:58.065
Spiral CT scans produce data
that can be processed into cross sections

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:01.921
detailed enough to spot 
anatomical features, tumors,

00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:05.066
blood clots, and infections.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.600
CT scans can even detect 
heart disease and cavities

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.640
in mummies buried thousands of years ago.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.141
So what began as Roentgen's happy accident
has become a medical marvel.

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:23.900
Hospitals and clinics now conduct over
100 millions scans each year worldwide

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.711
to treat diseases and save lives.
