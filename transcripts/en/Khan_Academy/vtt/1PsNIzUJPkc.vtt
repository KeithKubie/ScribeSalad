00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's say I have some linear
transformation

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.870
T from R2 to R2.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.700
So that is R2, and
then this is R2.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.770
T just maps from any member of
R2 to another member of R2,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.020
just like that.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.240
And I'm going to define T.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.400
It's a linear transformation.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.980
I'm going to define it.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.110
When I take the transformation
of some member of R2, it's

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.820
equivalent to multiplying it by
this matrix, by the matrix

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.560
1 minus 3, minus 1, 3.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.610
So just to kind of understand
this transformation a little

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.790
bit more, let's think about all
of the values that it can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.360
take on in our codomain.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.720
So if we say that 1 minus 3,
minus 1, 3, times any vector

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.390
in our domain-- so x1, x2-- it's
going to be equal to some

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.580
other vector in our codomain.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.860
Let me call that vector b.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.795
B is a member of R2.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.360
So it's going to be
equal to b1, b2.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.250
All I'm doing here is I'm
essentially-- if I call this

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.200
right here, I call that matrix
A-- I'm just trying to find

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.080
out what are all the possible
values for Ax is equal to b?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.980
I'm trying to find out all of
the possible b's in this case.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.330
So if I were to solve this
equation for any particular b,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.810
what I would do is I
would put this in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600
reduced row echelon form.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.290
Well, first I would make an
augmented matrix of it.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.700
So I would put a 1, a minus
3, a minus 1, and a 3.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.250
And I would augment it with
the member of our codomain

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.320
we're trying to be equal to.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.720
So b1, b2.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.140
And then, I would put it in
reduced row echelon form.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.670
So how can we do that?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.800
How can we put it in reduced
row echelon form?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.420
I'll keep my first
row the same.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.630
1 minus 3, and then b1.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.350
And then my second row, I'll
replace it with my second row

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.820
plus my first row.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.730
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.440
3 plus minus 3 is 0.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.259
And then b2 plus b1 is--
well I can just write

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.170
that as b1 plus b2.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.080
So this is only going
to have solutions.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.560
I have an interesting
situation here.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.540
You've seen it before.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.790
I have a row of 0's.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.140
And the only way that this
is going to actually have

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.160
solutions is if this thing right
here is also going to be

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.370
equal to 0.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:45.420
So the only members b that are
members of Rm that have

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.730
solutions are the ones where
if you add up their two

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.560
terms-- so let's say b is equal
to b1 and b2-- are the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.080
ones where the two terms added
up have to be to 0.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.850
b1 plus b2 have to
be equal to 0.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.990
Or another way you could write
it is that b2 has to be equal

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.410
to minus b1.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
So if we were to actually draw
our codomain-- let's do it.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.650
We always stay in the abstract,
but sometimes it's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.640
useful to draw an
actual example.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.850
Let's say that our
codomain is R2.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.280
Let me draw some axes
right here.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.010
Let's say that this
is my b1-axis,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.830
and this is my b2-axis.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.380
I could have called that
x and y, but I

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.900
called that b1 and b2.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.820
What are all of the members
of my codomain that have a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.000
solution, that have a mapping?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.390
Well, b2 has to be equal
to minus b1.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.900
So it's going to
look like this.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.860
It's just going to be a line
with a slope of negative 1.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.650
This is all the b's that
have a solution.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.950
Because if you're not
on this line.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.110
If you're a member of your
codomain-- this is the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.040
codomain right here, R2.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.920
R2 is also our domain, but let
me make it very clear that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.850
this is the codomain
that I've drawn.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.890
This is what we're
mapping into.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.170
It's very clear that if we're
not on this line, if you pick

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.440
somebody whose two terms don't
add up to equalling 0, or

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.840
aren't the negative of each
other, if you pick someone

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.760
over here in our codomain, and
then you try to solve the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.780
equation over here, 0 is going
to equal some non-zero number

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.750
here and you're not going
to have a solution.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.930
And we touched on this
in the last video.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.250
And so in this case we could
say that this right here is

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.773
the image of our
transformation.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.320
Or even another way of
thinking about it.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.440
This is our codomain.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.690
Let me draw a domain.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.920
So if you take any member of
R2, and it's always mapping

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.820
onto something onto that line,
clearly each point on that

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.050
line is going to be mapped to
by more than one vector.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.840
So we're not dealing with
an onto transformation.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.420
We saw that in the last video.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.460
In order for something to be
onto, when you put it in

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.750
reduced row echelon form,
you cannot have all 0's

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.380
in one of the rows.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.800
Or another way to say it in
reduced row echelon form,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.820
every row has to have
a pivot entry.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.990
Well, let's focus
on the b's that

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.460
actually do have a solution.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.190
So let's focus on these b's,
so that when you take a b1

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.530
plus b2, it actually is going
to be equal to 0.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.790
So we could have the b, I don't
know, that could be the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.260
b5 minus 5.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.120
Obviously the b0, 0
is going to work.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.560
You could have 1, negative 1.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.820
Maybe that's right there.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.600
Let's focus on those for a
second and see how many

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.030
members of our domain
map into them.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.390
So if we take this right here
and then we apply this

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.960
equation up here, we only
have one constraint.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.650
We're assuming that this is
going to be equal to 0.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.340
So let's assume that
we're dealing with

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.050
the b's in our image.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.890
Let's assume that we're dealing
with something where

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.920
we can get a solution.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.890
That b1 plus b2 is equal to 0.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.210
Then what is our constraints?

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.090
What will map to our vector
b that we're dealing with?

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.710
If we just take this topic
equation right here, we have 1

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:53.000
times x1-- let me switch
colors-- minus 3 times x2 is

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.190
equal to b1.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.610
And then this row will give us
no constraints, because it's

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.900
just going to be
a bunch of 0's.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.240
So this is the only constraint
for a member of our domain

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.770
that will map to some particular
b now that we are

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.750
picking, some particular
b that satisfies this

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.560
constraint.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.820
So we could write this solution
set-- let me rewrite

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.110
it as x1 is equal
to b1, plus 3x2.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.890
Or if we wanted to write the
entire solution set, it would

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.280
look like this.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:39.960
x1, x2 is equal to the vector
b1, 0, plus-- x1 is b1, plus

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.440
3, times x2, so plus
x2 times 3.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.910
And x2 is just going
to be equal to x2.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.260
That's a free variable.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.910
So x2 is equal to 0
plus x2, times 1.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.820
So what we're saying here is
this transformation just maps

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.400
to this line here for all of the
vectors in our codomain,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.770
where their two entries
add up to each other.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.850
Let's assume that we actually
have one of those vectors.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.440
And so first of all, this is
definitely not an onto

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.160
transformation.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.710
But let's assume that
we are dealing with

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.580
one of those guys.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.660
So if we are picking a
particular one of those guys

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:23.540
for a particular b-- let me
write this down-- that has a

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:42.559
solution to Ax is equal to b,
the solution set will be equal

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.690
to this thing right here.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.100
It'll be equal to x1, x2
is equal to the first

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.200
entry of your b.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:57.020
b1, 0 plus x2, times
the vector 3,1.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.780
And if you think about this, if
you pick a particular b--

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.610
so let's say we pick our-- let
me draw this out, because I

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.450
think it's nice to
visualize it all.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.380
Actually, maybe I'll
draw it like this.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.250
I don't want to draw
our blobs anymore.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.250
So let me draw my axes.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.980
So my axes look like this.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.070
We know that the image of our
transformation is the line

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.710
with a negative 1 slope, because
the two entries have

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.510
to be equal to the negative
of each other.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.120
Let's pick a particular
b that has a solution.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.550
So let's say we pick
that b right there.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.710
In order for it to have a
solution, its entries have to

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.830
be the negative of each other.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:38.480
So let's say that's the
entry 5, minus 5.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.660
That is our b.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.245
So what we just showed is that
the solution set, if we want

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:47.060
to say, hey, what in our domain
maps to this guy?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.210
So let's think about what
in our domain maps

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.460
to this right here.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.780
Let's think about what in our
domain maps to this point

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.680
right here, to this
particular b.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.940
So that's going to be all of
the x's that satisfy Ax is

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.425
equal to 5, minus 5.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:19.230
So x1, x2 is going to be equal
to b1, it's going to be equal

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:26.910
to 5, 0 plus x2, plus any
scale or multiple of the

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.420
vector 3, 1.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.780
So our solution set is going to
be, you take the vector 5,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.430
0-- so maybe the vector 5, 0,
specifies this position right

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.420
here-- and then you're going to
add to it multiples of the

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.320
vector 3, 1.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.770
The vector 3, 1 looks like this,
1, 2, 3 and you go up 1.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.980
The vector 3, 1 is going
to look like this.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.070
So if you add multiples of
this-- multiples of that could

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.610
stretch out like that or could
go negative like that-- to

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.440
this vector 5, 0, you're
essentially going to-- let me

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.140
see if I can draw this neatly--
you're going to end

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:08.090
up with a solution set that
looks like that right there.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.820
So if you pick a particular
b right there that has a

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.240
solution, we just said that
everything on this line will

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.620
map to that point in
our solution set.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.790
And in fact, if you picked
another point, let's say you

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.050
picked the point minus 5, 5.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.700
Then the solution set that maps
to that would actually

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.960
be-- this first term would
be the minus 5.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.940
It would be here.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:46.680
And all of these guys
would map to that.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.720
Well, this all interesting.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.680
I mean, we've been doing a
lot of abstract things.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.110
And I think it might be
satisfying that you're

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.770
actually seeing something more
concrete in this example.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.370
But I'm doing all of
this for a reason.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.760
Because I want to understand
what the solution set is to a

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.750
general non-homogeneous
equation like this.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.090
And to understand it a little
bit better, let's imagine what

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.670
is the solution set
if I were to pick

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.700
this guy, the 0 vector?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.910
Then what's going to be
the solution set?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.630
So if we say that Ax is equal to
0, then our solution set is

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:33.050
going to the vector 0, 0,
plus x2, times 3, 1.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.350
So it's going to be what?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.540
This is just the 0 vector,
so it's going to be here.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.270
It's going to be here, and
it's going to just be

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.410
multiples of 3, 1.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.020
It's going to look something
like that.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.770
What's this?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.470
What is the solution set to the
equation of Ax equal to 0.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.560
This is the null space.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.680
This, by definition, is
the null space of A.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.880
So notice-- and this is the big
takeaway from this video--

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.630
that for any solution-- we're
picking b's that actually do

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.650
have solutions, because we're
picking them on this line.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.320
We're picking them in the
image of our codomain.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.280
The solution set to any Ax is
equal to some b where b does

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.800
have a solution, it's
essentially equal to a shifted

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.450
version of the null set,
or the null space.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.290
This right here is
the null space.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.630
That right there is the null
space for any real number x2.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.900
Any scale or multiple of
3, 1 is the null space.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.960
I just showed it right there.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.300
It's going to be that.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.020
And so all of these other
solution sets are just some

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.610
particular vector, some
x particular,

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.050
plus the null space.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.300
Obviously, this vector by
itself would also be a

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.860
solution to Ax is equal to b,
because you can just set x2 to

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.120
be equal to 0.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.890
So in general-- and I haven't
proven this to you rigorously,

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.950
but hopefully you kind of get
the intuition behind it.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.370
The solution-- and I'll do this
in the next video, just

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.730
because I realize I'm running
long on time.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:21.300
Assuming Axb has a solution-- in
the example we just did, we

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.070
can assume it has, if we pick
one of these points here.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.540
So assuming it has a solution,
if we pick a point off of our

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.650
image, then we're not going
to have a solution.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:38.010
But assuming Axb has a solution,
the solution set is

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:47.210
going to be equal to some
particular vector-- so you

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.480
could just think of it as a set
with just one vector right

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.110
there-- with, or combined with,
or the union of that

00:14:53.110 --> 00:15:02.620
set, with your null space of
this matrix right here.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.830
I haven't proven this to you
yet, but hopefully you get the

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.410
intuition of why this is true.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.140
We just solved it for
particular cases

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.100
that do have solutions.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.880
We say, hey, it's going
to take this form.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.740
And I just showed you
that this is the

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.990
form of the null space.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.680
And the reason why we're doing
that is because we've been

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.100
talking about invertibility.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.860
And in order to be invertible
you have to be

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.520
onto, and 1 to 1.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.010
And for something to be 1 to
1, you have to have at most

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:41.330
one solution that maps to
a particular vector.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.350
You might have none.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.350
But you might have,
at most, one.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.050
So in order to have, at most,
one solution-- and the

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.950
solution set is always going to
be equal to this, so you're

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.440
always going to have this
solution-- so in order to

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.740
have, at most, one solution,
your null space can't have

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.440
anything in it.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.315
Or it can just have
the zero vector.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:10.275
So that means that your null
space of A has to be trivial,

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:20.430
or to be empty, or to just
have the zero vector.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.650
I'll do this a little bit more
rigorously in the next video,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.260
but I think when you do it
sometimes with the rigor, you

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.540
don't necessarily get
the intuition.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.300
But this is going to be a very
interesting takeway, and I

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.500
think you already understand
it's leading up to conditions

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.750
for invertibility.
