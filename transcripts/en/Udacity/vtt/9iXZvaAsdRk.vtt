&gt;&gt; Whew. We just completed our exploration of software

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.290
defined networking, and now we're jumping into traffic engineering.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; Traffic engineering is a fancy way of describing how network operators

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.840
deal with large amounts of data flowing through their networks. Companies like

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.160
Google are doing exciting work in this area, so be sure to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.810
pay attention to the instructor note

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.330
section, where we'll highlight exciting research papers.
