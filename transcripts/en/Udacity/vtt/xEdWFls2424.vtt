00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.019
George Gamow was a pioneer of the genetic code.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.370
After James Watson and Francis Crick accurately published the structure

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.980
of DNA in 1953. Gamow was one of the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.980
leading scientists trying to crack the genetic code, and figure

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
out how to translate it into protein. Now Gamow

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.110
had correctly calculated that three nucleotides was enough to code

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.820
for all 20 amino acids, and then some. But the

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.000
real question was whether or not the genetic code was

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.590
overlapping or not. In other words, Gamow favored a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.130
model where a sequence of letters in RNA would

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.670
be read in sets of three. But after reading

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.720
the first triplet, the second triplet began with the second

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.170
letter of the first triplet. And so on. Now

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.040
this was referred to as the overlapping model because each

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
codon overlapped with another. An alternative model suggested that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.170
there was no overlap and one triplet was read right

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.790
after another triplet and so on. So of these models, which

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.090
one do you think would be the most efficient for information storage?
