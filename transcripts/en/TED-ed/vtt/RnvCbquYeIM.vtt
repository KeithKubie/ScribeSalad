00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:11.914
Every year, the world uses 
35 billion barrels of oil.

00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:16.984
This massive scale of fossil fuel 
dependence pollutes the Earth

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.884
and it won't last forever.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:23.575
Scientists estimate that we've consumed
about 40% of the world's oil.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:25.245
According to present estimates,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.405
at this rate, we'll run out of oil
and gas in 50 years or so,

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:32.465
and in about a century for coal.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.654
On the flip side, we have abundant
sun, water, and wind.

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:38.715
These are renewable energy sources,

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:41.495
meaning that we won't use them up
over time.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:44.305
What if we could exchange 
our fossil fuel dependence

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:48.006
for an existence based 
solely on renewables?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.097
We've pondered that question for decades,

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:55.785
and yet, renewable energy still
only provides about 13% of our needs.

00:00:55.785 --> 00:01:00.496
That's because reaching 100% requires
renewable energy that's inexpensive

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:02.576
and accessible.

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.836
This represents a huge challenge,

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:10.017
even if we ignore the politics involved
and focus on the science and engineering.

00:01:10.017 --> 00:01:14.597
We can better understand the problem
by understanding how we use energy.

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:18.457
Global energy use is a diverse 
and complex system,

00:01:18.457 --> 00:01:21.957
and the different elements 
require their own solutions.

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:26.037
But for now, we'll focus on two
of the most familiar in everyday life:

00:01:26.037 --> 00:01:28.897
electricity and liquid fuels.

00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:32.279
Electricity powers blast furnaces, 
elevators, computers,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:36.417
and all manner of things in homes,
businesses, and manufacturing.

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:39.837
Meanwhile, liquid fuels 
play a crucial role

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:43.038
in almost all forms of transportation.

00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:45.780
Let's consider the electrical 
portion first.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.269
The great news is that our technology
is already advanced enough

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:52.268
to capture all that energy 
from renewables,

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:54.349
and there's an ample supply.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.349
The sun continuously radiates

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:02.538
about 173 quadrillion watts 
of solar energy at the Earth,

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:05.770
which is almost 10,000 times
our present needs.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.016
It's been estimated that a surface that
spans several hundred thousand kilometers

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:14.100
would be needed to power humanity
at our present usage levels.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.120
So why don't we build that?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.540
Because there are other 
hurdles in the way,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.580
like efficiency

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.960
and energy transportation.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.611
To maximize efficiency,

00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:28.870
solar plants must be located in areas 
with lots of sunshine year round,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.641
like deserts.

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:34.180
But those are far away 
from densely populated regions

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.401
where energy demand is high.

00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.741
There are other forms of renewable energy
we could draw from,

00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:40.986
such as hydroelectric,

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.179
geothermal,

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:43.691
and biomasses,

00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:47.892
but they also have limits based on
availability and location.

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:51.200
In principle, a connected electrical
energy network

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.686
with power lines crisscrossing the globe

00:02:53.686 --> 00:02:57.111
would enable us to transport power
from where it's generated

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.123
to where it's needed.

00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:03.612
But building a system on this scale
faces an astronomical price tag.

00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:06.680
We could lower the cost by developing
advanced technologies

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.632
to capture energy more efficiently.

00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:14.013
The infrastructure for transporting energy
would also have to change drastically.

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:19.361
Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%
of the energy they carry

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.952
because wire material dissipates energy
through resistance.

00:03:23.952 --> 00:03:27.043
Longer power lines would mean
more energy loss.

00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:30.052
Superconductors could be one solution.

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:34.243
Such materials can transport electricity
without dissipation.

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:38.412
Unfortunately, they only work
if cooled to low temperatures,

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.592
which requires energy 
and defeats the purpose.

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:43.263
To benefit from that technology,

00:03:43.263 --> 00:03:46.044
we'd need to discover 
new superconducting materials

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:49.224
that operate at room temperature.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:53.474
And what about the all-important,
oil-derived liquid fuels?

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:56.937
The scientific challenge there is to store
renewable energy

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.785
in an easily transportable form.

00:03:59.785 --> 00:04:03.484
Recently, we've gotten better
at producing lithium ion batteries,

00:04:03.484 --> 00:04:07.105
which are lightweight 
and have high-energy density.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:12.577
But even the best of these
store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram.

00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:17.204
That's about 20 times less than the energy
in one kilogram of gasoline.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:21.414
To be truly competitive, car batteries
would have to store much more energy

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:23.974
without adding cost.

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:28.996
The challenges only increase 
for bigger vessels, like ships and planes.

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:32.045
To power a cross-Atlantic 
flight for a jet,

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:35.696
we'd need a battery weighing
about 1,000 tons.

00:04:35.696 --> 00:04:39.085
This, too, demands a technological leap
towards new materials,

00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:40.570
higher energy density,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.236
and better storage.

00:04:43.236 --> 00:04:46.327
One promising solution would be
to find efficient ways

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:49.467
to convert solar into chemical energy.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:51.606
This is already happening in labs,

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:55.898
but the efficiency is still too low
to allow it to reach the market.

00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:59.274
To find novel solutions, we'll need
lots of creativity,

00:04:59.274 --> 00:05:00.306
innovation,

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:02.447
and powerful incentives.

00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:06.816
The transition towards all-renewable 
energies is a complex problem

00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:10.198
involving technology, 
economics, and politics.

00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:14.527
Priorities on how to tackle this challenge
depend on the specific assumptions

00:05:14.527 --> 00:05:19.558
we have to make when trying to solve
such a multifaceted problem.

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:23.058
But there's ample reason to be optimistic
that we'll get there.

00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:26.818
Top scientific minds around the world
are working on these problems

00:05:26.818 --> 00:05:29.378
and making breakthroughs all the time.

00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:33.519
And many governments and businesses
are investing in technologies

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.559
that harness the energy all around us.
