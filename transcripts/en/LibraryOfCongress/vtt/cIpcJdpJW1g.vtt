&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: ROBERT,
I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.980
WHEN I RECEIVED THE INVITATION.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.230
FIRST OF ALL, LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS, I'M ECSTATIC.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.870 position:56%
I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING HERE.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.560
AND THEN I THOUGHT DISCO FASHION.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.980
[LAUGHTER].

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.640
IT'S -- BUT THEN I FELT THE
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS EVERYTHING.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.940
AND YOU DO.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.270
SO WHY NOT?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.650
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT'S TRUE.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.720
WE DO. WE ARE -- WE ARE

ABOUT THE DISCO ERA, MUSIC, FASHION.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.560
AS YOU CAN SEE, A LITTLE
BIT OF EVERYTHING.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.210
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT TAKES ME BACK.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.510
[LAUGHTER].

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.000
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT'S ALSO FUN BECAUSE
YOU'RE A FELLOW WASHINGTONIAN.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.800
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I AM, GENERATIONS.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.510
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.220
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: AND A GRADUATE
OF CORCHRAN CULTURE.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.520
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YES.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.820
FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.670
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: SO TELL US HOW DID
YOU MORPH FROM CROCHRAN MAJOR.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.700
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WELL, HOW
MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.410
EVEN GETTING TO THE CORCHRAN
WAS A SERENDIPITOUS PATH

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.540
AND I HAD AN UNDER GRADUATE DEGREE.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.590
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING
TO BE DOING IN LITERATURE.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.340
I STUDIED ARCHITECTURE.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.110
AFTER ONE SEMESTER OF IT, I
THOUGHT THIS IS A SURE TRIP

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.080
TO AN INSANE ASYLUM.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.820
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE PULLING INK
AND A STYLUS ALONG A STRAIGHT AGE

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.340
AND 20 HOURS INTO A DRAWING,
THE WHOLE THING BLEEDS.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.910
I GRADUATED FROM CORCHRAN
AND I THOUGHT HOW AM I GOING

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.360
TO SUPPORT MYSELF AS
A STARVING SCULPTOR.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.420
AND I WENT BACK IN WASHINGTON, BUT
IN A DIFFERENT FORM OF DEPARTURE.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:55.810
AND I WAS INVITED TO
TEACH AT THE CORCHRAN.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.130
AND IT WAS ANOTHER
TRIP TO THE ASYLUM.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.550
FOR A WHILE I THREW UP EVERY
MORNING IN THE PARKING LOT.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.520
I HAD A WONDERFUL WOMAN
WHO HIRED ME.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.280
A WONDERFUL WOMAN.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:19.190
AND DURING THE WEEK I KEPT
REHEARSNG THE TALK I NEEDED TO HAVE

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.820
WITH HER FRIDAY AFTERNOON
AFTER CLASS.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.770
I THOUGHT I CAN'T DO THIS.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.530
AND SOMEONE ELSE DECIDED
THEY CANNOT RETURN TO TEACH.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.910
AND I HAD THIS WONDERFUL
IMPASSIONED SPEECH.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.920
I WASN'T EATING.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.040
I WASN'T SLEEPING.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.690
AND LIFE DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.490
SHE LISTENED TO ME.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.650
SHE SAYS I TRUST THAT THIS WILL
EITHER CHANGE YOU OR KILL YOU.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.370
AND I THOUGHT THE LATER.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:59.640
OH, NO. I GOT TO GO BACK ON MONDAY.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.910
BUT CURED ME IT DID.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.390
I ENDED UP BEING A CAREER ACADEMIC.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.410
29 YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:13.660 position:56%
SO I WAS INVITED TO TEACH AT PARSONS
SCHOOL OF DESIGN IN NEW YORK.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.030
THIS WAS 1982.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.330
AND I SAID NO, NO, NO.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.630
THANK YOU.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.930
I LOVE WASHINGTON.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.560
HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:29.410
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS
THAT WERE HAPPENING FOR ME.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.760
IT'S VERY INTERESTING
HOW MUCH LIFE CAN CHANGE.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.260
AS QUICKLY AS EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.530
THINGS CHANGE QUITE DRAMATICALLY.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:44.070
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING
TO GO OR WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:49.850
AND THE PHONE RANG IN THE
OLDERN DAYS WITH THE RING RING.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.940
AND IT WAS PARSONS SAYING
WE ARE TRYING AGAIN.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.720
AND I SAID I WILL COME UP
AND INTERVIEW AND WE'LL SEE.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.560
AND TWO WEEKS LATER I
WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.510
AND THAT WAS 34 YEARS AGO.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.990
SO ITS BEEN A LONG RIDE.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.780
NOW, I HAD ANOTHER ROLE AT
PARSONS OR EVENTUALLY DID.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.310
IN 1990 I WAS APPOINTED
ASSOCIATE DEAN.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.540
AND IN THAT CAPACITY I
WORKED WITH DEPARTMENTS

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.370
WITH CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENTS
AND FACULTY HIRING

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.500
AND FULL-TIME FACULTY
HIRING AND CHAIR HIRINGS.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.070
BUT MOST OF IT WAS CLEAN UP.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.120
PEOPLE CALLED ME MR. FIX-IT.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.250
AND I CALLED MYSELF
A POOPER SCOOPER.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.710
AND I WOULD SAY THIS PLACE
HAS TO STOP POOPING SO MUCH.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.010
AND IT WAS.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.910
AND THAT'S HOW I LANDED
IN THE FASHION DEPARTMENT.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.360
I NEVER -- PEOPLE SAY WHEN DID
YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH FASHION?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.300
WELL, IT WAS WITH A
BAYNETTE IN MY BACK.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.460
I NEVER INTENDED TO BE PART OF THE
FASHION WORLD, IN ANY CAPACITY.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.250
WE HAD A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP
IN OUR FASHION PROGRAM.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:02.410
WHICH AT THE TIME, WELL, IT STILL
IS ARGUABLY THE MOST FAMOUS PROGRAM

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.710
AT PARSONS.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.120
WE HAVE A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.130
I WAS SENT IN TO CONDUCT A
SEARCH FOR THE NEW CHAIR.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:18.070
AND WHEN I STARTED MY EXCAVATION
OF ISSUES, I WENT BACK TO THE DEAN

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.140
AND SAID THIS IS NOT A QUICK FIX.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.150
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT AN OUTSIDER CAN DO.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.600
AND HE SAID, WELL I WANT
YOU TO GO IN FOR A YEAR.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.950
SO THAT WAS THE DEAL.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.020
I WOULD THERE FOR A YEAR.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:36.740
AND THE LIMITS TO THE
YEAR WERE THE FOLLOWING.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.940
I WENT IN, IN AUGUST.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.230
THE BUDGET SET JULY 1ST.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.590
FACULTY CONTRACTS WERE SET.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.670
ROOM ASSIGNMENTS, I
MEAN EVERYTHING WAS LAID

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.530
OUT FOR YOU FOR THE COMING YEAR.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.760
THERE IS REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN
DO EXCEPT OBSERVE AND PROBE.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.220
I ASKED MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF QUESTIONS.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.540
SO AFTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS
THERE, I WROTE A STATE

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.650
OF THE UNION OF SORTS TO THE DEAN.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.400
SAYING THIS PLACE IS HEMORRHAGING.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.700
IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.860 position:56%
IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN I EVER DREAMED.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.050
AND CALLING IT FASHION DESIGN,
IT'S A DRESS MAKING SCHOOL.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.100
IT REALLY WAS.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.460
THERE WAS NO TALK ABOUT
CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.600
THERE WAS NO FASHION HISTORY.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.540
OH, I ASKED, HOW CAN THIS BE?

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.380
WE DON'T WANT THE STUDENTS
TO BE INFLUENCED.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.770
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.500
SO BURY YOURSELF IN A
BASEMENT AND PRETEND

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.300
THAT FASHION HASN'T BEEN
AROUND SINCE MILLENIA.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.690
AND NOTHING IS DIGITAL.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.220
IT'S THE YEAR 2000.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.530
SO I WILL FAST FORWARD.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.030
I ENDED UP BEING APPOINTED CHAIR.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.330
NOTHING THAT I INTENDED TO DO.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.830
I HAVE TO TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.130
A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE
FOR MANY YEARS,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:12:00.160
IT'S DIANNE VON FOSTENBURG,
SHE IS A DOLL.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.400
SHE WAS MY GO-TO PERSON
FOR ANY KIND OF DILEMMA.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.690
SHE IS A REAL PROBLEM
SOLVER AND KNOWS HOW

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.700
TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.330
AND SHE KNOWS HOW TO
DIAGNOSE AND PRESCRIBE.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:24.570
SO SHE WAS MEETING WITH ME
IN MY NEW OFFICE AS CHAIR.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.610
AND I WAS VERY AWARE
JUST IN TERMS AURA

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.480
THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.780
AND I LOOKED AT HER.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.080
AND I SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.380
AND SHE LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.030
AND SHE SAID, YOU NEED NEW CLOTHES.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.540
SHE SAID YOU CANNOT BE RUNNING
THIS DEPARTMENT LOOKING LIKE THIS.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.900
AND I SAID IT'S THAT BAD?

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.200
SHE SAID IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.190 position:56%
I JUST NEVER HAD A NEED TO TELL YOU.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.490
[LAUGHTER].

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.500
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WHAT A
GREAT PIECE OF ADVICE.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.800
I LIKE IT.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.760
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: BUT I HAVE TO TELL
YOU ANOTHER FUNNY STORY HAVING

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.060
TO DO WITH DIANNE.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.360
I'M SORRY I'M STRAYING.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.040
I HAVE THIS WAY OF TALKING.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.340
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: PLEASE GO ON.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.640
I LOVE IT.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.340
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: AS A CHAIR, THERE
WERE CERTAIN THINGS I HAD TO DO.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.970
CURRICULUM WAS A HUGE ONE.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.660
FACULTY WAS ANOTHER.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.770
THERE WAS A VERY POWERFUL
FACULTY MEMBER WHO --

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:23.070
AND I SAY POWERFUL BECAUSE HE
ASSERTED HIMSELF INTO EVERYTHING.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.110
AND DID SO VERY INAPPROPRIATELY.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.630
BUT IT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.750
AND MANY WAYS, THE
PRECEDENT HAD BEEN SET.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.310
AND WHO IS TO SAY TO HIM YOU
CANNOT DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS?

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.850
AND I THOUGHT, WELL I'M THE
ONE WHO IS GOING TO SAY IT.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.000
HIM. I MEAN I COULD HAVE.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.330
I KNEW POLITICALLY IT
WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.830
I WAS LIKE OKAY, I NEED
TO GET TO GUY TO QUIT.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.520
SO I WROTE HIM A VERY
MATTER-FACT LETTER LAYING OUT,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.740
HERE ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
AND HERE THE THINGS

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.710
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
AND WILL NO LONGER BE DOING.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.090
AND SENT IT.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:12.390
WAS WAIT FOR THE REPERCUSSIONS AND
WITHIN ABOUT 10 DAYS THIS ENORMOUS,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.410
I MEAN ENORMOUS ENVELOPE ARRIVED.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.710
AND IT WAS HARD.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.040
I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T REALLY
-- YOU COULDN'T BEND IT.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.610
I THOUGHT, WHAT IS THIS?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.660
WELL, THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS AN
EXTREMELY TALENTED ARTIST.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.260
I PULL OUT THIS DOCUMENT THAT
LOOKS LIKE A MID EVIL MANUSCRIPT.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:36.670 position:56%
I MEAN, IT WAS SPECTACULARLY
STUNNING WITH GOLD LEAF AND DRAGONS.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.470
AND I READ IT.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.450
AND IT BEGAN WITH I RECEIVED
YOUR MENACNG MISSION.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.600
AND IT CONCLUDED WITH I QUIT.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.170
I WAS THRILLED.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.470
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WOW.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.790
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: SO A FEW WEEKS
LATER, DIANNE WAS IN THE OFFICE.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.380
AND I WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE
MY OWN LITTLE PRIVATE RESTROOM

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.680
IN MY OFFICE.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.090 position:56%
SO I TOOK THIS THING, THIS DOCUMENT,

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.600
AND HUNG IT BEHIND THE BATHROOM
DOOR, WHICH FACES THE TOILET.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.770
SO DIANNE GOES TO THE
BATHROOM AND CALLS OUT,

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.430
WHAT'S A MENACING MISSIVE.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.600
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: DO YOU STILL HAVE IT.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.900
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YEAH.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.200
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YOU'RE BRAVE.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.350
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: AND PROJECT
RUNWAY CALLED.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:41.310
AND I MADE -- I WILL SAY THIS
MODESTLY, BUT ALSO RATHER --

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.440
WHAT'S THE WORD I AM SEARCHING FOR?

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.560
I'LL JUST SAY THIS MODESTLY.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.950
I HAD TO MAKE CHANGES
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.140
AND THEY WERE VERY
CONTROVERSIAL IN THE CASES.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:58.900
AND MANY PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY
ALUMNI HATED ME.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.800
I WAS REALLY UNPOPULAR.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.510
I TOOK THIS PRECIOUS THING.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:09.020
THIS FASHION DESIGN DEPARTMENT
THAT HADN'T CHANGED IN 52 YEARS

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.580
AND TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.220
MY PREDECESSORS WERE
KEEPERS OF THE LINE.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:22.570
AND MY PRODUCER HEARD
A LOT ABOUT ME.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.060
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.180
HE MADE A LOT OF CHANGES.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.870
ENDS WERE VERY GOOD.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.770
AND MAYBE HE CAN HELP
YOU WITH THIS PROJECT.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.670
SO THEY CALLED ME.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.240
AND I SAID -- I'LL TELL
YOU EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.540
FASHION REALITY?

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.110
THIS INDUSTRY HAS ENOUGH
TROUBLE WITHOUT THAT.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.140
SO THEY ASKED IF THEY
CAN COME MEET WITH ME.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.060
AND OF COURSE, I GOOGLED THEM.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.130
AND I FOUND OUT THEY WERE THE
PRODUCERS OF PROJECT GREEN LIGHT

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.680
WHICH HAS A LOT OF
INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.980
AND THEY MET WITH ME.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.280
AND I BECAME VERY EXCITED.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.230
THEY WANTED TO WORK WITH
REAL FASHION DESIGNERS

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.250
AND IT SOUNDED INTERESTING.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.650
IT SOUNDED INTERESTING AND FUN.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.420 position:56%
BUT THEY ASKED ME A QUESTION THAT I
KNEW WAS "THE QUESTION" SO TO SPEAK.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.030
AND IT WAS THE FOLLOWING.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.350
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND IF WE WERE TO
TELL YOU THAT WE WANT THE DESIGNERS

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.030
TO CREATE A WEDDING
DRESS IN TWO DAYS?

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.940
COMPARED TO PROJECT RUNWAY TODAY,
TWO DAYS SOUNDS LIKE AN ETERNITY.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.200
AND I MEAN, I COME FROM
THE ACADEMIC WORLD.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.730
AND WE HAVE ARCHITECTURE WHERE
YOU GET A PROJECT ON FRIDAY NIGHT

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.300
AND CRITIQUING IT ON SUNDAY.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.970
AND IN FACT, WE'LL HAVE TO CREATE
A WEDDING DRESS IN TWO DAYS.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.980
IT CAN BE DONE.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.670
WELL, IT CAN BE DONE.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.550
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN OSCAR
LAUREN OR A VERA WANG GOWN,

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.740
BUT IT WILL BE A SHIP
WITHOUT SLEEVES.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:59.810
ACTUALLY A COLUMN WITHOUT SLEEVES.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.020
AND THEN I DIDN'T HEAR
FROM THEM FOR WEEKS.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.970
AND I THOUGHT WELL,
THAT WAS INTERESTING.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.620
AND I WAS THEIR CONSULTANT
UP UNTIL TWO DAYS BEFORE THE

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.920
DESIGNERS ARRIVED.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.270
IN A WAY, I'M STILL
THEIR CONSULTANT.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.740 position:56%
BUT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE DESIGNERS
ARRIVED, THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD GO

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.800
INTO THE WORK ROOM AND PUMBLE
THE DESIGNERS WITH QUESTIONS

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.100
ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.320
AND I THOUGHT, THAT'S HOW
I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.850
SURE. I TOLD YOU BACK
STAGE, I NEVER DREAMED

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.430
OF BEING THE CUT OF THE SHOW.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.850
I THOUGHT AS LONG AS THEY HAVE
THE DESIGNERS RESPONDING TO ME,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.150
NO ONE NEEDS TO HEAR MY VOICE.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.450
NO ONE NEEDS TO SEE ME.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.880
AND FOR THAT REASON, I DIDN'T
GO TO THE PREMIERE PARTY.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.770
WELL, IF I'M IN THE SHOW.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.240
WHAT WILL I LOOK LIKE
AND SOUND LIKE?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.970
AND IF I'M NOT IN THE SHOW,
I WILL BE KIND OF HUMILIATED.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:02.010
SO I WATCHED THE PREMIERE
ON TELEVISION.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.740
I WATCHED IT, THE SAME WAY THAT I
USED TO WATCH "THE WIZARD OF OZ"

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.660
WHERE I WAS IN BED PEEKING
OUT FROM BEHIND MY SHEETS.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.890
I HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING IN ADVANCE.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.680
I THOUGHT, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.520
MAYBE IT'S SEXUAL ESCAPADES
IN THE APARTMENT.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.210
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.480
AND THE FIRST FIVE AS SOON AS
OF THE SHOW WE WERE ON BRAVO

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.510
AND DURING THE TAPING
OF THE FIRST SEASON,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:33.440
THERE WAS A WOMAN STANDING NEXT
TO ME IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BACK

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.460
OF THE PARSONS AUDITORIUM
WHERE WE FILMED THE RUNWAY SHOW

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.670
WITH THE DESIGNERS AND
THE JUDGE'S DELIBERATION.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.050
AND WE WERE WATCHING THE
JUDGE'S DELIBERATION.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.170
AND THIS PERSON, UNKNOWN TO
ME, TURNED TO ME AND ASKED,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.270
WHO IS GOING TO WANT TO WATCH THIS?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:00.430
AND THE PERSON WAS THE
PRESIDENT OF BRAVO.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.730
[LAUGHTER].

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.730
SO WHO KNEW?

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:10.130 position:56%
I MEAN, AND ALSO AT AGE 50, I HAD AN
ENTIRELY NEW THRESHOLD TO MY LIFE.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.430
I MEAN, IT WAS PHENOMENAL.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:21.590
AND I HAD A VERY HAPPY, VERY
REWARDING SPIRITUALLY CAREER.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: SO OVER THE COURSE OF
PROJECT RUNWAY, HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:31.680
AS ONE WHO CRITIQUES DESIGN
AS A TEACHER, AS A MENTOR?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.980
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THAT'S AN
INTERESTING QUESTION.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:38.000
WELL, ACTUALLY, BECOMING A
MENTOR WAS VERY CHALLENGING.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.080
IN WAYS THAT I DIDN'T
THINK THAT IT WOULD.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.810
BECAUSE I BECAME AWARE
VERY QUICKLY THAT I HAD

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.650
TO TAKE OFF MY TEACHER'S HAT AND
ACTUALLY IT HAPPENED, EPISODE 1.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.290
SEASON 1 EPISODE 1.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.810
I WAS IN THE SEWING
ROOM THREADING A BOBBIN.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.780
BECAUSE ONE OF THE DESIGNERS
WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DOING IT.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:04.610
JANE LIPSIT ONE OF THE
EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS IS KNOCKING

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.140
BECAUSE SHE HAS A FEED, THERE
IS A FEED IN EVERY ROOM.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.320
KNOCKING ON THE SEWING ROOM DOOR.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.040
SAYING TIM, CAN I SPEAK
TO YOU IN THE HALLWAY?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.080
I'M THREADING A BOBBIN.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.250
SHE SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.580
WHY NOT? BECAUSE IT'S
A FAIRNESS ISSUE.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.690
IF YOU THREAD THE BOBBIN
FOR THAT DESIGNER,

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.920
YOU HAVE TO THREAD THE BOBBIN
FOR ALL OF THE DESIGNERS.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.820
AND I SAID I'M OUT OF THE
SEWING ROOM AND I'M NOT GOING

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.410
TO BECOME THE BOBBING
THREADING HAND MAIDEN.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:42.110
AND I ALSO LEARNED
DURING THE CRITIQUES --

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.630
AND I HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.300
THE MENTOR YOU SEE IN THE
WORK ROOM IS VERY MUCH THE WAY

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.300
THAT I EVOLVED AS A TEACHER.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.100
BECAUSE IN THE EARLY
DAYS OF TEACHING,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.840
I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT NATURAL
FOR AT LEAST NOVICES TO WANT

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.530
TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS
INTO LITTLE MINI ME'S.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.470
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE SAME -- WORK
HABITS AND ALL OF THE MYRIAD THINGS

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:09.600
THAT GO WITH THAT, PUCTUALITY
AND BREAK TIME AND THE THING

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.950
THAT I EVOLVED TO WAS,
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.870
AND HOW WELL ARE YOU
SUCCEEDING AT THIS?

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.160
WHAT ISSUES ARE YOU HAVING?

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.930
I DEVELOPED A VERY SOCRATIC
APPROACH TO TEACHING.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.710
HUMBLING PEOPLE WITH QUESTIONS.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:36.800 position:56%
AND I WILL SAY THIS FOR ANY TEACHERS
OR WOULD-BE TEACHERS IN THIS ROOM.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.880
AND ANOTHER THING THAT
I RID MYSELF UP.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:48.460 position:56%
THE DEBILITATING THROWING UP PART OF
IT, FEELING THAT I WAS RESPONSIBLE

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.670
FOR EVERY KERNEL OF INFORMATION.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:58.020
THAT I HAD TO BE THIS
VUNDER KENT ANSWER MAN.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.930
AND IT WAS JUST DEBILITATING.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.260
SO WHAT I EVOLVED TO, IF
SOMEONE WERE TO ASK A QUESTION,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.120 position:56%
IF A STUDENT WERE TO ASK A QUESTION.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.920
I WOULD SAY, INTERESTING QUESTION.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.020
FOR THE NEXT CLASS, I WANT ALL
OF YOU TO RESEARCH THIS QUESTION.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.960
AND COME IN WITH AN ANSWER THAT
YOU DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE WOULD

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.320
HAVE FOUND.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.160
SO THEY HAD TO DIG DEEP.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.760
AND THEN WE WOULD SHARE IT ALL.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.000
AND IT WAS FANTASTIC.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.270
BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION
THAT WOULD EVOLVE

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:41.180
FROM THAT ONE QUESTION WOULD BE A
CATALYST FOR A MILLION OTHER THINGS

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.420
AND WOULD TAKE US INTO A DIRECTION
OF A MILLION OTHER THINGS,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.740
AND WAS A HUGE ENHANCEMENT FOR THE
COURSE SYLLABUS AND FOR ME TO MOVE

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.100
INTO THE MENTOR POSITION ON RUNWAY.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.790
I WON'T SAY IT WAS EASY.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.090
I WAS A NERVOUS WRECK.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.250
I WAS ESPECIALLY A NERVOUS
WRECK IF HEIDI WAS EVER AROUND.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.550
MY PALMS WOULD SWEAT.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.040
SHE IS VERY -- I MEAN SHE
IS A LOVELY FANTASTIC PERSON

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.340
WHO I LOVE DEARLY.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.640
BUT SHE IS HEIDI KLUM.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.940
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YEAH.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.470
THAT CAN BE VERY INTIMIDATNG
I'M SURE.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.710
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: BUT IT WAS A JOURNEY.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.010
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: RIGHT.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.880
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: AND ONE
THAT I REALLY LOVED.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.990
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: SO WHAT IS IT LIKE
ACTUALLY DOING PROJECT RUNWAY?

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.790
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO DO IT?

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.530
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WELL WE DO THE
BULK OF IT WHICH CONSISTS

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.780
OF 12 CHALLENGES IN 31 DAYS.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.060
WE HAVE NO BREAKS.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.570
SOMETIMES 18 HOUR,
SOMETIMES 20 HOUR DAYS.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.510
I LOVE PROJECT RUNWAY JUNIOR.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.700
WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY
THE CHILD LABOR LAWS.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.740
IT'S LIKE A VACATION.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.930
IT'S SO WONDERFUL.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.920
THE DAY ENDS AND EVERYONE
IS OFF THE CLOCK.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:07.790 position:56%
FOR RUNWAY, IF IT'S DECIDED THAT THE
WORK ROOM IS GOING TO NOT CLOSE AT

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.250
AND WE STAY OPEN UNTIL , WE
SHARE IT WITH THE AUDIENCE.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.980
WE NEVER MISREPRESENT THINGS.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.470
AND THEN I'M THERE UNTIL .

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.770
IT'S FINE.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.520
IT'S A HIGH CLASS PROBLEM.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.820
THE LONG DAYS.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.310
AND I WILL SAY, IT
GETS TO ALL OF US.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:30.700
I MEAN, IT'S A CUMULATIVE
EXHAUSTION.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.290
MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY, CREATIVELY.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.590
IT GETS TO US.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.010
BUT I WOULDN'T NOT DO IT.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.780
AND IT'S FOR BUDGET
REASONS THAT WE DO IT

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.340
IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.300
AND THERE IS A HIATUS.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.570
AND I DO THE HOME VISIT WHICH
IS 10 DAYS INCLUDING TRAVEL.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.150
AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER
VERY SMALL HIATUS

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.450
AND THEN WE HAVE FASHION WEEK.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.990
WHICH TAKES US FIVE
DAYS BEGINNING TO END.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.290
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WONDERFUL.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.080
WELL, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
WE'RE HERE IS TO CELEBRATE DISCO.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.190
THE WHOLE DISCO ERA AND WE'RE
BOTH PRODUCTS OF THAT ERA.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.490
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: REGRETTABLY.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:12.650
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WHAT DO YOU THINK
DEFINES DISCO IN TERMS OF FASHION?

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.740
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WELL, I WANT TO
GIVE IT A BIT OF A CONTEXT.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:21.380
WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE
1960S, WHICH WAS IN MY VIEW,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.080
THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY
DECADE IN FASHION EVER.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:32.840 position:56%
I MEAN, WE USHERED IN WITH MAD MEN
PRIMNUS AND BUTTONED UPNESS FOR MEN.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.450
AND WE USHER IT OUT WITH HIPPIES.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:42.790
AND WE HAVE THE CLEAR VINYL
DRESS COURTESY OF YSL.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.090
WE HAVE THE PAPER DRESS.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:49.880
THAT'S WHY TODAY, ESPECIALLY
THOSE, OH,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:27:04.060
GOD THOSE HORRIBLE
KARDASHIANS RUNNING AROUND.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.360
[LAUGHTER].

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.660
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.980
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES
ME RISE MORE IS WHAT'S GOING

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:19.790
ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.140
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.720
BUT TRULY, AFTER THE '60S, FASHION
WISE, I'M PRETTY UNSHOCKABLE.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.920
SO WE HAVE THIS TERM OIL.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:38.960 position:56%
WE ENTER INTO THE '70S AND THERE
ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT BROAD MEN.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:46.300
WE HAD A PEACOCK MOMENT OF MEN IN
THE '60S WITH EXTRAVAGANT DRESS

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.350
AND MELTED BEAUTIFULLY INTO
THE WHOLE DISCO MOVEMENT.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:58.640
WE HAD A KIND OF BODY
AWARENESS WITH WOMEN.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.160
WHERE VERY LITTLE WAS
LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.560
AND THAT CERTAINLY SEGUED
VERY BEAUTIFULLY INTO DISCO.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.570
IT WAS A TIME OF FLAMBOYANCE.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:15.560
IT WAS A TIME OF DIFFERENTIATION
AND EVERYONE WANTED TO STAND OUT.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.640
I AM ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT THE CLOTHES,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.480
THE CLOTHES WE WEAR SEND A MESSAGE
ABOUT HOW THE WORLD PERCEIVES US.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.170 position:56%
YOU WANTED TO BE DISTINCTIVE AND
DIFFERENT ON THAT DISCO DANCE FLOOR.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:30.660
IT WAS REALLY A GIANT
RUNWAY OF SORTS.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.950
AND IT WAS SEXUALLY CHARGED.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.130
SOCIOLOGICALLY CHARGED.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.440
IDENTITY CHARGED.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.250
THERE WERE GENDER-BENDING
ASPECTS TO DISCO CULTURE.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:51.340
AND WE SEE THE RISE OF CERTAIN
DESIGNERS IN THAT PERIOD

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:56.020
WHO ALSO WERE INEXTRICABLE
FROM THE MOVEMENT.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.390
HOLTSTON BEING THE MOST PROMINENT,

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.780
WORKING WITH JERSEY
WHO HAD STRETCHED.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:07.500
HOW CRAZY WOULD IT BE WEARING
HOLTSTON ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.560
DIANNE VON FURSTENBURG ANOTHER,
NORMA CANOLLI, ICONIC IN THE '70S

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.110
AND ENTRENCHED IN DISCO CULTURE.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.340
IT WAS A PHENOMENAL TIME.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.990
AND IT'S DEBATABLE, AND ARGUABLE.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.740
BUT MANY PEOPLE SAY
THAT DISCO CULTURE CAME

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.040
OUT OF A GAY SUBCULTURE.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.340
AND I BELIEVE THAT.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.640
IN MANY WAYS IT DID.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:32.030
AND COINCIDENTALLY, I AM SURE
MANY OF YOU ARE ENTIRELY TOO YOUNG

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.660
TO HAVE ANY AWARENESS OF THIS.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.650
IN SOME WAYS I THINK YOU SHOULD.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.980
IN 1973 HOMO SEXUALITY
WAS REMOVED FROM THE LIST

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.070
OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BY THE
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.370
SO SUDDENLY YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT BEING OUT.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.570
BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT,
TO YOU CAN BE LOCKED UP.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.870
I MEAN, LEGALLY.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.170
SO THIS SUBCULTURE COULD
EMERGE AND BECOME --

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.490
I DON'T WANT TO SAY MAIN STREAM.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.750
BUT ACTUALLY EMBRACED
BY THE MAIN STREAM.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:07.060 position:56%
I MEAN, THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT
DISCO CULTURE, IT WAS ALL INCLUSIVE.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.900
IT DIDN'T CARE WHERE YOU
CAME FROM, WHO YOU WERE,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.710
WHAT YOUR IDENTITY WAS,
WHAT RACE YOU WERE.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.010
IT EMBRACED EVERYBODY.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:22.160
AND IT WAS -- ACTUALLY I
DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.360 position:56%
IN IF ANTICIPATION OF OUR INTERVIEW.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.070
I THOUGHT, WHAT DO I
REALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS?

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.260
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BY
1978 IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.940
THERE WERE ,000 DISCO TECHS.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.240
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, I HAD NO IDEA.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.370
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THAT'S
A STAGGERING NUMBER.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.670
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT IS.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.930
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: AND OF COURSE THE GRAND
PUBA OF THEM ALL WAS STUDIO 54.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.230
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YEAH.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.190
AMAZING. SO FROM THIS
PERIOD, DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.860
OF YOUR OWN FASHION RECOLLECTION?

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.660
THINGS THAT YOU WERE WEARING?

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.650
IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR CLOSET
THAT YOU WANT TO TELL US ABOUT?

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.950
[LAUGHTER].

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.570
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YOU KNOW, I HAVE THIS
THEORY CALLED THE MONKEY HOUSE

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:02.870
AT THE ZOO.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.580
AND IT IS THE FOLLOWING.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:14.210 position:56%
WHEN YOU FIRST WALK INTO THE MONKEY
HOUSE, YOU SHRIEK THIS PLACE STINKS.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.330
AND AFTER 20 MINUTES YOU SAY,
THIS DOESN'T SMELL SO BAD.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.220
AND AFTER 30 MINUTES,
YOU THINK, WHAT SMELL?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.370
BUT ANYONE NEW WALKING IN
SAYS THIS PLACE STINKS.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:32.970
THAT WAS MY '70S FASHION.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:48.890
I PUT ON THE POLYESTER
PANTS AND THE FLORAL SHIRT

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:54.820
AND I THOUGHT THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE AND ATROCIOUS.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.210
AND AFTER 20 MINUTES, I THOUGHT
YOU KNOW, I LOOK KIND OF HIP.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:08.720
AND AFTER 30 MINUTES, I THOUGHT,
OKAY, I CAN LEAVE MY APARTMENT NOW.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.190
BUT LOOKING BACK AT IT,
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.490
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: RIGHT.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.490
WELL, TIM, I WENT INTO MY CLOSET.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.170
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WHAT DID YOU FIND?

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.470
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: [LAUGHTER].

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.080
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: ROBERT
YOU STILL HAVE THEM?

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:28.240
ARE YOU WAITING FOR THE RETURN?

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.250
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I WISH I
CAN GET MY FOOT IN THEM.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:38.710
1977, I BOUGHT THESE IN PARIS.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.010
I WAS STUDYING IN FRANCE.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:53.490
YES, I THOUGHT I WAS THE COOLEST
THING THAT EVER HIT THE EARTH.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.790
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WELL, YOU WERE.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.590
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: SO WHY DO
I STILL HAVE THESE?

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.890
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WHY DO YOU?

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.190
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.490
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:01.790
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THAT IS HILARIOUS.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.510
ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD
FOR TINY NEW YORK APARTMENTS.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:12.080
BECAUSE UNLESS I RESIGN MYSELF

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:23.990
TO BEING A HOARDER,
I GET RID OF THINGS.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.540
THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.850
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
YOU WERE TELLING ME BACK STAGE,

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:37.520
BACK IN YOUR CAREER THAT
SURPRISED ME WAS THAT YOU HAVE

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.820
TO HAVE YOUR OWN WARDROBE.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.120
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, I DO.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.420
I SUPPLY EVERYTHING.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.720
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I THOUGHT YOU
WERE JUST SITTING BACK,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.020
AND PEOPLE WERE HOLDING UP OUTFITS.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.320
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: NO.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.640
BUT YOU JUST TRIGGERED A STORY
THOUGH THAT HAS LEFT MY MIND.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:55.340
YEAR ONE OF PROJECT RUNWAY, IT'S
2004, BANANA REPUBLIC WAS ONE

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.610
OF THE SPONSORS OF THE SHOW.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:05.250
IN FACT, WE HAD THE BANANA
REPUBLIC CHALLENGE FIRST TWO YEARS.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.510
AND THEY WERE GOING TO WARDROBE ME.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.810
OUTFIT ME.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:16.940
AND COINCIDENTALLY, I WAS
A BIG BANANA REPUBLIC FAN.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.580
AND DIANNE VON FURSTENBURG
SAID ARE YOU GOING

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.280
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:32.990
I WENT TO SAKS AND FOUND A
BLAZER THAT I TRULY LOVED.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.680
IT WAS EXPENSIVE.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:40.360
AND THEN I WALKED ACROSS THE STREET
TO THE BANANA REPUBLIC OF FLAGSHIP

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.950
ACROSS THE STREET BY
ROCKEFELLER CENTER.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:49.440
I REMEMBER BANANA REPUBLIC BEING
KHAKIS, AND GOING INTO THE AMAZON.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:55.340
AND I FOUND THE IDENTICAL
JACKET MORE OR LESS

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.950
FOR 25 -- FOR 75 PERCENT LESS.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.960
IT WAS A MERE 25 PERCENT
OF THE PRICE.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.260
I BOUGHT IT.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.670
AND TOOK THE JACKET BACK TO SAKS.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:07.350
AND I DISCOVERED THE
WORLD OF BANANA REPUBLIC.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.770
AND I HAD A LOT OF THE CLOTHES.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.070
AND I WAS THRILLED.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:15.410
I WAS GOING TO GET NEW STUFF
AND THEY WERE ANTICIPATING

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.000
WHEN THE STUFF WOULD BE AIRED,
IT WOULD BE NEW FALL CLOTHES.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.920
AT ANY RATE, NOTHING CAME.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.220
NOTHING CAME.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.520
NOTHING CAME.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:32.060
SO THEN, SOME CALLS WERE MADE,
AND CLOTHES DID ARRIVE TAPED

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:37.710
TO A BICYCLE MESSENGER'S BIKE, A
BAG OF BANANA REPUBLIC CLOTHES.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:42.280
I WAS WEARING BANANA
REPUBLIC CLOTHES EVERY DAY.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.220
BUT IT WAS MY BANANA
REPUBLIC CLOTHES.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.520
NOT THEIRS.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.820
SO I GOT A STEAMER.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.120
AND WORKED ITSELF OUT.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.660
AND AT THE END OF THE SEASON,

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.900
THEY WANTED EVERYTHING
BACK INCLUDING THE SOCKS.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.580
SO I DRY CLEANED EVERYTHING.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.100
AND I HAD MADE CERTAIN ALL
OF THE SOCKS WERE LAUNDERED

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:10.300
AND I WAS THEN LATER ASKED,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:15.110
THIS IS GETTING REALLY
TEDIOUS, I'M SORRY EVERYONE.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:18.760
I WAS ASKED, LAUREN DAVID
PENEN WROTE FOR WOMEN'S DAILY

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.570
AND HAD A REGULAR FEATURE OF
GIVING SOMEONE 100 DOLLARS

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.710
AND WHAT WOULD YOU BUY?

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:29.200
OH, THERE IS A RAIN COAT
ON SALE AT BANANA REPUBLIC

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.880
AND IT'S 100 DOLLARS
AND I WILL PAY THE TAX.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.630
AND TALKING ABOUT TAKING
THE CLOTHES BACK.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.180
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.770
DON'T TAKE THEM BACK
IF YOU DON'T WANT

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.780
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.450
I WAS FLABBERGASTED.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.670 position:56%
SEASON TWO, BANANA REPUBLIC IS BACK.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.040
AND I AM STILL WEARING
BANANA REPUBLIC.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.100
I'M WEARING THEIR CLOTHES BUT I'M
TURNED OFF BY THE PUBLIC RELATIONS.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:10.130
AND THE PEOPLE WITH THE SPONSORS
SAY TO ME, WE NEED AN INVENTORY

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.070
OF EVERYTHING YOU WORE THIS SEASON.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.150
WHY? WE NEED TO CREDIT
BANANA REPUBLIC WITH IT.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.600
I SAID, WELL I'M WEARING BANANA
REPUBLIC BUT IT'S ALL MINE.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.550
THE CLOTHES NEVER CAME.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.100
AND THEY DIDN'T.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.000
ONCE AGAIN, ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.160
I MEAN, I LOVE BEING
I A TRUTH TELLER.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.560
BUT IT DOES CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.860
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY WARDROBE.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.410 position:56%
AND I TAKE THAT ROLE VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.960
AND IT MEANS THAT I NEED TO
GET NEW THINGS EVERY YEAR.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.110
AND I TAKE A LOT OF THINGS TO
GOOD WILL AND HOUSING WORKS

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:52.390
BECAUSE I HAVE SMALL NEW YORK
CLOSETS AND IF ANYONE IS WONDERING,

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.200
NO, YOU CAN'T WRITE
THEM OFF IN YOUR TAXES.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.090
ONCE ANYTHING LEAVES THE STUDIO,

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.170
OF COURSE I'M ON THE SUBWAY EVERY
DAY, SO IT LEAVES THE STUDIO.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.890
I DON'T HAVE A DRESSING ROOM.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.520
I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CHANGE.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.430
SO IT'S MINE.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.170
BUT THAT ALSO MEANS I CAN
DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:11.900
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THAT'S GREAT.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.900
WELL, TIM WE'RE GOING
TO TURN IN A MOMENT JUST

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.730 position:56%
TO SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.030
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, THRILLING.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.330
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT WILL BE FUN.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:24.120
BUT I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS THAT
EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO KNOW.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.600
AND I MUST GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.900
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: UH-OH.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.500
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THE FIRST
IS, DO YOU HAVE A TATTOO?

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.590
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YOU KNOW, IT'S
SOMETHING I FANTASIZE ABOUT.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.900
AND AT THE MOMENT, NO.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.060
BECAUSE I HAVE A SERIOUS
ADVERSION TO PAIN.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:51.030
BUT IF I WAS TO EVER GET A
TATTOO, AND HONEST TRUTH,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.370
I HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES,
IT WOULD BE MY LIBRARY

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.670
OF CONGRESS CATALOG NUMBER.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.120
ONE OF THEM.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.920
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: BRAVO.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:06.460
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.580
ALSO, IN A WAY, WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT TATTOOS, AND I MEAN THIS

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.830
WITH ALL RESPECT, DON'T
YOU THINK IT'S AN ANTEDOTE.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.130
THIS IS GREAT.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.430
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.270
WE'RE GOING TO GO PLACES WITH THAT.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.570
I'M NOT SURE HOW YET.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:26.170
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO THERE.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.420
ACTUALLY JUST TWO MORE THINGS.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.500
COULD YOU GIVE US ANY
DISH ON YOUR CO-STARS?

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.360
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: COULD I?

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:44.300
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.270
HEIDI IS A DOLL.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.740
THERE ISN'T A DEVIOUS
BONE IN HER BODY.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.110
AND ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS
THAT CREW MEMBERS ADORE HER.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.820
THEY DO NOT SEPARATE.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.580
AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER TWO.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:09.290
I HAVE TO INTERACT WITH
THEM SINCE SEASON 12.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.560
I HAVE HAD TO SIT WITH
THEM FOR THE RUNWAY SHOW.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.260
I'M TELLING YOU, COMING
DOWN THE RUNWAY.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.840
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT IT.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.230
AND FOR ME, YOU CAN SAY, YOU
ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE WORK IS.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.070
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT WALK.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.530
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ON MODELS.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.250
I HAVEN'T SEEN HOW
THE PROPORTIONS WORK

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.990
WITH THE PROPORTIONS OF THE BODY.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.100
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT WALK.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.750
AND THE JUDGES HAVEN'T
SEEN IT AT ALL.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.500
AT LEAST I SAW IT IN THE WORK ROOM.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.150
I WILL BE SITTING THERE STUDYING
THE SHOW AND NINA WILL LEAN OVER

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:44.490
AND ASK, SO HOW IS YOUR SUMMER?

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:48.360
LOOK AT THE SHOW.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.030
I USED TO SAY, BEFORE I INTERACTED
WITH THEM, THAT I WOULD SAY HELLO

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.620
TO THE JUDGES WHEN THEY ARRIVED.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.480
BUT I FREQUENTLY DIDN'T SAY
GOOD BYE BECAUSE I WAS MAD.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.920
SO I STILL DON'T SAY GOOD BYE.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.220
BUT I DO SAY HELLO.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.190
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THAT'S GOOD.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:08.130
WELL MY LAST QUESTION IS
REALLY ON THE SERIOUS SIDE.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.960
MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR VERY MOVING VIDEO

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.610
ON THE IT GETS BETTER PROJECT.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.140
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THANK YOU.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:24.000
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: BEAUTIFUL.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.300
[APPLAUSE].

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.240 position:56%
AND YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH WORK
CHANTING PREVENTION OF TEEN SUICIDE.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.030
AND HOW DO YOU MANAGE ALL OF THE
CHARITABLE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.830 position:56%
WITH THIS VERY DEMANDING PROFESSION?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.950
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WELL, I
CONSIDER IT A RESPONSIBILITY.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.700
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE TIME FOR IT.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.150
IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT
TO GIVE BACK.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:49.640
AND HAVING SPENT MOST OF MY
LIFE, WELL ALL OF MY LIFE REALLY

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.780
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, WITH
ESPECIALLY STUDENTS

00:41:52.780 --> 00:42:00.810
AND KNOWING HOW PAINFUL
NAVIGATING THE WORLD CAN BE.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.700
AND GROWING UP CAN BE.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.090
I'M A SQUISH.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:13.700
I MEAN, I HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR
THAT KIND OF PAIN AND ANGUISH.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.160
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER
BE DELIVERED FROM IT.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.620
AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY
TO PEOPLE, INDIVIDUALS,

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.250
IT REALLY DOES GET BETTER.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.610
BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS
TOO TO EVERYONE.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.100
LIFE IS A COLLABORATION.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.950
WE DO NOT DO THINGS ALONE.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.390
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T
GET BETTER ALONE.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.540
AND I HAD -- I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE --

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.840
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS
LUCKY AT THE TIME.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.490
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
HORRIBLE.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.480 position:56%
I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE AN
INTERVENTION BY AN INCREDIBLE DOCTOR

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.960
WHO WOULDN'T PUT UP
WITH MY NONSENSE.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.910
HE SAVED ME.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.210
AND STOOD BY ME.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.520
I'M FOREVER GRATEFUL.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.910
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THANK GOD.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.530
SO THANK YOU.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:56.410
I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO
SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:57.710
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I LOVE IT.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.010
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OUR STAFF
HAS MICROPHONES

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.310
AND IT'S KIND OF BRIGHT UP HERE.

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:02.170
ANY QUESTIONS, COME UP.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.470
HERE WE GO.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.770
READY FOR OUR CLOSE UPS.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:10.400
WE HAVE A QUESTION.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.180
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I JUST WANT TO SAY,
YOU'RE A FABULOUS LOOKING AUDIENCE.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.480
[APPLAUSE].

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.100
I AM SO GLAD THE LIGHTS WENT UP.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.440
WHERE IS OUR QUESTION?

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.930
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HI.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.590
YOU HAVE I THINK THE
BEST WASHINGTON,

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.170
D.C. STORY I HAVE EVER HEARD.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.020
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN TELL
US AGAIN ABOUT VIVIAN VINCE.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:38.600
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YES, MY FATHER
WAS AN FBI AGENT FOR 26 YEARS.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:45.110
AND HE WAS IN A FIELD OFFICE IN
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY OF ALL PLACES

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.160
FOR THREE OF THOSE YEARS AND
THEN WAS MOVED TO HEADQUARTERS.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.180
AND MY FATHER WAS A VERY
TALENTED WRITER AND ENDED

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.180
UP BEING HOOVER'S GHOST WRITER AND
SPEECH WRITER AND TOOK CARE OF ALL

00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.670
OF THE CORRESPONDENTS AND MY SISTER

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:04.640
AND I WOULD FIST THE FBI
HEADQUARTERS ONCE A YEAR

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.940
AND TAKE THE FBI TOUR.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.340
IT'S A REAL THRILL.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.390
AND IT PROBABLY STILL IS.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.430
AND REMEMBER, THIS IS THE
OLD ER DAYS OF HUBERT.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.830
IT WAS NOT A PRESIDENTIAL
APPOINTMENT.

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:24.330
IN FACT, I HAVE A WHOLE
CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT HIS DEATH.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:34.360
SO THIS ONE PARTICULAR DAY MY
FATHER SAID TO MY SISTER AND ME,

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.940 position:56%
VIVIAN VANCE IS VISITING MR. HOOVER.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:41.470
AND I WAS A HUGE "I LOVE LUCY" FAN
AND I AM A HUGE "I LOVE LUCY" FAN

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:45.230
AND WAS LIKE, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO MEET HER?

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.530
OF COURSE.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.830
WHO WOULDN'T.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.600
IT WAS THRILLING.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.930
IT WAS BEFORE SELFIES AND
LITTLE PORTABLE PHONES

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.660
AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.920
SO THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.220
WE MET VIVIAN VANCE.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.520
IT WAS GREAT.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.280
YEARS LATER, MY FATHER HAS PASSED.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.730
ALL OF THE STUFF COMES OUT ABOUT
HOOVER BEING A CROSS DRESSER.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:12.530
AND IT WAS THANKSGIVING DINNER
AND I TURN TO MY SISTER.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:17.270
AND I SAID REMEMBER THE VISIT
TO MR. MR. HOOVER'S OFFICE

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:18.820
WHERE WE MET VIVIAN VANCE.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.680
AND I SAID, DO YOU THINK IT WAS ODD

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.380
THAT MR. HOOVER WASN'T
IN THE OFFICE?

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:34.990
PUT A CURLY FRIGHT WIG ON
MR. HOOVER, IT'S MR. MERTZ.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:44.030
WOW. SO I WROTE ABOUT THIS.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:48.600
I THINK IT WAS IN RULES.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.710
AND THE CHECKER HAD TO
GO THROUGH EVERYTHING.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.770
AND WHEN I GOT TO THE STORY.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:02.770
THEY CONTACTED VIVIAN VANCE'S TWO
BIOGRAPHERS AND THEY KNEW NOTHING

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.520
ABOUT A VISIT TO THE FBI.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.970
AND THEN THEY CHECKED THE
VISITOR LOGS OF THE FBI.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.670
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, MY GOSH.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:12.750
THAT IS SOME WASHINGTON FOOTNOTE.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.030
WOW.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:23.270
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: BUT IF VIVIAN
VANCE WERE STILL ALIVE AND WERE

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.710
TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE,
THERE WOULD STILL BE NO RECORD.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.010
[APPLAUSE].

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:37.710
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, WE HAVE
A QUESTION RIGHT HERE.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.010
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: HI.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.870
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HI.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.390
I'M JENNIFER.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.580
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT
YOU SEE CELEBRITIES

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.420
THAT ARE JUST PEOPLE
TODAY, THAT WE WEAR,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.840
THAT IS YOUR LEAST FAVORITE TREND?

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.230
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WHAT IS
MY LEAST FAVORITE?

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.550
AUDIENCE MEMBER: TREND.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.370
TREND TODAY.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.670
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, MY GOD.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.360
I'M GOING TO OFFEND SOME PEOPLE.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.120
CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION?

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.930
WHEN DID THE LEGGING BECOME A PANT?

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.230
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:18.190
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:20.480
YOU KNOW IT'S A CLASSIC
MONKEY HOUSE ITEM.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.780
YOU KNOW IT IS.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.270
I CAN'T GO OUT WEARING THESE.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.540
AND 30 MINUTES LATER, I LOOK HOT.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:35.770
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.570
IT'S A FORM OF UNDER GARMENT.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:42.530
WEAR IT UNDER A TUNIC OR A
PAIR OF SHORTS OR A DRESS.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.880
IT'S NOT A PANT.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.160
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YOU HEARD IT
HERE FIRST WASHINGTON, D.C.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: REALLY.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.340
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OKAY WE
HAVE ONE RIGHT UP HERE.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.740
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HI.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.010
SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES
ON PROJECT RUNWAY SEEM

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.860
TO BE RUN BY THE SPONSORS.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.160
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, THEY ARE.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.920
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HAVE
YOU EVER GOTTEN ONE

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.800
THAT YOU WERE JUST DISGUSTED BY?

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.470
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: YES, BUT FORTUNATELY
WE -- THE SPONSOR GOES AWAY.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.830
BECAUSE HEIDI AND I
SAY WE WON'T DO IT.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.130
WE WON'T DO IT.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:19.470
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, THE ONES
THAT YOU DO SEE ARE MODIFIED

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.780
AND MITIGATED IN SUCH A WAY
THAT THEY ACTUALLY AT LEAST,

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.580
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, WORK.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.140
ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME EXCEPTIONS.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:36.660
YEAH. I MEAN THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
HEIDI AND I WERE SUPPOSED TO DRESS

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.420
UP AS DETERGENT BOTTLES
AND PRESENT A CHALLENGE.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.610
IF WE DO IT, DO IT
IN LA AND WE'LL GO

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.990
ON "LET'S MAKE A DEAL"
OR DO IT ON HALLOWEEN.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:52.140
WE COULDN'T DO THE SHOWS
WITHOUT THE SPONSORS.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.750
WE HAVE SUCH A SLIM BUDGET.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.150
THERE WOULD BE NO SHOW.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.330
WE DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH IT.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.630
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: GREAT.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.550
A QUESTION RIGHT HERE.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.000
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HI, TIM GUNN.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.490
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:09.790
I'M SORRY.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:14.380 position:56%
I WANT TO KNOW WHO YOUR FAVORITE
LOOK WAS AT THE MET GALA LAST NIGHT.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.130
AND WHAT YOUR FAVORITE
BAR IN D.C. IS?

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:28.020
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: LAST NIGHT.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:37.810 position:56%
WELL, I MEAN, HONORING IT'S REALLY A
LICENSE TO WEAR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.730
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DID.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.510
I TENDED -- I MEAN, PERSONALLY.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.330
I'M AN OLD DUDDY.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.340
I LIKE THE LOOKS.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.430
I THOUGHT JENNIFER
LOPEZ LOOKED FANTASTIC.

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:59.070
BUT WAS SHE OUT OF STEP WITH
THE THEME OF WHAT THE SHOW WAS?

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.700
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT PERMITTED
TO ATTEND THE GALA.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.340
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.660
BECAUSE THE HOSTESS
AND I ARE ARCH ENEMIES.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.960
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:19.020
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.630
DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS STORY?

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.870
IT WAS AN OUTCOME OF TRUTH TELLING.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.480
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, MY GOSH.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.780
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.950
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, DEAR.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.250
YES.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.430
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I WAS BEING INTERVIEWED
BY ROBERT YORK AT THE NEW YORK POST

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:40.500
FOR A COVER STORY THEY WERE
DOING CORRESPONDING TO A PREMIERE

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.110
OF PROJECT RUNWAY, A NEW
SEASON OF PROJECT RUNWAY.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:47.070
AND HE ASKED ME, WHAT IS
THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE THING

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.740
THAT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN FASHION.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.190
AND HE SAID, I DON'T MEAN
AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.900
BUT SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.050
AND I SAID OH, THAT'S EASY.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:59.140
I SAID I WAS WATCHING ANNA WINTOR
BEING CARRIED DOWN FIVE FLIGHTS

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.820
OF STAIRS FROM HER FASHION SHOW.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.120
JUST THE FACTS.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.830
NO EDITORIALIZING.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.880
JUST THE FACTS.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.570
CAME OUT ON SUNDAY OF COURSE.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.700
AND IT WAS A LITTLE BOX.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.740
AND I WAS TEACHING THE
FOLLOWING MONDAY MORNING.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.180
I GET BACK TO MY OFFICE.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.900
SO THIS IS PARSON'S OF COURSE.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:29.520
AND I WISH I CAN RECREATE
MY EXPRESSION AND MOVEMENTS.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.790
THERE WAS A WHILE YOU WERE
OUT LITTLE POST-IT THING

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:38.110
THAT WAS ALSO LIKE OLD DINOSAURS.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:39.780
ANNA WINTOR'S OFFICE CALLED.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.080
PLEASE RETURN.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:47.560
WELL, I WAS -- I THINK
EVERYTHING OPENED.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.240
SO I CALLED.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.160
ACTUALLY I DIDN'T CALL RIGHT AWAY.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.790
I THOUGHT, WHEN WILL SHE
PROBABLY BE AT LUNCH?

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:02.950
YEAH, SO INTUITIVELY, I THOUGHT .

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:05.910
SO I CALLED.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:07.950
AND SHE WAS AT LUNCH.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.530
SO I THOUGHT OKAY.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:10.830
DEED DONE.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:17.570
HOWEVER, SOMEONE ELSE PICKED
UP THE PHONE AFTER BEING

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:19.810
ON HOLD FOR A FEW SECONDS.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:21.110
NAMED PATRICK MCCONNEL.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.530
HE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF
COMMUNICATIONS FOR VOGUE.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:28.110
AND HE SAID MS. WINTOR
DEMANDS A RETRACTION.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:32.030
OF WHAT, I ASKED.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:35.540
SHE DEMANDS THAT YOU CALL THE POST
AND HAVE THEM PRINT A RETRACTION.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.220
AND I SAID, THAT WOULD
IMPLY IT'S NOT TRUE.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.880
I SAID IT IS TRUE.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.180
AND THIS HAPPENED.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.480
AND I KEEP A DIARY.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.780
IT WAS SEPTEMBER 12TH.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:48.230
THE METROPOLITAN FIDDLING.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.630
I WAS ON THE FLOOR.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:58.250
AND THE METROPOLITAN IS AN
OLD INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.890
IT'S ONE BIG FREIGHT ELEVATOR.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:07.960
AND MS. WINTOR WILL NOT RIDE
IN AN ELEVATOR AND ALONE

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.780
WITH HER SECURITY DETAIL.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:17.090
SO WE WERE -- MY COLLEAGUES
AND I WERE GOING TO THE SHOW

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.970
AND SPECULATING NOT
HOW SHE WOULD ARRIVE,

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:22.690
THAT CAN BE EASY FACILITATED.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:23.990
GET HER IN ALONE.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.290
GET HER OUT.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.680
BUT HOW SHE WOULD DESCEND.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.420
BECAUSE IT'S A FRANTIC MAD RUSH.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.700
YOU GOT TO LEAVE THAT LOCATION.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.830
AND GET TO THE NEXT
LOCATION FOR THE NEXT SHOW.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:37.770
SO WE WERE STANDING.

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.710
ALWAYS HAPPY TO STAND
AT A FASHION SHOW.

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:42.910
OR WE WERE DIRECTLY
OPPOSITE ANNA WINTOR

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.990
AND HAD TWO HUGE BODY
GUARDS INSIDE OF HER.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:53.030
AND THOUGHT, WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN THE LIGHTS COME ON.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:56.420
WELL, WE RAN OUT BEHIND THEM.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.170
AND THERE WAS A BIG
GIANT OPEN STAIRCASE.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.500
AGAIN, A BIG INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.050
AND THE TWO SECURITY PEOPLE
MADE A FIRE MAN'S LOCK.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.550
AND SHE SAT IN IT.

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.540
AND THEY WOOSHED HER
DOWN THE STAIRS.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:14.160
SO I RAN TO THE WINDOW, TO
SEE WHETHER THEY WOULD PUT HER

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.620
DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK
OR TAKE HER TO THE CAR.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:27.190
THEY TOOK HER TO THE CAR.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:30.530
DOWN 18TH STREET THEY WENT.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.780
I DIDN'T SAY ANY OF THAT.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.040
HAD IT IN MY DIARY,
ALL OF THE INFORMATION

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.550
THAT I GAVE WITH PATRICK MCCONNEL.

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:42.410
OH, DEAR, OH, DEAR, OH, DEAR.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.880
SO GOOD DAY, PATRICK.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.180
[LAUGHTER].

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:48.790
TUESDAY HE CALLS.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:59.550
HE CALLS. AND HE SAID,
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:08.150
HE SAID, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MS.
WINTOR KNOWS HOW TO WORK A MANOLO.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.800
WHAT? SHE COULD TAKE THOSE STAIRS.

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.840
LOOK, I KNOW MS. WINTOR
KNOWS HOW TO WORK A MANOLO.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.640
IT WASN'T WHETHER SHE
CAN WALK DOWN THE STAIRS.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.600
IT'S ABOUT SPEED.

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.400
THESE GUYS AND THEIR FLAT SECURITY
SHOES WERE BEING MUCH FASTER

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.550
THAN SHE WOULD HAVE EVER
GONE IN THE MANOLOS.

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:31.860
ONCE AGAIN, OH, DEAR.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:39.480
OH, DEAR. SO THE FOLLOWING DAY,
HE CALLS AND HE SAYS ALL RIGHT.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.550 position:56%
WE HAVE TO GET THE LAWYERS INVOLVED.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.150
AND I SAID, GOOD.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:47.020
BECAUSE THIS MEANS WE
CAN'T TALK ANYMORE.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.420
SO THEN, YOU'RE GOING TO
LOVE THIS PART EVEN MORE.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:01.060
A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO I HAD AN
APPOINTMENT WITH IN MY OFFICE,

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.650
CAME AND LOOKED AT ME AND
SAID YOU LOOK HORRIBLE.

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:04.950
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.520
AND SO I TOLD HIM THE STORY.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.610
AND HE SAID, I WAS THERE.

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:12.430
I SAW IT. HE PICKED UP THE PHONE.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:14.980
HE CALLED PATRICK AND
HE SAID IT'S SO AND SO.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.490
AND HERE IS THE PART
THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE.

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.930
I CAN'T SAY SO AND
SO'S NAME ANYMORE.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:24.600
BECAUSE BY AN ATTORNEY, ANNA
WINTOR THREATENED HIS JOB

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.820 position:56%
BECAUSE OF THIS ASSOCIATION WITH ME.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.150
BUT ANYWAY, HE SAVED ME.

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.810
SO HE SAID, I WAS THERE.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:36.680
I SAW IT. AND OF COURSES
THERE WERE PROBABLY 100 PEOPLE

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.980
WHO -- WELL PROBABLY NOT.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.330
THERE WERE PROBABLY 50 OF US
GATHERED AROUND THE STAIRWELL.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:43.540
BUT SHE INSTILLED SUCH
FEAR IN PEOPLE

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.060
THAT NO ONE WOULD SAY ANYTHING.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.730
WELL YES, SHE DOES SCARE ME.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:52.350
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.460
I CALLED THE FLOREST THAT I USED.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:57:00.810
AND I SAID I WANT AN ENORMOUSLY
STAGGERING BEAUTIFUL ALL WHITE

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:03.830
ARRANGEMENT SENT TO MS. WINTOR.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.720
AND I WROTE MY OWN NOTE.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.890
TOOK IT TO THE FLORIST
TO ACCOMPANY THIS.

00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:11.680
AND THOUGHT, OKAY.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.980
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:18.930
HOWEVER, I HAD A SECRET EMBEDDED
MESSAGE IN THE WHITE FLOWERS.

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:23.540
HERE IN WESTERN CULTURE
IT MEANS PEACE.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.840
BUT IN ASIAN CULTURES
IT MEANS DEATH.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.140
[LAUGHTER].

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:39.220
GOT IT. HOW DID WE GET
OFF ON THIS TANGENT?

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.520
ANYWAY --

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.400
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I DON'T
THINK WE WILL TOP THAT.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.930
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: OH, THE GALA.

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.630
I WAS INVITED.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:51.970
WHEN LIZ CLAIREBORNE, MY
BOSS OR CEO INVITED ME.

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:56.260
THE FIRST YEAR, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.750
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:01.410
I BUY A TABLE EVERY YEAR.

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:02.780
AND COME WITH ME.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:07.300
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN
HIS LEGS HE CAME TO ME

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.730
AND SAID SORRY YOU
HAVE BEEN UNINVITED.

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:13.290
AND SHE GOES THROUGH THAT LIST.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:15.340
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THAT THING ANYWAY.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.720
WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND QUESTION?

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:25.040
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: WE HAVE
ONE LAST QUESTION.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.960
AUDIENCE MEMBER: HI,
WOW, THAT'S LOUD.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.900
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE
CHALLENGE ON PROJECT RUNWAY?

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.870
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I HAVE TO SAY
IT'S VERY SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:43.740
SEASON 1 CHALLENGE 1 WHEN WE HAD
TO GO TO THE HIGH END FABRIC STORE

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.890 position:56%
AND WE TOOK THEM TO A GROCERY STORE.

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:48.740
AND WE SAID OKAY.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.290
HERE IS YOUR MONEY.

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.890
SHOP FOR ALL OF THESE
UNCONVENTIONAL MATERIALS.

00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:55.930
IT DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE SHOW.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:59.510
BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS
WITH AUSTIN SCARLET WHO WON

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:04.110
THAT CHALLENGE WITH THE
INCREDIBLE CORN HUSK DRESS.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.930
IT WAS STAGGERING.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:11.040
HE HAD A SHOPPING CART
FILLED WITH CORN.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:15.080
AND ON TOP OF IT WERE ALL OF
THESE BAGS OF POTATO CHIPS.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.250
I SAID, I UNDERSTAND THE CORN.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:23.310
BUT WHAT ARE THE POTATO CHIPS FOR?

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:34.070
AND HE SAID FOR THE BUS RIDE HOME.

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.370
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:47.820
ARE FABULOUS.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.060
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THANK YOU.

00:59:54.060 --> 01:00:02.250
