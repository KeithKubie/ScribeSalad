00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.080
Before we dive into techniques to add context to our visualization, and see how

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.530
to create a narrative around our data, I wanted to take a step back and first go

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.110
over some approaches traditional journalism takes when treating its stories.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.210
Nate Silver, of blog FiveThirtyEight fame, who correctly predicted all 50 states

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.130
in the 2012 presidential election, describes approaches to journalism,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.720
with the following spectrum, in opening post of the new relaunch of his blog.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.140
Nate sees journalism as neither wholly quantitive or qualitative.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.550
When talking about approaches to journalism,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.690
it's not a binary categorization to him.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.660
Rather than being either quantitative or

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.230
qualitative, he sees it as more of a spectrum.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.780
Numbers without context is just as meaningless as words

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.489
without numbers, and you need both to create effective data stories.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.750
And Nate actually goes one step further, and labels each of the quadrants.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.470
The upper left is where organizations like 538 stand, that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.200
produce very rigorous and empirical articles based on some quantitative data.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.700
When talking about the upper right quadrant,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.410
I'm referring to the traditional articles.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.150
That the Washington Post or the New York Times might put out, that have

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.560
extensive research backing the qualitative story they're trying to tell and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.680
narrative, but may not necessarily contain charts, interactive graphics, or

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.590
some data collection or experiment they're testing.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.891
But, as I mentioned earlier, the quantitative and qualitative divide

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.560
isn't necessarily as black and white as I might have drawn it in this graphic.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.794
And organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times do

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:57.556
have very data driven articles and interactive graphics just like 538.

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:01.890
I publish more qualitative articles in line with traditional journalism.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.610
The bottom of this chart, the bottom left and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.520
the bottom right quadrants, Nate doesn't think too highly of.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.675
The reason being that the bottom half of this graphic represents anecdotal and

00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:17.090
ad-hoc stories.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.010
The bottom left here, might represent sports writers or

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.020
other journalists, who take numbers and statistics out of context and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.080
don't have the rigorous research to back them and verify their facts.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.810
And finally the bottom-right quadrant is reserved for op-ed columnists and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.860
pundits who disseminate solely their opinions, without any research,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.110
data, or hard facts to back up their claims.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.650
In this class, we will focus on the upper-left quadrant and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.280
techniques that organizations like 538 take when writing their articles and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.080
crafting their narratives.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.110
In this lesson, we will try to create a compelling data

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.120
narrative around the history of the World Cup.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.610
Using quantitative facts and data to support our claims to convey potentially

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.322
some qualitative or subjective view of the World Cup, but before we go farther,

00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:18.060
I want to expand on this idea of the upper left quadrant of quantitative and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.210
rigorous analysis in the context not only of journalism, but

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.050
how it tied into data science as a whole.
