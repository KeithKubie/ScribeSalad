1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,070
I get the painful ones, bro. Yeah. What's
that? What's that like the time, size,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,190
tissue, deep tissue. Should I lower
this? Whatever you want. No, whatever.

3
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:09,270
Whatever feels comfortable for you.

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,330
But it's pretty good at picking up
your voice. You just want to know,

5
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,350
you don't want to have it that low.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,470
You definitely want to have it in front
of your face. Okay. It's like a radio one.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,260
It's not a stage one.
So like it's a sideways Mike.

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,590
If you see it like the Mike is in. Oh
yeah, I just go. This is how I do it.

9
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:24,170
I have this like right in
front of my face. Okay.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,930
Plus people don't get to see as much
of my face. It makes me, me staring.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,390
I like it when I used to sit there
used to hide behind it. Like, like hey,

12
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:34,410
I'm half robot. Half man. All right,
let's do this. Three, two, one

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,170
popping [inaudible] when we drink we do
[inaudible] three six [inaudible] six

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,750
six [inaudible] me now wait,

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,290
wait.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,800
Give me that Christmas Day ladies
love my staff table cabled.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,833
Wow.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,950
Been that drought that can meet two more
bottles. Cause you know we don't say

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,273
drinking.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
I,
I'm like the truck.

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Please drink

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,640
like three six,

23
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,630
six g,
g,

24
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,783
G.

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,130
I think the g six is a jet. Okay. You
think as a jet or think so. All right.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
I'm a fucking retard. I
always think apple like, oh,

27
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:10,480
they got any make g six
these are way above the game.

28
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,300
They sound like they're falling. They
sound like they're born, right? Yeah.

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,460
They've got a bunch of
girls that are sober,

30
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,710
but they're pretending to be drunk so
they can fuck. Yeah. Okay. That ball,

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,200
that starts,
that's when you're out of control.

32
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:23,520
When people are pretending they need an
excuse to fuck you. Yes. All right. Yes.

33
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,810
That's what's going on. Speaking with
the excuse. Excuses the fuck you.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,350
Michelle's sponsored by the flashlight.
Ladies and gentlemen, last slide.

35
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,570
If you go to Joe rogan.net
and you click on the link,

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,870
it'll take you to the fleshlight
website and they give you 15% off.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,610
What's a flashlight? A flashlight is,
this one is an alien version. By the way.

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,440
Our guest is little Esther and Esther
is a very funny standup comedian here in

39
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:47,890
Los Angeles, California. And uh,
she's our first female guest ever,

40
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:52,090
ladies and gentlemen. So how about a round
of applause? 50th episode? Yeah. Also,

41
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:55,600
this is our 50th episode and we, we, you
know, we just never found a girl worthy.

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,270
But you're here, you're
here. They're all worthy.

43
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,330
They just don't want to come
over. And, and not only that,

44
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,120
it's my house so I can't bring porn
stars over embers will usually do have

45
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:08,160
boards doors on, you know, well,
you know, you can do all you want.

46
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:12,430
It's just the issue is I have little
children that are girls want them being

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,370
really good friends with the porn star
and said, I want to do it in Maryland.

48
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:20,290
Does, you know she's obsessed with porn
star. She actually bought off of Ebay,

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,070
Jenna Jamison socks or something
like that. Sweater off of Ebay. Wow.

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,720
Did,

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,780
did it smell like jizz fairy
princess fairy princesses.

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,700
It was cute. She's a nice
person. I bet you could meet her.

53
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:40,330
If you ever went to the fcs
obsession with her.

54
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,530
What is the obsession like she does so
many things that I would not do and it's

55
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,310
just cool and exciting and she's pretty,
and she wrote a book that was good.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,790
You actually liked her book? I loved
her book. I've read it like three times.

57
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:59,140
I bought it in high school and I used
to have to put like a fake cover over it

58
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:03,800
so I could read it in high school. No one
know what I was reading. Whoa. Yeah. Um,

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,830
so was that like, like, like
inspiring to you or not?

60
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,210
I mean,
yeah.

61
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,990
When you say that she does like a lot
of things that you wouldn't do. Yeah.

62
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,040
Like she's important star. Um, and
she's just so different from me.

63
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,060
Like I'm like a little,
thank you Brian.

64
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:27,040
Brian just put a floppy dick and asters
lap that's from the ones they made them.

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,750
It's sort of a proof of concept device.

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,080
Like they didn't make it so that anyone
can use it obviously because it's too

67
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,140
soft and it wouldn't really be functional
unless you just into disappointment.

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,420
But, uh, they just wanted to show that
they could get this deck. It's very,

69
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,620
it's disturbing. You know, a lot of
it's circumcise too. Yeah, it's soft.

70
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,780
It's kind of crazy that the norm
is to cut a chunk of your dick off.

71
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,660
That's the norm.
If someone said this to me,

72
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,610
I don't remember who it was they're
talking about if he had a boy,

73
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,150
would you circumcise it? I
said, no. I said, it's, I think
it's ridiculous. I go, what?

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,760
You want to chop a piece
of skin off someone's Dick?

75
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,550
And it makes it less sensitive and
the whole deal. And he goes, yeah,

76
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,690
but it looks better.
That's what I saying.

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,850
It does look better, but I don't. Does
it really? No, really? I think so.

78
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,700
I don't know. I don't know. I don't get
it. Have you had both? No, I haven't. Oh,

79
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,290
have you seen the other one
in person? No, not in person.

80
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,220
I think when it's soft, yeah.
It looks very animal like, yeah.

81
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,570
When it's soft, it's like the skins
over it. It's like an elephant Dick.

82
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:31,690
It's just like, eh. I
never seen it soft. I whoa,

83
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,900
what the fuck are you talking about?
Get a rock hard. And while that's you,

84
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,370
you're just very sexy, circumcised men
around you. They can't help themselves.

85
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,450
It's um, it's a terrible thing. You're
chopping a Jew. I mean, people, Ooh,

86
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:47,680
it's hard gene. You know these
people in Africa, it's ridiculous.

87
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,640
It's not a hygiene issue.

88
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,560
I'm sort of against it because it's
to look tissue you sort of against it.

89
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,980
Yeah, because like, it's like
you said, it's cutting skin off.

90
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,970
That seems just wrong. It's not like
a, it's helps anything. You know?

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,950
It's not like he cut skin off and then
you could see behind your back like,

92
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,350
oh no god, I bought back there,
but this is an extra piece of skin.

93
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,050
Let's get rid of that skin. Dude, there's
an eyeball back here. This is crazy.

94
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,040
You don't believe in like having an
umbilical cord still like as grownup.

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,730
That's stupid. What? Well,
I mean, and you're like,

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,640
don't want to modify the body how it is,
you know,

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,590
that's not a good analogy at all. Terrible
knows you. That's all he ever does.

98
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,440
Dry Low fucking stuff in the conversation.

99
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,360
There's tracks put some silly nonsense,
but it's funny to get their haircut.

100
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,060
She doesn't, she gets angry and mad.
No, I just, I appreciate a good analogy.

101
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,850
So when a bad one is presented to me,
explain a good one.

102
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,680
Then that's also like that
like piercing your ears.

103
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,390
You're modifying your a little teeny piece
of your body, your skin Stenek thing.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,420
Well, so is the Dick thing?
Yeah. What else does it for you?

105
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,600
The issue is that it changes
the functionality of the penis.

106
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,450
You no longer like when the
four skin is over your penis,

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,000
your penis is much more
sensitive because it's protected.

108
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,140
Now your penis is all like calloused
and like tired out role and against your

109
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,290
underwear and it's rubbing
against your leg. It's like, it's,

110
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,270
the tip part is really supposed to be
protected by skin so that it makes it even

111
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,104
more sensitive.

112
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,680
So you'd have way more problems
with premature ejaculation
apparently because it

113
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,430
will just feel better. It was as good as
it feels now. It feel even crazy better.

114
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,760
You know, people who go to wounded to
feel better, but that's ridiculous.

115
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,040
Why would I want more sensitivity?
You know,

116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,090
we'd like to talk about penises and
show it's good. I forgot to warn you.

117
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,950
I get to talk about
penises. So, yeah, right.

118
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,080
All my stand up is very clean. So
it was Jenna Jamison, the only, um,

119
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,090
you're not though. You're dirty, right?
Yes, you are clean. Are you kidding?

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,240
You're not dirty as in
like fuck, fuck, fuck.

121
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,940
But you're a dirty as in like
the subjects you bring up.

122
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,880
Abortion jokes are not really insults.

123
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,010
I like to install the abortion insult.

124
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,100
I like to insult hot women because
some of them are mean to me.

125
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,170
So. So you insult them with
abortion jokes? No. Well, okay.

126
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,720
Like people say that blondes
have more fun. That's fine.

127
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,900
I've never had to have an abortion.
So that's, that's the joke.

128
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,870
I've never had to have an abortion.
It is kind of a tricky thing.

129
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:18,590
If you really break it down as to what
it is. I mean you're, you, it's alive.

130
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,980
You know, it's, it's, it's inside your
body. You're hosting it and you know,

131
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,170
you get to terminate that
because it's inside your body.

132
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,610
You get to pull the trigger.
But whoa,

133
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:29,120
that's a crazy gray area because
it comes out, it becomes a person.

134
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,910
It's very strange. I mean I understand
why people would do it. I do as well,

135
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,200
honestly.
Cause I wouldn't,

136
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,560
I have nightmares about having children
and it's not happening, but it's,

137
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,400
I don't know,
just,

138
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,520
it's just basically saying that
one women are whores and I don't

139
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,070
particularly blondes. But Jenna
Jamison is a huge support. Like your,

140
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:55,030
your big idol. Well she
is, but I like, it's,

141
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm really just insulting

142
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,410
like the blonde, the, it's
not all the specific ones.

143
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,600
The ones that like are mean to me and
like picked on me in high school. Um,

144
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,860
what did they used to do here?

145
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,980
Like throw like bloody tampons at you
when you walk down the hall and stuff. No,

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,650
I just did a pilot audition
where that happened to me. Okay.

147
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,980
Every audition I've ever been on,

148
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,810
the breakdowns are traumatizing cause I'm
listed as unattractive and like Chubby.

149
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,423
But anyway,

150
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,780
yeah. So Michael, Charles, what these
boots, before you go anywhere with this,

151
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,280
obviously something happened.
So tell us what,

152
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,560
what these guys did to you that makes
you want to bring them up specifically?

153
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,550
Um,
nothing really.

154
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:38,551
I just think that sometimes like you go
out and you see like the hot chicks that

155
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,740
like wear mini skirts and
tons of makeup and like I'm,

156
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,510
when I'm ever in their vicinity,

157
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:47,890
like I'm like this like in jeans and a
tee shirt and sneakers and I feel like

158
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,590
they like look at me
and think I'm retarded.

159
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,021
Okay.

160
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,690
But are they actually doing anything
to you or are they just looking hot and

161
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,524
you're getting Yang?

162
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,500
Um, they're just looking hot and
I get angry. Whoa. No weird. No,

163
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,080
they're mean to me. They're mean
to you. Okay, let's go there. Um,

164
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,080
do they mean to you? Okay,
well one I used to go to,

165
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,310
like I would go to movies and people
would follow me into the movie theater and

166
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,460
like yell things at me. Like they
were meeting, like I was picked on,

167
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,360
like what you face stinky farts.
Like Esther, the molester,

168
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,020
he molested girls that you knew. Um, yeah,

169
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,610
I think people just picked on me because
I like was a nerd. Is that normal?

170
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,410
Yes. That's normal. Yeah. Yeah, but it's
just those kinds that you grew up with.

171
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,250
It's really all blocked me.
I believe it.

172
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:37,310
I love how I have a blog that's called
Esther with hot chicks.com and I just

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,460
take pictures with hot people and
talk about them. Really? Yeah.

174
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,430
One of the pictures is me and
Brittany Murphy, his grave site.

175
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,910
It was great. It's just the pitcher
for, and there's like this like this,

176
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,910
like square of flowers on the ground
and she's just sitting there like, yeah,

177
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,970
I like it. I love it. Don't get
me wrong. I love attractive women.

178
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:58,000
Like I'm obsessed with them to the
point of like, I could be a lesbian,

179
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,710
but there's someone's that I just,
they get me mad and I don't like them,

180
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,220
so I want to say mean things about them.
Like if they, it basically this started,

181
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,370
we can also too, because I get heckled
a lot by hot chicks and they're like,

182
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,520
you're a Dork. And like I just
come back at them like, no,

183
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,620
you're a disgusting,

184
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:17,560
filthy whore and no one likes you and
I'm not gonna listen to you because I'm

185
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,000
not interested in having sex with you.

186
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,810
Wow. So they're, they're, they're
tricks don't work on you there.

187
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm not a psychologist.
I might think you have an issue.

188
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,420
I don't have an issue. Might be
an issue here. It seems like,

189
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,230
it certainly seems like it's an
issue. What's the issue? Well,

190
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:38,040
I mean you've got an anger towards a
very specific group of the part of the

191
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,630
population. Girls that are
attractive. No, I don't. I like them.

192
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,150
We did them with clients with
assholes. Is that wrong? But yeah,

193
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,030
because you made it attractive.
Like they're attractive and their cons.

194
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,250
So it's really like what it
is is like being attractive.

195
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,830
They have this extra gift that you wish
you had. Like they're, they're hotter,

196
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,670
they're in the group. And then the current
part is like, well, they're just cuts,

197
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,060
plea. You've thrown it all together.
Just the fact that they're attractive,

198
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,150
it's really, doesn't mean
anything. They're just assholes.

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,760
If they're hot and they're
nice, they're great. I,

200
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,680
but I think that Alpha hot woman is mean.

201
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,000
It's like the biggest disservice to the
world because you're not representing

202
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,700
duty. But yeah, but, but
you see what I'm saying?

203
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,710
Like you don't necessarily have to lump
in hot along with cont just so happens

204
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,730
that they're hot, but the real issue, is
that correct? Yeah. And that's your enemy.

205
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,710
It's the clients.
It's not hot girls.

206
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,980
Sometimes people like to see
the nerdy Jew girl attack.

207
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,300
They'd like to know that I'm
attacking the hot women. Right, right.

208
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,410
But if you do it for no reason,

209
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:43,120
it's one thing as you're attacking
me for no reason. Absolutely. Okay.

210
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,480
But it seems like you have a reason
that maybe they might not be involved in

211
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:49,770
personally, we might be a
reason. It's like you're,

212
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:53,320
you're going back to four years ago.
They're in the moment and they're like,

213
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:57,190
what the fuck is this chick screaming
at me for just cause I'm hot? No,

214
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,430
cause they're conti. They're just
[inaudible] know what I'm saying.

215
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,750
It's like what the, the
hot part is irrelevant. It
doesn't mean anything. Well,

216
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,930
it just makes it worse because not
only are they acting a certain way,

217
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,320
they're getting treated a
certain way cause they're hot.

218
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,600
Ultimate enemy to a girl probably is
a hot chick. That is also a kind of,

219
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,750
so really the problem was weak dudes that
are willing to treat hot chicks and in

220
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:24,400
a superior way. Right. There's
through really problem. Of
course you understand it.

221
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,440
They're like hot chicks
are like super celebrities.

222
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,810
Literally if I go into like
a really pretty girl, like
wearing like a hot outfit,

223
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,110
I just look at her like she's a
princess and like want to talk to her.

224
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,280
If she's nice then so you have
this love hate thing going on.

225
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,320
Very strong and I just don't know yet.
Have you made out withdrawals and stuff?

226
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,790
Um,
yes.

227
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,791
My Freshman Year of high school I kind
of see that fluff site real quick video

228
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,110
tape with two other girls
in my high school though of
us making out and touching

229
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:59,440
each other's boobs and it
made us very popular. Wow.

230
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:03,360
So you guys released it
online or have it? Uh, I do.

231
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,330
I don't know how to play it cause
it's not like an old, totally,

232
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:09,700
you just need the cables.
Brian knows how to get it online.

233
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,370
But it's also illegal because I
was 13. No, no, no. We can put cat,

234
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:17,180
the cat faces on the heads.
They'll never know. You know,

235
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,010
that's a tricky thing man.
You can't really, if they
could prove that she was 15,

236
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,740
you know how dangerous that is.
Girls are getting arrested.

237
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:27,040
High school girls are getting arrested
because they send boys pictures of their

238
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:31,180
Posey and that's child
pornography. So this woman, yeah,

239
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,670
and I mean it's sexting. That's
what everyone's calling it. Sexting.

240
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,500
But the courts are calling
the child pornography. Right.
It's a cute name to use.

241
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,260
So it doesn't sound like they're sending
child pornography. Yeah. This one girl,

242
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,650
um,

243
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,240
she's 15 years old and they arrested her
for child pornography because she sent

244
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:49,480
some boys pictures of her pussy and then
he sent them to everybody and she was

245
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:53,090
obviously the source. So, and they all
got, everyone was in trouble and so they,

246
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,710
they wound up like taking it to court
and they moved it. They changed the,

247
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:01,920
the charge to possession of
criminal tools. Oh my God.

248
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,750
So instead of child pornography,
possession of criminal
tools, because her phone,

249
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,220
her cell phone was a tool for crime cause
she took a picture of her pussy with

250
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:13,130
her cell phone. Like man,
we need some new laws.

251
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,900
Like we need some new laws to catch
up with 2010 and this technology,

252
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:22,070
because we're using like fucking smoke
signals and you know, the, the, the,

253
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,870
you know, the, the, the Pony Express.

254
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,580
I mean we're using that kind of technology
to deal with kids. You know, you,

255
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,270
if we're in an area where kids have
phones and the phones have cameras,

256
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,910
they're going to take pictures of their
assholes. They just get to do everything.

257
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,890
They're going to take pictures of
everything they can. They're kids.

258
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:40,160
They're curious. They're more likely to
do if they know they're not supposed to.

259
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,390
They don't have any willpower.

260
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:46,370
They don't know that things are gross
or embarrassing or shocking or, yeah,

261
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:51,080
they make terrible choices. We need
some laws, man. They need some new laws.

262
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,990
He's still film yourself like a lot nick,
by yourself.

263
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,100
Do you ever want to be a porn star?
No.

264
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:01,190
I think when I was younger I was like
that a little bit and then I sort of went

265
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:06,160
through like a transition of
liking stand up comedy so,

266
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:08,880
well, how'd you get into San
Diego? Porn lays just the message.

267
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,840
They go together a lot,
like of like same Tripoli's Nice.

268
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:16,250
Show it the porn mixed with comedy.
It just seems like like salt and pepper.

269
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,010
It just seems like they're supposed to go
together for some take two go together.

270
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,251
Well,

271
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:22,520
because it's like you can't take yourself
too seriously with either one of them.

272
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,580
Right. You know, and you're looked down
upon by a lot of people to, you know,

273
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,540
like mentally disturbed
to do both. Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,140
The reason why you get into all of them
is there's a deficit. There is always a,

275
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:37,220
an unusual need for attention is either
touched by your mother or a hit by your

276
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,790
father. What's, and it
doesn't necessarily,

277
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,570
I've actually met comics that have good
families. They're just, they're funny.

278
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,360
Yeah.
Porn stars are having,

279
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,780
I've never met a porn star that
doesn't come from some chaos. Right.

280
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,560
Have you ever seen that?

281
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,600
What's that one porn star that's a
dad is like the porn star manager. Uh,

282
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,120
have you seen that? It was like on
that HBO show. Uh, I did see that.

283
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't remember her name. I feel like
it's sunny lane. No. Is it sunny lane?

284
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,650
Maybe funny lane is that,
it might be Google that shit real quick.

285
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,680
But it was the most disturbing
thing if you haven't seen it.

286
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,720
She was on the show with her parents
who manage her porn career and they were

287
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,240
talking about terrific.
It is, it's so awesome.

288
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:20,900
Like she won the number one video
of the year. That's our daughter.

289
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,860
They're all like all excited and shit.
It was like, it was so twisted and weird.

290
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,960
And then she wound up working as a whore
and a brothel and the dad was talking

291
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,530
about the brothel. Like wow. They give
up, they feed them, they give them food.

292
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,840
I saw that it was clean.
Like whoa,

293
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:38,870
truckers can just come in there
and fuck your little baby's mouth.

294
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,980
And that's not weird to you.

295
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,340
All they have to do is come up with
150 bucks or whatever it costs.

296
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:47,110
They can fuck your baby's mouth and you're
happy about it. Yeah. Wildly feeder.

297
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,880
They feed it.
They feed

298
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,430
sick Jack all day. Yeah.
It was a very disturbing,

299
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:58,200
but I think any kid that comes from
that background, you know, you're just,

300
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,980
you know, that's your parents
probably your foot, your
shit's going to fall. This.

301
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,843
Yeah.

302
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,320
Any chick that comes from that
background is just fuck man.

303
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,350
What chance do you have? I mean, you
know, that's the one thing that I see.

304
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:14,700
So clearly having babies,
you see how you behave with them and how,

305
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,940
you know you can influence their
behavior and calm them down and put them,

306
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,640
get them to think about things like
explain things to them. You know,

307
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,610
we don't do this because if we do this
then it's going to hurt other people's

308
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,160
feelings. And then you
have them repeat it. Yeah,

309
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,710
we're going to hurt other people's
feelings. So we don't want to do that.

310
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:30,930
And she'll stop herself and
say things like that to me.

311
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,370
So it's like her mind is off in the
right direction. But if you're, if that,

312
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,160
if that's your mom or you know, if that's
your dad, you're gonna act one way.

313
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,620
But if your dad is like
you stupid fucking content,

314
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,230
you're just like your mother and then also
your and your two and you're like, oh,

315
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,910
I don't think that that's not happening.
I mean people are out there.

316
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,270
There's a story I read. It
was a heartbreaking story.
A guy who is with his, uh,

317
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,080
his girlfriend's baby and it wasn't
his baby. The baby was two years old.

318
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:59,100
He beat it to death two years old.
So I don't think that,

319
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:01,290
I mean 90,
I think in my opinion,

320
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,970
99% of all the problems that we have
in our society is the way people are

321
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:09,180
raised. 99%. Totally
agree. People raising,

322
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,460
get the fuck Outta here with this. Who is
calling me during the podcast? How rude.

323
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,330
One robot voice. My mom, she heard I
was talking about her cause from Dhl.

324
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Joe Has not paying attention to the
positives. I can fuck what the fuck.

325
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:27,300
Cock soccer,
I'm calling put me online.

326
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,090
You don't got the technology
Brian and get that shit together.

327
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:34,360
Come on Cock sucker. I want to be
able to call in. I got questions. Um,

328
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,830
99% in my opinion.
I mean that's a fake number.

329
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:40,570
I just pulled it out
of my ass as a a good,

330
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,240
a good chunk of the reason we're fucked.
It's because the way people raise kids,

331
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,780
you know,
no one is raising kids to,

332
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,140
to look at the entire human race as one
giant organism and just to be as cool as

333
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:55,290
possible and make as many
positive connections as possible.

334
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,280
We're all raising kids to fucking go out
there and compete and go kick ass and

335
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,530
be the best to make money and get
ahead and then what Di, you know,

336
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,460
fuck we're,

337
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,810
we're messing it all up or we're not
enjoying the time here and now we have,

338
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,510
we have all this fucking
cool shit going on in,

339
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,970
in this country and everybody's
pissed off about the future.

340
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,590
It was sunny lane by the way,
that they like show her parents packet.

341
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,390
They show parents, her
parents packing, uh,

342
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,520
for her like putting clothes inside thing,
her suitcase,

343
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,970
there's your toothbrush
and here's your ass cream.

344
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,570
I watched one of reports after
that and I felt so dirty.

345
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,240
I felt like I shouldn't
have been watching it.

346
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,450
Like I was like her counselor or something
like that and I was watching her porn,

347
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,130
you know.
You know what I'm saying?

348
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,250
Like I felt like I knew she
was fucked up then. You know,

349
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:48,010
I knew there was just a lot, a lot of
issues. And then I watched this video and

350
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm like yeah what am I doing my watching
her suck someone's Dick for gross as

351
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,870
so die and or yeah,

352
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,880
yeah you said d the amp varied rap band
for for those who don't know it's from

353
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:05,360
South Africa. I think though the American
way of saying it. Cause even Jim Kim,

354
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,840
Jimmy Kimmel said die Antwoord
or something like that.

355
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:10,160
He didn't say it like all
weird and I think this is,

356
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:13,430
there's like an American way to say it
and maybe he just fucked up cause they

357
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:17,350
provide, I pre, pre told don and then
he went and checked on it and yeah.

358
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,410
And they all said at the same way.
Hmm.

359
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,790
Guy From South Africa told me
was Deann Vert Danford whose DNV?

360
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,910
[inaudible] well let's,
let's listen to Ninja say it.

361
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,910
Put on that Ziff side video and listened
to him. So, all right. Have you,

362
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,580
are you familiar with them? Asked her.
Um, I've heard a little bit. I'm obsessed.

363
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm obsessed with them because they're so,
it's a legitimate,

364
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,350
it's like in this world of like, I mean,
not zen, anything wrong with lady Gaga.

365
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,590
I think lady Gaga was very talented.
I really do. I know I like her.

366
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:46,720
I think she's talented. She's
got a great voice. She's hard.

367
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:50,290
She's got a killer body and she, you know,
she's out there making noise. I mean,

368
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:54,670
for, for whatever reason, but it's not
working on me. You know what I'm saying?

369
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,910
It's like, I see what you're doing.
I see that you're working at,

370
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,180
and I appreciate the mastery of,
you know,

371
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,340
working in controlling the media and
having all these people on your side and

372
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,650
lady Gaga doesn't work for you.
You don't like that.

373
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,960
So she's not saying shit to me.
It's all just,

374
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,800
you're singing songs and you're wearing
meat on your tits. And it's like, okay,

375
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,630
it's not legit to me. Listen, it's
not, what I'm saying is it's not,

376
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,860
it's not someone who is being,
it's not genuine to me,

377
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,630
these feeble, I like what they're doing
is like this fucking, first of all,

378
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:29,650
it's ugly. They look dirty.
They have fucked up hair.

379
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,940
This guys get the shittiest tattoos ever.
You know, he knows he's ugly as fuck.

380
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,450
You know what I mean? And he's ugly too.
That she's hot. She's hot, she's hot,

381
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,640
she's hot, but she has like
sort of an ugly face dude.

382
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:43,450
The girl you mean Lady
Gaga? Oh, Lady Gaga. Oh,

383
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,180
I thought you were talking about
Uilani. Oh No, I want to see her though.

384
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,280
I heard you guys saying that
she was, she's Hoxie. Yeah,

385
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,770
Lady Gaga has got a Funky mug.
But you know what,

386
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,380
that's why she's working so
hard. Yeah, she was hot as fuck.

387
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,370
She'd be like those kinds of the
club with no ambition. Exactly right.

388
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,770
That's why you have to be a little bit,
I appreciate it. I appreciate Lady Gaga.

389
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,750
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with her.

390
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,870
I mean it's not my kind of music. I,
there's a couple of songs that I enjoy,

391
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:09,490
but it's not, it's boring to me that
mum poker foods like just hocked deck.

392
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,960
This is, this is the real
shit. This is uh, this is um,

393
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,090
what's his name? Ninja that high
tech or whatever his name is.

394
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
Well just hit play.

395
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:24,400
This is DJ hoc deck that up the
mother fucking beat box dog.

396
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:27,970
I love the South African accent
to bring that next level shit.

397
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,840
That's what I'm talking about.
Checking out.

398
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Don't be [inaudible] Yo yo Yo pick up the,

399
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,990
I've got Bob, the name of Jay does
a mug insulating your brain locked

400
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,290
the static step Gulf,
the Three d graphics

401
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,990
scoping throwed off.
Strobing Mondo will sweat streaming.

402
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,680
Flash dreaming does feeling hot and deep
meanings break. When I say things like,

403
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,270
this chick in a dish today,
can I touch you for the end?

404
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,040
Where's it saying in it? It's in the
video. Are you playing the video?

405
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,883
Are you playing the,

406
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, okay, well do you don't have
it says the advert and they says,

407
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,090
what does that is the answer. Yeah. And
then he goes to answer to why audios,

408
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,940
whatever.
Actually I like lady Gaga Music.

409
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:28,120
I liked that song operator where she's
like telephone, where like, you know,

410
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,000
like it starts scrambling up in the song.

411
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:33,480
Just like if you were talking on his
cell phone. Yeah. Yeah. I like that.

412
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,150
I think that's a good song.
Don't get me wrong.

413
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:41,070
I think she's creative music too
though. Yeah. I like dirty people.

414
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,000
I like dirty people. I like people would
fucking dirt under their fingernails,

415
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,060
stinky breath and good stories.
But when I first met her,

416
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:51,800
she didn't wear deodorant. It had
to talk her into wearing, oh my God.

417
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,700
Are we being open about our situation
here on the show as being friends?

418
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,710
You guys be in pals making video
for friends and you, um, you,

419
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,040
you just smelled her and you're like,
hey, this has got to change. Right.

420
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,260
You used to be like that too though.

421
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,750
Like you didn't like wearing
deodorant at one point. Still don't.

422
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,740
I like on like a monkey.

423
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,230
I think that if a man likes the way my
underarm smell, then we're a good match.

424
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,600
Really.
He can deal with a lot of other things

425
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,680
like a genetic or like whatever it is.
Yeah.

426
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,000
You don't want to deal with some weak
dues pushed off by a little under set.

427
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,430
I think it's cute. I like that
fragile. That's a great conversation.

428
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:31,410
But when you're trying to
be a struggling actress,

429
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:35,040
and then she was on the Jimmy
Kimmel show as her brother,

430
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,200
no sister as her sister and her part
was Jimmy Kimmel's head right underneath

431
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:44,470
her armpit. And can you imagine it
was stinking? No, she was probably,

432
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,680
well maybe it's just me.
Cam, we'll call you back.

433
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,080
Wash yourself before you went on.
Well, I got the call to do that show.

434
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:56,400
Like literally I had 30 minutes to get
there. So No. So when you got there,

435
00:25:56,401 --> 00:26:00,450
did you smell your underarms and give a
little check? I'm pretty sure I was fine.

436
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,390
You're pretty sure no one ever
thinks they stink though. Yeah,

437
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,660
but mentioned Jimmy Kimmel's nose right
in her arm pit for like how long did it

438
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:11,460
take the film? That shit.
Yeah, he's probably going to
think, oh this girl stinks.

439
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,830
So you have to have a perfect stinky girl.
Yeah,

440
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:17,010
you have to be at like a professional.
You're a right.

441
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,710
So when you, when people talk vegans,
they'll automatically think stinky feet

442
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,520
close. Literally just, I dunno,

443
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,760
I like it because I think dairy is bad
for you and that makes me feel sick.

444
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,830
That's Diaz. Jose, we've
got a fucking problem.

445
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,700
But soy milk actually tastes pretty good.
Like soy milk lattes.

446
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,100
That motherfucker just put

447
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,750
your phone off the hook. Yeah, I can't,

448
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,640
it's not like it's in the
other room and just have the,

449
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,680
he said he's one of those add guys
that'll keep calling it and then when you

450
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,930
answer he'll get angry at you.
What the fuck? Cock sucker.

451
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,840
I called you five fucking
times. Like, can I take a nap?

452
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,540
Is it okay if I take a nap? I called
you cocksucker you don't call me back.

453
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,550
Don't call me back. What the
fuck's going on? Funny. I'm sorry.

454
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,170
We were talking about um,
hippies and so you became [inaudible].

455
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,070
I'm sorry you're not a,
you're not a hit,

456
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,650
but you're vegan because
dairy is bad for you.

457
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,660
You just want to do it for health reasons.
For health reasons basically. Yeah,

458
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,130
I thought about doing that. Yeah,
it's good. I feel better and I like,

459
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,790
it's easy though in Los Angeles to do
it because there's so many restaurants

460
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,070
that have vegan like cake and
you know, stuff like that. Cook.

461
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,280
That's what you need. Cake. Well,

462
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,150
I'm like really concerned about animals,

463
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,500
but I don't want to make sure
that this cake cake available,

464
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,430
then I can do it. Right. Well,
when you don't smoke or drink,

465
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:44,130
there's very few things you have
in life. Right, right, right.

466
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,540
Why don't you try drinking?
They'll mellowly like, like wine.

467
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,090
I know a lot of people enjoy wine.
You just don't like the taste of it.

468
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:52,170
Or 21st birthday.

469
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,610
I went out to dinner with my parents and
had a glass of wine and I had one sip

470
00:27:56,611 --> 00:28:00,330
and spit it right back. I was so gross, I
couldn't handle, one's an acquired taste,

471
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:02,900
but I like it.
I don't know why people acquired tastes.

472
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:06,000
So I tried to acquire the taste
of caviar once I was on a plane,

473
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:09,630
they serve caviar and I'm like, okay,
I'll try this. I'm like, this is ass.

474
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,100
This is so stupid.

475
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,640
Why would anybody pay a lot of
money for this stupid tasting thing?

476
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,120
It tastes like, smells like,
tastes like warm smell. Like,

477
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,520
like after a rain looks like a weird
thing. Like, well it's not that bad,

478
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,630
but it's a weird thing.
I was like,

479
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,710
why don't we do acquire a taste
for something that's a Shitty,

480
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,030
unless it's like super
healthy, but wine I like, I,

481
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,480
I genuinely like it and I
think it's an acquired taste,

482
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,520
which I just contradicted myself.
But it goes well with certain things.

483
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:37,980
Like if you're eating like meat,
like steak,

484
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,540
like a big juicy red ribeye and you're
just chewing into that and you'd just

485
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,370
feel that blood and that texture and then
you have a little swig of Merlow to go

486
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,730
with that. Ah, it's probably the best
thing to put the whole entire world.

487
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,740
It's fucking good. Then
it's good. Then it's good.

488
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,350
Then it's just like they go
together somehow or another.

489
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,710
But if you just like hanging out with your
friends and it's hot outside and like,

490
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,680
let me get a glass of wine. I was
like, yeah, why do you want, you know,

491
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,140
you want me to it up
Gatorade or one you'd rather,

492
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,770
you'd probably have to
start off with wine coolers.

493
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,570
I think that's how everyone starts off
as drinking wine coolers and then one day

494
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,970
you go, I'm going to get a
chardonnay or Pinot Gris. Yes.

495
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,180
If I'm not interested in it.
Like what's the point in starting?

496
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,580
I feel like it only because it's
going to cause trouble in my life.

497
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,360
Wine's going to cause trouble.
Like drinking. I've never drank,

498
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,390
I've never been drunk. Well, you know,
there's, there's, there's that, I mean,

499
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:27,780
you could look at it that way or you
could look at it that you're not going to

500
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:31,380
have as much fun. Right? I mean, it
is true. These are, I mean, these are,

501
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:34,830
this is a legit way of looking at, I
mean, people will argue, you know what,

502
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,500
eagles sober people have
plenty of fun sober people.

503
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm going to say this and I love you,
but you're not nearly as interesting.

504
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,053
It's not

505
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,330
all my funny friends,

506
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:48,160
all my fascinating friends all either
smoked pot or do mushrooms or do something

507
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,550
and they fuck around with their mind.
It's just everything in moderation.

508
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,890
And you know,
you don't have to not look at Stan hope.

509
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,690
There's no moderation there, right. It's
just everything while you're alive. Yeah.

510
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,320
But it should be, that's what you
should focus your whole entire life on.

511
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:04,120
Everything in moderation except like
heroin. But that's for me. And you may be,

512
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:05,320
but I think for other people,

513
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,500
they really don't mind burning the candle
at both ends and seeing how long it

514
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,920
takes til they die. Right. I mean, if
you really look at it all objectively,

515
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,480
it's like, you know, what is
this an 80 year trip, a 90
year trip? If you're lucky,

516
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,450
it ends for everybody.
If it's not that enjoyable,

517
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,540
isn't there an argument for a much more
enjoyable fucking completely chaotic 47

518
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:29,660
years? Oh my God. You know,
drugs and alcohol. Yeah.

519
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,030
Wait until you get your shit and
then you level off. I mean, look,

520
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm not saying it's the way to go.
It's certainly not the way to go,

521
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:40,520
but it's a way to go. It's a
way to go. You know, and it's,

522
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:44,140
it's a way that's produced a lot of
pretty fucking incredible artwork. That's,

523
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,650
you know, every great
musician, every great comedian,

524
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,050
they've all fucked her head up.
They've all done it.

525
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:54,640
Every single one of them prior Kennison
Mitch Hedberg mean just go down,

526
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,360
stand hope, go down the line of all the
guys that I really appreciate watching,

527
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:02,890
they're all fucking either pot Ed's or
they've done a bunch of crazy shit and

528
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:06,940
lived a fucked up life. So it's not, I
mean, it's not your Yogi, Vegan, you know,

529
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,060
eating beans and sitting in
the Lotus position way to go.

530
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,810
But that way ends to man that way.
Fucking shits out. And you're,

531
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,240
you're crapping in your
fucking the loin cloth.

532
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,450
No,

533
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,900
that's the dilemma that I have is like
a lot of the comedians that I'm friends

534
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:25,010
with constantly tell me, you'll write
better, you'll be more creative.

535
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,460
So that's sort of what's making me,
it's made me consider it.

536
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,760
Well, it's also a testament
to your character though,

537
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:34,760
that you've got this thing in your head
where you don't want to be a fuck up.

538
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,900
Right. You know, it's like you have like,
like a plan or you have, uh, you know,

539
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,310
a guideline that it's like safe to operate
in. You know, you're looking at like,

540
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:45,980
I don't want to be a loser. I don't want
to be of this. I don't want to be that.

541
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,350
So I don't want to fuck around with drugs
and I don't want to be like all these

542
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,290
people. I mean, there's,
that's, that's legit too.

543
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,550
Have you ever become addicted to
something so drastically before that?

544
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:58,910
You're just, it scares you
to try things like, I mean,

545
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,540
you barely want to take Tylenol. You told
me, you know, like you don't like taking,

546
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,390
um, I'm not, it's not like I've ever
been addicted to anything crazy. Like no,

547
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,410
but I, I think my, okay.
Growing up, my parents,

548
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,050
I've never seen them drink,
they don't drink and they don't,

549
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,500
they don't smoke or it
just was never around it.

550
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,780
And also I think it comes
back to like high school,

551
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,190
all the cool people started drinking
and I was like, oh, I get it,

552
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,550
but I don't need to do that right now.
And I just sort of never started. Right.

553
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,300
You're a rebel and being
sober. Uh, yeah. I guess

554
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,690
you're fighting the status quo.

555
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,280
You guys want to drink and
party and have a good time.

556
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,740
I'm going to listen to Morrissey
and cry. Fuck you. Exactly, exactly.

557
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,570
And suffer from my art. No, I mean,
yeah, they're really surprise.

558
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:46,190
You're not really religious because it
seems fucked up and all these other ways.

559
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,460
How come you haven't followed Jesus?
Yeah. Do you think you'll ever find Jesus?

560
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,500
Is that right around the corner for you?
Brain is too big for that

561
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,600
whoa. Strong words. Well,

562
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,630
what do you think about scientists
and all these like really intelligent,

563
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:02,670
educated people that become Christians?

564
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,180
I, I don't know. I, if someone
provides me with evidence and proof,

565
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,950
I'll take a look at it. But I, I didn't,
I wasn't raised with any religion and I,

566
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,130
I mean I would like to believe in God and
I think that people that do believe in

567
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:19,690
God lead much happier, better lives
than I ever will. But I just can't.

568
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,990
Yeah, that's an interesting
thing, isn't it? Yeah.

569
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
That a lot of people who
are like Super Christian,

570
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,350
it's like they have the answer.

571
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:29,490
They have Deann word in their
head and because of that they,

572
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,550
they have like a piece
about them. They, you know,

573
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,370
they believe that this is going to end.
It's going to go onto the next thing.

574
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:40,371
And all this could be ironed out
if we just made IOWASCA legal.

575
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,180
If all these people that
have these religious ideas
of all these people that are

576
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:48,180
confused and don't know what the fuck's
going to happen if they really got a

577
00:33:48,181 --> 00:33:50,550
chance to go over to the
spirit world and you can do it.

578
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:53,400
If you want to go to Peru,
do you want to go on a shamonic vacation?

579
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,150
You'd cross you like a few hundred bucks
and you get to stay in a hut for a few

580
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,400
days and then I'll just cook up Iowasca
and you'll sit around and drink it with

581
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:03,900
the Shaman and they'll blow tobacco
smoke in your face and you will fucking

582
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:07,470
travel to the spirit world where you will
get to see what it's like on the other

583
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,420
side. You will get to talk
to your dead ancestors.

584
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:12,780
You'll get to commune with mother Earth
and see the leopards in the fucking

585
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:17,550
jaguars and the snakes in the trees. You
could do it. Do you know what Iowasca is?

586
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,020
No.
Iowasca as this crazy jungle brew.

587
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,530
It's a good,
see,

588
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,180
it's a psychedelic brew that they've
made by combining two plants. And, uh,

589
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,230
these people have been taking it for
thousands and thousands of years and they

590
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:35,400
go over there and they have trips. Like
people gonna have trips. Like we're,

591
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,940
you know, they'll organize like big
vacations while they'll send 20,

592
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,260
30 people into the jungle.
And you know,

593
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,660
you've got to take a boat to
get to these fuckers. You know,

594
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:46,110
they're like living like people
been living for thousands
and thousands of years.

595
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:49,680
Very difficult to get to them. And then
you can do Iowasca with them. What, like,

596
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:53,040
who decides to go do that? A lot of
people do. They want to, you know,

597
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,600
there's a lot of people that have had,
see,

598
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,910
we don't think about it in this
country because it's all illegal.

599
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:59,910
All those drugs are schedule one drugs.
But in a lot of countries,

600
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:03,840
for thousands of years, everyone's
had these rite of passage, uh,

601
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,840
things in their life. You know. I
mean, for some people it's pain.

602
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,700
Like there's tribes in
the Amazon that they,

603
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,380
they have these gloves with bullet
ants in them. It's the craziest thing.

604
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,250
I, it's, I've, I've found it
online on Youtube. You can find it.

605
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,840
These guys did a bullet ant.

606
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:22,950
Apparently one aunt staying is like
literally getting shot by a bullet.

607
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,310
It's like my friend described it as like
feeling like he got his arms slammed in

608
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:29,320
a car door over and over again for hours.
He said is the,

609
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:33,750
is the most intense and excruciating pain
and they stick their hands into these

610
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:38,340
gloves that are filled with bullet ants
and they'd just the bull Jews Jack them

611
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:42,010
and they have to keep the gloves on for
like 10 minutes and then for hours and

612
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,550
hours during the in they're crying.
They're in incredible agony,

613
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,400
but these are rites of passages
and these rites of passage.

614
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:52,401
The idea is that you have
to have something that
perturbs your normal state of

615
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,490
consciousness, something that completely
blasts you out of this current,

616
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,540
like you know,

617
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:02,490
this mundane state of existence in
order to signify that you've made a

618
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:05,520
transition, like this is going to
be a very difficult thing to do.

619
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:08,520
But once you've done this very
difficult thing than the regular life,

620
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,500
normal life, you're going to
appreciate this so much more.

621
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,490
You're going to feel like,
like privileged,

622
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:15,000
you're gonna feel like you've made this
rite of passage. Like you've become,

623
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,220
someone evolved, you know, you've, you've,

624
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:21,780
you've reached the next level in the
video game. Well, with Iowasca, you know,

625
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:24,150
these,
these rituals were totally painless,

626
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:27,600
but psychologically very scary
for people because you're,

627
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:32,601
you're literally giving up control of
your consciousness and connecting to this,

628
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
this web of consciousness that's surrounds
every life form on the planet and

629
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:42,790
every life form that ever existed, they're
all interconnected somehow. And you,

630
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,990
you realize during the four
hours that you're on his trip,

631
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,540
you realize that my God,
like I'm like,

632
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,250
everything's insignificant.
It's not just that you're insignificant,

633
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:56,610
it's earth isn't significant,
but it's not as at the same time,

634
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,320
it's like it's all connected
in this weird, strange way
that we don't understand.

635
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:04,920
And that the way I was described as
that life might be just one frame and an

636
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,590
infinite movie that lasts
forever. You know? I mean,

637
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:11,580
you really do have to look at it like
that. Well, IOWASCA provides this vision.

638
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,110
IOWASCA provides you with this,
like this, this, this, this idea,

639
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:20,400
this way of looking at the world,
you know? And that's totally illegal.

640
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,630
It found interesting.
And it also sounds to me,

641
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,040
my first thought is very, very
dangerous. Yeah. But not see,

642
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,150
but the DMT,

643
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:33,370
the chemical that it makes is a chemical
to your own brain producers. Oh Wow.

644
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,840
So it's not, it's not dangerous at all.
I mean, nobody's dying from this stuff,

645
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,310
but people dying from cigarettes,

646
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:40,980
people dying from alcohol to dying from
a million different things that are not

647
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:45,300
worried about, you know,
but people are worried about
doing this crazy thing. Well,

648
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,580
this crazy thing is scary because
you're going to give up control,

649
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,200
you're going to go someplace,
you're gonna.

650
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,640
But that's what these rites of passages
are all about. That's what like really,

651
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,540
really figuring out, like really having a
better view of life. You know, like, uh,

652
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,230
like,
like you really feel like you're evolving.

653
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,510
One of the best ways to do that is to
just really objectively look at what this

654
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:09,690
life is, you know? And it's very
hard to do that while you're in it.

655
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,120
And what these psychedelic drugs do is
they pull you out of this life and they

656
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,490
let you look at it. I mean, if
they are religious experiences,

657
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,680
this is the root of all religious
experiences in psychedelics. I believe.

658
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,280
So you want to do it right
now? Try some. All right,

659
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,370
so these people who have all done these
like all throughout the past, you know,

660
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,990
um, I think that's probably
the original religious story.

661
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,860
And then somewhere along the line they,
they got twisted and more twisted more.

662
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,400
And then instead of
like seeing God as like,

663
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,250
like really God is us and we're all
together in this thing and it's this weird

664
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,490
sort of like insane momentum behind
like all life in the universe,

665
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:50,290
everything together,
all this one big thing.

666
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,560
But you can't really see it
in your everyday life and
allows you see it when you

667
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,980
did take entheogens are when you take
mushrooms or something like that.

668
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,170
And I think that's what that was the
original message while that shit.

669
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,930
So that's why religion is good for you.
I mean,

670
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:04,720
that's why religion like why
it can help you. Like why?

671
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,110
Like people that do it live a happier
life because in a way they're right.

672
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:08,891
I mean,

673
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,610
they're not really right that there's a
dude in the clouds with a harp and he's

674
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:16,310
got a book and Saint Peter Goes, so what
have you done while she, oh, you did this.

675
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,250
There's not that, it's not that, but there
is something else. I mean it's a very,

676
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:26,080
very likely that we are just
like one part of a much,

677
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:30,670
much, much bigger thing. Yeah. I
don't doubt that. I just write,

678
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,230
I guess I just don't believe in,

679
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:36,990
I don't like to hear people talk about
you're going to go to hell. Well that's,

680
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,780
that's, that's the negative aspect
of it. But the positive aspect,

681
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,880
I met a lot of Christians
that were really happy,

682
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:47,140
really nice people because they really
did believe that they were a part of

683
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:47,974
something bigger.

684
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,520
They really did believe that they were
doing the work of someone bigger and they

685
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:54,880
really are. I mean, it really is what
you're doing. Positive Shit. I mean,

686
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,480
although the, the ideals of Christianity,
the real ones are, you know,

687
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,030
love your brothers. You would
love yourself, don't commit crime,

688
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,760
don't commit murder. Don't fuck your
neighbor's wife. Like that kind of shit.

689
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,690
Like that's all. I'm a subscriber. There's
a lot of other stuff thrown in there.

690
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,280
Like you're allowed to have slaves
and beat your wife. But you know,

691
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,060
you got to know that some Douche bag
stuck that in there and they'll put the

692
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:16,960
teams up here right here,
50 slave and fucking in the ass,

693
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,490
you know, but, but the root of
it all, like the ideas behind it,

694
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:26,491
it's obviously clearly a guideline for
living life and being happy and creating

695
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,870
a harmonious culture.
I think that's good.

696
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,500
The root of all those almost positively
is come from psychedelic drugs for crazy

697
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:35,981
murderers,

698
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:39,490
monkeys that ran around and taking drugs
and they sat back and just went, whoa,

699
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,670
wait a minute. What are we doing
here? What is this? It's not just me.

700
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:46,930
It's not just you were a part of a Web,
a network. The trees are intelligent,

701
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,830
the dirt is alive, and they just have
this intense feeling for you know, five,

702
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,800
six hours or however long it is, depending
on how many mushrooms they've eaten.

703
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,790
And then they start to rethink. I'm turned
off by the word drugs like that. Yeah.

704
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,780
If you think about it like they're just
consuming things in nature and this is

705
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:06,520
happening. That's sounds a
little different too. Yeah.
Well that's cause we drugs,

706
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:10,050
you know the idea we've, you know, put
it as pills and that fuck your world up.

707
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,620
That's the problem is how can
you have one word for everything?

708
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:18,910
How can you have one word that includes
coffee and cigarettes and heroin.

709
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,740
You know like how are those together? How
has, how has coffee and meth together,

710
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,540
how are they in the same
drug? But they are. How was,

711
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,460
how was rockstar energy drink?

712
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,600
How is that and should have
it like a drug one through 10.

713
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:34,460
Like it's a trig Wu. But here's
the problem. Schedule One.

714
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,080
Schedule One is like the least
dangerous shit. It's marijuana. Heroin.

715
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:42,500
Like the laws are completely fucked up.
Mushrooms are scheduled one.

716
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,740
Nobody's dying off. They need to start
off a little bit slower than that though.

717
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,520
Needs to be like level one, like,
you know, at caffeine and you know,

718
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:52,600
it should go through all the drugs, you
know, he's like, that's a level six I had,

719
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,510
she'd be logical.
Yeah,

720
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,920
I have.
I think I'm such a control freak.

721
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:59,830
Like I've heard people talk about
mushrooms and it sounds like, oh,

722
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,560
you go through this exciting
experience and that's really cool,

723
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,000
but what if I'm like,
I don't know.

724
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:06,820
I feel like I would just get freaked
out and be like, take it away.

725
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:07,840
Like make it stop.

726
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,840
You might, because that's what happens
if you try to control the trip. Yeah.

727
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,390
If you are really worried
and you, you know, look, you,

728
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:19,080
what you're doing is very difficult.
Okay. You're a single girl,

729
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:24,081
you're 22 years old and you're committing
to do stand up comedy in Los Angeles

730
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,640
and you're, you weigh about 35 pounds
and you look like you're 12. I mean,

731
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:32,220
what you're doing is,
that's a fucking dangerous thing.

732
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,620
Did you have any friends out here?

733
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,120
Um, yeah, my best friend from college.

734
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,610
Yeah. And so you moved out here with her,
with him and met him here. Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,100
Well, you know, what you're doing is very,

736
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:45,740
very risky and I bet
your mind in your mind,

737
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,770
you want to minimize all the
outside risks as much as possible.

738
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,870
Glare. Yeah. And I like, I'm not against
it morally at all. I mean if I, you know,

739
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,880
I've achieved nothing so far,

740
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:59,090
so it's like once I start to get
somewhere and feel accomplished,

741
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:02,490
I'm sure that I will sit back
and like take a hit of something.

742
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,100
Right. No, I totally
know what you're saying.

743
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:08,030
I totally know where you're coming
from. When I was a kid, um, uh,

744
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,640
when I did martial arts, I never
did any drugs. I never did anything.

745
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,010
I hate only drunk or gotten drunk.

746
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:17,430
Maybe like I could count on my hands
and my fingers like maybe eight,

747
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:20,220
nine times in my whole high school
career. You know, it was like, oh,

748
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:22,710
my friends would be fucking hammered
all the time. I'd be going to parties,

749
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:24,060
but I don't even,
it was eight times.

750
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,790
So it's probably less than that all
throughout high school. All I did was,

751
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,150
so I always thought the same way. I
always thought that drugs are for losers.

752
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,210
Yeah. Alcohol and drugs and you
know, want to smoke cigarettes,

753
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,860
you're going to be a zero.
It's gonna fuck you up.

754
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,050
And you know it just until I was
like 30 that I smoke pot again.

755
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,260
Yeah. I think I may be done at
once or twice, like over the years,

756
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:46,290
like drunk at a party or something
like that. But it was never like, Ooh,

757
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,960
I'm going to smoke pot and
like think about shit. Never.

758
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,420
I would never even think of that.
It'd be like, you fucking loser.

759
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,680
You need pot to think about
shit you fucking pussy. Like
that's was my mentality.

760
00:43:55,681 --> 00:43:58,860
But it was the same reason. It was
like, I was like hyper control freak.

761
00:43:58,861 --> 00:44:01,820
I was trying to like be successful.
I didn't want to be a loser.

762
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,550
I was gonna fucking go out there and I
had a very similar attitude that you do,

763
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:09,510
you'll about all these, this anger that
you have towards these hot chicks. Yeah.

764
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,680
You know, I mean, I had that same
thing, you know, with towards, you know,

765
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:15,780
I don't know who it was.
It was a lot of different people.

766
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,720
I'd probably have an Asian man, much less
specific. No, I've always enjoyed fine.

767
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,430
I really nice guys.
Um,

768
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,590
as I totally know where you're coming
from. Don't let anybody talk you into it.

769
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,650
But the idea is once you become like a
little bit more stable with your life,

770
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,110
you know, then you start
considering the idea of, you know,

771
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,880
just fucking around
with your consciousness.

772
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,500
You don't have to do dangerous shit
though. Yeah. Start off slow. Yeah.

773
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,230
Start off with shotgunning
we'd Af you know,

774
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,840
whatever with another person
and then next move on to,

775
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,670
if you're going to smoke weed, just
moat. Know who you're smoking a weapon.

776
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,120
Just smoke a tiny bit. Yeah, just
like a little baby hit or no,

777
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,460
because then you'll just be like,
ah,

778
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,320
you just be like relaxed and silly and
then you'll just have cool conversations

779
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,930
and you won't be paranoid. You know, like
so many people come to me and they go,

780
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,150
dude, I tried pot. You was
listening to you. I tried pot.

781
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:08,010
I got fucking super paranoid man. I told
he fucking freaked out. I couldn't drive.

782
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:09,990
I had to stay at my friend's
house for like eight hours.

783
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,140
His wife has tried to kick me out like
it's always this terrible, terrible story.

784
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:15,300
And Mike Gamble, you got
to high stupid. Yeah.

785
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,500
You weren't supposed to smoke
five joints here first time.

786
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,910
That's supposed to fucking a time travel.
Right.

787
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,240
You know when you smoke too much
weed bend, you just lose time.

788
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,080
We just ended up in play when I was in
high school. I got super, super high.

789
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:29,820
Me and my friend Josh and my girlfriend,

790
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,530
there was one time that I
deviated from my plan and uh,

791
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,880
we were like 15 and my stepfather
had weed and it was really good weed.

792
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,470
My stepfather was a super hippie who
was like long hair, computer programmer,

793
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,700
the whole deal.
And he had some bomb ass weed and uh,

794
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,100
it was one of the reasons also
that I never smoked weed. This is,

795
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:50,160
I just always assumed that it was terrible
for you because of this experience.

796
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,410
So we were over my girlfriend's house
and we smoked this pot and then we would

797
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:59,460
just appear in rooms. I was like
blip and now I'm in the kitchen.

798
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,280
How do I get the kitchen blip
now I'm on the couch. I mean,

799
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,330
we were all doing this.
I mean we were our little 15 year old,

800
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:09,720
weak ass brains were way to just,

801
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,280
there's no way we had the experience
to deal with this kind of weed. It was,

802
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:18,600
it was craziness. And from then on
I was like, I could just be fucking,

803
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:22,170
I just wake up and traffic driving, you
know, like what if, what if that happened?

804
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,540
What if I have flashbacks, you
know, to me I considered like, wow,

805
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,940
I've dodged that bullet. I learned
the pots for losers, you know,

806
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,670
it's not even the case. My, I didn't
get stone the first time I did it.

807
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,540
I like would get stone like three times
or something like that and nothing would

808
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,374
ever happen.

809
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,480
And then finally one day I got to stone
and I just wanted to watch cartoons all

810
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,910
day. You should try it. And
it's good for your asthma.

811
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,890
Even though you say it's
bad for your asthma,

812
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:50,930
it's actually really good
for your ass. It's, the smoke
is not good for asthma. No,

813
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,710
no,
you don't have to smog it too.

814
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:55,110
There's a thing called a
vaporizer and they brought her,

815
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:59,970
just makes mist and when it makes us miss,
it's really pretty cool. The missed. Um,

816
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,230
like it seems like,

817
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,860
like you're blowing fog almost out of
your mouth and like a lot of people go to

818
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:07,800
d because they're like, I don't even,
I mean I'm feeling there's no smoke.

819
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,140
Like they feel like they're not
getting enough. But you are,

820
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:14,460
you're getting the burned off
THC crystals only for you.

821
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:17,430
You'd want only like
three volcano bags full.

822
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,610
Three full bags of volcano. Definitely.
Good for you to contemplate to his,

823
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:26,190
I'm thinking about jumping off a bridge.
We'll start freaking the fuck out.

824
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,680
I saw the craziest thing. I saw her do
stand up the other day and I you about it.

825
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,220
But it

826
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,650
was amazing. Uh, there was,
what does it? Saddle ranch. Oh,

827
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,570
it was like the worst audience ever.
It was just people rowdy,

828
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,840
not paying attention. The comments
were chatting on sunset? No,

829
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,830
it was a universal universal center and
there was even comic right next door to

830
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:49,090
John Lovitz his club. Yes. There's like
a little standup thing going on. Yeah.

831
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,420
And so like there,
there's even stand up comics.

832
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,760
They're just waving their legs and
their arms while they're on stage.

833
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,880
Just trying to get attention.
It wasn't that bad. Wow.

834
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,640
And then she gets on stage and
everyone just, it was weird.

835
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:04,270
Everyone just shut up and then started
applauding and clapping and it was

836
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:08,000
amazing. I've never seen somebody
Turner room around biker and like,

837
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,640
I saw three comics go up and fail.
And how,

838
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,690
how good were the comics
that went up before? Uh,

839
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,830
I mean they were pretty good if
you were to listen to their jokes.

840
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:17,410
I'm not saying they're the best or
anything, but they're decent, you know.

841
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:20,630
And then the two guys from,
uh, ways that repo man. Yeah.

842
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,060
And I dunno the show. Yeah. Yeah.

843
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:25,780
Like these big buff guys
that have to have some true

844
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,840
TV. There's only one repo man. It's
with Emilio Estevez bitches. All right.

845
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,810
I'm not watching your shelter.
You change the fucking name. Okay.

846
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:37,430
You can't be repo man. Yeah. Kevy
even repo men, that's done. You know.

847
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,080
Totally even want to say
Cosell repossession ink.
That's cool. You can't change.

848
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,170
Make the name of your show one of the
greatest cult movies ever and then make a

849
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:49,250
cheap fake. Yeah. You're cheating you
cons. Yeah. You're making it fake. Yeah.

850
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,800
You Fox. So what about a
reality show? Asked her,

851
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:55,400
would you be down for that following
little Esther around? No, I don't know.

852
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,500
I guess would while little Esther,
how about this?

853
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,480
How about a reality show
with you and Brian were,

854
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:01,280
Brian just gets you to do terrible,

855
00:49:01,281 --> 00:49:04,530
terrible things like that video
you guys made. What is it?

856
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,330
Where can people find out if you've got
a little esther.com she has her on there.

857
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:10,760
It's called an Ester is spelled with a t.

858
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:14,030
H. E. S. T. H. E. R. Yeah.

859
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
[inaudible] dot com and a,

860
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:19,460
it's a video of Brian
literally legitimately getting
her to try cigarettes for

861
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:22,640
the first time. Alcohol for the first
time. He got you to try all these things.

862
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,580
Like I just stepped it though. And I
barely am hailed the cigarette and yeah,

863
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:31,720
it was, it just reaffirmed everything. I
already, I'm like, this tastes discussing,

864
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:35,170
this makes me feel sick.
Like it reaffirmed everything.

865
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,110
The only thing he liked was the
shoplifting. One guy, she went back,

866
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:41,890
sack tee times. It's like, I'm just
doing more shit from this place. I

867
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,280
shoplifting. I just said, did you
stop it for real gummy bears? Like,

868
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:48,700
you know how they have all the candy
out and really did shoplifting. Yeah.

869
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,320
Took a few pieces of candy. Whoa. Yeah.
And we'd go to jail for that. Right.

870
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,930
You're talking about they're middle men
again. I thought it was just a setup.

871
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,000
They were samples. Okay. Okay.
I was free. Right. It was legit.

872
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,320
I think there's like a uncalled law
that you're allowed to sample a,

873
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,530
when you go to those candy shops,

874
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:06,100
you're allowed to sample one to see if
you want to buy it. They have it open.

875
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,220
It's like a little gummy bear that's
not really shoplifting. Oh, okay.

876
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:14,090
It is though, because if everyone
just knows one stove, gummy bears,

877
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,410
everyone's told gummy bears. I
smoked cigarettes, uh, when I was 15,

878
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:21,770
I smoked one and I didn't like it and
I just, I was like, this is disgusting.

879
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,580
My sister won up getting hooked and that
was another, it showed me like, okay,

880
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:28,130
this is obviously not good.
And then when I was about

881
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,650
23, I did some, there was
like a bunch of comics,

882
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:33,590
they were doing some sketches and we
were trying to put together some sketches

883
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:38,120
and one of the characters was this guy
who was like this cigarette smoking,

884
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:40,260
like um,
like poet guy who was like,

885
00:50:40,261 --> 00:50:43,880
what was writing terrible poetry and
smoking cigarettes all the time and like

886
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:47,510
smoking, like, so I had to play that guy
and I was like smoking the cigarette.

887
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,500
Like I smoked cigarettes all day while
we rehearsed this and my hands were

888
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,830
shaking,
my whole body was freaking out.

889
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:56,090
I must've smoked like
at a no cigarettes ever.

890
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,050
I must've smoked like seven
cigarettes. That's crazy, dude.

891
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,580
I was shaking. I was shaking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like,

892
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,360
and I couldn't talk all that good.
It was like my words are coming out.

893
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,740
It was like I needed breasts in
between my words. I was like,

894
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:13,520
Dow fucking crazy that people suck
down two packs these things a day.

895
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,700
Whoo.
That's a,

896
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:20,810
that is the biggest mind fuck in the
history of our society is that cigarettes

897
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,130
are not just legal,

898
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,900
but that cigarette and tobacco
companies are allowed to send money to

899
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:31,160
politicians and put politicians in office
and contribute to their funds so that

900
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:36,161
the politicians support them and give
them good laws and make sure that they can

901
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:39,560
continue to sell their shit and
stores everywhere. You know?

902
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,800
Meanwhile they're killing hundreds
of thousands of people a year.

903
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,000
I can't even think about it as
it so crazy. Like if something,

904
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,150
if something gives you cancer,

905
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,810
like if they find out the diet coke no
fucks you up or something like that,

906
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,940
you've got to get rid of it.
You got to pull it off the market.

907
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,230
It's a fact for sure that cigarettes
fuck you up. It's so disgusting.

908
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:58,070
I can't handle.

909
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,610
I like their new commercial for like
the nonsmoking thing where it was like

910
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,360
broken glass, you know, we're
recalling broken glass and he was like,

911
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,990
only if co companies, you know, recalled
products that wasn't, uh, you know,

912
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,840
they should read recall
cigarettes the same way. You know,

913
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,450
it's all about that money,
man. It's all about the money.

914
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:17,690
There's too much money on cigarettes.
It's a multibillion dollar industry.

915
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:20,810
People like them and I support the,
if you really want to have a cigarette,

916
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,700
you should be able to do whatever
the hell you want to do. You know,

917
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:26,000
if you want to smoke. So I like cigars.
Kevin James and I smoke cigars sometimes.

918
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,950
He's the only one that really struck
them with, he likes, you know, Ari,

919
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:32,840
Ari and I smoke cigars or mature for
cigars. Look man, they taste good.

920
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,150
I like it. It's, again,
it's an acquired thing.

921
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:38,180
It's like you can enjoy it if you have
a big fat fucking piece of meat and sit

922
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:41,000
down with a big cigar. It's
fun. But you could do it.

923
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:42,320
You should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want.

924
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:47,000
But the idea that you know that this isn't
like something that people are trying

925
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,834
to stop.

926
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,360
The idea that you have these people that
are politicians but they're not like

927
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:52,880
coming out and saying Lazy Jen, we'll
do it. We've got a real issue here.

928
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,300
We're losing loved ones were getting sick.
We're losing time on the job.

929
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,110
This is costing employers money like and
it's costing you your enjoyment of this

930
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:03,050
time here you're addicted.
This little fucking country cigarette man,

931
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,810
we've got to stop this
shit at the same time.

932
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,130
No one's unaware that that's what it's
like. Yeah they are, but we were babies.

933
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,000
We need someone to step up
and say it. You know, if they,

934
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,620
if all of a sudden you know
the fluids in the news,

935
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,290
all they have to do is put the flu in
the news and say we have to be careful to

936
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,520
wash your hands and this and that.

937
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,730
The flu is in the news and then everybody
goes home. The fluids in the news.

938
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,860
You knew about the fucking flu.
Goddammit.

939
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,500
The is always coming every goddamn winter.
It's the same thing. It's a new flu.

940
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,830
This year. It's the pig flu. Next year
it's the bird flu. It's a fucking flu.

941
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,450
You get sick every year. Well, you know,
don't touch things that shitheads touch.

942
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,620
Wash your hands. Take probiotics,
eat acidophilus in yogurt.

943
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,730
Take care of your body.
Take your vitamins, get some
sleep. It's all fucking,

944
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:46,920
we all know it, but we need to
hear it. We need to hear it.

945
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,340
We need daddy to tell us though. Flu.
Get your flu shot. Ladies and gentlemen,

946
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,350
Wash your hands. You can use this. This
is PRL. This kills 99% of all bacteria.

947
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,730
I like your purple bottle that's on
this couch. It's like parral with shit.

948
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,650
Like on the bottle. That's
probably chocolate. It's like
a joke. That right there.

949
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:07,860
The joke. It's like the cleanest
solution is covered with poop.

950
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,590
It doesn't look like poop. Oh,
you know what it is actually,

951
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,670
it looks like a piece of tape that's been
peeled off at the sticky stuff is here

952
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,430
and the sticky stuff is accumulated.
A bunch of dirty things. Yeah.

953
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,760
Hmm. Ah, so good point though, Brian.
Just going to put this on my ball back.

954
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,213
So it feels like,

955
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,000
so if you were to ever do a show where
it made you just try a bunch of things,

956
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:30,920
would you like if you
got paid for that show,

957
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:34,580
would you do things like that you would
never do? Like, like eat a raw, you know,

958
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:37,340
medium rare steak. Would you uh, you know,

959
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,810
try to be a stripper for a day or
you know, like do shit like that?

960
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,560
I wouldn't do like weird, weird stuff.
Like I wouldn't not, you brought me,

961
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:48,380
that sounds really not even like
if you were being paid for it,

962
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:52,790
like each episode you're getting $5,000. I
don't know. That's a really, uh, I'm, no,

963
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,030
why not?
Cause I like to use my brain,

964
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,910
but you're that afraid of me.
I'm not, I've eaten meat. I mean,

965
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,640
and every now and then I'm
like, okay, yeah, I'll have
a bite of that cheeseburger.

966
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,600
But, so I'm not like super strict
and I grew up eating meat a lot.

967
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,190
What made you stop eating meat?

968
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:15,200
I'm just kind of reading different books
and getting bored and just trying to

969
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:16,570
learn different things and yeah,

970
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:20,090
I really miss about health health,
some main reason. Yeah. So,

971
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,940
so you're like very concerned with making
sure that your life is in order. Yeah.

972
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,710
Very concerned with your health
and very concerned with, you know,

973
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:30,290
don't doing anything dangerous and
your future and everything like that

974
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:31,221
basically.

975
00:55:31,221 --> 00:55:35,280
Is that to offset all the danger you
take in this fucking crazy risky career?

976
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:40,150
I think so. Yeah. And I mean, I
also don't, I don't know. You don't,

977
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:42,070
you don't, you can't
trust many people. I mean,

978
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:45,850
I'm hanging out at comedy clubs till three
in the morning where everyone else is

979
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:49,540
a guy and in their thirties and you had
been trying to take advantage of you. Oh,

980
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:53,440
well I think that goes without
saying. Really. No. I mean, no,

981
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:55,250
no one does anything crazy.
But I mean,

982
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,800
they'll try to kiss you when
you didn't want it. Yeah.

983
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,910
We all might say names. Yes, that happens.

984
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,080
So we know the story.

985
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,160
So you were in speaking of or you were
in Don [inaudible] Dingdong show or were

986
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:14,080
you in the no, I was on the
Dingdong show. I was in,

987
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:19,081
he has a band called the bears Kennedy
overdrive that I was a part of for a year

988
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:24,160
and a half actually. That's the air
guitar band. Yes. They, they pretty much

989
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:26,730
our a part of for a year and
a half. Yeah. As Jesus Christ.

990
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,460
How much patience do you have is actually

991
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,110
really uh,

992
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,520
integral like part of my comedy career
I guess because I like developed a lot.

993
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:37,780
I got a lot of stage time.

994
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,440
I was there every night to like sometimes
three in the morning was even no one

995
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,274
in the audience.

996
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,310
And like I played this character that's
actually had a little Esther videos sort

997
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:50,140
of came about because I play this
character that, you know, don goes,

998
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:52,360
is there any a dancer in the audience?
And I'd be like,

999
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,580
be sitting in the audience
like, Oh, I can do it.

1000
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:57,940
And then on stage and everyone's like, oh
my God, who let the 14 year old in here?

1001
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,510
And like it just wouldn't just
improvised stuff every night.

1002
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,630
And it was actually a pretty cool and
so you were doing this even without an

1003
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:07,840
audience? Um, yeah there
would be audiences a lot,

1004
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:12,100
but some nights there were not
audiences and wow. Don is very,

1005
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:15,910
he's a die hard performer and he's one
of the smartest people I think ever.

1006
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:20,170
He's so funny and there's very fine
cheese is a great guy. Oh my God,

1007
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:24,310
he's so funny. He's so weird. He's
crazy. And he's just like literally,

1008
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:29,311
I feel so lucky that I got to develop
with him cause he's definitely like made a

1009
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,690
big part of the character.

1010
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,460
So you developed this
character doing that, right.

1011
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,910
And then so that is who you
are when you go on stage. No,

1012
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,410
you're you when you go on stage.
Yeah.

1013
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,520
Which is really weird because
like when I first met her,

1014
00:57:43,521 --> 00:57:46,760
she was the little character person.
And so like I thought all right,

1015
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:50,510
this girl is like a little girl
and then you meet the adult person.

1016
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:54,450
It's so weird cause you're, you
are like uh, you play like you're,

1017
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:56,360
you trick yourself into
thinking you're a kid.

1018
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,640
Yeah. I mean I guess it's
more, let's honestly,

1019
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,260
it's probably more like
multiple personality disorder
and don't say anything.

1020
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,540
Maybe bipolar. No, I
don't know. I just like,

1021
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,510
sometimes I act like a kid and I just
get into it and I commit to it yet.

1022
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,220
Okay. What's the trauma? There's
no, what has gotten you into this,

1023
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:17,450
this form of a performance and
communication? What it was gotten.

1024
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:18,510
You understand the economy something.
Huh?

1025
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,610
My, I'm trying to figure it out.
My theory and you can tell her,

1026
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:25,270
my theory is that one day she's going to
like drop her car keys and bend down to

1027
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:28,030
pick it up and there's going to be this
huge flash in her head and she's going

1028
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:31,090
to remember all this shit that
she's totally blacked out.

1029
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,840
I literally have no idea.
I'm be a scientist with your theories.

1030
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,360
Doesn't it seem like it's something like
that would happen like the $6 million

1031
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:42,120
man for guy. My Dad used to
kiss me on the tummy too hard.

1032
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,300
You know the problem with those,

1033
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,100
those types of memories that like,
you know,

1034
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:47,800
Roseanne's that or she remembered being
molested when she was two or something

1035
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:52,030
like that. You're real memories
from back then are a ghost,

1036
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,960
you know, your, your body first
of all isn't even the same body.

1037
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,920
Every single cell in your body
changes over every seven years.

1038
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,460
So a lot of times you're, they don't
even know where the memories are stored.

1039
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,550
The only, the only options
are that it's not a local,

1040
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,090
but the memories are somewhere out in
the ether and you can tune into them and

1041
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:12,550
access them like a cloud,
which is ridiculous.

1042
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,730
And then the other option is that they're
in the neurons because the neurons are

1043
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,490
the only things that don't get
swapped out, like with cells.

1044
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,890
I do remember being breastfed.
Do you? Yeah, I really,

1045
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,810
yeah. I was breastfed really
late years. Three and a half,

1046
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:30,930
three and a half years old.
Most people do. At what, six
months is the Max usually?

1047
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,740
Sometimes three. My wife does
it for a year. A year? Yeah.

1048
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,260
Three and a half years ago.
She remembers it being done though.

1049
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,550
Really good for you. Yeah. I have
one memory of being brown. Oh,

1050
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,310
there's a woman that I know who did
it to her four year old. Wow. Yeah.

1051
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,490
Four years old. Four years
old. The kid would get upset.

1052
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,890
She would just worry about a tip. But can
you, can you imagine remembering at Joe?

1053
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:49,990
Can you remember?
No,

1054
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,320
I have heard that people can remember
really in depth things about their

1055
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:55,154
childhood.

1056
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,510
I have some distant ghostlike
memories from being very young,

1057
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:02,600
like five and four and
three and one very clear.

1058
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:06,110
One of her very traumatic moment
when I was young I was about five,

1059
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,510
but the other ones are like goes,
what's your traumatic moment?

1060
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,620
My Dad beat the shit out my mom. Right,
right, right. No mine. The youngest,

1061
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:16,610
I can remember my mom says I was three
and a half for my great grandmother was

1062
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:21,130
sitting on this bench across this like
a farm field and I guess there was a,

1063
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:25,510
a nes ate chicken nest or
something like that nearby. Uh, uh,

1064
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,520
I think it was chickens and I was walking
towards her and I got too close and

1065
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:31,650
then like maybe five chickens
like attacked me. Like,

1066
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,570
like I just remember my great
grandmother being too old going, yeah.

1067
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,470
Oh help him.
He's getting attacked

1068
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,730
cause she could walk over and stuff like
that. And I just remember my mom here,

1069
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:40,870
my mom would go,
oh my God.

1070
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:44,110
And she runs up and gets
all these chickens off me
and I had like bloody phase

1071
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,660
and everything like that. How old were
you? I think like three and a half.

1072
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:50,130
Four to went on a chicken slaughter.
Rampy yeah.

1073
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,900
I would have killed those chickens with
baseball bats, but that was my kid.

1074
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:55,030
I would have smashed all
those little cunty chickens.

1075
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,210
I remember cause one hit
me right in between you and
they kind of got your eyes,

1076
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,200
just chickens get sick if once you can
get sick and he falls to the ground,

1077
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,700
right? Yeah. The chickens will just
pick at it. Death. Really? Yeah.

1078
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,820
They'll peck the dead. They'll start
eating and eating his eyeballs.

1079
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:09,760
He in his brain. Yeah. Pack the
shit out of him. Chickens are cuts.

1080
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,700
What's your most dramatic moment from your
childhood as the youngest? You can go,

1081
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,550
I can't even think of any thing.
Okay.

1082
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:20,610
So do you think that the trauma was all
being ostracized by the cool kids and

1083
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:21,790
that you know,

1084
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,840
being forced on the outside and forced
to think that you're a piece of shit and

1085
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:29,380
you're not special and so then you
have this motivation to show that your

1086
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:32,320
specialty, your performer, that you can
make it, that you could be successful?

1087
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:37,130
I think I, but I also think at
too comes from like my family.

1088
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,450
My mom is Christian and my dad's
Jewish and my mom has like this big,

1089
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:45,080
a big family with like a lot of cut.
There's cousins and aunts and whatever.

1090
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:50,230
And I always sort of felt like I was like
the one Jew like that no one liked and

1091
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:52,220
they'd like,
I was not included in a lot.

1092
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:56,300
And I think that is like mostly it
because it's school. When I was little,

1093
01:01:56,301 --> 01:01:59,360
I was finally, I was like a leader in
like my teachers always said like, oh,

1094
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:02,870
Esther's kind of bossy and people follow
her around like so I know that I was

1095
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:04,520
confident early on,

1096
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:09,650
but I think like just having a family
where I felt like I wasn't a part of what

1097
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:12,020
they were a part of made me feel like,

1098
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:16,250
well then I don't care and I'm going
to do my own weird stuff. And so yeah,

1099
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,080
that seems pretty active.

1100
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,250
So you,
you felt almost like as a young kid,

1101
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,700
because they're one side of the family
was not Jewish and you're Jewish and you

1102
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:27,510
had, you couldn't mix in, you felt
there was other Jewish people,

1103
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:29,640
they just didn't like her.
That's what you're saying. No,

1104
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:32,370
cause she's saying your mom's
side, right? The Non Jews. I don't,

1105
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:35,400
but I didn't really associate it with
being Jewish. Now I do a little bit,

1106
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:39,660
even though that might not be fair
of me to say, but it's like I just,

1107
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:44,490
I didn't really fit in with
everyone. So your, your mom
was Jewish. Christian. Okay.

1108
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,600
So you weren't raised Jewish
though. So you're not a Jew? No.

1109
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:52,170
So what are you saying that I, my
dad's a Jew. Right. But at your camp,

1110
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,760
you're not a Jew. Technically have to, but
you're not Jewish religious wise. Right.

1111
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,580
He comes from the mother.
But people that are not Jewish,

1112
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:03,450
if they know that you're have one
Jewish parent, it's sort of like, Oh,

1113
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:05,730
you're a Jew. A lot of
people are like that. Yeah.

1114
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,840
Jewish people say I'm not Jewish
and non Jewish people say that I am.

1115
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,180
No one wants me in their group. Wow,
you've got this thing, you've got this.

1116
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,760
I'm on the outside looking in thing.
I do.

1117
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,110
I sort of like the, the Rogan board
posts will start coming in. Whoa.

1118
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:26,130
George try to cycle.
Why isn't he doing it?

1119
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:30,600
Doctor Phil Voice through a girl on the
show call called, Oh my God, there's,

1120
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,310
they said so many mean things about me.
They're like,

1121
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:36,510
she's 20 Felix 25 and she's
like a weird child lady

1122
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:46,140
cleaning my house. Oh, I understand.

1123
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:46,680
It's okay.

1124
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,700
And then one said that I have the face
of a 14 year old and the stomach of a 34

1125
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:55,200
year old.
That is rude to you,

1126
01:03:55,201 --> 01:03:58,620
that motivate you in any way? They want
to go to the gym, do some crunches.

1127
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:02,470
I do want to go to the gym. Yes. But I um,

1128
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:07,950
I mean being in stand up like one of
my comedy mentors is Ari Shaffir and he

1129
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:12,750
constantly tells me that I'm, that I'm
like need to lose weight like I'm used to.

1130
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,110
Yeah, he tells you that.
Was he talking to him?

1131
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:22,440
I wrote him this text message cause we
had the same agent. I'm like all right my,

1132
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,860
our agent said that cause I put that
little extra video out and he was like,

1133
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,820
he said that that video is going to hurt
me and it's dirty and things they're

1134
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:34,230
going to ban me from the casting directors
won't talk to me and our response

1135
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:37,910
back was lose weight.
Wow.

1136
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,860
Did he say something like you will
always be no, he told me, he's like,

1137
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:45,410
you're going to die alone and it's going
to be your fault. He's so mean to him,

1138
01:04:45,411 --> 01:04:48,060
but I enjoy it. I don't know. I
think it's, I think it's funny.

1139
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:52,770
He's funny when he's mean instead of
Juju thing you think or do you think that

1140
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,360
is how he talks to ladies?
That's how I talked to the lady.

1141
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,670
He knows you don't want him,

1142
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:59,760
so he's lashing out at the same way you
do with those hot chicks, I guess. Yeah,

1143
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:03,450
and every time like a hot check, I'll walk
by. He's like, she taught her than you.

1144
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,580
[inaudible] is rude,

1145
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,970
but the good thing about that kind of
rude thing amongst friends is when you

1146
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,190
hear it from someone else,
let's try to hurt your feelings,

1147
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,040
but it doesn't work at all. Shut up
stupid. Yeah. I got this the first time

1148
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,310
I've heard that dummy.
Exactly. Yeah. All right.

1149
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,650
Do you ever say anything negative to
him? Not really. I'm pretty nice. I,

1150
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,950
I've got some ideas, some shit down
for claim to give you some information.

1151
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,340
Shit's discuss. So I bought hall
and you haven't seen Jew clam.

1152
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,710
If you just googled Jew
cloud, it is. You should.

1153
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:40,510
Fear has had apparently ferocious
hemorrhoids his entire life and they have

1154
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:43,330
malformed his bottle.
He says it's all back to normal now,

1155
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:45,730
but I don't believe him. I don't even
think he knows what the fuck normal is.

1156
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:50,430
He always thinks it's supposed to
feel like sitting on bubble gum. Yeah.

1157
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,500
It's like you remember that chick that
got her face bitten off by the chimpanzee?

1158
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:58,360
Yeah, we fixed it. We fixed your
face paint. No, fixing that bottle.

1159
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,990
That thing is, I don't
know what happened, but uh,

1160
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,960
so you've seen his bottle on a video?
Yeah.

1161
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:08,410
So he didn't take that it would hurt your
career at this, you being dirty stuff?

1162
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,890
No. Most a lot of people, all
the comics don't think it will.

1163
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,020
I mean the Disney channel
probably won't look at me anymore.

1164
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,310
You don't need that shit. You're funny.
If you're funny, just keep doing comedy.

1165
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,980
Keep doing what you think is funny.
Look at Sarah Silverman.

1166
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:23,390
She's dirty as foxes and everything.

1167
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:27,200
Selling fucking books are in the New York
Times bestsellers and movies is always

1168
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:30,110
on television. You know, you don't have
to be clean. Yeah. That's nonsense.

1169
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,800
That's if what that's all
that is is people with a,

1170
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,310
they're shortsighted with limited
imagination that are trying to sell you.

1171
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,300
That's all it is.

1172
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:43,250
They think that they have to sell you as
someone who squeaky clean. Why the why?

1173
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:46,310
That's what everybody else is doing. You
know what, what is your personality like?

1174
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:49,940
What's coming out of your own brain and
obviously your brain is very complicated.

1175
01:06:49,941 --> 01:06:53,180
It's not going to be right down the
middle and squeaky clean and always,

1176
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:57,500
you know, fucking softball
bullshit, you know,

1177
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,770
whatever the fuck's on your
mind, what it out, you know,

1178
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,910
it's harder and it's easier. It's harder
for a little bit because you know,

1179
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:06,650
then people were like,
why is she swearing?

1180
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:09,710
I don't like when she talks about cock,
but then after a while,

1181
01:07:09,711 --> 01:07:11,360
you know it's good because you're like,
hey,

1182
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,740
you want to go see that
little list or yeah, I love,

1183
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:16,850
she talks about car people know and then
they'll go see it and look forward to

1184
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:17,370
it.

1185
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,600
You need to talk about cock on stage more.

1186
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:24,680
I don't actually ever super
clean onstage. Yes. Wearing no.

1187
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:27,800
I mean sometimes it will slip out, but
because that video is pretty dirty. It is.

1188
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:31,430
But I don't say anything dirty. And the
video is [inaudible] dot com as well.

1189
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,760
Yeah. I just make other people
say dirty things, right? Yeah.

1190
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:36,380
But you're pretty demented onstage though.

1191
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,430
How am I diminishing like squeaky
clean? Like, Hey, we went,

1192
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,250
did I wear my heart on my sleeve?
Like I'm very much whatever mood I'm in,

1193
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:45,110
I just go,
well that sounds like fun.

1194
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,300
I'm going to cunty mode.
I didn't want to pee up here performing,

1195
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:54,650
but that's what he does really want
to fuck me, whatever like that.

1196
01:07:54,651 --> 01:07:59,100
But sometimes you have to be like that
to discover things. Hmm. That could

1197
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,090
true.

1198
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:03,240
Or it could be an excuse
for not controlling your
behavior that you look at it.

1199
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:04,530
Like why I don't want to be organized.

1200
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:06,540
Because if I was organized
and I wouldn't be creative,

1201
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,620
a lot of people like they don't develop
discipline and they don't do the things

1202
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:13,560
they're supposed to do and they'll somehow
or another justified in their head,

1203
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:17,720
well, hey then this is how I discover
this is high. Take chances up there.

1204
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:20,690
It's like the brilliant
point actually. But I, I'm,

1205
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,180
I'm working on my organizational skills,
but no,

1206
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:27,650
I sometimes you have very prepared
things and sometimes I'm just like,

1207
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,040
I'm going to, I just want to try
and riff as much as possible.

1208
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,630
I think that's a great thing.
I riff a lot.

1209
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:34,580
I do a lot of question and
answer stuff on my shows.

1210
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:38,510
But what's important to me is I got to
go on stage with a good frame of mind.

1211
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,410
You know,

1212
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:43,580
it's very important but I mean you're
talking probably like these 45 minute sets

1213
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:46,250
or whatever. I'm talking like a three
minute potlucks out of the comedy store.

1214
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,830
Like I might be in a country mood, but
even that like why, why go up there then?

1215
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:55,310
Why, you know, I mean yes and no. I mean
why not take some chances? Who knows?

1216
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,350
But it's not like that
all the time at all.

1217
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,740
I've had friends that have had real
problems with not being able to regulate

1218
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:03,200
their state of mind before they
go on stage. And like you'll,

1219
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,150
you'll have some sets that are great.

1220
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,460
And then other sets where
you can tell there's like,

1221
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:10,730
there's like some disconnect between
them and the audience. You know,

1222
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:14,930
we had a buddy that was going through
a long stretch of shitty sets and he

1223
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,930
wasn't telling us what apparently his
girlfriend had broken up with them and

1224
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:21,020
moved out and he didn't tell us and we,
we were were like,

1225
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,810
what the fuck is wrong with this dude?
Like when you talk to him,

1226
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:26,930
he's like barely there. It's like,
it's weird like something's going on.

1227
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,020
And then one day, you know, we were eating
and he told us the whole story. I'll,

1228
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:31,310
she broke up with me
and this and I'm like,

1229
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:34,940
we were going to say anything like you
fucking Weirdo. Like for like months,

1230
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:38,140
you know, we're like a, so that
was a check. Everything good. Yeah,

1231
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,250
everything's great shit.

1232
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,660
And meanwhile we were wondering what
this dude was falling apart on stage,

1233
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,490
you know, like kind of harness
that and talk about the breakup.

1234
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,340
Then you create a lot more
stuff if you're saying,

1235
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,560
but especially if you're a man.

1236
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:59,000
A lot of times the problem with men is
when men get dumped, it's like their,

1237
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,160
their,
their reason for existing is like there,

1238
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,060
it gets questioned. For a lot
of men, like when they're there,

1239
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:10,820
they're worth is like gone to zero. You
know, they, they don't feel valuable.

1240
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,520
They feel like a loser. You
know, like a man gets dumped,

1241
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:17,090
a woman leaves him for another man. She
takes off and like your step by yourself,

1242
01:10:17,091 --> 01:10:19,730
like you don't feel worthy
to go on stage and talk.

1243
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,910
You don't feel like anything you have
to say is valid. Like you're a zero.

1244
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,760
Like that chick just broke up with you
and she's probably got another dude's

1245
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:29,330
Dick in her mouth right now and you're
thinking about this and you're like, fuck.

1246
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:29,871
And you,
you know,

1247
01:10:29,871 --> 01:10:33,200
you make mistakes and you call her or
trying to get her back and he say stupid

1248
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:36,200
shit. Like let's just try one
more time. And then she says no.

1249
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:39,560
And then she hangs up the phone. You're
like, what the fuck? I'm just a loser.

1250
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:43,340
And then tried going onstage right then
and there and they're ready. Go, you know,

1251
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:47,410
ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome
Mike mcfuck stick and Mike like,

1252
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,660
fuck stick goes up there and just
eat shit. I've had to do that,

1253
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,780
but I've never done to anyone. I always
get broken up with really always. Oh,

1254
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:58,430
I've only had like four boyfriends,
but wow. Well, you know what?

1255
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:01,850
You're going to get the opportunity to
dump this new one. You can. You could,

1256
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,700
you could fucking pull the strings
on this one. This can be your first.

1257
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,450
What are you guys talking about? I don't
know. Her just got some new boyfriend.

1258
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:13,350
It's really cool to have the black. Did
they blocked in big, big block too. Um,

1259
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,540
have you ever dated a black guy? No.
No you wouldn't. What about a mud race?

1260
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,460
What's the Monterrey one?

1261
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,410
Just make sure if you're an ignorant
racist in some, I don't know

1262
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,340
Brown people. No, I'm not an ignorant
racist. I'm just making jokes.

1263
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,280
You know, some jungle dude. Some fucking,
I don't know. I don't date on this date.

1264
01:11:38,281 --> 01:11:41,580
A dude from Vietnam? I don't think
so. I don't know. I ever meet. Yeah.

1265
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:45,770
And wouldn't choose smoke cigarettes?
No.

1266
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,750
What do you look for in
a guy besides red hair

1267
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,010
from, um, I don't know. I don't
really look for things in guys.

1268
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:00,540
I just, if a guy like is, I don't know.
There's nothing. I have no answer.

1269
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,220
What's it like going from Chicago?
Meaning like Chicago guys,

1270
01:12:03,221 --> 01:12:04,930
regular dudes eating sausage and shit.

1271
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,880
Well, I'll say this. I went literally
two and a half years in college.

1272
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:14,230
No boy ever hit on me and I was like,
no,

1273
01:12:14,231 --> 01:12:18,020
I didn't even kiss anyone. Like I was
two and a half years in college. Yeah.

1274
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:22,170
In College. Pillows get fucked. Everything
gets fucking college. But I didn't,

1275
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,550
I didn't drink, I didn't
go out. I wasn't social.

1276
01:12:24,551 --> 01:12:26,320
I was really into comedy and stuff then.

1277
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:30,700
But I mean sit in like meat guys
during doing the comedy stuff.

1278
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,500
Not really.
Not of interest to you or then?

1279
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:41,050
I think both. Really? Yeah. I mean I
went to like one of the big 10 schools.

1280
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:46,051
So there's all these like really
pretty Midwestern like sweet girls.

1281
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:51,520
Yeah. Why? Like all those
guys, the sorority people,

1282
01:12:51,521 --> 01:12:55,330
you know, people go from them losers.
I'm like there, I'm like the weird

1283
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,900
nerd. And did you ever do comedy
at a Sorority? No, I didn't. No,

1284
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,930
no, I was living in Boston. I did a
fraternities couple times. Really? Yeah.

1285
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:09,120
Yeah. It was just like basements
and shit. Go down the handle,

1286
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:13,350
like a little mic set up and 50 dudes
in a room and tell call me strange.

1287
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,560
There's a lot of places to do comedy.
When I lived in Boston,

1288
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:21,360
there was a ton of like satellite rooms
and bar rooms and you got to get all

1289
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:24,660
kinds of different looks. You know how
you're talking about the saddle ranch,

1290
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,670
you know, those, those are
terrible shows to do. Yeah.

1291
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,950
But they're good shows to do to, you know,
up to a certain point. Some guys just,

1292
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,760
I remember, uh, um, who the fuck was it?

1293
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:40,170
Freddy? Freddy Soto was the first
one to say it. He, uh, you know,

1294
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:43,380
he was a very funny guy that
passed away a few years ago,

1295
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,860
but he was a comedy store regular. And
dudes would always be like, Hey Freddy,

1296
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:51,180
I'm doing a show at, you know, the Mikes
pub down the street on Tuesday nights.

1297
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:54,450
You know, and you want to come by and do a
set. And He'd be like, thank you. But uh,

1298
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,610
you know,
I only do comedy clubs like I'm done.

1299
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,730
I'm done with all that nonsense because
the nonsense the have to deal with when

1300
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,220
you're doing comedy in a non comedy club,
you know,

1301
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,840
the bar and the noise and people talk
and especially in Hollywood, you know.

1302
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:07,940
But those are good too.
Yeah.

1303
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,190
Oh yeah. I mean I'm desperate for
that right now. Stage is stage time.

1304
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,920
It's, I'll take what I can get. But yeah,

1305
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:17,860
I definitely prefer the comedy
club setting. I mean who wouldn't,

1306
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,970
but don't you think that it's
good to do those shitholes yeah.

1307
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:23,860
Cause it makes you like really
grab people's attention. Yeah.

1308
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:28,620
I mean you have to really command everyone
in the room and also you have to just

1309
01:14:28,621 --> 01:14:31,350
sort of deal with the fact that some
people are not going to pay attention to

1310
01:14:31,351 --> 01:14:32,940
you and they're going to drink
and they're going to heckle.

1311
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:36,630
And they're going to shout, show me your
tits. And you know, stuff like that.

1312
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,450
You just, it's, it's part
of that and it's, it's fun,

1313
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:44,540
but it also will show me your tits. No,
no, no. You don't know. But I laugh at,

1314
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,230
I don't hate it. I'm like, okay,

1315
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:49,860
you're drunk and you think that that's
funny if you say it so I understand and

1316
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:52,380
you don't know how to be
funny in another way. Wow.

1317
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,150
Cut it down. You break it down like
guys just sitting there like was

1318
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,360
from Iowa so we roll.
Yeah.

1319
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,700
Girls on stage and say show us
your tits cause you never know.

1320
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:08,210
I'm just taking a chance. You did
all the Improv classes too, right?

1321
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:12,370
Like the second city and shit.
Like a bio in Chicago and travel and Joe,

1322
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:12,930
what does that,

1323
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:17,250
it's like, it used to be called Improv
Olympic. It's like where Chris Farley,

1324
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:18,370
all those Improv people.
Yeah.

1325
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,000
And you were just going to
give us the abbreviation.

1326
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:21,950
Like everybody knew what the fuck
you were talking about. They,

1327
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,090
I think [inaudible],

1328
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:26,300
I think they just call it Iot are not
allowed to call it some kind of like

1329
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:30,650
Olympic lawsuit Olympic or
Improv Olympic really can,

1330
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,440
you can have a club Improv
with all the comedy clubs.

1331
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,000
I would think that that
would be more of an issue.

1332
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:38,570
Well I think Olympics is actually like a
ne, isn't it? An Olympics? Like a name?

1333
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:41,660
Like it's like a coca cola.
Yeah. Oh is it really? Yeah.

1334
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,890
So it's called Io trademark the
Olympics because I think they made it,

1335
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,420
didn't that, wasn't it around in the
Greek days? Oh yeah, no. Yeah, it wasn't.

1336
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,060
It was it. Yeah. The Olympic cows. Oh,

1337
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,720
how long does the Olympic
Games are going on for?

1338
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:59,810
Was a lot of Roman numerals connects,
you know, you look at that, that's like,

1339
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,800
someday there's going to be UFC in Roman
numerals is getting too many numbers.

1340
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,830
Totally have to go with centuries,
two x's and shit.

1341
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,070
Did you ever think to like maybe try like
a Saturday night live skit or is that

1342
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:14,690
something you wanted to do?
Like kind of like a, you know,
like a live Improv? Yeah,

1343
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,420
totally. I mean, I grew up
watching that show. That's like,

1344
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:23,220
would you prefer to goal like a comic
or would you still be a comic or is it,

1345
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:25,130
is it the comic thing that you,

1346
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:28,250
I dunno. I mean I, I'm playing
everything by ear. You know,

1347
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:31,340
I don't know what's going to happen with,
but I'm interested in all of it.

1348
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:34,550
I just like getting on stage and making
people laugh and being myself. Right?

1349
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:38,300
So I'm playing characters too,
but right now I think it comes in phases.

1350
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,730
Sometimes I'm more
interested in what can I,

1351
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,030
what character can I create and what
can I do? And then other times I'm like,

1352
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:47,210
I just want to be myself and talk and
what are my thoughts and how can I get

1353
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:50,570
them out there? And that's sort of
what I'm in right now. Just stand up.

1354
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,850
It's way harder for a way harder
for a girl to get into comedy.

1355
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,720
Way Harder when you're on stage,
people don't want to hear you talk.

1356
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:02,740
A lot of men do not want to hear a
woman talk for 10 minutes or an hour.

1357
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:06,430
And how many dudes want to go pay to see
Ellen degenerates do comedy, you know,

1358
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,060
three to know that aren't
gay. You can come on. Really.

1359
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,380
I mean it's like one of those. I mean,
you might, I would, I would have a dad.

1360
01:17:13,381 --> 01:17:14,930
She's good. You know
what I'm saying? Like,

1361
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:18,110
it's like you have some no name woman
headliner at the Improv in Cleveland.

1362
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:20,870
Good fucking luck selling
tickets. Good luck. It's conti.

1363
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:24,280
Mcgillicuddy from fucking from
nowhere. Where's she been? Well,

1364
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:27,740
she was on comedy central wants. Wow.
Yeah, whatever. Let's go to the movies.

1365
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,020
You know, it's very hard to sell
tickets. It's very hard at black.

1366
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:34,300
I though the like, look at that black guy.
Probably funny. I'll take a chance. Yeah.

1367
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,400
Black Man. Probably
funny, right? White girl.

1368
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:41,540
The fuck is she got to say
since this silly bitch out
to say what's your favorite

1369
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:46,220
comics? Um, I really
into Louis C K right now.

1370
01:17:46,221 --> 01:17:50,630
I love his show. Louie.
Yeah. Great. Great.

1371
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:51,830
Great question for me to add.

1372
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,960
So what I was saying about, but
girls doing comedy, like you,

1373
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,630
you don't get as many different things
you're allowed to talk about either you

1374
01:18:00,631 --> 01:18:01,920
can't have opinions on,

1375
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,940
you can't call people don when it comes
to politics or opinions on, you know,

1376
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:09,030
the president or opinions on
the way the world should be run.

1377
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:13,800
Like you enter into like a danger zone
where there's knee jerk reactions where

1378
01:18:13,801 --> 01:18:17,340
people automatically don't want
to hear a young girl with opinion.

1379
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,810
Right? Well already. Yeah,

1380
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:22,950
because I look so young people sort of
don't trust that I have a brain and on

1381
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:27,570
top of the fact that I'm a girl. But so
I mean, luckily like I'm not right now,

1382
01:18:27,571 --> 01:18:32,280
at least where I am, I'm not talking
about political stuff and topical stuff.

1383
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:36,480
I'm really just sort of talking about
what are my thoughts and feelings on

1384
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,320
myself or on the situation that I
just experienced. Like it's just,

1385
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,690
you know,
I'm not getting into in depth in Paul,

1386
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,490
what would something, I'm sure, but, um,

1387
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,370
but what if something happened
and it was relevant to your life?

1388
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:51,940
Like what if there were some new political
decision or some new local law or

1389
01:18:51,941 --> 01:18:53,560
whatever that is relevant to your life.

1390
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:55,720
You might start talking about it
and saying, yeah, like, you know,

1391
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:58,120
like what if you had a really good
friend and the friend was trying to get

1392
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,170
married and they were gay,

1393
01:18:59,171 --> 01:19:02,950
and then all of a sudden the law passed
and you couldn't marry gay people

1394
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:03,850
anymore,
couldn't get married.

1395
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,250
You would say something
about that, right? Yeah.

1396
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,400
That would upset me and I'm
sure I would talk about it

1397
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,750
and then there'd be some guy
in the audience goes, fucking,

1398
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:13,310
if I wanted to hear your fucking opinion,

1399
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,280
I'd be a to you.

1400
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:21,500
Yeah, I don't know. Then I
would just say like, thank
you, sir. Please sit back down.

1401
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:21,610
Yeah.

1402
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:24,670
So you're preparing your prepare yourself
for all these people to say shitty

1403
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,190
things to you.

1404
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,650
Yeah, I mean, I'm used to it. I
mean, like you said before, you know,

1405
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:30,500
if you get it from your friends first,
when you get it from the outside world,

1406
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:31,334
it's not so bad.

1407
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,020
Yeah. Yeah. Our sphere is helping you,

1408
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,250
but I have always admired
chicks doing comedy. It's,

1409
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:41,390
it's more difficult than men
doing it I think. I think it's a,

1410
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:43,220
it's a totally different
animal and it's like,

1411
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,310
it's like women's mixed martial arts too.
You know,

1412
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:49,670
like a lot of people don't like watching
women fight like Yo, much more crazy.

1413
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:52,880
It is for a chick to be fighting.
That's like a dude fighting with swords.

1414
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,940
You know, like men want to
fight, it fills, it's normal.

1415
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,090
But for chicks to actually train
and fight and pick a girl, I'm like,

1416
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:00,920
listen bitch,
at six weeks we're going to throw down.

1417
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,100
You better fucking ready and then you
run it up pills and shit and throwing

1418
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:07,710
sandbags around for a girl to actually
do that. That bitch has got to be crazy.

1419
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,450
You know,
like off the deep end.

1420
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:11,690
Crazy like 10 times crazier
than a man is doing it.

1421
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,190
The,
they're tough cookies.

1422
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:17,960
I once had lunch with this chicken knock
Amera she's like an undefeated champion

1423
01:20:17,961 --> 01:20:21,200
boxer and she like just,
they're tough.

1424
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:26,100
That's where she's really hot. You wish
really, you would have went with it?

1425
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:29,820
Probably she reigned over and just
grabbed the hairs on the back of your neck

1426
01:20:29,821 --> 01:20:34,060
and just ball them up and just
controlled your head. Just about,

1427
01:20:34,061 --> 01:20:37,370
my cat's trying to get in here, get out
here. You fuck. Would you let her happen?

1428
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:40,720
Did that? I guess I
would. Yeah, you would.

1429
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,170
And you would let her.
So you're down for a lesbian experiences.

1430
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,000
Just the chick's got to pull the
trigger. Not the, I guess I, I mean,

1431
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:52,260
I'm pretty easy going, so whatever
happens, you're pretty easy going.

1432
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,050
There's no guys that ever say that.
What you're thinking about gay sex?

1433
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:02,900
I'm pretty easy going. My family,
my family thinks I'm a lesbian.

1434
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,620
Really? Yeah. Why is that?

1435
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:07,200
Because you're not married with
a child already that well, no.

1436
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:11,240
I think just my mom is when I went
through college and not, didn't date,

1437
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,220
my mom's like, oh yeah,
maybe you're a lesbian.

1438
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,510
I have a neighbor who has a
gay son for sure. Really? Yeah.

1439
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:23,160
The kids like 10 now. Oh, and I've
been saying the kids gay forever.

1440
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,630
Not that there's anything wrong with it,
but I mean I've been saying like, look,

1441
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,960
there's this kid is gay and everyone's
like, you can't say that. You know,

1442
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:33,930
he's around his mom all the time. His
Dad's always working. I'm on stop it.

1443
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,490
Stop it.
The kid's gay

1444
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,150
sometimes, you know? I mean in my opinion,

1445
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:41,480
I think you're born gay and
it's like being a comedian.

1446
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:42,980
This is actually important to me.

1447
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,400
Like you're born a comedian and you
just figure it out as you go along.

1448
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,480
Yeah.
I don't think you're born a comedian.

1449
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:52,200
I think you're raised in a fucked up
way that makes you want a lot more

1450
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:54,740
attention than a normal person gets and a,

1451
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,810
it's to compensate from the
lack of attention that you
got when you were younger

1452
01:21:57,811 --> 01:22:00,880
and that's why I become a performer.
That's why everyone becomes a performer.

1453
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,510
I think that's probably a more
intelligent way of looking at it.

1454
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,430
Maybe not everyone,
I shouldn't say everyone cause some,

1455
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:08,970
I've met some people that just got
into it and they had great childhoods.

1456
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:13,420
I did. I had a great childhood I
think, and no one believes me. I did.

1457
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,620
Doesn't sound like it from all the shit
you're saying. You were tortured. I mean,

1458
01:22:16,621 --> 01:22:19,360
I was tortured by everyone else,
but I'm really close with my mom and dad.

1459
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,670
It doesn't have to be a mom and dad,
you know?

1460
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:25,900
It could be just all the feelings of
alienation that you felt when you were

1461
01:22:25,901 --> 01:22:28,630
younger. Yeah, I think that's a good,

1462
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:33,190
I always wonder like I have this crazy
theory that gets over talked about on

1463
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:38,170
this show that the entire world, that
everything, all the events, car accidents,

1464
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:41,650
you dropped the book, you
know, you move into the, the,

1465
01:22:41,651 --> 01:22:43,720
this lane in the parking lot.

1466
01:22:43,721 --> 01:22:47,380
Like all these things are all somehow
or another connected like some giant

1467
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:51,610
fucking mathematical program and
that really shitty parents and shitty

1468
01:22:51,611 --> 01:22:55,910
situations growing up that like coming
out of those things, it's like the force,

1469
01:22:55,911 --> 01:23:00,610
the negative force of those things makes
the rebound like so much greater and it

1470
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:04,420
makes the, the, the creativity so much
greater with a person that makes you know,

1471
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:06,190
makes the to perform,

1472
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:06,971
you know,

1473
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:10,330
and the crazy ability to create something
special because the fact that you

1474
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:13,960
desperately want this attention and then
all these people benefit from that and

1475
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:16,900
like, you know, like people that go to
see it like wow, they had this great time.

1476
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:17,980
Why they have a great time?

1477
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:20,680
Well they had a great time
because somewhere along the
line this kid got fucked

1478
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:21,610
with,
you know,

1479
01:23:21,611 --> 01:23:26,230
so that negative of that blossoms out and
becomes this performance and then it's

1480
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:30,040
all somehow another balanced out.
That's pretty intense.

1481
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:35,950
I mean it is. I mean look, that's where
sluts come from, right? Sluts come from,

1482
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:39,430
they don't, they didn't get
enough attention. It's always
the same story, but guys,

1483
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:40,780
look,
men,

1484
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,550
it's very convenient that slots exist
because if every time you had sex you have

1485
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:49,900
to be in some like fucking
serious relationship and
God, that's a lot of work.

1486
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,450
You know like maybe sometimes I'm
confused. I don't know where I'm at.

1487
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:55,240
And you just want to go around and
fuck around. Well you need slots man,

1488
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,590
or a flashlight or a flashlights.
I liked the way you segway young lady.

1489
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:02,710
You really know how to work this.
I see big things.

1490
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,350
When are we expecting the
literal Esther podcasts?

1491
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:09,790
You can start your own podcast
in the works. It's in the
works. Is it really? Yes,

1492
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,790
it would be good. I think you'd be good
at that shit. Yeah. And you could, I can,

1493
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,970
you can interview Unicorns and stuff.
Yeah,

1494
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:18,040
it's a good way to develop material too.

1495
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,250
So you're doing like three
minutes sets for the most part,

1496
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:23,770
like five minutes on Sundays and Mondays.

1497
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:28,690
And then like whenever I just searched
for bar shows and spots at the comedy

1498
01:24:28,691 --> 01:24:33,160
clubs. And so yeah, like I'd say
eight minutes. It's like a good,

1499
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:38,290
what's the most time we've ever
done on stage? Um, like 20, 20.

1500
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:42,280
That's like the weird, that's like when
it begins to get strange. Yes. Right.

1501
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:43,750
Like you'll like God,
am I still up here?

1502
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:49,300
I'm still talking like the transition
between like those little short sets and

1503
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:50,500
like doing a real set,

1504
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:55,510
you know it's definitely different and
especially too like I've gotten so used

1505
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:57,880
to just having to prepare
three or five minutes.

1506
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:02,560
So now it's like harder to be
like oh I have to keep going.

1507
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,790
Yeah it's definitely how you use Twitter,
Twitter, a lot to write, don't you?

1508
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,330
Cause I ever since I was like,

1509
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:13,690
I guess in high school I used to carry
a notebook around with me and just

1510
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:16,600
anything that like struck me as weird,
I would write it down.

1511
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,570
And that's sort of like
how I've transitioned.

1512
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,630
Like that's my Twitter page now and it
just so I can remember it because I want

1513
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:23,920
to make it something later.

1514
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,160
Twitter is great because it
gives you only 140 characters,

1515
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,130
which makes it kind of an art form.
Like you have to edit.

1516
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:34,720
And funny and usually that's good though.
I always find that I get too verbose.

1517
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:35,940
There's too many words.
If I just,

1518
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:38,410
you just leave me alone with
everything already got done. Blog.

1519
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:41,710
And so 160,000 characters long.
I'll just keep going.

1520
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,430
But really it should be a couple
sentences. You don't use extra words.

1521
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,050
It helps comedy. That's like
a good comedy tool. Yes. Yeah.

1522
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:52,180
140 characters is perfect. It's
not even a text message. You know?

1523
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:55,960
You just gotta be safe. Be
able to say something funny,
really quick. It's just a,

1524
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:58,780
it's a strange thing that we can connect
to each other like this. You know,

1525
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,510
there's never been a time in human
history where it's so easy to get in touch

1526
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:04,010
with human beings. You don't
need a magazine, you don't need a

1527
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,850
new station. I mean, look at this. We're
just talking right now. We're, we're,

1528
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,490
you know,

1529
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:11,450
my fucking office and we're connected
and hundreds of thousands of people

1530
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:13,640
download this. It's, it's very strange.

1531
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,110
You're going to have a lot of new
people masturbating to you. Oh

1532
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:20,460
yeah. No. Thousands right
now. There's guys with dig out
right now. You're so wrong.

1533
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:24,630
Zero. Elster you're so exciting. Oh No.

1534
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,370
You just became a hundred
times more exciting.

1535
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:30,240
Why all the stories
you've told God damn girl.

1536
01:26:31,210 --> 01:26:35,920
Uh, does that freak you out? No. Do you
think you've ever posed for playboy? Um,

1537
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:39,600
I actually interned for playboy in
college and that's not the same thing.

1538
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:44,430
Um, I don't know where ever were
you ever thrown into the humanics?

1539
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:47,040
The Hefner mixed? No. No. I was not.

1540
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,180
I was not on that pretty side of
things. If you got famous, you know,

1541
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:55,100
and you got an offer, do you think you
pose for playboy? Probably. I mean, what?

1542
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:58,270
Hustler? No. No, not
too much in penthouse.

1543
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,000
I don't know the difference
between all of them,

1544
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:02,840
but I was a nude model and
different sheet. All of them.

1545
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,240
Playboy playboys, impossible to jerk
off to. Right. Unless you're desperate.

1546
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,440
If you're jerking off to play ball,

1547
01:27:07,441 --> 01:27:10,680
you might as well be jerking off the JC
Penney's catalog. Who are we kidding?

1548
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:15,310
They're all impossible to jerk off to.
Now our brains, I've gone past photos. Uh,

1549
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:15,721
you know,

1550
01:27:15,721 --> 01:27:19,230
not necessarily if you gotta do what you
gotta do really trapped in Alabama in a

1551
01:27:19,231 --> 01:27:23,080
hotel room, there's no internet
connection. Now there's a seven, 11,

1552
01:27:23,081 --> 01:27:24,270
and you just close your eyes.
Yeah.

1553
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,800
Thinking about like my cousin
or something cause was kidding.

1554
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:32,110
I said her dream weaver.
We'll have to end with that song.

1555
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:35,320
Can you continue to download that song?

1556
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:36,850
That's how we're going to
end the podcast back. Yeah,

1557
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,610
but I like playing a song from the
70s yeah, I think it's cool. Yeah,

1558
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,980
it's cool.
I like I said earlier,

1559
01:27:44,981 --> 01:27:49,480
like I have a thing for very
pretty put together ladies being

1560
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,560
Mrs. Reagan had a really
interesting point.

1561
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:55,610
She said that she thought it was funny
that playboy used to be like the girl

1562
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:59,840
next door and penthouse was like
these really skanky whores. She goes,

1563
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:02,780
but now it seems like Penn
houses like regular girls,

1564
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:05,360
they look like more like
real girls and playboy.

1565
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:09,440
It's like all these bleach blondes. It's
like the same look over and over again.

1566
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:13,790
The Holly Madison type look, it's
like, it's a, an an manufactured look.

1567
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:15,380
It's like that's become
the look of playboy.

1568
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:19,340
And I think it happened when somebody
around, when Hugh Hefner stop fucking,

1569
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,670
he just like, just like
fucking, you know what I mean?

1570
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:26,000
It wasn't like what he was attracted
to. Yeah. There's like all of a sudden,

1571
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:28,250
you know,
we used to be like the girl next door man.

1572
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:32,090
But somehow on another girl next door is
not as attractive as it used to be to a

1573
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:34,820
lot of people. A lot of people would
just rather have the whores, you know,

1574
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:38,660
it's just like lit. I want big
stupid looking fake tits and dirty.

1575
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:41,630
I want to know that you're
going to definitely take
it in the mouth right away.

1576
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:45,320
You know? I don't want to have to talk
you into anything. You're a freak here.

1577
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:50,130
Dirty Bitch. Professionally. They do
like that. Why? Because we're sad.

1578
01:28:50,131 --> 01:28:54,830
Sad little monkeys. Well, it's exciting.
It's exciting. It's exciting wars.

1579
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,990
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you don't
get that. I don't know.

1580
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,100
It seems because it's rare.
Yeah. Yeah. It is exciting.

1581
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,270
And why are they doing it? They're doing
it because they've got a deficit, right?

1582
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:09,510
Something. Yeah. The same thing that
the reason why people become comedians,

1583
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:13,200
except usually there's abuse involved
in porn. Yeah. Almost always.

1584
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,860
Every single one that I've ever really
sat down and talked to after a while,

1585
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,450
you get to the heart of the matter.
There's something,

1586
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:19,890
something happened that
shouldn't have happened.

1587
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,110
Also,
to be a comedian,

1588
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:24,170
I think you have to have a very
strong brain and be really,

1589
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:25,640
I think you have to be really smart.

1590
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:30,700
Yeah. Yeah. You can't, it's hard to,
you can't just be molested. No, no.

1591
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,770
That would be nice. What
have you got? A good body.

1592
01:29:33,771 --> 01:29:36,980
You can have like a chimp
brain still do porn. There's,

1593
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:40,640
there's a lot of open miker is that
when you watch them, you can totally go.

1594
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:44,780
I don't think even if this guy did
it for 20 years, he will ever get it.

1595
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:47,410
You'll ever be funny. Yeah,
so I think that that there's,

1596
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,410
there's something to that.

1597
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,520
You have to be definitely smarter or at
least at some level with something. Yeah.

1598
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:55,910
There's a lot of people that they don't
understand what it really is. You know?

1599
01:29:55,911 --> 01:29:57,500
They don't know what the
fuck they're really doing.

1600
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,340
I've had friends that do it that they
tried to do it and I've thought they'd be

1601
01:30:01,341 --> 01:30:05,180
able to do it and then they could never
figure out how to talk to an audience

1602
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:09,190
like, like a, just like a bunch
of people, you know, they could,

1603
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,000
they never figured out
how to and be themselves.

1604
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:14,420
They never figured out how to tap into
it and they just were terrible where I

1605
01:30:14,421 --> 01:30:17,900
thought they were like Eddie Bravo was,
he bombed. Like he did it like nine times.

1606
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,950
He bombed horribly, like six of those nine
times. He could never get it together.

1607
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:25,010
But if you talked to him in person, he
was always funny. He would say funny shit.

1608
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,770
Like, why? Why can't you go up
there and do that? Like what is it?

1609
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:32,440
We will have an idea of like
being a standup comedian
and they don't realize you

1610
01:30:32,441 --> 01:30:33,370
just be yourself.

1611
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:34,571
There's that.

1612
01:30:34,571 --> 01:30:37,120
And there's also some people when
they're forced to be on stage with that

1613
01:30:37,121 --> 01:30:41,230
spotlight on them and there's a bunch
of strangers who don't know them and you

1614
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:43,330
know, you're demanding the
strangers attention and then you,

1615
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:47,350
you really start to make, uh, like
an audit of your own thoughts. Like,

1616
01:30:47,351 --> 01:30:48,970
are these words, these shots, do these,

1617
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:52,150
do I really need to be the guy in front
of the microphone or am I an idiot?

1618
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,620
And you know,
those all,

1619
01:30:53,621 --> 01:30:56,380
any weird fucking insecurities
you have about who you are,

1620
01:30:56,590 --> 01:31:00,190
just come spilling out when you're trying
to get people to laugh and you have a

1621
01:31:00,191 --> 01:31:03,610
microphone and you're the one that gets
the mic and the light is on you and

1622
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:06,700
shit. It's scary. I think
if you can accept that,

1623
01:31:06,701 --> 01:31:11,140
you're going to say things that people
won't laugh at and it's going to be a

1624
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:12,490
year, it'll be okay. I think

1625
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:15,340
a little more comfortable.
Yeah. But that's sucks.

1626
01:31:15,341 --> 01:31:18,820
Decks sucks hard to be up there.

1627
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:22,180
And you be the one who's commanding
the attention and said, look at me,

1628
01:31:22,181 --> 01:31:26,860
look at me, look at me. And they're
like, okay, I'm looking what? Um,

1629
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,280
okay, what else? Um, yeah,

1630
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:35,040
there's something crazy that happened, you
know, hey, they can't think about it. Oh,

1631
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:39,790
I know, right? Does that feel in a
tailspin feeling when you're bombing? Oh,

1632
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:44,260
Ooh. And then you're driving home and
you're like, fuck, fuck. Oh my God,

1633
01:31:44,261 --> 01:31:47,860
I forgot about it for a second, then. Fuck
you remember it again? Shit. Fuck. Oh.

1634
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,480
Have you ever led a heckler get to you?

1635
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:52,990
Like having the heckler ever women
against one against, you know,

1636
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:57,610
all hecklers or retards?
There's no genius. There's
no genius. Fucking brilliant,

1637
01:31:57,611 --> 01:32:01,190
awesome dude. I hecklers all
cunts. They're all dumb cons.

1638
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:04,270
Don't understand what's
going on or where they are.

1639
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:08,350
Like they're so stupid. Yeah,
well, you know, they're just,

1640
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,000
they really wished they were up on stage.

1641
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,460
They just don't have the balls or the
brains or whatever the fuck it is.

1642
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:17,560
It's just our society has gotten used
to having its own input constantly.

1643
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:19,950
And Youtube videos, let me
call my aunt. She's taught,

1644
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:24,880
she's fucking talking nigger, nigger cunt.
I said that at a certain point in time.

1645
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:27,140
I wanted to get to, I want to, um,

1646
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,300
get to a point where every video that I
have that's on Youtube to somebody just

1647
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:36,160
writes nigger cunt in the comments just
because he can and no one can stop you.

1648
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,360
You know,
it's like,

1649
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:42,010
it's because you can and your
name is luck shod nine, six,

1650
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:45,250
four. You know, you could just,
who are you? You're nothing.

1651
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:48,040
You're just have voice out
there screaming into the abyss.

1652
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:52,240
Do you think there's ever going to become
a part point that like we are all like

1653
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,480
having to be like social
security numbers on the Internet.

1654
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:59,290
Meaning you cannot no longer Joe Rogan
for you are going to be your social

1655
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:01,600
security number and like they're
going to take it that way.

1656
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:05,290
Cause I think that's social security Gump
number. No, because if that's the case,

1657
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:07,930
then people will be able to get your
information. I mean, not, not, not,

1658
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,110
not actually. Just having a number like
this. So she took your fucking name,

1659
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:14,430
you cowards, you know what's your name?
Is Your name? Bob Smith will peep.

1660
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,180
Fucking Bob Smith. You Pussy. I'm Joe
Rogan. Why do you gotta hide? Well,

1661
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:21,850
I love, you know, I don't want the
people at work to know what I'm doing.

1662
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:22,980
Well then you know what this,

1663
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,590
that's a legitimate point actually not
making fun of a legitimate point for a

1664
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:27,550
lot of people.
You know,

1665
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,460
you know we were reading about
this the other day that the um,

1666
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:34,060
the number of people that get drug
tested on the job, random drug tests.

1667
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:38,170
It's like 40%. You walking
tests and set. Yeah,

1668
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:41,200
I'd make sure you smoke pot if you know
it's still testing on smoking weed.

1669
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:44,320
I don't why you editing those
videos from them. Trust me, I don't,

1670
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:46,780
I don't really test Ya. What I do is
just, I'll just collect your urine.

1671
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:50,840
So like a hobby of mine.
I showed her that Megan icicles out of it.

1672
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:53,680
Tell me about drinking your own.
Well, you could just drink it.

1673
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:58,090
You can drink your own. Does it
really do anything? I don't know.

1674
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,790
I mean you take vitamins once.
Do you know if it's good for you?

1675
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:04,480
I mean you got to read a
lot of peer reviewed papers
on the effects of vitamins.

1676
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:05,620
Then you have two objectives.

1677
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:08,230
We analyze your own performance
and you have to think, okay,

1678
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:11,710
was I working extra hard during that time?
Does that maybe why I feel better?

1679
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:13,570
I was like, was I watching
what I eat? You know,

1680
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:16,300
to really be sure that a
vitamin is benefiting you,

1681
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:19,870
you've got to have a lot of thinking
about it and you have taken over a long

1682
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:23,590
time and then not take it. So I dunno,
I only drank my piss a few times.

1683
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,030
Doesn't taste that bad.

1684
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:28,020
Would you ever drinks really in the back
of your head was like super healthy?

1685
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:30,800
Yeah. What'd you drink? So you,
which maybe tasted if we get some PR,

1686
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:34,070
you know Google searches,
well there's a lot in,

1687
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,760
you can't Google search because
there's a lot of nutty websites.

1688
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,090
They want you wearing crystals white.
You took your

1689
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:44,920
fucking recycling, your,
your, your sperm as well.

1690
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:48,340
I noticed every time I type in symptoms
and to Google, I always like, oh,

1691
01:34:48,341 --> 01:34:51,980
you have aids, you have Crohn's disease.
Oh, when you tap into your own stuff,

1692
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:55,450
like if it's just like runny nose,
back pain, you have aids, you know,

1693
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:58,100
you end up at some message board.
It's like you should

1694
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,490
just throw this symptoms into iTunes
and download Elton John Songs instead.

1695
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:06,260
There's a recent study that suggests
that all cancer is man created,

1696
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:10,040
that cancer did not exist until human
beings started fucking around with

1697
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:13,220
chemicals and polluting the
environment and eating things.

1698
01:35:13,221 --> 01:35:16,610
They're not supposed to be eating and
eating processed foods and an unnatural

1699
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:18,890
diet and that in the natural form,

1700
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:21,800
if people just ate plants
and animals and you know,

1701
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:24,950
and hunted and fished and there was no
pollution in the water and we lived like

1702
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:27,590
a nomadic hunter gatherer existence.
No cancer.

1703
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:32,140
Yes, I, that's a spirit man. I agree
with. I've always thought that that's,

1704
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,990
so what does a history
of breast cancer then?

1705
01:35:33,991 --> 01:35:36,420
Is that just a history of being
susceptible to pollution? Yeah,

1706
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:41,020
I mean radiation, all who know? I
don't know the twist and sucked.

1707
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:44,920
I don't think that's, how
do you know? As I said,

1708
01:35:44,921 --> 01:35:47,470
I don't think that breaks down DNA.
You know,

1709
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:49,510
like you're doing this constantly
and breaks down the DNA

1710
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,530
bay.
It's like the Lance Armstrong analogy.

1711
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:54,050
The reason why I want to use the last
one of those balls because it's always

1712
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:57,500
rubbing up against that seat. The ball
just get tired of it. It makes sense.

1713
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,210
That ball just tap the fuck out.

1714
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,860
You never know. I mean, but some of
it they say is genetic too. I thought

1715
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:05,480
I'm going to get Tonkin. Yeah, well that's
what I don't understand. Is it genetic?

1716
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:08,120
If is cancer people,
it's genetic that people get cancer.

1717
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:11,330
Is it a in if they haven't proven
which they have not proven.

1718
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:13,610
This is a theory that
all cancer is manmade.

1719
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:16,760
I'm sure there has to be a bunch of
people that don't believe in it that also

1720
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,370
feel just as strongly. But
if, if it is all man made,

1721
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:25,400
then all that a genetic predisposition
is you're more susceptible to whatever

1722
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:28,700
these toxins are that's creating
this ailment in your body.

1723
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:34,360
Um, right. Yeah. I, I don't know. It's,

1724
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:36,130
it's hard because yeah.

1725
01:36:36,131 --> 01:36:39,040
What can you have a genetic
predisposition to have cancer?

1726
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:39,910
Yeah. I mean, if,

1727
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:43,540
well not if what these people are
saying is that all cancer is because of

1728
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:45,040
pollution and chemicals and shit.

1729
01:36:45,041 --> 01:36:46,540
You're not supposed to have in
your body in the first place.

1730
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,510
Stuff that didn't exist in nature until
man started tampering with nature.

1731
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:54,430
If they're right, then no, you're just
more susceptible to all this bullshit.

1732
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,030
Right. I mean, what's,

1733
01:36:56,031 --> 01:37:01,031
what actually kind of boggles my mind is
that I can eat peanuts and someone else

1734
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:05,180
will eat a peanut and die.
Yeah. Cause it's so weird. Yeah.

1735
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:07,110
And we have the same body.
We all have long. Yeah.

1736
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,230
And whatever.
Right.

1737
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,940
Well that's when the autism argument
gets really trippy when you start talking

1738
01:37:10,941 --> 01:37:15,140
about vaccinations, you know, and people
go, well, vaccinations can't cause autism.

1739
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:16,910
They don't cause problems with kids.
They don't do anything.

1740
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,800
You can't even get a kid peanut butter.

1741
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,780
You're not supposed to
give a kid peanut butter,

1742
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:25,100
but it's okay to shoot all these chemicals
and these live viruses in the child.

1743
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:29,250
You're sure every child is going to be
cool with mint, not necessarily. Right.

1744
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:29,601
You know,

1745
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:33,590
and then of course they're going to
have every scientific study possible.

1746
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:35,150
They will highlight the fact that,
you know,

1747
01:37:35,151 --> 01:37:38,120
there is no connection between
this and that and that and this.

1748
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:43,100
But when you research it, you find out
that they're the, uh, um, um, uh, vaccine.

1749
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:47,060
Courts in this country have given out
thousands of different awards to families

1750
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,750
because of brain damage
caused by vaccines. Oh my God.

1751
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,340
Thousands of different kids.
I mean, it's not just one,

1752
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:55,190
and this is what they've awarded
money too. So it's not a great,

1753
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,040
it's on a black and white

1754
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,600
area. It's fucking, it's tricky.

1755
01:37:57,601 --> 01:38:01,020
Different people's bodies respond
differently to all sorts of things.

1756
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:03,060
That's why I never tell people smoke pot,
drink beer,

1757
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:04,770
do this because some people can't.

1758
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,940
Some people just drink one
beer and all of a sudden they,

1759
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:12,660
the switch goes off in their head and
they're fucked and gone. It's not mean.

1760
01:38:12,661 --> 01:38:13,500
It's probably not you.

1761
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:18,090
But for some people they have some
weird biochemical setup and you know,

1762
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:20,100
it makes them more susceptible to cancer.
You know,

1763
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:22,860
it makes them more susceptible to this,
makes them more susceptible to that.

1764
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,850
And that's just like a tomato. Like if
you don't know you're allergic tomatoes,

1765
01:38:25,851 --> 01:38:28,530
you eat a tomato, now, Bam,
you're dead. But my friend's wife,

1766
01:38:28,531 --> 01:38:30,990
her whole life has had problems
with wheat and she didn't know it.

1767
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:33,060
She didn't know she had
an allergy to wheat.

1768
01:38:33,061 --> 01:38:35,430
So she had all these health ailments,
didn't know what it was,

1769
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,340
didn't know what she had fatigue. She'd
get headaches, all these different things.

1770
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:43,340
Cut Out. Wheat gone. It's
nuts, man. I fear I haven't,

1771
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,440
I feel like I have something like
that, you know, like, yeah, totally.

1772
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:49,400
Because there's some times where it just
seems like I'm allergic to something.

1773
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:51,960
I should really get it tested out.
But then it goes away. You know,

1774
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:56,070
like guessing checking. It's really
annoying to deal with your problem, Brian,

1775
01:38:56,071 --> 01:38:59,140
is you're still smoking
cigarettes. I mean beef, you know,

1776
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:01,920
when I wasn't smoking cigarettes,
you know, and you weren't smoking,

1777
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:03,720
you were only not smoking for like a year.

1778
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,990
So your body was probably trying
to recover from the factory.

1779
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:09,290
We're smoking constantly for your whole
life. I mean when you say when you,

1780
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,910
I'm not smoking the majority of
your life you've been smoking.

1781
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:15,530
So even you saying when I'm not smoking,

1782
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,890
you're not the in the peak of health
going and fucking drinking weaker at shoes

1783
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,700
or Greg, we've got good weird Greg
through thought guy. You know,

1784
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:27,280
I mean health is such a tricky thing. As
I've gotten older, like I'm sitting here,

1785
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,480
my back fucked up or hurt my back last
night and Jujitsu it's not fuck that was

1786
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:33,240
just some sort of a muscle pull.
But as you get older,

1787
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:38,420
like for sure I recognize the differences
in good and bad behavior and the like,

1788
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:41,850
you can still have a good body and keep
your body healthy and have all this

1789
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,820
energy, but you have to be way more
diligent than when you're younger.

1790
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,310
You have to really make sure
that if I eat like shitty food,

1791
01:39:47,311 --> 01:39:48,990
if I go out and have a big fat,

1792
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:53,991
stupid cheeseburger and ice cream
Sundae and I will fucking wall is a good

1793
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:58,350
motivator. Like that hurts later
sort of. It's not that it hurts,

1794
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:02,310
I just feel like a lard ass. I feel
like I got hit with a tranquilizer dart.

1795
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:08,590
That's why like I'm up fucking bear at
the circus that ran a muck and proud

1796
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,820
fired fucking Darta
normally just lay in it.

1797
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:16,980
I don't want to hang over. You see
people dealing with hangovers. I'm like,

1798
01:40:16,981 --> 01:40:20,040
what's that?
Goddamn cheeseburgers are awesome.

1799
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:23,820
You know I went to five guys for the
first time the other day. Yeah. Yeah.

1800
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,600
Not as good as in and out.
Not as many choices and no shakes.

1801
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:31,590
I haven't been to the counter. The counter
is that another one? That's a good one.

1802
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:34,770
And so it's still pretty fucking awesome.
Don't get me wrong.

1803
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:37,290
I mean if I'm looking for something to
eat and it's right there, I'm going in,

1804
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:40,790
but the lack of shakes,
it's really disappointing.

1805
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:43,770
It's weird how the hamburger places in La,
I don't think it's,

1806
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:45,990
it's spread out out of la too much,

1807
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:49,950
but like how there's all these now
trendy burger places now in La.

1808
01:40:49,951 --> 01:40:53,980
Have you noticed this? That flood out
of nowhere you oh no. The poor thing out

1809
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,860
your habit is another one.
There's the one cup of Colab in there.

1810
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:59,440
I've been to those. Those are pretty
decent. Yeah, it was a decent,

1811
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:03,190
weird how that just came out of burgers
or on the burgers are delicious and

1812
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:04,950
Americans love murdered meat.
Yeah,

1813
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:05,980
we love it.

1814
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:10,150
We love getting somebody else to do all
the dirty work and packaging it in a

1815
01:41:10,151 --> 01:41:15,010
nice circle. Nice flat circle.
Cook it up, give it to me.

1816
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,060
I don't want to have to do anything.

1817
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:19,540
I don't want to go out and fucking grow
grass and then have the cow eat the

1818
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:23,020
grass. Then shoot the cow on the head and
hanging up by its ankles and gut it and

1819
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:28,440
process it and chop it up and grind it
down and then press it and then cook it

1820
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:33,400
and just give me a burger. Right.
Okay. And Burger King and Mcdonald's.

1821
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,530
Who knows when that fucker
was actually cooked.

1822
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,220
I mean those things are just sitting
in a bin and they flip it onto a pad,

1823
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:40,210
throw it in the microwave.

1824
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,330
I had McDonald's the other day and it's
weird how you actually don't even think

1825
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:45,920
about it when you're eating it that,
hey,

1826
01:41:45,921 --> 01:41:48,440
this is actually really
supposed to be like a hamburger.

1827
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:52,820
It's not supposed to be like I Mcdonald's.
You know? It's like different tastes.

1828
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:56,300
Right? It's like I always get the
two double cheeseburger meal. Yeah,

1829
01:41:56,301 --> 01:42:01,100
there's like hamburger cookies.
That's hilarious. But yeah,

1830
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:04,580
you don't really think of it like, wow,
this is like really good cow. You know?

1831
01:42:04,581 --> 01:42:08,530
This is a good hamburger.
No, it's, there's a website
online where a dude has a,

1832
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:11,360
he's running a running tally.
I don't know if it's legit,

1833
01:42:11,361 --> 01:42:13,670
but I think you said it's
like 180 days so far.

1834
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:18,500
He kept a happy meal and it hasn't rotted
yet. Was dried out sitting there. Yeah.

1835
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:19,490
He's got all these photos of it.

1836
01:42:19,491 --> 01:42:22,910
It was on the board was on the road and
boy thing ever seen that and he's got a

1837
01:42:22,911 --> 01:42:26,450
photo of it at 180 days and
it looks like perfect today.

1838
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,760
Preservatives are really scary.
You know,

1839
01:42:28,761 --> 01:42:30,650
what the fuck is that doing to your body?

1840
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:32,740
Ooh.

1841
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,220
Some stuff that keeps things from growing
on it that's not good to have in your

1842
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:40,180
body when your body consists of a bunch
of different positive organisms that are

1843
01:42:40,181 --> 01:42:40,810
helping you,

1844
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:44,530
you know all these different bacteria
that you need like acidophilus and

1845
01:42:44,531 --> 01:42:47,200
probiotics and what is
happening when you're eating.

1846
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:50,630
They're going to war or those
preservatives going to war with the,

1847
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,540
the good bacteria in your body.

1848
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:58,540
Dead bodies were just decomposing
a lot slower than they used to.

1849
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:02,890
I don't know really. Yeah.
That's interesting. It
sounds like some pita talk.

1850
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:04,930
This is what I've heard,
man.

1851
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,770
I don't give a fuck how quick I
rot the end of all the whole thing.

1852
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:12,580
When you die in your hair,
still still growth. Is that
true though? Oh, I hope not.

1853
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:17,630
I heard it was maybe a little
bit because it's growing, right?

1854
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,900
I mean to think like what it was already
going to grow kind of pops out like a

1855
01:43:21,901 --> 01:43:22,050
little

1856
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:24,480
cycle to it. Hm. I Dunno.

1857
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,890
There's a crazy story I watch
on HBO once where they had that.

1858
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:33,390
Do you remember that guy, Dr Baton?
He was a the autopsy guy. I believe.

1859
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:36,720
That's his name. Doctor
Badden, HBO, real autopsy.

1860
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,530
I forget what the name
of the show. Well, one,

1861
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:45,690
one of the most fascinating ones was
this one guy. His wife died. Okay.

1862
01:43:45,691 --> 01:43:49,860
And he kept preserving
her and like he was,

1863
01:43:49,861 --> 01:43:52,130
I dunno if he worked at a
home or whatever the fuck

1864
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:52,431
he did,

1865
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:56,870
but he somehow or another kind of embalmed
her body and created like a little

1866
01:43:56,871 --> 01:44:00,500
fleshlight little plastic teeth.
Okay. No, it wasn't his wife.

1867
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,730
That's why it was so creepy.

1868
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:06,080
It was one of his patients and he fell
in love with their pa some somehow or

1869
01:44:06,081 --> 01:44:08,210
another, he got this woman's,
I believe it's a patient.

1870
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:09,380
I'm fucking this whole story up now,

1871
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:14,090
the bottom line is this dude had a corpse
in his house that he kept preserved

1872
01:44:14,091 --> 01:44:18,080
and he would cover it with like gallons
and gallons of perfume and he designed

1873
01:44:18,081 --> 01:44:22,040
like a little plastic vagina. It
would fuck this plastic vagina. Yeah.

1874
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:25,640
And he stole the body from the grave yard,
like you went into the grave,

1875
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:30,560
brought it into his house and was
like covering it with perfume.

1876
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:35,150
I had bought crates of perfume.
[inaudible] blotting. Yeah.

1877
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:39,080
This rotting fucking hunk of meat that
used to be this woman and he's sticking

1878
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:42,980
his dick and like this little garden
hose that he's created for her vagina.

1879
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:47,540
I to try it once. Try once.
And people, a lot of Tequila.

1880
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,680
A lot of people do freaky
things to dead Bot.

1881
01:44:49,681 --> 01:44:53,720
It's just like something to them like
desiccating a corpse is like a huge crime.

1882
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:56,300
You know, like people that's
like, it's offensive to society.

1883
01:44:56,301 --> 01:44:59,330
It's like for a lot of people
it's like the ultimate taboo.

1884
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,910
Like dig somebody up in their head.
Look, look at me. I'm a retard.

1885
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,180
I got these fake skulls everywhere.

1886
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,780
All around. Like what is
different though? Yeah,

1887
01:45:08,781 --> 01:45:12,680
but what is this fascination like what
is the fascination with skulls and shit?

1888
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:15,680
Like this is a real one actually.
It's totally real.

1889
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,510
Oh my God, she's retarded.
Additional. It's anything real.

1890
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:24,670
It's got tribal over its head. Could. Yes.

1891
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:28,550
If you were a Maori living in nosy,
are you really?

1892
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:32,630
If someone's going to tell me something,
why? Why are they lying? I don't know.

1893
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,130
Right.
Cause you wouldn't lie.

1894
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:37,690
So it's good for you to be around
a bunch of scumbags. It's good.

1895
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,210
I have to be pretty careful.
Yeah.

1896
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:44,390
You gotta be careful to carry
a knife to the comedy store.

1897
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:49,150
How'd you become friends
with Brian on his show?

1898
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:54,050
He's on my video and thought it was funny.
And then what did he do?

1899
01:45:54,051 --> 01:45:58,830
Did he bust a move? What did he do?
You can tell and I can't remember.

1900
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:02,370
I came up the year, I was like, I just
went to the, no, wait, where did he say,

1901
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:07,640
can I be your stalker? Oh
God, Brian. No, I said,

1902
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:10,700
your video was cool.
And then I said I'm going to be stalker.

1903
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:14,510
And then every time I walked by it I
think I was like, you're so awesome.

1904
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:19,100
Or something like that. Don't like
that. Wow. Really smooth pickup movies.

1905
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,660
Pickup. Well, it's worked.

1906
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:27,920
We've successfully made a lot of videos.
They get pretty awesome.

1907
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,020
You guys just killed the shit out of
this conversation. Fucking faggotry

1908
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,120
so what is gay?

1909
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,010
Yeah, you can't say that right?
How? How sensitive are you to that?

1910
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:43,290
Like the idea that there's certain things
that are offensive to talk about and,

1911
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:46,820
and, and expressions. Like you
can't say gay, like that's gay,

1912
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:50,550
like that really bothers
a lot of people. Um, it's

1913
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:54,660
hard. I mean sometimes I say oh and bumps
friends, you'll say that's gay, right?

1914
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:59,160
Not really. I've tried to police myself
on it a little bit, but it's definitely,

1915
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,760
I know, I know that it's not
rooted in some sort of evil hatred.

1916
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:07,320
I love gay people. I, like I said, I
probably am gay, so it's hard for me.

1917
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:09,900
I don't know. I, but it's tricky, right?

1918
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:12,600
Sometimes people say it and
they don't mean it. I mean,

1919
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:15,300
I say faggot all the time and I do too.
Yeah.

1920
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:17,820
Sometimes people get mad
at me and they'll say like,

1921
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:20,370
you know what you're saying is
hateful, this done? I'm like, no.

1922
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,000
So I want to meet are not hateful
mean like feelings or hateful. Right.

1923
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,930
Intent is hateful. Yeah. But if
you were thinking about, you know,

1924
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:31,200
you are the type of person who is
ostracized as a child and all these pretty

1925
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,060
constantly kept you on the outside.

1926
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:36,300
What if that was a word that
they use all the time for you?

1927
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:39,690
What if you actually were gay and you
were gay at a young age and you know,

1928
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:40,021
it was like,

1929
01:47:40,021 --> 01:47:43,820
look at her that fucking gay loser and
then you're around people and they're

1930
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:46,710
like, that's gay, that's
gay. I'm like, Shit, I'm gay.

1931
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:50,470
And you're saying this movie is
gay? What the fuck, man? Yes sir.

1932
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:54,900
Suck. But I think you can't give
words that much power. And if you do,

1933
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:57,690
it's not, it's not smart. I don't know.

1934
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:01,880
But is that easy to say because you're on
the outside of it maybe. Yeah, probably.

1935
01:48:01,881 --> 01:48:04,820
I think about that sometimes, but other
than that, I think stop it. Faggot.

1936
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,980
Fucking get over it.
It's a big deal.

1937
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,400
Yeah. I mean some, I dunno, I,

1938
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,210
I really think that if
you're not racist really,

1939
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:15,600
and if you're not hateful of gay people,
really then say what you want.

1940
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:20,740
I mean, there's certain things that are
fucking gay men blow drying their hair.

1941
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,970
Always gay. You don't want to
dry your hair naturally. Well,

1942
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:29,320
you want to accelerate the drying process,
right? Fuck. Like who? Your pace mass.

1943
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:32,980
Those are gates. So gay, they even call
them facials, but yet all it is is like,

1944
01:48:32,981 --> 01:48:36,970
hey man, you like to open your pores. You
don't have your face doesn't break out.

1945
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:41,290
You're gay. You know, but
it's real though. You're
going to be like, that's gay.

1946
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:43,180
If you have bad skin,
you want to clear your skin up.

1947
01:48:43,181 --> 01:48:46,310
I think you should get a lot of you came
over to my house and had a face mask on

1948
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:49,870
with like blue he back. Well we believe
that they do face mask, brow face mask.

1949
01:48:49,871 --> 01:48:53,620
What you were before you go to
bed or American psycho. Yes.

1950
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:57,790
Do you ever read that book is all about
facials and masks and fucking so he

1951
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:59,800
wasn't gay.
He was crazy scary.

1952
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:04,420
It's like a red bull and are not read
well cranberry and vodka cranberry and

1953
01:49:04,421 --> 01:49:05,050
vodka is,

1954
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:08,590
you know like the second you throw
triple sec into that shit that's caught a

1955
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:11,530
cosmo and if you can't drink
a cosmo that's fucking gay,

1956
01:49:11,531 --> 01:49:15,100
but yet it's just a splash of triple sec.
I like girly drinks.

1957
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:18,430
I try to white Russians. I like
white Russians. That's kind of girly.

1958
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:22,840
I like 'em Pina coladas and shit
stuff with it's, I don't get it.

1959
01:49:22,841 --> 01:49:25,200
People think that they're so
refined that they like these.

1960
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:29,290
It's just like you want it to
taste like candy sometimes,

1961
01:49:29,291 --> 01:49:33,630
but sometimes you don't. I
like Jack Daniels to sometimes
I like a beer, you know,

1962
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:38,320
like a Sam Adams in a shot of Jack
Daniels that's like, that's to ass tastes,

1963
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:42,760
you know? So it's not candy at
all, but it's weird. How are you?

1964
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:46,900
The older you get you start liking
things like, like I never liked blue,

1965
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,220
but then around 24

1966
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,330
I'm like, oh, blue cheese is awesome.
You know? And like we have these things,

1967
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,250
you have these things
just like that though.

1968
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:58,540
Like I never used to like pickles and
now I'm fucking addicted to pickles all

1969
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:02,300
lives I still don't like yet. Blue Cheese
is tricky because it's mold. Yeah, right.

1970
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:06,680
You know we, when we were cheeses
boulder. Yeah, right. A lot of cheeses.

1971
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:08,080
When we were on fear factor,

1972
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:13,081
we used a lot of expensive cheese
for the stunts because some of them,

1973
01:50:13,361 --> 01:50:13,721
there was a,

1974
01:50:13,721 --> 01:50:18,100
there's a cheese shop in Beverly hills
that has like really authentic French

1975
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:21,430
cheeses and all these different
European cheeses that are like really,

1976
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:22,270
really strong.

1977
01:50:22,271 --> 01:50:26,440
Like their smell is horrendous and somehow
none of these freaky fucks in Europe.

1978
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:29,710
They, they get into this stuff and they
would bring it out to the set and that we

1979
01:50:29,711 --> 01:50:32,620
would open up the tubs and make everybody
smell out and they'd be like vomiting,

1980
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,680
like literally people be dry heaving
and this is some shit that was really

1981
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:40,360
expensive and now it is just a funky,
powerful cheese. And we would throw that,

1982
01:50:40,361 --> 01:50:44,290
that was like a secret ingredient that
we would throw into a lot of the blended

1983
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:46,540
shit that people had to
eat that smelled horrific.

1984
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:50,140
The reason why it smelled Baz worms don't
really smell that bad when you grind

1985
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:54,490
them up and have to throw
that funky fucking shit
cheese and that's what made it

1986
01:50:54,491 --> 01:50:57,700
smell better. Yeah. Worms.
The smell like worms,

1987
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:00,000
especially because they're fresh worms.
Well they're for,

1988
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:02,530
it smells like dirt kind of because
they're really, that's all they are.

1989
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:05,470
They're like tissue and dirt.
You're drinking dirt, you know,

1990
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:06,970
but the worms that we're,
we're getting,

1991
01:51:06,971 --> 01:51:09,790
we're getting these worms come from
dirt farm so they know what the fucking

1992
01:51:09,791 --> 01:51:13,600
worms are eating. It's all, you get
them out of the fish supply shop.

1993
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,450
So been really eating worms is not,
not big a deal.

1994
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:18,270
The big deal was this fucking cheat.

1995
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,970
Then this cheese is expensive and people
are like, did you get that from ODG?

1996
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:24,250
D is,

1997
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:29,250
Oh this is Smith is one to buy his
bid to flow for whatever reason,

1998
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:32,290
people just got into those
fucking creepy smells.

1999
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:37,220
I recently found out that I am a video
game tran, transsexual, video game,

2000
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,420
transsexuals. Anytime I, I'd never even
thought about that. You play as a girl?

2001
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:41,850
Yeah,
I always plays a girl at like,

2002
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:45,120
I just got this new game called fallout
new Vegas where it's like you're, you're,

2003
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:48,760
you're looking at an ass the whole time
you're running around the whole game and

2004
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:51,760
it's going to take you months to
beat this game. And I'm thinking,

2005
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:55,780
I don't want to look at a man's ass. I'm
gonna pick a girl character, you know?

2006
01:51:55,781 --> 01:51:59,620
So I, I write and I think back, I've
always like Tony Hawk, you know,

2007
01:51:59,621 --> 01:52:03,220
any kind of video on Microsoft, Laura,
I'm always playing girl characters.

2008
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,140
I always pick girl characters.
I've been sucks though,

2009
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,920
is the guys end up hitting on you thinking
that you're a girl and so that then

2010
01:52:08,921 --> 01:52:12,030
it makes you even feel more gay. Well,
how often do you hit on them back?

2011
01:52:12,031 --> 01:52:13,900
Do you walk around and pretend
that you're a girl? Yeah.

2012
01:52:13,901 --> 01:52:15,250
Especially if I don't have a microphone.

2013
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:18,400
I'll just like turn around a couple
times, you know, shake it a little. Yeah,

2014
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:21,370
that's a big thing right now. See,
I'm out of the loop video games,

2015
01:52:21,371 --> 01:52:23,140
but a lot of people are
talking and they're online.

2016
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:26,140
They're talking on microphones, right?
Well nowadays, yeah, usually and shit.

2017
01:52:26,141 --> 01:52:28,300
That would be annoying, man. I don't
want to hear all these little nuggets.

2018
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:31,390
It's weird because video games, if
you ever thought, you know what,

2019
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,720
I don't think people are racist against
black people and that much anymore.

2020
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:37,960
Second, you go online, bullshit.
All, all, all the rules are out.

2021
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:41,080
It's just nonstop racism.
It's just like message boards.

2022
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,200
It's same thing except they don't have
to worry about their account being good

2023
01:52:44,201 --> 01:52:46,160
for six months a year and keep talking

2024
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,650
on the message board. Right. You figured
this is the one game want to see you,

2025
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:49,484
you nigger cunt.

2026
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:54,940
It's really weird though
when you're playing a video
game and it's usually like,

2027
01:52:55,150 --> 01:52:55,421
you know,

2028
01:52:55,421 --> 01:52:58,990
like one other person and it's just
like an 11 year old kid and you're like,

2029
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:03,400
so hey, how old are you? And you're like,
you're like, oh hey. That's great. Uh, so,

2030
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:07,480
uh, we should go over here
and get the sword. Oh, okay.

2031
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,430
I feel like you seem very strong.

2032
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:15,690
Video Games are like 11 year olds and
like 37 year old. No, no, no. There's

2033
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:19,760
people that are playing video games all
day. Video Games are addictive as fuck.

2034
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:23,050
They're awesome. That's the problem.
There's so much fun to play there.

2035
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,960
So God damn addicted. I need to
find one though. I would like,

2036
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,400
it's a weird thing to me.

2037
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:31,570
It's a weird thing to me that we have
like this level of connectivity with like

2038
01:53:31,571 --> 01:53:35,980
Twitter and Facebook and and and you know,
message boards and stuff like that.

2039
01:53:35,981 --> 01:53:39,430
We have this crazy level of connectivity
where we're way more immersed in each

2040
01:53:39,431 --> 01:53:41,530
other's lives than we've ever been before.

2041
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:45,760
But yet it's easier to be anonymous
and to be country with people.

2042
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:49,390
It's easier to like say
shitty things cause you're
not saying it in front of him.

2043
01:53:49,391 --> 01:53:52,450
You don't have to deal with the social
consequences of looking him in the eye

2044
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:56,190
and insulting them. You just, you fucking
shit and they can just do it. It's,

2045
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:59,620
that's a weird thing. It's like we're
more immersed but we're more disconnected.

2046
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,550
It's like, and we're slowly becoming
more and more used to, you know,

2047
01:54:03,551 --> 01:54:07,540
being able to be shitty to people with no
repercussions and not worried about it.

2048
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:11,710
And being able to take out all your own
personal bullshit on some just random

2049
01:54:11,711 --> 01:54:15,970
stranger online and attack them and try
to break them down. And you really, like,

2050
01:54:15,971 --> 01:54:17,680
you're going about your
day and total silence,

2051
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:19,540
like you're sitting in front of
Kiva, click, click, click, click,

2052
01:54:19,541 --> 01:54:23,590
click saying the meanest,
nastiest, most harsh shit than me.

2053
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:26,010
While there's no sound coming out
and you're walking around your house,

2054
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,810
you're pouring yourself coffee and you
going back to the message board and

2055
01:54:28,811 --> 01:54:31,680
typing some more horrible
evil shit. And you know, it's,

2056
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,460
it's a very strange thing that,
you know,

2057
01:54:33,461 --> 01:54:37,690
it used to be all our interactions that
we had, the ones that were designed for,

2058
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,080
or we look at each other and then all
of a sudden someone invented a phone as

2059
01:54:41,081 --> 01:54:43,000
well, now you're interacting with
somebody who can't see anymore,

2060
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:46,510
and then all of a sudden the person
becomes faceless and now they're on a

2061
01:54:46,511 --> 01:54:50,440
message board and now you're
just a name and like, whoa. Yeah.

2062
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,290
And your Avatar is buckwheat,
you know, it's like, okay,

2063
01:54:53,291 --> 01:54:57,250
who is this guy's got buckwheat
from for the rascals as this photo.

2064
01:54:57,251 --> 01:55:01,540
I don't even know who the fuck he is. They
tell me that I'm ugly and yes, exactly.

2065
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:05,800
Dude. So many people have been
exposed from my message board,

2066
01:55:05,801 --> 01:55:08,560
like so many people that
were like really super conti,

2067
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,510
but they fucked up and
somewhere along the line,

2068
01:55:10,511 --> 01:55:13,390
one of the Internet sleuths figured out
who they were and then through their

2069
01:55:13,391 --> 01:55:16,840
photos up and all their Facebook
photos and then you get to see, oh,

2070
01:55:16,841 --> 01:55:19,180
you're a douchebag, right?
Oh, here you are. I mean,

2071
01:55:19,181 --> 01:55:21,850
how many times that happened on the
Rogan board? Oh, totally. All the time.

2072
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,450
Oh my God.
We had this one guy who was an asshole.

2073
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:29,620
He was so mean to everybody like on,
and he couldn't tell him to stop doing it.

2074
01:55:29,621 --> 01:55:32,230
Like at a certain point in time
it was like, fuck dude, you know,

2075
01:55:32,231 --> 01:55:35,650
stop being a Douche bag and a contrarian.
Every time I fucking argument comes up,

2076
01:55:35,651 --> 01:55:39,560
you're insulting people and saying, we
found out he was like 700 pounds. Okay.

2077
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:43,320
And he had would post on this weight
loss forum and he got his stomach fixed.

2078
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,333
He was a staple

2079
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:44,700
or,
yeah,

2080
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:48,570
it was always like super
critical of anybody who did
anything to their boat. You,

2081
01:55:48,571 --> 01:55:51,200
you don't have the heart and the willpower
to do it on your own. You've all,

2082
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:54,830
he says, fat fuck living in
his own shit is on apartments.

2083
01:55:54,831 --> 01:55:58,350
Where is why he's such an asshole
because his life sucked and then it was

2084
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:00,000
exposed and flop.
Oh,

2085
01:56:00,001 --> 01:56:03,780
found that guy and just posted all of
his photos and all of his testimonials

2086
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:07,250
about it. It was a totally different
person on this site, on our side,

2087
01:56:07,251 --> 01:56:11,880
which is a mean nasty asshole
on that website. He was all
about like, it was like,

2088
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:16,410
you know, positive like Oprah stuff. Yeah.
Like he was on Oprah. He was like, well,

2089
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:18,780
just trying to get used to the Diet.
Lol.

2090
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,580
Yeah.
I mean you,

2091
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:26,550
you learn a lot about a person's
character when they're anonymous. Totally.

2092
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:28,290
You know, you get to know, I mean,

2093
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:31,860
one of the things I found about my
message board is there's like three plus

2094
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:33,630
million posts on it now.
I mean,

2095
01:56:33,631 --> 01:56:37,020
it's been around since like 1998 there's
thousands and thousands of members and

2096
01:56:37,021 --> 01:56:39,940
every day there's
thousands of posts and you,

2097
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,310
you really can get to know someone
just by reading their words. You know,

2098
01:56:44,311 --> 01:56:47,430
you really can,
because weird situations will come up.

2099
01:56:47,431 --> 01:56:49,140
We'll someone will say something,
you can take it one way,

2100
01:56:49,141 --> 01:56:51,960
you can take it another way. You can
be upset, you could be insulting.

2101
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:53,490
You could be,
you know,

2102
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:56,580
you could listen to their criticism
and agree with it and you know,

2103
01:56:56,581 --> 01:56:59,190
have an own your own introspective
and objective viewpoint.

2104
01:56:59,191 --> 01:57:03,720
But people are so attached even to these
little anonymous fake names that you

2105
01:57:03,721 --> 01:57:06,360
know, you criticize their
anonymous fake screen name in,

2106
01:57:06,361 --> 01:57:09,990
that shit hits personal and then they
go after you and then they go after each

2107
01:57:09,991 --> 01:57:12,510
other. And I see these flame wars
like back and forth. I'm like,

2108
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:15,390
how much of this would really happen if
you guys were standing in front of each

2109
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:17,130
other? None of it, right?

2110
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:21,060
I think they have those awkward meetings
of like the people from the Internet

2111
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:24,690
and then no one says anything.
We've done that a bunch,

2112
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,020
which we were doing that in
the 90s on my message board.

2113
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:31,500
The first one was like evil and circle
jerk or the Houston circle jerk,

2114
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:33,960
I think it was nine,
nine, nine, nine or 2000.

2115
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:37,050
We were doing it like before I was
on fear factor. We would have these,

2116
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:39,300
these message board meetings
where people would, you know,

2117
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,590
come from the message board and we would,

2118
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,370
we'd all be in Houston or whatever and
we'd all go out to dinner together and

2119
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:45,900
you got to meet the creeps too.

2120
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:48,480
There was like a few guys that
we were hanging out with. Like,

2121
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:51,530
now I know why he's such a shit head.
Like you meet the guy in real life,

2122
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:55,480
it's like fucking shifty and weird and
looks like you'd Roofie your drinks and

2123
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,990
you know, there's, there's
always a guy that you meet.

2124
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:01,890
Like we went to a strip club with one
guy from the message board and uh, uh,

2125
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:04,560
one of the strippers came over and
put her hands on them, just like,

2126
01:58:04,561 --> 01:58:08,790
would you like to dance? Don't touch
me whore. And we're like, Whoa,

2127
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,120
don't touch me whore.

2128
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:13,350
And she went over and told the bouncer
and the bouncer came over to him and he

2129
01:58:13,351 --> 01:58:17,430
looked at me like I was going to say,
I'm like, dude, go get away. You're done.

2130
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:21,150
You're done son.
You're a fucking creep will touch me.

2131
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:25,410
Whore people are really hurt. And uh,
but you know, it's on all of them.

2132
01:58:25,411 --> 01:58:28,350
I mean it's like he didn't come off
that way online, which is strange.

2133
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:31,740
He would say mean nasty shit.
But like normal,

2134
01:58:31,741 --> 01:58:34,920
like everybody else would say mean nasty
shit. It's like kind of commonplace.

2135
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:38,850
He never like saw that, um, you
know that in his online thing,

2136
01:58:38,851 --> 01:58:41,290
he just seemed kind of
annoying. And then, you know,

2137
01:58:41,291 --> 01:58:44,950
you see him in La in real life, you're
like, oh, you're a fuck you're a mess.

2138
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:48,280
You know, you never know. And then
there's people that won't even meet us,

2139
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,170
which is like a whole new thing,
you know.

2140
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:55,240
Flaco he is this guy named Flaco and he,
I won't even come meet us.

2141
01:58:56,350 --> 01:59:00,050
I don't know why. Well cause he
doesn't cause he attacks everybody.

2142
01:59:00,051 --> 01:59:04,030
He doesn't want you finding out what's,
what's really wrong. He knows we love him.

2143
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:07,360
Yeah. Well not call, I had mad balls.

2144
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:10,030
We got this guy named [inaudible]
who is a on our website.

2145
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:13,120
He's been on my websites. It's
like the, I like 2000 or something.

2146
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:16,410
Maybe not for that. Maybe even
before that. Yeah. And uh,

2147
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:20,350
we were doing a show in San Francisco
and somehow or another came up,

2148
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:24,370
we were talking to him, it was like five
years ago. More, more than five years ago.

2149
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:27,880
So I said, you want to come
out to San Francisco, man,
I'll fly out. So he's like,

2150
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:30,900
okay. Like he went with it and he
goes like this troll online. Yeah.

2151
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:34,330
Likely fucking with people.
And like nine 11 happened and he was like,

2152
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,180
two hours later, he's already,
you know, too early, too soon.

2153
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:41,260
He's ruthless.
Like fucking with people and stuff.

2154
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:45,290
But we hung out with them
and he was a nice guy. He was
nice when we hung out. We,

2155
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,710
I gave him a pot lollipop. He
could handle it. He threw it up,

2156
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:50,080
threw up in the street.
God, I forgot about that.

2157
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:53,680
Pot lollipops are very powerful.

2158
01:59:53,710 --> 01:59:57,160
If someone tries to give you pot like
edible pot, don't do it. Don't do it.

2159
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:02,590
Runaway, do not do it well. They'll
say like, oh, it's just a little bit,

2160
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:07,260
you need to be an experienced pot smoker
before you start fucking around with

2161
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:08,270
edibles and last,

2162
02:00:08,271 --> 02:00:12,190
you know that like this is your very
best friend and your friend made these

2163
02:00:12,191 --> 02:00:16,270
brownies and she told you, listen, there's
you just, if you take a quarter of this,

2164
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:17,650
you're going to be fine,
but that's it.

2165
02:00:17,651 --> 02:00:19,450
Just a quarter and we're
not going anywhere anyway.

2166
02:00:19,451 --> 02:00:21,970
We're just going to sit on the couch
and watch TV and it'll be weird,

2167
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:25,150
but you're going to be okay. And you
go, okay, I trust you, let's do this.

2168
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:27,790
But if you're just like hanging out at
a party or something and someone says,

2169
02:00:27,791 --> 02:00:31,180
Hey, you want to pop cookie? No,
you did not want a pug times.

2170
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:34,270
People at the comedy store, I've
been like, eat this pot Brownie.

2171
02:00:34,271 --> 02:00:39,240
You've never tried. So
irresponsible. God, thank God I'm,

2172
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:41,740
those are fucking freaky.
The fuck out.

2173
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:45,850
We were talking on the last podcast about
I got to high on a flight and I hit a

2174
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:47,330
pot cookie and um,

2175
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:51,040
some dude fart on Melanie
Griffiths head long story,

2176
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:56,170
but I got so high,
get so high that I almost peed myself.

2177
02:00:56,171 --> 02:00:57,430
I literally thought about doing it.

2178
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,580
Eating pot is way more strong
than smoking it a hundred times.

2179
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:05,590
Not really like five times more powerful.
It's like you, you get way too high.

2180
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:07,800
Way Too quick visual on top of it.
Yeah.

2181
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:10,930
We did some more happy
and mellow like you know,

2182
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:14,320
muscle relaxer type kind of
body buzz that's more visual.

2183
02:01:14,321 --> 02:01:16,840
It's going to fuck with your visuals
and everything. Can you close your eyes?

2184
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:20,860
You see cartoons fucking see like
cartoons moving around and changing shape.

2185
02:01:20,861 --> 02:01:25,861
Like I saw all these looked like they
looked like 1960 Spiderman comic books,

2186
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,870
like that style of drawing.

2187
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:32,320
But it was all like
animals that didn't exist.

2188
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:38,140
It was all like an, and they
were constantly changing
like every, every second,

2189
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:41,720
every half a second. It was a new animal
and they were animals that didn't exist.

2190
02:01:41,721 --> 02:01:44,340
All drawn like Jack Kirby style.
You know,

2191
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:48,200
like early marvel comics and they were
just moving and they were like all two

2192
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:52,940
inches long and the entire sky was
filled with them. Wow. That's on us.

2193
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:56,340
I just close my eyes and watch
that for like an hour lucky. So we,

2194
02:01:56,550 --> 02:01:59,480
I can't even freaking out though.
Couldn't, it was too high to enjoy it.

2195
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:03,980
I can't even imagine. It's kind of
like dreams. You know how dreams,

2196
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:07,190
yeah. It's like, it's like that,

2197
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:12,191
but you're in railroad eating pause
is really too introspective too.

2198
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:14,390
It makes you like really start
thinking about your life.

2199
02:02:14,391 --> 02:02:18,260
Like I broke down my whole childhood.
I'd, I started thinking about my eating.

2200
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:21,800
You start really like considering all of
your behavior and the way you interact

2201
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,300
with people and all the things you've
done wrong and all the things you would

2202
02:02:24,301 --> 02:02:27,530
love to take back. And you know,
it's just, it's really just fucking,

2203
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:32,030
it's a mind fuck because it's another,
it's another chemical.

2204
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:34,910
It's another chemical. When you eat
it, you should know that this is your,

2205
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:39,050
your liver produces a chemical
called, uh, 11 hydroxy metabolite.

2206
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:41,540
That's what it is. And it's only
when you eat pot, you don't,

2207
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:44,060
it's not active in psychoactive
doses when you smoke it.

2208
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,510
So it's literally different than
being stoned when you're smoking it.

2209
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:50,660
Very dangerous. So don't let those
assholes just give you a pot Brownie.

2210
02:02:50,661 --> 02:02:55,380
That's Douchey, Douchey, a little
girl, he just popped Brownie.

2211
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:58,730
You're the quarter curled up in the
fetal position in the puddle of pis

2212
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:03,020
cause there's no way to make
it stop. No, there's no way.

2213
02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:06,650
No way you can try coffee,
but that doesn't work.

2214
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:10,670
You just get like hyper and
high at the same time. You know,

2215
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:14,180
you're still nervous and freaked
out and they're still be paranoid.

2216
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:18,830
I remember once I was a bad acid trip
and for some reason I always thought that

2217
02:03:18,831 --> 02:03:21,440
drinking a bunch of milk was
supposed to do something.

2218
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:25,460
So I remember sitting there fucking
sweating my ass off. Panicking,

2219
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:30,530
just chugging milk. I remember I
might've done a whole thing of milk,

2220
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:33,620
but then there's something where
your body just starts rejecting milk.

2221
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:38,390
I just start puking milk everywhere a
chirping and I just remember the next day

2222
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:41,510
I forgot I had done it and I just went
into the kitchen and it's just milk all

2223
02:03:41,511 --> 02:03:46,070
over the floor. Were you living
at home where you live? It alone.

2224
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:50,250
I was living alone and a
little one bedroom would suck.

2225
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:51,680
If you had explain this shit to your mom,

2226
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:56,840
why is there milking
cheerios all over the floor?

2227
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:01,490
Uh,
I didn't realize that um,

2228
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:03,680
like lactose had a real effect on you.

2229
02:04:03,681 --> 02:04:07,190
I never really paid attention to it
until I started drinking raw milk.

2230
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:12,320
Raw Milk is just milk that hasn't been
homogenized or pasteurized and you can

2231
02:04:12,321 --> 02:04:14,790
get it at like whole food stores.
I don't know if they have it anymore.

2232
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:18,180
They might again stop kicking against
milk completely though. Right? Why?

2233
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:23,150
Because it probably what you're about to
say. Well the raw with raw milk, it's,

2234
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:26,090
it's dangerous where you don't
want to let it go too long.

2235
02:04:26,091 --> 02:04:29,000
You don't want to like keep
it around like you can't,

2236
02:04:29,001 --> 02:04:31,930
like you get a court and a milk,
you like,

2237
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:35,630
you get a carton of milk and you
look at the expired expiration date.

2238
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:38,010
It's like a month. How the fuck is
this gonna stay good for a month?

2239
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,190
It's because everything worthwhile
has been barbecued out of it.

2240
02:04:41,191 --> 02:04:44,100
I mean there's still protein in it
and sort of still calcium in it,

2241
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:46,380
but for the most part,
all the enzymes,

2242
02:04:46,381 --> 02:04:49,800
all the things that allow you to
digest it correctly, they're all gone.

2243
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:51,120
But when you get raw milk,

2244
02:04:51,121 --> 02:04:53,700
you get everything in it and it's
really easy to adjust. It's like,

2245
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:57,470
it feels totally different. Like it feels
different in your body. Gross though. No,

2246
02:04:57,471 --> 02:04:59,610
it tastes good, man. I was
drinking raw chocolate milk,

2247
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:02,070
but I think they stopped carrying
it because I think it's dangerous.

2248
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:05,250
Wholefoods used to be like,
these take chances,

2249
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:08,550
but then they found out that Kombucha,
like this stuff that, I love this stuff.

2250
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,050
I'm a big fan of probiotics
is very important.

2251
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:17,590
Like probiotics are fucking huge for
your health. So I take acidophilus and I,

2252
02:05:17,591 --> 02:05:21,270
I drank probiotic drinks like this
Kombucha Shit, but apparently it's,

2253
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:24,840
and some of them, if it sits
too long, it ferments too long.

2254
02:05:24,841 --> 02:05:27,930
Then it becomes more than
one half of 1% alcohol.

2255
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:31,960
So then whole foods like pulled them
out. All of their stores. Are they back?

2256
02:05:31,961 --> 02:05:35,040
I will. They have some Kombucha,
but do they have the GTS Kombucha?

2257
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:37,440
That's like the real shit.
That's the real shit.

2258
02:05:37,441 --> 02:05:39,960
Like you get chunks of the
mushroom in it or the fungus,

2259
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:44,490
like someone shot loads in your drink.
You don't get that out of the week.

2260
02:05:44,491 --> 02:05:44,971
Kombucha,

2261
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:49,680
the wheat Kombucha is just have it
out of the tap now in whole foods.

2262
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,430
Yeah, that's stuff that they're
growing. They're making it. That's weak.

2263
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:57,480
You know this company Gts, that was may.
Again, that's, that shit is powerful.

2264
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:00,090
That's the kids.
I haven't gotten sick in over a year.

2265
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:03,210
I would get sick constantly
because I'm always traveling,

2266
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:06,810
traveling and shaking people's hands and
you're going on the road and you're in

2267
02:06:06,811 --> 02:06:08,040
planes and you're,
you know,

2268
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:11,610
all that common in contact with
all these different germs and bugs.

2269
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:13,290
Like for a long time,

2270
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:16,800
like every couple months I'd get a cold
for the longest time because all the

2271
02:06:16,801 --> 02:06:20,050
traveling with this stuff,
never, I don't get sick, I don't,

2272
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:22,830
I don't get sick and I'm always
getting like four hours sleep.

2273
02:06:22,831 --> 02:06:25,590
Then I take a flight,
I get tired like normal and everything,

2274
02:06:25,591 --> 02:06:29,430
but I'm not getting sick anymore.
And Ajay huge chunk of that is this stuff.

2275
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:33,580
And acidophilus acidophilus milk culture.

2276
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:36,810
So it's a bacteria that originates from,
yeah,

2277
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:40,590
you keep it in the refrigerator and uh,
it's a live bacteria to healthy bacteria,

2278
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:44,130
but it's a very aggressive, healthy
bacteria. When you eat acidophilus,

2279
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:47,190
all this negative stuff that you come
in contact with when you're like, you,

2280
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:50,460
you touched someone's hands and
they'll get like a cold or a sickness.

2281
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:52,800
You're acidophilus attacks,
all that shit.

2282
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:56,340
It's like having warriors in
your body to fight off bad germs.

2283
02:06:56,341 --> 02:06:59,750
And since you don't usually eat yogurt
because you don't like milks, uh,

2284
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:03,450
you should really look into
it. Probiotic supplement. Yeah,

2285
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:06,390
the Kombucha is a great one. It's a
great, I'll see them supplement though,

2286
02:07:06,391 --> 02:07:11,340
because I noticed your nails always
have like the, the calcium lack. Zinc.

2287
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:14,310
What's wrong with your nails?
What do you fucking Weirdo.

2288
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:17,640
You know what's wrong with her neck? Cause
I take a lot of pictures of her hands.

2289
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:21,270
The hand model? Yeah.
You're a hand model. Yeah.

2290
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:24,870
I was an American girl magazine catalog.
Your hands are tiny.

2291
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,410
They're so small. It's like
where's the rest of the, her feet?

2292
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:31,740
Her feet are smarter than wow.
Those are those.

2293
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:35,290
My daughter Lola is feet might be a
little bigger than yours. She's too.

2294
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:39,460
Let me take my shoes off.
She did go on the playground.

2295
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:45,460
That's hilarious. Yeah. I didn't see you
guys look like you're in the same grade.

2296
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:50,590
We have the same Halloween. How did we
get on this hands and feet thing? Uh,

2297
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:54,190
because it's Kirk calendar. What
point? Yeah. How the hell do you know?

2298
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:57,540
Because I thought that was cows. When
you have the white lines on your nails,

2299
02:07:57,550 --> 02:08:01,600
that's kind of a lack of calcium.
Has that started when I went vegan.

2300
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:05,110
So there is downs. Whoa. Really?
Yeah. There's also, yeah,

2301
02:08:05,111 --> 02:08:09,190
you should totally take a some
kind of calcium via, you know,

2302
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:11,640
I don't supplement calcium.
I think it's, yeah,

2303
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:15,520
but you're supposed to have a certain
amount of calcium. Oh, I get calcium.

2304
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:19,480
Broccoli as marketers. The
lines. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
You don't eat broccoli. Yes,

2305
02:08:19,481 --> 02:08:19,980
I do.

2306
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:23,470
To you like crazy Broccoli as how much
house you and then what then I think it

2307
02:08:23,471 --> 02:08:26,260
had, I don't, I'm not going to say, but
I think it does. It has a lot of calcium,

2308
02:08:26,261 --> 02:08:30,640
so a lot of protein to
broccoli as protein. That's
why gorillas love Broccoli.

2309
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:34,070
If you go to the zoo, they throw gorillas
and chimps always turned on Broccoli.

2310
02:08:34,670 --> 02:08:37,160
They're really want to eat monkeys,
but they don't let them. Yeah,

2311
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:40,430
I think that's so fucked up. They don't
let animals in the zoo kill things.

2312
02:08:40,490 --> 02:08:41,360
At the very least,

2313
02:08:41,361 --> 02:08:43,940
they should be allowing them to do what
they're naturally put on this planet to

2314
02:08:43,941 --> 02:08:44,630
do.

2315
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:49,630
You know when you're sliding a cold tray
of meat into a cage and a lion looks at

2316
02:08:50,361 --> 02:08:53,540
that meeting, he was like, what the
fuck, man? Let me tell you some shit.

2317
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:58,130
Can Be killed. Some shits on
it. Get some of that. Is it sad?

2318
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:01,380
Yeah. Do you, are you an
animal rights person? Um,

2319
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,190
I'm not out there doing anything for it,
but I believe in it and I,

2320
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:09,320
I like the people that are,
I appreciate them.

2321
02:09:09,630 --> 02:09:13,260
The only problem with that is
if you don't kill some of them,

2322
02:09:13,530 --> 02:09:14,850
then they will overpopulate.

2323
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:19,050
Let's say if we stopped killing cows and
stop killing chickens and stop killing

2324
02:09:19,051 --> 02:09:23,250
deer. If we were really did that, we
have a real issue. Is that really true?

2325
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,740
I'm sure. Of course. Well,
it's definitely true with dear.

2326
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:28,380
One of the most important thing about
controlling deer populations is make sure

2327
02:09:28,381 --> 02:09:31,590
in the population doesn't get too big for
the resources that they have available

2328
02:09:31,591 --> 02:09:31,861
to them.

2329
02:09:31,861 --> 02:09:35,190
You can't have a bunch of deer starving
to death and getting sick and diseases

2330
02:09:35,191 --> 02:09:38,580
because there's no food, you know,
and deer, we'll just like rabbits,

2331
02:09:38,581 --> 02:09:41,100
just like rats, just like any
other animal. That's wild.

2332
02:09:41,101 --> 02:09:43,110
And especially in a competitive
environment like that,

2333
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:44,750
they breed as much as
they can. I mean the, the,

2334
02:09:44,751 --> 02:09:48,210
the pump out as many little baby
deer as possible. And I want, if you,

2335
02:09:48,211 --> 02:09:50,970
if you go to a place like where I
lived in Boulder, I lived in Colorado,

2336
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,210
they don't, nobody in Boulder's all
nutty, crunchy and no one's shooting deer.

2337
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:56,910
So the deer like fearless,
so they're everywhere.

2338
02:09:56,970 --> 02:09:58,950
So you have to be very careful
when you drive it around.

2339
02:09:58,951 --> 02:10:00,300
Could you get slammed into him at night?

2340
02:10:00,330 --> 02:10:03,200
They'll just jump in front of the road
and all of a sudden, you know, there's,

2341
02:10:03,201 --> 02:10:05,970
there's a fucking deer with his
antlers through your windshield,

2342
02:10:05,971 --> 02:10:09,390
goring you to death, you know? But
that happens to be Paul. It's tricky.

2343
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:13,850
So if you're not eating cows and you're
nodding and Glam and you're nodding what

2344
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:16,110
you're going to have to do something,
you have to separate them,

2345
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:19,710
keep them from breeding. You ever to
do something to control the population,

2346
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:21,480
you're going to have to
be proactive about it.

2347
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:25,380
I mean that, I'm not against eating meat.
I think it's, I would, I don't like,

2348
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:29,130
and what makes me cry
is when, yeah, exactly.

2349
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:33,680
I watched a documentary called Food Inc,
which I literally have never so hard.

2350
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,190
Yeah. You don't, you ever watch
Anthony Bourdain's show? No, I, no,

2351
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:39,890
I haven't seen that actually. Good
show. It's called no reservations.

2352
02:10:39,891 --> 02:10:43,000
It's on the travel channel. He's a chef
and it was really interesting guys,

2353
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:46,430
one of my favorite shows and he goes all
over the country and all over the world

2354
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:47,510
even and uh,

2355
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:50,690
goes to all these different cultures and
sees like what they eat and talk to the

2356
02:10:50,691 --> 02:10:52,910
people there and tries to find out
their traditions about their food.

2357
02:10:53,090 --> 02:10:55,220
Kind of really fascinating.
Well one of the things he did,

2358
02:10:55,221 --> 02:10:57,860
he went to this place in Maine and this,
this uh,

2359
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:01,610
it's a restaurant in Maine that does
everything. They have their own farm,

2360
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:04,670
they grow all their own produce,
they grow all their own animals.

2361
02:11:04,671 --> 02:11:06,020
They slaughter their own animals,

2362
02:11:06,021 --> 02:11:08,390
butcher their own animals and
then serve them and cook them.

2363
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:12,170
And it was really interesting. Yeah.
Because here's these, these guys,

2364
02:11:12,171 --> 02:11:14,240
I mean this guy was petting this
peg and he's like, you know,

2365
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:17,270
it's kind of weird cause you know your
pet net but then you're also like looking

2366
02:11:17,271 --> 02:11:17,711
at it like,
wow,

2367
02:11:17,711 --> 02:11:20,060
this is going to make some Nice Bacon
and there's some ham right here.

2368
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:24,230
And like it's a real,
it's the reality of it and you know,

2369
02:11:24,231 --> 02:11:25,220
that's what they're there for.

2370
02:11:25,221 --> 02:11:27,110
They're not going to live forever
if you don't eat them. Okay.

2371
02:11:27,111 --> 02:11:27,980
They're eventually going to die.

2372
02:11:27,981 --> 02:11:31,460
These are temporary creatures and it's
like to give them as much freedom and

2373
02:11:31,461 --> 02:11:32,930
dignity and you know,

2374
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:35,780
and to treat them as humanely
as possible before you kill him,

2375
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:39,020
you're still killing them.
The real problem is that right?

2376
02:11:39,021 --> 02:11:40,490
The real problem is not the killing them.

2377
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:43,000
The real problem is the suffered
suffering before he killed.

2378
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:46,370
Horrible because this didn't seem
offensive. It seems shocking to me.

2379
02:11:46,371 --> 02:11:49,760
Like does this guy was petting this pig
talking about it being bacon and ham,

2380
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:53,420
but you still petting the pig and the pig
like wasn't freaked out at all and the

2381
02:11:53,421 --> 02:11:58,310
pig was eating well. And it's like, okay,
well I mean that's the food chain. Yeah,

2382
02:11:58,311 --> 02:11:59,144
I guess.

2383
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:02,750
But that's the problem with a lot of
the animal rights people and the animal

2384
02:12:02,751 --> 02:12:05,000
rights movement. It's like they
don't believe in the food chain.

2385
02:12:05,001 --> 02:12:08,660
They believe we stop killing
animals, period. But if we do that,

2386
02:12:08,661 --> 02:12:12,620
like you have to take into consideration
that a lot of animals are here and

2387
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:15,590
they're here as prey animals.
Like in the natural cycle of things.

2388
02:12:15,591 --> 02:12:17,360
If you have deer,
well you have to have mountain lions.

2389
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:20,240
If you don't have mountain lions take
out these deer or coyotes to take out

2390
02:12:20,241 --> 02:12:23,840
these deer, well we'll, who fucks gonna
eat all the deer w what are you going to,

2391
02:12:23,850 --> 02:12:26,210
you're going to have a just
gigantic overpopulation of them.

2392
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:26,621
What are you gonna do?

2393
02:12:26,621 --> 02:12:29,060
You're going to start breeding mountain
lions and now you have mountain lions

2394
02:12:29,061 --> 02:12:32,600
everywhere. You have millions of outlines
and millions of deer. Like really?

2395
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:35,720
Is that the solution? Well, something's
going to happen, right? I mean,

2396
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:40,960
we look at this Utopian Granola fucking
Unicorn way of life that you know,

2397
02:12:41,511 --> 02:12:45,140
hey man, we should just leave the
animals alone. We're kind of past that.

2398
02:12:45,141 --> 02:12:47,570
We can't really do that. There's,
there has to be some sort of a,

2399
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:49,390
if you were going to stop
eating animals through,

2400
02:12:49,391 --> 02:12:52,670
who would have to be some sort of strategy
for dealing with overpopulation and

2401
02:12:52,671 --> 02:12:55,880
right now we can't even control that
with animals like cats and dogs.

2402
02:12:55,881 --> 02:12:58,140
We have a hard time. We're killing
them and fucking, you know,

2403
02:12:58,141 --> 02:13:00,500
the rescue places are killing them
left, right Pete? It kills them.

2404
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:02,340
Peta kills animals left at rice,

2405
02:13:02,860 --> 02:13:05,680
all the animals on boats, so
they stroke, they're still alive.

2406
02:13:05,681 --> 02:13:09,100
There's so much extra water out there
and you just let them float for the rest

2407
02:13:09,101 --> 02:13:11,170
of their life.
Holocaust of animals,

2408
02:13:11,171 --> 02:13:14,410
we keep killing animals and
keeping them in cells as sad.

2409
02:13:14,411 --> 02:13:18,670
So many chihuahuas that are fucking
murdered or put to sleep every year,

2410
02:13:18,671 --> 02:13:22,690
especially in California because people
just by Chihuahuas and then send them

2411
02:13:22,691 --> 02:13:24,160
back to the,
like if you go to the pounds,

2412
02:13:24,161 --> 02:13:27,700
they're shipping chihuahuas
out of California to other
states to try to get rid

2413
02:13:27,701 --> 02:13:31,170
of them because there's so much to over
Chihuahua population. You know, it's,

2414
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:32,100
it's like instead of killing

2415
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,850
all these swabs in Paris with, I'm on a
boat to go in Paris Hilton. Totally. Yeah.

2416
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:39,330
I loved her in high school though.
I bought her, I bought her book,

2417
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:41,370
her book between her and Judge Anderson,

2418
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:45,750
who's been the bigger influence on your
life? Um, I wouldn't call them influences.

2419
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:50,310
I would just call those pretty
girls that I'm interested in.

2420
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:52,900
People that you're interested
in. Yeah. Oh my God.

2421
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,770
I loved when their true Hollywood stories,

2422
02:13:54,830 --> 02:13:58,650
when we're on the Hilton sisters
and then, um, Jenna Jamison. Yeah.

2423
02:13:58,651 --> 02:14:01,020
There was another Hilton. Whatever
happened. That one, she kind of faded out.

2424
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,690
Hilton, she's still around
and, but she puts up,

2425
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:08,350
I used to follow her on Twitter and they
were so dumb that really disappointed

2426
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,880
cat stacks. There's, I hate cats stacks.

2427
02:14:11,881 --> 02:14:15,900
That's her Twitter name and it's all
about her fucking all these rappers.

2428
02:14:15,901 --> 02:14:19,530
She fucks all these rappers and she gets
videos of her with these rappers and

2429
02:14:19,531 --> 02:14:23,380
then she's like, he'd be all doing
cocaine. Dick Holly get logged this.

2430
02:14:23,381 --> 02:14:25,820
They get Bailey,
fuck me and,

2431
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,530
but she's got like a hundred
thousand fucking more than that.

2432
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,750
Almost 200,000 Twitter
followers on Twitter. I have a,

2433
02:14:31,950 --> 02:14:36,330
I used to want to follow up points or
center where they do not stop tweeting.

2434
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:40,980
They tweet,
go on and get my workout on every all day,

2435
02:14:40,981 --> 02:14:44,730
every day. Children looking to
connect with someone that loves them.

2436
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:48,690
I like to follow, not the porn
stars. I like to follow them,

2437
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:51,750
but then when I look at
them replying to a guy,

2438
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:56,310
then I like to go to his website and
see what does that guy have to say?

2439
02:14:56,311 --> 02:14:58,040
These guys that are
tweeting the porn stars car.

2440
02:14:58,140 --> 02:15:00,450
That's where the fucking
real interesting shit is.

2441
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:03,660
You know I went to this one guy and
it was like silence of the lambs.

2442
02:15:03,661 --> 02:15:07,770
It was like kicking in the door with the
flashlight flashlight with the fucking

2443
02:15:07,771 --> 02:15:09,870
pistol, like going, oh shit.

2444
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:14,280
I went to this guy's Twitter page and it
was all him interacting with porn stars

2445
02:15:14,281 --> 02:15:18,750
and a lot of it was like crazy talk.
A lot of it was like,

2446
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:22,770
you know,
you are incredibly inspirational to me.

2447
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:27,300
I just think it's amazing how
you put yourself out there.

2448
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:29,880
My God, I mean, I don't
know how you do it,

2449
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:34,050
but it moves me and I feel
connected to you. And um,

2450
02:15:34,620 --> 02:15:38,130
since you've contacted me and this guy's
going on and on and on like 10 tweets

2451
02:15:38,131 --> 02:15:42,540
in a row, the same person, you know, when
you know you get nutty, it's like, dude,

2452
02:15:42,541 --> 02:15:45,540
you can't recognize the
concept of 140 characters. No,

2453
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:50,100
it's 140 and 140 more than 140 more. And
like, I just stopped reading your shit.

2454
02:15:50,101 --> 02:15:54,270
Sorry, I can't read that. This guy
had like 10 10 to one porn star.

2455
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:56,280
What's really weird is the people that,
you know,

2456
02:15:56,340 --> 02:16:00,030
all the porn starts have like their
shopping lists, their Amazon wishlist.

2457
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:04,290
I did know about that until like
a year ago. How gross is that? Oh,

2458
02:16:04,291 --> 02:16:07,160
it's totally guys. Instead they
just pumped that shit all day.

2459
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:09,720
There was somebody that said
something the other day,

2460
02:16:09,721 --> 02:16:12,060
I can't remember who it
was and I hopefully I'm not
friends with this person,

2461
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:13,800
but they said something like, uh, Oh,

2462
02:16:13,810 --> 02:16:17,130
you guys getting mad at me for
pumping my Amazon wishlist.

2463
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:22,050
I showed you my boobs
yesterday. Come on. Really?

2464
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:27,660
I need to be paid for this. Right.
I need to be paid for my boobs.

2465
02:16:27,661 --> 02:16:31,210
Jesus Christ. Just give me the
PS three slim. I just want it.

2466
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:34,330
How weird is that? The Amazon
wishlist? It's like, come on,

2467
02:16:34,331 --> 02:16:38,680
I know you're a loser by me. Some shit.
What's really weird is that I, I uh,

2468
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:42,970
is how many people actually
buy them stuff? Oh,

2469
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,360
that guy with the 10 fucking
tweets to the porn star.

2470
02:16:45,361 --> 02:16:47,280
He's definitely butter
their underwear stop.

2471
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:51,280
Like when I used to know this
girl that did it, porn, uh, she,

2472
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:56,770
she would get like shoes from the guy
and then like outfits and then like a

2473
02:16:56,780 --> 02:17:01,310
purse and then sunglasses. It was like
this guy felt like he was dating her. Oh,

2474
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:04,060
you think about it like 10 years ago,

2475
02:17:04,061 --> 02:17:08,860
there was no way for a creepy guy on the
internet to contact a porn star and now

2476
02:17:08,861 --> 02:17:13,150
he has Twitter and connects. You look
at our response letters back and if he,

2477
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:15,880
yeah, if he does something
cool like buys her a new purse,

2478
02:17:15,881 --> 02:17:20,110
you know for sure she's going to
say, Oh mg, thank you so much.

2479
02:17:20,111 --> 02:17:22,860
You're so sweet.
Yeah.

2480
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:26,230
And then maybe she's going to come to
Cleveland and fucking show her pussy at

2481
02:17:26,231 --> 02:17:29,680
some club. You know, they do that.
They go on the road. All these things.

2482
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:31,520
While a lot of these girls,

2483
02:17:31,521 --> 02:17:34,090
she's poor girls that you know
that the industry has fallen apart.

2484
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:36,010
It used to be the porn industry.
You know,

2485
02:17:36,011 --> 02:17:39,070
they could just get into porn and they
could get a vivid contract and we a ton

2486
02:17:39,071 --> 02:17:42,640
of money while the Internet crushed it.
You know what I mean? There's free porn.

2487
02:17:42,641 --> 02:17:44,310
It's everywhere else buying porn.
It's like this.

2488
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:46,000
The business has completely fallen apart.

2489
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:48,790
The business model just eroded
because of the Internet.

2490
02:17:48,970 --> 02:17:52,860
So why the recession happened?
The Internet before, well,

2491
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:54,730
they had a legitimate fucking beef.
You know,

2492
02:17:54,731 --> 02:17:56,650
they were talking about people
getting bailouts. They're like,

2493
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:59,260
what about the porn
industry? Right? We're like,

2494
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:02,970
we're going to bail you out like you
dirty birds. That's pretty fucked up too.

2495
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:03,650
True.

2496
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:08,020
It's a legit business where billions of
fucking dollars are coming from it and

2497
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:11,650
millions and millions of people all
throughout this country are enjoying porn

2498
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:14,050
and it's a legit,
it's a legit business to bail out,

2499
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:19,140
but no one would ever dare spend your
fucking tax dollars keeping some fucking

2500
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,160
porno house at Chatsworth or over, you
know? Yeah. It's crazy. Right? Totally.

2501
02:18:24,161 --> 02:18:27,630
What was really weird to me is I
don't get the whole, like I say,

2502
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:30,010
like you like gin and Jamison and
you're just like, ah, you know,

2503
02:18:30,011 --> 02:18:31,590
you can't find any videos,
agenda.

2504
02:18:31,591 --> 02:18:34,200
Jamison on the Internet for some reason
the Internet is broken or whatever.

2505
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:36,340
For Jenna Jamison videos, what? Right.

2506
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:40,990
So you see there's a video of her that
costs $10 and it's just her getting anal

2507
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:44,590
and then [inaudible] name.
Okay, well as an example, right?

2508
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:48,180
They do with a way more than 10 bucks
is what I'm trying to say. Here's,

2509
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:53,050
here's miscellaneous hot girl over here,
anal video for free. Why would you,

2510
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:56,810
why is there that big of a difference
to pay 10 bucks to see this girl, Dude,

2511
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:01,880
oh dude, guys become obsessed with a
girl, becomes their jerk-off girlfriend.

2512
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:05,830
I use that, I guess, uh, porn it as
masturbation and then once I'm done,

2513
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:09,990
I'm not watching porn. Something still
they fixate on one chick, they'll like,

2514
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,340
they'll have this one girl,
you know, for whatever reason,

2515
02:19:12,341 --> 02:19:14,230
she just does it for them.
And they did decide.

2516
02:19:14,410 --> 02:19:16,630
They've jerked off a couple of times
to her and it was very satisfying.

2517
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:19,950
So decided they're only gonna
go to her videos at one time.

2518
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:24,850
This is really embarrassing. I'm my
space messaged a porn star that I liked,

2519
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:28,580
but did you say I really like you?
If you're ever in La,

2520
02:19:28,581 --> 02:19:33,100
you should come to one of my shows
like a girl, Bree Olsen. Whoa.

2521
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,830
Free Olsen. Black Dick.
Like a champ. She's so cool.

2522
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:41,660
Like a duck to water.
She is so cute.

2523
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:44,750
And then the guy that I was dating
saw the message and it wasn't really

2524
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:47,170
embarrassing
like

2525
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:53,660
walking through the casino
[inaudible] she was like,

2526
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:58,070
what is this mind space mass?
It is checking your my space.

2527
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:02,960
That's a symptom of a greater evil.
That guy was looking for

2528
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:08,840
Bri Holsten God Dang them
bitches out to writers.

2529
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,980
I would be offended. They
were looking at my master's.
Yeah. What's that? Oh, I ever,

2530
02:20:13,981 --> 02:20:16,250
I don't know. Have you ever had someone
pick up your phone and just like,

2531
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:20,510
let me see who you're texting.
Get the fuck off that. Yeah,

2532
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:24,620
you got to grow up. I did want to touch
people's phones. Can't talk to my phone.

2533
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:29,140
Whoa. Nice. Woo. Bri, Bri Olson. Um,

2534
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:32,420
no one takes a big black
dick in the ass with a smile.

2535
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,430
She's so innocent looking. She's so
innocent looking and she sounds innocent.

2536
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:40,020
She's very vocal coach.
She still,

2537
02:20:40,021 --> 02:20:44,980
she's got that giant black snake in her
anus and she's like, Oh fuck my ass.

2538
02:20:44,981 --> 02:20:48,410
And like, whoa. Do Isis. Taylor is, no,

2539
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:51,650
she's the last month pet a pet
of the month. She's pretty hot.

2540
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:54,110
Then you got through our videos
and she just had black Dicks,

2541
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:58,490
like two black dicks in her ass and
stuff like that just ruins a girl

2542
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:03,440
because I don't even want
to say the names, but uh,

2543
02:21:03,510 --> 02:21:06,650
is there a few poor girls that
have done those? A gangbang videos.

2544
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:10,610
That's, that's the number one. Ruiner oh,

2545
02:21:10,611 --> 02:21:14,390
like when it's like 98 cops in
10 seconds or more than that.

2546
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:16,460
There are hundreds now
they're up to the hundreds.

2547
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:18,350
One girl just broke the record recently.

2548
02:21:18,351 --> 02:21:22,190
I think she went like 600 and
then her friend there were,

2549
02:21:22,191 --> 02:21:25,400
I believe they were on open Anthony, they
were talking about this and her friend,

2550
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:29,480
she was talking about how her friend just
broke the anal record and she was mad

2551
02:21:29,481 --> 02:21:30,420
that her friend,
like,

2552
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:34,370
I'm going to go get that record
to see these people are insane.

2553
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:40,130
I actually don't necessarily blame
them as much as I blame the people

2554
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:44,420
surrounding them that are like,
yeah, keep doing it. Well, you know,

2555
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:47,090
yes and no because listen,
you're dealing,

2556
02:21:47,091 --> 02:21:49,760
you're dealing with a fairly
finished product and you know,

2557
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:52,610
if it's a shit sandwich, it's a shit
sandwich. What are you gonna do?

2558
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:55,150
You're gonna scrape the shit
out and put mayonnaise down,

2559
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:59,090
lay some new fucking meet and we're
going gonna make it ham and falafel. No,

2560
02:21:59,091 --> 02:22:02,210
it's a shit sandwich. This
bitch is crazy. If she's,

2561
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,090
if she's a blow these guys out of videos,

2562
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:08,080
she's going to be blown
someone at a concert or she's
going to let somebody fuck

2563
02:22:08,081 --> 02:22:12,260
her in the middle of a bar while a bunch
of people watch she's nuts. You know,

2564
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:12,521
you're,

2565
02:22:12,521 --> 02:22:15,350
you're not going to be able to fix her
unless you have a time machine where you

2566
02:22:15,351 --> 02:22:17,930
can go back in time and stop her
stepfather from fingering her.

2567
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:20,000
You're not going to be able to fix,

2568
02:22:20,001 --> 02:22:23,720
or I film it and then go back in time
10 more minutes and then stop it.

2569
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:30,960
I don't even know what you just said.
If Future Shit. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean,

2570
02:22:30,961 --> 02:22:33,390
unless you, you, it's
all what we said earlier.

2571
02:22:33,391 --> 02:22:36,780
It's all about the way they're
raised. You know, all human beings,

2572
02:22:36,781 --> 02:22:40,170
that's our number one problem is that
we're not concentrating on schools.

2573
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:43,260
We're not concentrating on,
on educating people about parenthood,

2574
02:22:43,261 --> 02:22:47,520
providing people with child support and
child, you know, childcare and you know,

2575
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:50,280
making like positive environments
for children to grow up in.

2576
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:53,430
And then of course people are angry
because they can't get what they want.

2577
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:55,410
They're told the, you know,
the world's their oyster,

2578
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:58,110
but meanwhile they're living in a world
of shit and they're in their projects

2579
02:22:58,111 --> 02:22:58,830
and just,

2580
02:22:58,830 --> 02:23:01,770
and they're having babies and no one
wants to give them money and they got no

2581
02:23:01,771 --> 02:23:05,370
money and he's got no fucking
happiness and shit. Shit, Shit.

2582
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:10,380
Kid grows up angry, fucked up, begets
more angry, fucked up behavior.

2583
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:13,410
And then it all comes from that.
It all, it seems so simple,

2584
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:17,600
but yet there's no resources put
towards it whatsoever. No one is on TV.

2585
02:23:17,650 --> 02:23:21,360
There's no politician saying we have to
do a way better job of raising children.

2586
02:23:21,361 --> 02:23:24,120
We have to do a way more
responsible job of parenting.

2587
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:26,190
We have to understand
what the actual role is.

2588
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,830
It isn't just this is your kid
and you're the dad. No, no, no.

2589
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:33,930
You are in charge and managing
the development of a new
human being and you can

2590
02:23:33,931 --> 02:23:37,050
make that life incredible positive.
Really.

2591
02:23:37,051 --> 02:23:42,051
Like you can set connections in that
child's mind that are very positive and

2592
02:23:42,121 --> 02:23:46,290
loving and friendly and make that person
an asset to any community that they're

2593
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:50,460
in. Or you can create a monster.
Right? Yeah. It's a huge deal.

2594
02:23:50,461 --> 02:23:55,461
I mean it's amazing too how it's so
easy to become a parent and how he,

2595
02:23:56,390 --> 02:23:58,180
yeah, it's sad. It's so easy.

2596
02:23:58,181 --> 02:24:02,540
My accident by accident you have to go to,
yeah,

2597
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:07,140
it should be hard as fuck to make pre
Paul people. It's just that again,

2598
02:24:07,141 --> 02:24:09,240
if it wasn't, I wouldn't
have made a person, you know,

2599
02:24:09,241 --> 02:24:11,520
I mean honestly my wife
got pregnant by accident,

2600
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:14,010
but you might have like if
they made it like a college,

2601
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:18,750
like he had to go through like four
years of like strange baby wouldn't have

2602
02:24:18,751 --> 02:24:20,520
done it, but maybe you would
them maybe it wouldn't have done.

2603
02:24:20,521 --> 02:24:23,790
It would be such a special thing that
you'd be like, I want it. I want a baby.

2604
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:27,630
I get say that man. But you're
you, if you're, if you're selfish,

2605
02:24:27,631 --> 02:24:29,670
which I frick certainly was,

2606
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:33,810
and you get used to your freedom and
you think about a buy a baby as an

2607
02:24:33,811 --> 02:24:37,460
infringement on freedom and like, I'll
do it someday. Maybe someday, maybe,

2608
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:39,690
maybe when I'm ready.
Maybe when I got this in line,

2609
02:24:39,691 --> 02:24:44,580
maybe when I got that I didn't have a
kid til I was 40 but in all those things

2610
02:24:44,581 --> 02:24:46,230
before the baby's actually born,

2611
02:24:46,250 --> 02:24:49,590
either you don't really understand
what it really is until you have one.

2612
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:52,920
And then when you have one,
all that selfishness, it's
like, no, no, no, no, no.

2613
02:24:53,070 --> 02:24:54,210
This is like a part of me.

2614
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:57,150
Like this isn't like a new person
that I have to take care of. It is,

2615
02:24:57,151 --> 02:24:59,870
but it's a part of me. Like you, you,

2616
02:24:59,871 --> 02:25:03,240
you have this connection to that child
that really doesn't exist until you have

2617
02:25:03,241 --> 02:25:07,980
that connection. And you have to sort
of be incredibly ready for that. Yeah.

2618
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:12,060
You gotta be ready and done everything
you want to do or you become ready as it

2619
02:25:12,061 --> 02:25:16,350
happens. You know, sometimes it
does. Ed. He's had a few friends,

2620
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:20,250
girls that he dated that were just scan
aromas and all of a sudden they got

2621
02:25:20,251 --> 02:25:23,710
pregnant and they had kids and they
just changed everything. Went Veg,

2622
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:27,190
started doing yoga. Stop fucking around,
no drinking, no drugs, clean sober,

2623
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:30,490
going to meetings, you know, getting
their shit together, having a good job,

2624
02:25:30,491 --> 02:25:33,490
starting their own business because I
got a few stories of that because it's

2625
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:36,940
just like the overwhelming responsibility
in love you feel for this kid.

2626
02:25:37,290 --> 02:25:41,070
I think it either clicks or it doesn't,
and you raise it porn,

2627
02:25:41,071 --> 02:25:44,980
star mushrooms and babies.
That's what it's all about folks.

2628
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:46,210
Getting mushrooms to babies,

2629
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:49,510
raising children the right way
and giving people mushrooms.

2630
02:25:49,511 --> 02:25:50,650
So we realize we're all connected.

2631
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:55,420
This is my platform for 2012 I want to
run for president. We think not president.

2632
02:25:55,421 --> 02:25:57,490
I'm going to run for president
when president of the Internet.

2633
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:01,210
I'm gonna Start my own thing. I think the
regular president thing is all rigged.

2634
02:26:01,211 --> 02:26:06,040
It's all bullshit. You know? It's
like, you know you're not in,

2635
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:09,790
it's like campaigning to be
a character on a cartoon.

2636
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:12,940
It's like the cartoons already
written like we don't need you.

2637
02:26:13,230 --> 02:26:16,420
We already have our players. We
already have, the roles are in,

2638
02:26:16,421 --> 02:26:19,640
no matter what your, it's a Democrat
or Republican or an or a cookie.

2639
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:23,310
It's an independent, whatever it is, Green
party, libertarian or whatever he was.

2640
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,990
No one's taking you seriously
stab a crat or it's Republican.

2641
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:28,090
It's a fucking game.
It's a game that's already set up.

2642
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:31,270
We need a new game president
of the Internet. Well

2643
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:36,940
will it president Internet to kick out
all the cuts. Stop all the bullshit.

2644
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:37,900
Make everybody nice.

2645
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:40,540
I would set up the Internet at the
same way I set up my message board.

2646
02:26:40,690 --> 02:26:45,160
Why have one room, which is shit talking
one on one, which is like for everybody.

2647
02:26:45,161 --> 02:26:45,970
That's cool.

2648
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:48,590
If you're nice and you're cool and
even if you're kind of slow or you're,

2649
02:26:48,591 --> 02:26:50,320
you know, whatever, as long
as you're not a Douche bag,

2650
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:53,710
just go on there and post and try to
have a good time and try not to spam and

2651
02:26:53,711 --> 02:26:56,200
try to, you know, engage in
interesting conversations.

2652
02:26:56,350 --> 02:26:59,110
But if it become a douchebag,
we give you a pink name.

2653
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:03,100
And we send you to the retard room and
you could still go to shit talking one oh

2654
02:27:03,101 --> 02:27:06,970
one but you can't post
anymore. It's pretty much like
how it is now though. You,

2655
02:27:06,971 --> 02:27:10,180
you either out of prison are in
prison or you get the electric chair

2656
02:27:12,010 --> 02:27:14,210
again, there's analogies. He's
motherfucker, they're there.

2657
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:16,700
They don't make any sense.
This whole strange.

2658
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:21,640
You're saying you would have your world
or your country be like your message

2659
02:27:21,641 --> 02:27:24,400
board where you're either in the
normal mess up or the country.

2660
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:26,670
I'm talking about managing the Internet.
I'm talking about being president,

2661
02:27:26,671 --> 02:27:30,200
the Internet, right? Eventually we
will live in a world. You see, well,

2662
02:27:30,201 --> 02:27:32,830
we'll not be a regular world.
We're going to be connected, right?

2663
02:27:33,210 --> 02:27:35,860
And when that happens, I think we
should set it up like a message board.

2664
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,310
Got to have a Douche bag
room, right? Which is prison.

2665
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:42,520
But it's not because you don't
want to put someone in a cage.

2666
02:27:42,910 --> 02:27:45,520
Prison is for fucking real assholes.
You know

2667
02:27:48,210 --> 02:27:49,730
what? Prison, yes, he, terrible analogy.

2668
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:53,350
But prisoner would prison really should
be for his people will hurt people.

2669
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:57,280
Whether you steal from them with you
and when they bring you into prison,

2670
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:59,800
you know, ideally it should
be all right, sit down.

2671
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:02,320
We've got to figure out how to fix
your life. But that's not what it is.

2672
02:28:02,321 --> 02:28:04,410
It's like, here's a guy
who's going to rape. You

2673
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:09,910
want me to keep me to join a white
gang? Because you're white. You know,

2674
02:28:09,911 --> 02:28:13,210
you need to get down with the Latinos
because you're Mexican. You know,

2675
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:18,430
fuck how we know that that goes on and
there's nothing done about it. Well,

2676
02:28:18,431 --> 02:28:22,920
there's a website, stop prison, rape.com.
It's stories. Meanwhile, the stores,

2677
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:26,150
that dude's beat off to Wellesley,
it's probably not even real stories.

2678
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:28,580
It's probably just some sick fuck.
It was like a fan of prison rape.

2679
02:28:28,581 --> 02:28:32,990
Like some dudes are a fan of
civil war reenactments. Yeah.

2680
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:37,160
He's faced like letters to home
from a civil civil war soldier.

2681
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:41,090
This guy is faking it. No prison
rape stories. And on that note,

2682
02:28:41,091 --> 02:28:44,960
ladies and gentlemen, that's the end
of the podcast. We'd like to thank, um,

2683
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:47,460
little Esther for coming.
We would like to thank, uh,

2684
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:50,540
the fleshlight of course
for sponsoring our podcasts.

2685
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:54,950
You can go to Joe rogan.net. My website
has a link and if you click on that link,

2686
02:28:54,951 --> 02:28:57,560

15% off. It's all fixed now, right?

2687
02:28:57,561 --> 02:29:00,950
Does that Brian [inaudible] a coupon
code that you just use? Rogan.

2688
02:29:00,951 --> 02:29:05,090
Now does it say it? Yeah, it says on the
banner, you click, it goes in and says,

2689
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:08,420
okay, so there's a coupon
code. Uh, and that's,

2690
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,910
that's good for 15% off.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2691
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:13,070
this right now we're going
to play dream weaver. Folks,

2692
02:29:13,071 --> 02:29:17,750
this is a song from the 70s.
Yeah. Yet in 1969 maybe.

2693
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:22,250
And um, if you're around this weekend
is UFC of course. Oh, that's right. Um,

2694
02:29:22,251 --> 02:29:23,060
Friday night,

2695
02:29:23,060 --> 02:29:28,060
tomorrow night I am in Santa Ana at the
Galaxy Theater with Joey Coco Diaz one

2696
02:29:28,371 --> 02:29:31,100
show 8:00 PM.
We're ready to throw the fuck down.

2697
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:33,230
That's if Joey's not mad at me
for not answering the phone.

2698
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:36,200
I called you twice cock sock
fucking podcast. Who gives a shit?

2699
02:29:36,201 --> 02:29:39,710
You don't even know those people.
I'm family. So that's tomorrow night,

2700
02:29:39,890 --> 02:29:43,490
which is a Friday,
October 22nd.

2701
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:48,320
And we were at the galaxy theater. Um,
and if you're around on Monday night,

2702
02:29:48,321 --> 02:29:53,240
October 25th, our pal Don Barris has a
show in the main room, the Ding Dong show.

2703
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:58,370
And uh, if you're a fan of freak shows,
if you're a fan of, of chaos and,

2704
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,450
and odd human beings, Don Barris knows
how to put it together, like watching,

2705
02:30:02,451 --> 02:30:06,470
not craziness. And it's going to be a
huge event, like a big party. Seriously.

2706
02:30:06,471 --> 02:30:10,880
Shockingly unbelievable. It's so funny.
Yeah. And Don's a great guy and he's,

2707
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:14,260
the problem is the new comedy store is
kind of not appreciating dawn's efforts.

2708
02:30:14,261 --> 02:30:17,180
So this, if this doesn't work, he
might be kind of forced out of their,

2709
02:30:17,181 --> 02:30:20,900
like Brody Stevens has been, last
time I was, I saw the Dingdong show,

2710
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:25,010
there was a schizophrenia comic, I
forget his name and he said, yeah.

2711
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:28,820
And he used to do open mic with him and
he took off all his pants and he only

2712
02:30:28,821 --> 02:30:33,260

thing that you hate and you like thongs,

2713
02:30:33,890 --> 02:30:38,060
fanny pack. He was only wearing a
fanny pack, but his balls were so long,

2714
02:30:38,061 --> 02:30:42,610
his balls were hanging below the
fanny pack. That's odd sound.
