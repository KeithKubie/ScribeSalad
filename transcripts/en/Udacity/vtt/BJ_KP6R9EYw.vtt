00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.029
When you've got it all working, then go

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.420
ahead and extend the code. Add a function greet

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.570
by period that takes the name and a period or a period's a time of day like

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.680
morning, afternoon, evening. And return a HelloClass object

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.030
whose greeting field includes a greeting using the name

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.670
and the period. For example, if the name is

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.290
the name is Kippy and the period is morning,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.890
the message in the Hello Class would be: Good

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.380
morning Kippy! And if the name was Ken and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.720
the period was evening, the message would be: Good

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.020
evening, Ken! Add this Endpoints API function to your app,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.750
try it out in the API's explorer, and update

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.520
index with html to allow people to call this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.110
function from the UI. So just to remind it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.917
to go to the API Explorer. Go to /_ah/api/explorer and

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:58.440
when you've got your app working and it's got this new

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.530
function. This function must have this exact name because we're going

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.290
to test it and if you use a different name our

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.360
test won't work. Go ahead and enter your app id here
