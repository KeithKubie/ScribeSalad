[Nostalgia Critic Intro song]

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.780
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.600
I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760
Let's talk about Ralph Bakshi.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.380
From the 60's to the 80's he was one of the few animation directors that insisted

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.860
animation shouldn't just be for kids.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.760
In fact, some should be explicitly for adults!

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.540
This resulted in him making films that often gained critical and even box office success.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.260
Most of the time, these movies were weird, political, raunchy and usually in bad taste.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.220
Bakshi himself also gained a reputation as being weird, political, raunchy and usually in bad taste.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.740
Usually splitting people's opinion of him.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.400
Some say he's a genius, others say he's mad...

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.800
I say he's a mad genius.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.120
Yes, the madness can overshadow the genius,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.260
but the genius can also overshadow the madness.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.260
And since his passing recently,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.520
I figure it'd only make sense to look at his greatest work:

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.040
"American Pop".

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.300
So, in loving memory of one of our greatest animation legends,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.520
I give you--

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.760
[phone rings]

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.660
Hello?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.680
He's not dead?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.340
Oh.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880
Could've sworn I heard that somewhere...

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.900
What?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.100
He's coming over here?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.100
Oh, hell no!

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.600
You keep that loon away from me!

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.400
[rumbling]

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.520
You lazy asshole!

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.980
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.560
Stop it!

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.440
STOP IT!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.320
You need to fight the crypto-fascist system of the man!

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
By drawing big-titted ladies in black face while waving around bananas.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.580
You know, which represents our economic downfall!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.240
What the hell are you talking about!?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.340
I'm talking about 'Nam.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.740
Here, have a puppy!

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.480
OW!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.620
OWWW!!

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.700
Look, I kind of thought you weren't alive. 
Meaning, I could praise your genius

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.480
without having to actually deal with you.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.920
Stop sucking my cock, Critic!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.880
And talk about something REALLY interesting.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.160
Like what?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.740
Like the last feature film I ever mades:

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.740
"Cool World".

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.340
[hard rock music plays]

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720
Wait a minute, I thought that was one of your biggest cinematic disasters.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.360
It was critically panned, bombed like crazy,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.380
it didn't even really get a big cult following like your other films.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.140
Yeah, but Critic, it's important to understand your failures.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.600
Isn't that what this show is about?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.800
Through recognizing our mistakes and missteps,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.740
We can discover how not to fall into the same traps.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.360
It also helps us appreciate when we overcome these challenges.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.740
As well as give an idea of the what the artists originally had in mind.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.340
Wow, that's...

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.580
actually kind of profound.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.180
Have I mentioned how many producers
 I've punched in the face lately?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.780
Well, nevertheless, you have a good point.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.260
Yeah, more producers need to be beaten.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.900
NO!

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.300
...maybe.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.540
I'm talking about reviewing Cool World.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.580
Analyzing how it didn't work,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.020
why it didn't work and how it wasn't necessarily a great director's fault.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.160
Hey, did you ever see the movie I made for kids that had

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.880
swearing, gore and Nazi propaganda?

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.180
It's a "family picture".

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.500
Pray for me guys.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.820
This is Cool World.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.780
So, nothing says "cool", "risque" and  "badass" like

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.300
1945's Nevada.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.300
The Lindy Hop could not be contained.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.300
As World War ll vet, Frank, played by Brad Pitt,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.980
returns home to his mother.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.980
And he has the perfect surprise for an aging woman in her forties...

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.360
a motorcycle!

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.720
"Ready? We're goin for a ride."

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.100
"Oh, no, no, I have to finish dinner."

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.300
Come on!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.960
Let's go riding ten miles per hour 
in the middle of the desert in my best suit!

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.720
We'll go down to the hottest spot in town:

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.360
The Gambling Casino.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.280
Right next to the Drinking Bar.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.280
But a drunk couple are driving recklessly on the road

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.920
and crash into Frank and his mom.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.600
Oh, no. Not that couple.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.560
This one.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.020
[Goofy Holler ]

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.800
[explosions and shouting]
I'm hit! Mortars comin' in!

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.340
Frank for a minute thinks he's back in the war until he realizes it's very unlikely his mother enlisted.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.620
Nostalgia Critic: At least the bike's okay.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.120
[deep voice]

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.880
I knew it! They're so sneaky!

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.160
[buzzing]

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.320
Aaah!

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.380
"Well, it works."

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.400
"My spike works."

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.220
Boy, if you started watching this movie with no idea of what it's about,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.920
that would be totally out of left field, wouldn't it?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.560
I wonder what's gonna happen?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.260
Maybe he'll get revenge on the driver.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.760
Or it's how he reenlists to distract from the pain or--

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.380
[screaming]

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.900
"Oh, bother."

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.720
...Doctor Wiley creates Brad Pitt Man.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.220
"You're. Not. Real."

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.080
"We may not be real to you as yet, but we will be."

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.740
Just as Frank is wondering why he's in a different movie,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.920
presumably called "Who Plagiarized Roger Rabbit?"

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.420
We cut a mere 47 years later where a prisoner named Jack, played by Gabriel Byrne,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.280
is getting dragged into his cartoons.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.640
[crackling and screaming]

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.820
[screaming]

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.960
Wow, the alternate ending to Shawshank Redemption
 is much more classic Stephen King.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.520
Thus, he's given his introduction not only to Cool World but to Holli Would, played by Kim Basinger.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.080
[hard rock music plays]

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.240
"'My god, I've created Anime..'"

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.720
Man, this guy knows all the smooth moves, doesn't he?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.900
He's doing the classic "put boob here" technique.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.940
[crackling]

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.920
But Jack is...immediately sent back.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.800
I guess Holli just wanted to ask if her body was as impractical as Jessica Rabbit's?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.460
As we see 47 years have been pretty kind to Brad Pitt.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.500
Actually, who am I kidding? They fucking have!

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.200
But he's angry because Holli apparently brought a human, or a Noid as they call them, into their world.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.180
"Rumor has it, Holli, that you had a Noid visitation 
at the Slash Club last night."

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.980
Don't you know what they do to pizzas!?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.260
Holli: "You're just a regular true believer of law and order, huh?"

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.640
"Beat it, coppa."

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.680
Nostalgia Critic: We're gamblin' on Feivel's ransom.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.200
[buzzing]

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.760
And by the way, if you think some of these animated sections seem...random...

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.920
check the rating on the "What the Piss-O-Meter" with these scenes during their chat.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.780
"You could help me..."

Ghost of Spuds Mackenzie does not approve?

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.160
Get a load of this one.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.940
"Don't you see?"

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.500
"They're real."

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560
"They really taste it."

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.380
"And when they do it with a man..."

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.800
[sighs passionately]

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.940
So, Ralph...

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.780
Yeah, what?

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.260
First of all, what are you eating?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.820
An eyeball and mustard sandwich, of course.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.600
Of course, second, what's with the random bits of animation not tying into anything?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.040
Oh, well, originally we were gonna have all sorts of cool stuff,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.320
but then the s-s-s-studio got involved and

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.800
next thing you know, we didn't even have a script!

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.360
So, with nuttin to do, I was just like,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.920
"Hey, friends, eh... Just draw some random sh*t and we'll just toss that in the screen somewhere."

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.960
Yeah, but some of those animations aren't even finished.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.200
In fact, you actually played this animation twice in the same scene!

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.820
LITERALLY drawing attention to the problem!

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.880
Did you...think showing it twice would somehow complete it?

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.440
Hey!

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.620
I wanted to show the s-s-s-studio what happens when you mess with an artist's vision!

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.560
You have a bad movie with your name on it.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.240
And get paid for it.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.740
I can't tell if you're my hero or the worst kind of crazy...

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.760
Can't it be both?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.820
So while enduring the side cartoons you see in "MAD Magazine",

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.120
it looks like Jack is let out of prison and he goes to a comic shop

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.840
where he sees his comic: Cool World is being sold.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.660
And if I had a nickel for every comic shop employee who looked like this...

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.660
"I mean, I know people, friends of mine, who
 want to be Holli Would when they grow up."

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.920
When they grow up?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.380
How old are your friends, five?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.420
Nostalgia Critic: "I always wanted to be a personalityless shell."

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.280
But we find out a little more about why he was in jail.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.640
"Why don't you do a book on that guy you murdered?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.920
"You know, that guy you found in bed with your wife?"

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.620
Whoa.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.980
Well...eh...

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.420
That's a big development.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.620
Holy smokes. One of our main characters is a killer.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.160
I wonder where they're gonna take this--

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.720
Rrrrrright out the door!

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.460
That's where they take it, right out the goddamn door!

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.940
Our hero is apparently a murderer who...judging by the picture on his book

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.620
was not in jail very long.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.660
And it's never referenced again and we're supposed to just sympathize with him

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.300
when he goes back to Cool World

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.120
Which also has no explanation on how that's happening.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.380
You know, maybe it's supposed to be like one of those deep character studies

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.480
where you're not supposed to know if he did it or not.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.520
I mean, after all, they do give him a lot of deep writing. Like...

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520
"Am I dreaming?"

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.020
And...

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.660
"Yeah."

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.440
And...

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.220
"I drew you..."

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:06.880
And...

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.780
"Yeah..."

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.640
Not forgetting...

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.220
"What?"

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.900
Okay, was this dude charged by the letter?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.360
Why are his lines so short?

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.700
We can't even get to know this guy because he has as much dialogue as Grommet!

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.260
In fact, Grommet has more personality than this guy ever has and he never says a word!

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.560
But then again, maybe that's good when you do hear

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.240
the dialogue they actually have in this.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.860
"What'd you do that for?"

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.980
"Because I dig you."

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.880
To be fair, if I had to say lines like this, I'd kill someone too.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.820
So, while he indulges the Nightmare on Elm Street babies

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080
Frank stops by...um...

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.200
black hair Holli.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.400
"Word is, you got a thing for Noids."

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.420
"Tough guy."

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.060
[giggles]

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.360
"Alright, where you wanna go? Movies?"

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.880
Amazing how well that syncs up, isn't it?

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.780
How big did he think she was when filming this?

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.160
She'd have to be stretched out like a squashed
 Wile E. Coyote to match that push!

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.700
"Hey, boss! We gotta go!"

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.100
But he gets interrupted and has to head out.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.000
So, their car suddenly turns into a...cartoon.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.440
Okay, Ralph,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.540
why are sometimes things animated and then
other times they're three dimensions?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.640
Like the car or the cardboard cutouts?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.540
Why does everybody call my characters that?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.280
I mean the actual cardboard cutouts.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.220
Oh, see,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.860
I wanted it to be like a live action painting.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.900
You see, that's what I did for years and years. Paint!

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:26.900
And I wanted to transform the lights and shadows
 of my work into a more physical dimension.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.240
In fact, originally I was going to 
call it Background: The Movie.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.140
You just don't understand, Critic.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.740
He's showing the anguish of our utilitarian world colliding with the abstract of untapped potential.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.500
With boobies!

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.360
Where the hell did you come from, follow-up question?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.160
Who the hell are you?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.440
I'm Julie Taymor,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.260
director of countless Broadway hits and kind-of-good movies.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.640
She helped me escape.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.280
Oh, okay.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.020
So what the fuck do you mean "escape"?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.820
Oh, escape. Don't you know?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.200
We were in the Institute for the Artistically Insane.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.420
Oh, my god, I've heard of that.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.360
That's where artists go when their ideas stop obeying logic and reason!

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.980
I don't know why I was there.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.340
Having Bono do Spiderman: Turn Off the Dark, it killed!

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.900
Literally. It LITERALLY killed.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.300
Hey, you can't make an omelet without breaking some heads, yo.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:07.800
That's true.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.300
Yeah, you just don't get us, Critic.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.880
Oh, God. Spike Lee...

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.420
Can you believe they put me in there?

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.820
After I directed 65 projects and at least 1/3rd of them was watchable?

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.320
That's why I love you guys!

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.320
You understand me and the struggle, which is real!

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.780
His work is about the impression of 
blacks against whites

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.800
as told through an animated backdrop
of color or no color. Right?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.600
Yeah...with boobies.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.520
Well, at least nobody else escaped.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.660
Oh, well, there was that one guy who almost got away but they caught him just in time.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.160
[loud clang]

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.240
And I had two hit movies back to back!

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.020
Don't worry about it, just get yourself 
nominated for another Oscar

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.240
and they'll forget about
 all the horrible things you've done.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.540
So, Holli takes Jack to her club.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.740
Jesus, even their cars are getting me hard!

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.120
But Frank stops them and explains, 
poorly, what's going on.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.340
"I'm a cartoonist, I drew all this."

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.620
Frank: "This place exists with or without you."

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.360
"You believe me, right? I'm not one of your creations."

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.520
Oh, now everything makes sense.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.920
Thanks for clearing that up.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.460
We don't need any more information beyond that.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.020
That's like God coming out and saying

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.800
"I CREATED THE COSMOS AND THE UNIVERSE..."

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.420
"ALL EXCEPT FOR SWEDEN."

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.600
"I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM."

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.680
"OH, WELL. I'LL JUST ACCEPT IT."

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.660
"SWEDEN."

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.500
"Ordinary fountain pen, right?"

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.600
"Around here, this can be a big nuisance."

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.920
Kind of like our foreground.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.540
"One should be careful how they wave this thing."

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.800
Jack: "No, I don't get it."

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.240
"Of course you don't get it, because you're a wackadoo."

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.360
Hey, that is OUR word!

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.020
He also explains that in this world of cartoons or "doodles", there's only one law:

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.160
Noids do not have sex with doodles.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.240
Frank: "You think she's got a thing for you, don't you?"

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.140
"The truth is she's been after me and 
every other noid who's come through here

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.380
it's just that no one's been insane 
enough to get involved with her."

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.400
I somehow doubt that.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.440
Have you seen DeviantArt?

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.980
Getting involved with her is not the craziest thing compared to others.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.260
So, Jack is dropped off back home resulting in him driving to the desert to pace.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.300
Oh, well that was worth a whole shooting day,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.420
back to where we just were!

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.580
[screaming]

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.580
Thank god we had that essential 26 seconds

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.700
of him being in the real world.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.500
Now we can go back to...exactly the same place we were!

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.200
Why don't they just call this "Scenes"?

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.540
Scenes World?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.740
So, after...I don't know, something stupid.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.140
Frank goes back to Holli's place.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.580
"Do you think she'll let us in?"

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.900
Well, it is one of only TWO places he goes in this city, so I would hope so.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.080
He goes up to Holli to say pretty much 
the same thing he always says.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.540
"You stay away from the Noid."

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240
Yeah, that's like 90% of your dialogue.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.460
You're totally on repeat.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.320
You're the mother/daughter scenes from The Room!

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.920
We heard you once, the other 70 
gajillion times aren't needed!

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.440
"Be content with the cards you've been dealt."

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.380
"Well, you prance around here waving that 
gun around like you're some big deal."

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.000
Wait, wait, hold on. Is anyone even listening to us?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.080
Or are you too distracted by the background?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.000
I know you can chew the scenery, but what do you do when the scenery chews you?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.420
But Holli, of course, has Jack hidden and definitely has plans to feel the Byrne,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.380
but not before a lot of persuading.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.120
Jack: "It can't go any further than this, Holli."

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.320
Holli: "You gonna follow the rules?"

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.960
Jack: "No."

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.840
Holli: "Or are you gonna follow your instincts?"

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.340
Jack: "Yeah."

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.660
Persuading over.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.780
[rock music plays]

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.160
I feel like I'm getting an STD just watching this.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.120
[screaming]

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.620
[sighs passionately]

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.360
[explosion]

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.240
WHOA!

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.760
No wonder you weren't supposed to fuck a doodle,

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.460
apparently they explode!

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.720
Blowjobs blow up!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.460
But it's all good, cause we have this incredibly funny line to end on.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.820
"Was it good for you?"

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.060
"It wasn't what I expected."

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.820
The movie in a nutshell.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.720
So, Frank AGAIN goes to visit his girlfriend.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.900
Is his police route like one line in between two places?

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.160
Where he once again makes awkward chitchat.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.960
"Tough night?"

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.300
Now that's a sensual message.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.320
I call this the "almost puppet" mouth.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.940
We also see that having sex with a Noid results in the doodle becoming a Noid herself.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.900
Nostalgia Critic: "I suddenly want to make terrible career choices,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.880
like be in Fifty Shades Darker."

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.300
She, of course, wants to go to the real world to see if that too looks like a lesser production of Bebe's Kids.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.160
And because exposition is apparently too expensive

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.800
they just transport again without ever explaining how.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.900
Okay, Ralph,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.700
They start off talking about this spike that's used to teleport people in between worlds,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.560
Yet it's never used again in any of these other teleportations.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.480
It...just seems to happen whenever they want, and sometimes even when they don't want.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.000
How do you explain that?

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.960
Oh, I dunno.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.120
What do you mean you don't know!?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.380
I thought you wrote the script!

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.640
Well, the original script, yeah.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.740
You, see, I sold Paramount a "Hard 'R' Animated Horror Film

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.640
mixed with live action because that kind of genre hadn't been done before.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.360
But on the first day of shooting, I was given a completely different script

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.960
that was written in secret by two other writers!

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.640
So, literally from day one, I didn't know what I was doing

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.660
because the movie I wrote wasn't the movie I fucking wrote!

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.560
Holy smokes, no wonder so much of this isn't making sense.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.420
It actually happens more than you know.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.160
Yeah, producers change everything and we get all the blame.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.120
When will people learn that the vision of the artist is all you need to make something brilliant?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.280
By the way, I love when you did Lord of the Rings

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.320
how you made Saruman "Aruman".

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.780
Yeah, I just hid the letter S.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.960
As you should.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.800
Well, that's nothing compared to how you did a torture scene in Drop Squad

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.940
with Oreo cookies.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.040
And dressed a woman like Aunt Jemima.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.760
Or how you dropped, like, a whole third of the story in Across the Universe!

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.880
Nobody understood!

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.780
They never do.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.640
I'm not sure that's a bad thing.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.700
So the two of them end up in a night club

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.460
where we see Frank Sinatra Jr. figuring out the best way to fire his agent.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.920
Seriously, why did he take this cameo?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.960
"Let's make love."

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.080
Well, that answers that.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.020
"Hey!"

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.320
"She's with me!"

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.600
Security: "Nah, she's with us."

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.180
Dude, what the hell kind of place is this!?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.440
The price to go in is $20

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.960
AND your girlfriend!

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.740
Also, you don't get to go in.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.580
Holli poorly lip-syncs as Sinatra Jr. is starting to look thankful nobody's ever gonna see this

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.360
While it looks like Frank has to go to the Real World to get Holli back

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.580
so, his kisses his girlfriend goodbye

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.920
...while thinking about his mother...?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.360
[screams]

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.900
THIIIIIIIINGS!!!!!

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.280
Holli goes to find the spike that was mentioned in the opening

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.160
thinking it could combine their two worlds together because...

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.400
THIIIIINGS!!

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.480
While Frank tries to figure out from Jack where she is.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.320
"I'm taking you and the bimbo back."

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.880
"What're you gonna do, shoot me?"

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.160
"Why don't you shoot me goddamnit!!"

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.660
Don't try to have character now,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.540
there's like 20 minutes left.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.780
Jack agrees to take Frank to Holli

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.940
while Holli is having some wacky comedic moments.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.480
"Miss..."

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.540
I see you've played idiot seesaw before.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.420
Sure enough, she comes across the scientist who invented the spike and crossed over

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.520
dressed as...

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.060
little Darkman...

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.840
and he tells her that the spike is at the top of the casino.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.780
where Frank is waiting for her.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.620
Frank: "Guess what?"

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.420
Frank: "You're through."

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.000
That was my attempt at humor.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.580
Hey, it's about as good as this.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.780
But as Holli starts changing into a doodle

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.340
she tries to use her ability to walk through the wall.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.280
Because...that's something they could do in Cool World?

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.460
I was hoping the sloppy editing that would jump cut

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.880
people out of rooms would work for me too.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.940
Holli knocks him off the building

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.880
But thankfully he seems to be a puppet...

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.220
(Pull the string!)

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.240
Nevertheless, he turns into a Splat Pitt.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.400
"Jack, this is your chance to make it right!"

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.720
"I wanna do something right..."

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.140
"He's fulfilling his destiny,

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.060
he's becoming a hero!"

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.040
What!?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.600
Oooh!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.920
Isn't this where you put your audio commentary in the movie?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.760
You better believe it, doll.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.680
Ralph: Ladies and gentleman,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.180
according to the new screenplay I was just handed before shooting this scene,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.900
this was all about Jack becoming a hero.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.280
Eh, I don't get it either, but

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.320
I made wizards.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.300
I'm not saying that to impress you,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.780
I'm saying that to make myself feel better.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.820
You may now return to this bullshit.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.980
She eventually finds the spike...

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.920
(I am She-Ra!)

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.720
And unleashed the Cool World on the Real World.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.400
[incoherent voices]

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.200
"Oh!"

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.380
Well, look at that.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.600
They went from Gabriel Byrne only having a few lines

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.780
to just tossing him out of the movie altogether.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.720
Yeah, now he's a super hero trying to stop Holli from destroying the world.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.580
It's not even him doing the voice!

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.980
"You fiends!"

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.720
"Trying to stop me!"

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.560
Half the time the mouths don't even move when they talk!

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.000
Holli: "Oh, please."

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.040
Holli: "Pencil dicks."

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.320
[screeching]

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.180
Well, this is a really nice Ren &amp; Stimpy cartoon.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.080
...Actually, it's not even that, but could we possibly return to the movie?

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.760
You know with conflict and such?

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.200
"Give me the spike, Jack."

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.680
"Okay, Honeypoo."

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.220
"Hey! Goody, goody, goody!"

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.160
"A trick!"

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.780
"I must do what is right and return the spike!"

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.480
That was your conflict, huh?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.420
That was your big climax of the movie?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.140
And let me guess,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.660
there's just a bunch of yelling and screaming to follow?

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.200
Yeah, okay.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.440
Ralph, I can't believe I'm asking this but,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.620
what was your original idea for this movie?

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.760
The script that Paramount bought at first?

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.860
Oh, it was about a guy who had sex with a cartoon character.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.060
Okay, so it was crap.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.740
Ralph: And then they gave birth to a psychopathic killer.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.640
Really?

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.740
See, it was supposed to be about the child!

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.860
Who grows up resenting his father because he abandoned him.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.640
So he goes into the real world being half man and half cartoon and tries to kill him.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.240
In the end, he discovers he's an abomination that can't live in either world.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.880
Wow...

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.320
I mean, it sounds crazy but..it also kind of sounds deep.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.500
Exactly!

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.380
I know my stuff is bonkers,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.760
but it comes from a place of real passion,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.840
before the s-s-s-studio gets in the way!

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.520
Even Kim Basinger was trying to change it!

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.860
Kim Basinger, really?

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:58.400
Yeah, she wanted it more family friendly so she could show it to the kids she visited in the hospital.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.580
I says, "Kim, that's a nice thought but this really isn't the sort of picture for that sort of thing.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.560
Might I recommend uh, Fritz the Cat?"

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.140
So, instead of an animated psychological hard 'R' horror film, we got...

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.640
"It's up to me to return the spike!"

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.320
The jacked up adventures of Banana Man?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.000
Yeah,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.640
Why do you think I "rigsed" it so that Holli Would

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.300
is the main villain destroying everything in the picture?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.100
That's actually clever. Was that intentional?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.720
I dunno.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.620
I mean...Yeah!

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.580
I dunno.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.200
I guess there's not really much else to talk about.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.840
The spike is returned and Franks partner takes his body back to his girlfriend

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.240
...in the most cautious way possible.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.400
"Oh, Frank, honey, no please!!"

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.980
"Oh, no, please!"

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.140
"Was she a doodle when she aced him?"

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.340
"When they get killed by a doodle, they become a doodle themselves!"

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.720
[scat singing]

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.820
"Oh my god!"

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.500
Ralph: This is the director again,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.020
I'm looking at the script here I've just received...

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.980
Ugh...yeah I'm just an errand boy.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.580
So, happily whatever after I guess!

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.120
As Frank and his girlfriend can now doodle the noodle

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.440
and Jack's personality I guess is erased from existence

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.340
as he stays the superhero pissing off Holli.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.480
Jack: "Oh, we're going to be deliriously happy, Honeypoo!"

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.880
Holli: "Pencil dick."

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.920
And that was...a thing.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.260
A very, very bad thing.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.060
Cool World has little to no focus,

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.280
and is amazingly sloppy in every category.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:40.140
Characters, story, technique, most of it either goes nowhere or falls awkwardly flat.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.260
But...

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.140
I will defend it a little bit.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.100
As easy as it is to pick on, there is some amazing stuff.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.960
The animation is phenomenal...

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.940
except when it's not.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.260
The backgrounds are spectacular...

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.360
except when they're not.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.560
This is arguably Ralph Bakshi's best looking film,

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.980
fill in the blank.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.400
I can't act like there's nothing here of value.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.180
Some of these visuals are jaw-droppingly inspired and it's not fair to just bunch them together

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.780
with everything else that doesn't work.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.060
So many of these images could be frozen and they'd be regarded as surreal masterworks.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.260
Even the animation has a wide range of styles,

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.580
Disney, Looney Tunes, action comics, underground comics, and that really should be admired.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.660
So, is it good? God no!

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.240
But there is good stuff in it to open up the imagination.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.840
And you know what? I'm thankful for that, Bakshi.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.220
I'm thankful for all your insanity, even when it doesn't work.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.280
Because when you think that much outside the box, even when it doesn't succeed,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.200
it can still inspire people.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.100
[crash]

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.080
Alright, you three, back to the institute with ya.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.720
Cram it, pig!

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.760
You'll never be able to stop us from filming our Bakshi crazy ideas!

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.160
Because we have puppets!

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.460
And big tittied cartoons!

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.400
And breakdancing college students!

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.820
What the holy hell?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.080
Wait, this isn't right!

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.280
Step aside, Critic.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.420
They're weird and stuff.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.360
I know, and it's not always good but...

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.960
It's their madness and nobody else's.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.940
Films like Cool World show what happens when an artist's vision is bought and destroyed,

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.800
instead of coming to a compromise.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.200
Bakshi's films don't always make sense,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:28.000
but they're so strange and so unfiltered that it's impossible for them not to expand the creative part of one's imagination.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.020
We need failures that take risks to expand the mind as opposed to a failure like Cool World

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.320
that's constantly limiting itself.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.260
Would Bakshi's original story have been better? Maybe.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.620
But it would be 100% his.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:46.600
Appealing to a world with few rules as opposed to this world with a ton of rules which don't make any sense.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.600
Call me crazy, but I think they should be allowed to show all their madness

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.780
and be as free as they want to be and none of you are here right now, are you?

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.140
God, I prattle on, so where'd you all go?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.700
I've lost them!

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.080
Up here you lazy asses!

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.240
Screw logic!

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.080
I'm going to use Julie Taymor and Spike Lee as wings

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.740
and soar to the cosmos!

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.660
To titties and beyond!

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.700
[angelic choir sings]

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.380
By god, that's the craziest stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.340
Yeah...

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.820
They inspired us all.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.080
I'm the Nostalgia Critic and never lose track of the right kind of madness.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.460
Ralph: This is really fucking amazing.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.600
Hey, Doug Walker here once again

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.900
doing the charity shout-out.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:19.420
And this week we're doing one that's an especially good one that's definitely relevant now.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.060
It's Save the Children.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.200
Save the Children invests in childhood everyday

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.660
in times of crisis and for our future.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.840
In the United States and around the world,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.400
they give children a healthy start,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.860
the opportunity to learn,

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.940
and protection from harm.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.340
By transforming children's lives now,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.680
they change the course of their future and ours.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.720
They're committed to conducting programs and operations in a manner

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.980
that keeps children safe and protects them from danger.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.940
Insisting on one hundred percent accountability for safeguarding the children

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.020
they are privileged enough to serve.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.700
All representatives including employees, board members, partners and volunteers

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.500
conduct themselves according to this commitment

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.820
with clear procedures to prevent, report and respond to any risks to children.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.580
No matter the challenge, even through the devastation of Syria,

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.980
they always put children first in everything they do.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.360
If you go to their website or their Youtube page,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.620
you can hear all the stories about the children they saved.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.280
And I will warn you, a lot of them are very tough to watch.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.520
They're very difficult to get through, but at the same time,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.140
it shows how important your donation is.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.080
Anything you can give is being used to save these lives

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:37.260
and under the worst circumstances, you can imagine, they try to fight through and prevail.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.460
There are countless stories of how many children they've helped and saved

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.020
and you can be a part of it.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.240
Definitely check them out and see how you can help in such a troubling time.
