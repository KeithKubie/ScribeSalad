00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.667
Narrator: PREPARING RICE
IN AN ELECTRIC COOKER

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:10.868
IS EASIER THAN COOKING RICE
ON THE STOVE.

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:13.767
YOU THROW IN THE RICE AND WATER,
PRESS A BUTTON,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.234
AND WALK AWAY UNTIL IT'S READY.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:20.334
THIS MACHINE IS DESIGNED
TO STEAM RICE TO PERFECTION.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.300
RICE COOKERS USE INDIRECT HEAT

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.167
TO CIRCULATE STEAM
AROUND RICE AND WATER,

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:32.934
FROM THE OUTER POT
TO AN INNER POT.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:38.100
THIS PROCESS COOKS THE RICE
EVENLY IN HALF AN HOUR.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.067
TO CAST THE OUTER COOKING POT,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:43.400
ALUMINUM INGOTS
ARE MELTED IN A FURNACE.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
A ROBOTIC ARM SCOOPS UP

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
THE REQUIRED AMOUNT
OF MOLTEN ALUMINUM

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
WITH A LADLE...

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.100
...THEN POURS IT
INTO THE TOP OF THE MOLD.

00:00:56.868 --> 00:01:01.868
IT TAKES THE METAL FOUR MINUTES
TO COOL AND SOLIDIFY.

00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:05.267
THEN TECHNICIANS EXTRACT
THE POT FROM THE MOLD.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.667
TO REFINE ITS FORM,

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.667
THE POT IS MOUNTED
ON A COMPUTER-GUIDED LATHE.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.667
AS IT SPINS,

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.901
SEVERAL MACHINES CONTOUR
THE POT'S OUTSIDE SURFACE

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.934
TO ITS FINAL SHAPE.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:30.300
♪♪

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.100
NEXT, THE POT IS LOADED ONTO
AN AUTOMATED DRILLING MACHINE.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.534
THE MACHINE PUNCTURES 18 HOLES
THROUGH THE BOTTOM.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.300
THE RICE COOKER'S
HEATING COMPONENTS

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.434
AND ITS PAINTED STEEL SHELL

00:01:47.434 --> 00:01:50.734
ARE ATTACHED TO THE OUTER POT
THROUGH THESE HOLES.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:58.501
THEN THE POT IS RETURNED
TO THE COMPUTER-GUIDED LATHE.

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.934
A TOOL POLISHES THE INTERIOR

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.701
UNTIL THE ALUMINUM
IS SMOOTH AND BRIGHT.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.934
A DISK OF STAINLESS STEEL
IS PLACED IN A PRESS.

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:14.934
THE PRESS MOLDS THE STEEL
INTO THE INNER COOKING POT.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:19.100
THE NEXT PRESS TRIMS OFF
ANY EXCESS METAL AROUND THE TOP,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.467
LEAVING A CLEAN AND EVEN EDGE.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.267
ANOTHER MACHINE CURLS THAT EDGE
TO FORM A ROUNDED LIP.

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.868
THE LIP STRENGTHENS THE POT
AND PROVIDES A PLACE TO GRIP

00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:38.901
WHEN THE INNER POT
IS PLACED INTO THE OUTER POT.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:43.400
ONCE POLISHED, THE POT
IS PLACED IN ANOTHER PRESS.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.767
THIS PRESS STAMPS
WATER-LEVEL LINES ON THE SIDE

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.834
AND A TRENCH ON THE BOTTOM.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:53.767
THE TRENCH HELPS THE WATER
EVAPORATE QUICKLY.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:58.267
NEXT, AN AUTOMATED BOOTH PAINTS
THE RICE COOKER'S STEEL SHELLS.

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:00.868
THE SHELLS ARE BAKED IN AN OVEN
FOR 15 MINUTES

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:03.067
AT 390 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:05.767
SO THAT THE PAINT CAN SET.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.000
WITH A PAD PRINTER,
THE COMPANY LOGO

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.300
IS APPLIED TO THE SHELL.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.734
TECHNICIANS INSTALL
PART OF THE SWITCH MECHANISM

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.968
TO THE SHELL.

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:18.968
ANOTHER TECHNICIAN PLACES
THE HEATING ELEMENT IN A SLOT

00:03:18.968 --> 00:03:20.701
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OUTER POT,

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.334
SECURING IT WITH THREE CLIPS.

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:25.400
THEY INSTALL
TWO CONNECTION PLATES

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.400
USED TO ATTACH
THE STEEL SHELL --

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.267
A PORCELAIN PLATE
AND A MAGNETIC CORE.

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.667
THE CORE CONTROLS
THE ON/OFF SWITCH

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.267
BASED ON THE TEMPERATURE
INSIDE THE COOKER.

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:46.100
♪♪

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.467
THE TECHNICIAN CONNECTS
THE POWER CORD

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:51.868
AND ATTACHES
THE THERMAL-INSULATION SHEET,

00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:53.334
WHICH ALLOWS THE COOKED RICE

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:58.934
TO MAINTAIN A TEMPERATURE
OF 158 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.734
THIS PART
OF THE SWITCH MECHANISM

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.367
HOVERS OVER THE MAGNETIC CORE.

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:07.234
WHEN THE COOKING TEMPERATURE
HITS 158 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT,

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:10.701
THE CORE ACTIVATES THE SWITCH
TO TURN OFF THE HEATING ELEMENT

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:14.501
AND START UP
THE THERMAL-INSULATION SHEET.

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.467
AFTER MORE SWITCH WIRING,
TECHNICIANS INSTALL THE FUSE,

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.400
WHICH PREVENTS THE COOKER
FROM OVERHEATING.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.968
ONE END IS CONNECTED
TO THE HEATING ELEMENT,

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:28.234
THE OTHER END TO THE POWER CORD
BY THE PORCELAIN PLATE.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.534
THE PAINTED STEEL SHELL

00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:32.234
IS ATTACHED
TO THE BASE OF THE OUTER POT.

00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:34.567
ONCE ATTACHED,
EACH CONNECTION PLATE

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.434
IS SECURED WITH SCREWS,

00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:39.400
THEN HANDLES ARE INSTALLED.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.334
FINALLY, EVERY RICE COOKER
UNDERGOES A TEMPERATURE TEST.

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:45.133
AFTER STARTING THE MACHINE,

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.234
THE COOKING TEMPERATURE
IS MEASURED WITH A THERMOMETER.

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:51.834
ONCE APPROVED, THE COOKER
IS PACKAGED WITH A COVER

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:55.400
AND PERFORATED INSERT
FOR STEAMING OTHER FOODS.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.434
TO USE THE COOKER, YOU PUT RICE
AND WATER IN THE INNER POT

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:01.567
AND WATER IN THE OUTER POT.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.934
IN UNDER AN HOUR,
THE HEATING ELEMENT TURNS OFF,

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:09.467
AND THE INSULATION SHEET
KICKS IN TO KEEP YOUR RICE WARM.
