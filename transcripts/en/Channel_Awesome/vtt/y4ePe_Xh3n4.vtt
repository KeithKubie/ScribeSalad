00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.540
[NOSTALGIA CRITIC]: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.220
Especially when you shouldn't have to.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.640
By God, is today's movie bad! It is one of the worst Christmas flicks you could possibly see!

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.040
It's a wonderful little piece-of-shit bomb called "Christmas with the Kranks"!

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.180
This is based on the John Grisham novel.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200
Yes, that John Grisham.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700
He was so good at making white people afraid of the justice system...

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.200
that I guess he decided to make white people afraid of Christmas, too.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.380
He succeeded, but in a way he probably didn't intend.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
It's mind-blowing how little this movie tries, how tired the writing is...

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.300
how it doesn't attempt in any way to give us anything new.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.160
The jokes are years old, the acting is like something out of the 50's, its message is beyond half-assed and lazy...

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.700
It's just freaking horrendous.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.020
It's so bad, I wish I could give this review as little effort as possible.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.360
[SANTA CHRIST]: Wish! Did someone said, "wish"?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.280
[NC]: No, no no. I', not doing that, Santa Christ.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.120
No, I'm not dignifying this review with any kind of effort whatsoever.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.880
[ELF TAMARA]: Well, we put this costume on for no reason.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.060
[ELF MALCOLM]: Care for a little Yuletide hamper?
[ELF TAMARA]: You know it

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.860
[SANTA CHRIST]: Wait, discip-elves! Get back here, you pointy-eared lushes!

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.240
Critic, what's going on?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.260
[NC]: This movie tries so little to be anything interesting or good, I want to devote as little effort as possible to it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.980
Like the good old days, you know? Before I had a budget or a studio.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.540
Just talk in front of the camera. I didn't have to try as hard.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.260
Things were easier and better then.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.020
[SC]: Well, the segue you were going to put effort into would've made that happen?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.920
But, since you're not interested...

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.000
[NC]: No! No no, no! I want to give this move the same shit-poor delivery it gave me!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.040
[SC]: Very well then! By the discontinuous powers that somehow killed me in the Cinema Snobs crossover, yet brought me back...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.600
[NC]: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.740
[SC]: Dick. I send you to the past!

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740
[NC]: Oh, this is just my folks' place.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.640
[SC]: Not just your folks' place.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.340
Your folks' place in 2007.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.100
AD.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.160
[NC]: You mean I can see...

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.620
It's young me!

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.080
[PAST NOSTALGIA CRITIC]: Holy shit, what's going on here?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.660
[NC]: Hey, you wanna travel to the future for a day?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.580
[PAST NC]: Really? I get to see all the new ideas Hollywood comes up with?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.740
[NC]: That's right, all three of'em.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.820
[PAST NC]: I'm in!

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.840
[SC]: Come with me, you slightly overweight scamp.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.240
[NC]: Hello, shitty camera. Hello, shitty lights.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.840
Hello, shitty movie.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.160
This is the cheapest possible review I can give to you.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.160
No budget, no cutaways. Just one asshole piece of shit talking to another asshole piece of shit.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.380
This is "Christmas with the Kranks".

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.940
The movie opens with a convention center doubling as an airport...

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.500
where two parents, played by Jamie Lee Curtis and Tim Allen...

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.360
are saying goodbye to their daughter, who's just off to join the Peace Corps.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.280
As we also say goodbye to the only bit of human decency this film will offer us.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.040
[NORA]: I just need a couple things from Chip's.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.720
[NC]: They stop by the store to pick up some items.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.740
Or rather, Curtis has her husband go in to pick up some items.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.140
[LUTHER]: I didn't bring the umbrella.
[NORA]: I need that stuff from Chip's.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.760
[LUTHER]: I didn't bring the umbrella.
[NORA]: Well, I still need it.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.800
[NC]: Eh, he should've done Santa Clause 4.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.840
But he doesn't get the right stuff, so she sends him in again until he gets it right.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.400
[NORA]: Did you talk to Rex, the butcher?
[LUTHER]: I didn't think of asking the butcher where the chocolate was.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.000
But I will.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.720
[NC]: Our main characters, everybody! The Kardashians too down-to-earth for ya?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.960
Well, sit back and enjoy these charming A-holes.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.080
[SANTA]: I really think you need an umbrella!

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.860
[LUTHER]: You know why I don't need your stupid umbrella...

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.140
[NC]: You know, there's slapstick, and then there's crapstick.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.340
I much rather eat craptstick, rather than watch any of this.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.780
Oh right, they don't have any visuals.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.020
Fed up, he goes to the office to figure out how much they spent on Christmas each year.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.660
And just to give you an idea of what kind of movie we're in for...

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.540
this is the kind of music they play throughout the entire thing.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.660
Yep. That "Einstein for babies" score accompanies the whole film.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.480
It's like having this music throughout the entire review.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.000
♫ I'm reviewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing... ♫

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.540
♫ -viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing-viewing! ♫

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.660
Seeing how much they spend every year,  Allen has an idea.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.580
[LUTHER]: I'll be right back.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.000
[NORA] Make sure you shut the courtains!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.220
[NC]: So, she mistakes "I'll be right back" for "I want sex on the table".

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.740
A common error.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.760
As he explains that they should cancel their Christmas party and go on a cruise instead.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.540
[LUTHER]: The most luxuriant ship in their fleet. Cayman islands.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.080
Snorkeling!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.380
[NC]: Was that snorkeling or chloroforming?

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.120
Great, a heavy dose of that would've be welcomed at the time!

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.380
[NORA]: Well, can we still give our charitable donations to the children's hospital, and of course, the church?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.680
[LUTHER]: No, this is a total boycott, honey.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.660
[NORA]: It's $600.
[LUTHER]: It's a total boycott.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.140
[NC]: Yes, it's part of a complete asshole package. Look, there's even a part where we can sign up for ISIS.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.680
Don't you just sympathize with those people?

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.700
She horribly agrees, as she forgot we have to put up with them throughout the entire picture...

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.360
as Allen writes a pointless letter, saying he's not participating Christmas, to his coworkers.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.640
He says he's not angry or bitter, yet he so angrily and bitterly hands the letters out.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.320
[LUTHER]: I'm not angry, and I will not yell "humbug".

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.320
[NC]: No, really, I'm not angry! Not even the slightest! Say, what's that?

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.280
Curtis also lets the aunt from "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" know, and immediately, anger starts to spread.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.700
[NORA]: We're not going to do Christmas this year.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.460
[MERRY]: How do you simply not "do" Christmas?

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.460
[AUBIE]: She's not ordering Christmas cards, neither.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.160
[NC]: Don't you know? Christmas is about not embracing variety, and shaming those who do!

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.200
[NORA]: We're taking a break! One year off, no Christmas whatsoever.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.880
[NC]: I told you this would happen if we let refugees in!

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.660
Their block is not especially happy, either.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.740
[LUTHER]: We're not buying a Christmas tree this year.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.200
[RANDY]: Sorry we had to go up on the price.
[MR. SCANLON]: We're making less per tree than last year.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.700
[LUTHER]: It's not about the money.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.800
[NC]: Even though you clearly said it is about the money.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.240
[BIFF]: Hello! Hello! Anybody home?
[NC]: What the hell!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.560
[NC]: Oh yeah, yeah, I forgot. I cut to random film clips a lot more in the past.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.900
[VADER]: Noooo!

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.760
[NC]: Yeah, got it.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.900
[ASH]: Groovy.
[NC]: I'm good!

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.640
[VENKMAN]: He slimed me.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.360
[NC]: Knock it off!

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.200
OK, maybe some of the traditions of the past are a little much, but you know what?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.360
It's still great to be back in the good old days!

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.280
[MOM]: Son, when are you going to stop swearing?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.820
[NC]: Shut up, mom! People are going to find this charming!

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.040
The Boy Scouts go and tell the head of the block, played by Dan Aykroyd...

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.000
about the Kranks abandoning Christmas.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.360
[VIC]: Becker is at it again.
[LUTHER]: Evening, Vic.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.120
[NC]: Enjoying the randomly placed snow puddles the sun didn't melt for some reason?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.480
[VIC]: But I gotta tell you, a lot of the neighbors are pretty upset.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.560
[LUTHER]: You trying to make me feel guilty. Get off with it.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.100
[NC]: You're just upset because my Home Improvement bumped and saved Soul Man.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.020
[VIC]: Perfect time to put up Frosty.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.506
[NC]: But of course, it
doesn't stop there...

00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.560
as every house in the block apparently
hangs some giant Frosty decoration.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.260
Oh, come on. You know, what never has and never will be a thing.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.060
And the Kranks refuse to hang theirs, spreading more misery to the easily offendable.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.540
[WALT]: Still working for The Man, huh? I thought they would've made you a partner by now.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.540
[LUTHER]: I got to get to work.
[WALT]: Have a good one!

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.800
Old man.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.700
[NC]: Wow. That's some prime-meat asshole right there.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.260
"Can I have yesterday's asshole?" "No, no, you deserve the 'crème de la crème' asshole".

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.380
Straight from the witch's vagina.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.460
[LUTHER]: Bah, humbug.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.280
[SECRETARY]: Good morning, Mr Scrooge.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.620
[DOX]: Walmart called. They said I had to buy my own cheap perfume, since Santa Claus isn't coming this year.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.060
[NC]: Well, at least our Starbucks cups are still celebrating Christma--

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.860
Oh my God! You will face the wrath of my first-world problem!

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.840
Get a load of this. The neighbors actually line up outside their house, demanding Frosty.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.480
Do any of these people work?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.400
[VIC]: We're here for Frosty!

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.660
[NORA]: Oh, they're gonna come back!

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.720
[NC]: Oh, come on, lady. Olive Oil wouldn't overreact this much.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.300
[NORA]: They want Frosty.
[LUTHER]: Well, they can't have him.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.780
[NORA]: They won't go away.
[LUTHER]: Well, don't give them Frosty!

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.320
[NC]: Not giving into a demand that would take seconds of no effort...

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.920
is working out great  in this stress-free Christmas that we apparently wanted.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.220
[NORA]: I am the one trapped here! I am the one dealing with this!

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.860
[NC]: Christ, she would react less to Mike Myers approaching the house!

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.420
I said, she'd react less to--Oh that's right, I don't have any actors.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.400
I will move the camera... No, no! I'm keeping it still. Simple old days

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.300
[IMPERSONATING LAURIE]: Mike Myers, you may be a serial killer, but these people want me to hang a snowman.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.680
They're much more dangerous

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.960
[IMPERSONATING MYERS]: If only I could get you this afraid of me.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.700
[LAURIE]: Sorry, Mike Myers! It's Christmas Town!

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.320
[NC]: You know, the past is a lot more awkward than I remember it.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:50.300
She tries driving away, but the neighbors, who have clearly sacrificed the art of having a social life, chase her down.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.360
[VIC]: Give us Frosty! Please! It's all we--

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.860
[NC]: You know, "crapstick" is too good a word for this. How about something more fitting, like...

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440
"slapshit".

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.320
Enjoy your slapshit, everybody. Which is, again, something I'd much rather do, than watch any of this!

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.000
So, to feel better, they go to get a tan from this sexy Oompa-Loompa.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.860
Which, of course, leads to even more confusing comedy.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.020
[MAN]: Excuse me!

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.080
[NC]: "Oh, sorry. I'm an unexplained weird-voiced pervert you'll never see again!"

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.280
Comic gold...?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.100
Apparently, they thought that joke would work so well, that they actually do it again.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.400
Only this time, with a perverted priest.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.560
[PRIEST]: It's a mall, Nora. I'm Christmas shopping.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.120
[NORA]: Of course you are. Jeez, lady, make up your mind!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.820
[NC]: Noticed that awkward silence that's accompanying this entire scene?

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.020
That's because you're laughing so hard at this ingenuous set-up...

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.840
that they're actually allowing you to laugh at it!

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.400
It's all considered that way!

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.600
[PRIEST]: Luther?
[LUTHER]: Father Zabriskie! Umm...

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.920
Hey!

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.100
[NC]: Yes, because tanning is not God's way!

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.620
Or the way of all these onlookers, who clearly have never left their homes...

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.700
and have no idea what's supposed to be inappropriate in the real world.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.800
Hell, it even makes the front-page of the news! I am not shitting you.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.600
The front-page news! What the hell is going on here?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.260
[NORA]: "They're preparing for cruise, according to unnamed sources".

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.420
[NC]: OK, I haven't been to Oak Park or Riverside recently, as they're not that far away from me.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.200
But, this counts as front-page news to them? Seriously?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.660
"Stop the presses, everybody! A rock! Oh my God! This is the biggest story ever since 'Squirrel'!"

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.260
"We're on bigger-than-squirrel lockdown, everybody!
We have to address the elephant in the room."

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.320
DAAH!

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.820
That's right. I forgot about those memes I always tried to force.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.720
[BISON]: Of course!

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.320
OK, did that connect to anything...?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.600
Yes, it is! But--

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.660
Just like that! But--

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.980
[CHARLIE]: I was frozen to-!

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.800
[NC]: None of this has to do with what I am reviewing--

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.800
Stop it! Stop! Stop!

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.600
[NICK]: That's a lot of fish.
[CORNELIUS]: Rheumatism!

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.580
[DR SMITH]: Spiders!

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.500
[NC]: Christ! I thought all these repetitive traditions would be great, but I'm sorry!

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.820
I gotta return to effort!

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.700
[SC]: What! You can't go back yet!

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.100
[NC]: Why not?
[SC]: Because you're supposed to learn your lesson by the end of the video.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.700
We're not even half-way through! Look at the little red border.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.980
[NC]: I don't care!  I need to go back! Right now!

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.920
[SC]: Fine, but we're violating the screenwriting lessons of Chris Columbus.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.860
[MOM]: Let's never have him in the house again.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.540
[DAD]: Agreed.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.520
[NC]: You, out.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.380
[PAST NC]: What have you done!
[NC]: What?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.540
[PAST NC]: Your reviews. They have more variety, actors and visuals.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.420
[NC]: Well, yeah. You've got to evolve, in order to stay relevant.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.740
[PAST NC]: I have seen reviews where there wasn't even one white wall.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.820
That's your identity! And some of these don't even have clips from the movie!

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.140
[NC]: Yeah, it's a different kind of reviewing, to get a lot of hits.
[PAST NC]: That's not traditional.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.760
How the hell can you do a review with no clips?

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.300
[NC]: Similar to how other critics did it for hundreds of years?

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.240
[PAST NC]: No. It's not a review. It's just sketches. You're not saying anything about the movie at all.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.220
[WINIFRED]: ♫ Our writing is atrocious and makes no goddamn sense ♫

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.040
♫ But you'll laugh because we always use synchronized movements ♫

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.020
[NC]: Yeah, no commentary in the slightest.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.400
[PAST NC]]: Who knows what this might lead to? Crossovers, anniversary specials. A pointless feud with an angry gamer!

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.900
And all of them will bomb!

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.340
[NC]: OK, I don't have time for this.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.060
Go back to saying "Bat-Credit Card" twenty times!

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.120
[PAST NC]: No, I am not done here yet!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.680
[SC]: Well, I tried.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.520
[NC]: So. In an effort to make you as uncomfortable as possible, this scene happens.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.460
[CANDI]: It's Bev Scheel. She went for a check-up yesterday.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.920
The cancer's back for the third time.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.860
[NC]: Whoa.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.220
[CANDI]: This could be her last Christmas.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.620
[NC]: Yikes!

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.700
Well, OK. I guess we have to find the time to show how this is affecting everybody...

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.060
Or we can just return to the goofy music and silly shenanigans!

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.560
[WALT]: Isn't it old Scrooge himself.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.980
[NC]: I'm not even kidding. It cuts directly to that, after literally 20 seconds.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.240
Twenty seconds of suddenly talking about cancer!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.280
Jesus Christ, the bedside manner of this movie is on par with a Canadian PSA!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.980
[WOMAN]: It's a rape whistle.
[NC]: Merry Christmas!

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.940
They even have the balls to cut to the husband of the cancer patient being an asshole again.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.020
What is this movie trying to do?

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.600
[WALT]: I try to be, old man.
[LUTHER]: Stop that.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.960
[WALT]: Stop what?
[LUTHER]: Stop calling me "old man"!

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.640
You're like 10 years older than me!

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.820
[WALT]: Am I?
[LUTHER]: Yeah!

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.820
[WALT]: Well, prove it!

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.320
[NORA]: Walt! I just heard about Bev. I am so sorry.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:11.520
[NC]: You know, if we could bottle this movie and drop it on our enemies, nobody would ever touch us.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.180
So, later on on the most evenly lit block in town, a bunch of carolers come to sing for the holidays.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.940
This causes the Kranks to duck and cover for some reason.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.900
[CAROLERS SINGING]

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.060
[NC]: Who the hell does this?!

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.480
I mean, I'm not a fan of something like country music.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.600
But that doesn't mean I'm going to act anything like this if someone played it!

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.880
Tamara! Stop playing that music!

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.840
[TAMARA]: Why?
[NC]: Just do it!

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.480
Don't ever force me to have those incredibly normal spasms again!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.020
[TAMARA]: Freak.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.360
[CAROLERS STILL SINGING]

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.760
[NC]: OK, can we never cut back to Aykroyd singing again?

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.580
I thought that was a legal agreement he would never do that again, after "Blues Brothers 2000".

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.520
Apparently, their Christmas spirit is so down, that even their statue of Frosty turns evil.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.640
I can't make that shit up.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.520
[NEIGHBORS]: Free Frosty! Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.680
[NC]: And that's not just the lighting. They had to literally sculpt that to give it an evil brow.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.180
The symbolism is amazing. Why don't you just have an alien pop up in "Gravity", and say...

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.360
[ALIEN]: "She's a fetus. It's a metaphor for rebirth!"

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.560
[NC]: This leads to the movie turning into "Home Alone" for absolutely no reason.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.780
Yeah, take that, mailman who has no interest in my actions!

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.320
Look out! It's clearly not cold enough outside for the water to freeze!

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.460
I'm just going to  assume that was thrown in there for the poster.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.120
Is it on there? Yeah. Animal cruelty is fine, as long as it's used for promotional purposes.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.640
And hey, since it's the early 2000's, why not a needless Botox joke?

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.200
[LUTHER]: I had a Botox injection today.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.020
[NC]: Because Lord knows, this won't be everywhere!

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.360
[LUTHER]: I got a Botox...

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.600
[FIONA]: It's the Botox...

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.500
I just swung by a little Botox party

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.640
[ADON]: Did you bring any Botox?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640
[DANNY]: I didn't bring the Botox.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.840
[DR COX] Did you Botox your face
 into an expressionless mask?

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.900
[NC]: Malcolm!

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.780
It's time we lay that joke to rest.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.880
No, don't do it.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.500
After his face heals literally the next day, hey, it heals faster than the other scars this movie leaves...

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.240
people call their house, demanding that they free Frosty.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.800
They even start standing outside all day.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.320
[KIDS]: Free Frosty! Free Frosty! Free Frosty!

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.880
[NC MOCKING KID]: Hey Bobby, you want to wast hours of our childhood chanting outside a house...

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.100
about how someone should hang up a piece of plastic?

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.360
[NC MOCKING ANOTHER KID]: Hey, what grown boy hasn't?

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.180
[NC]: But suddenly they get news that not only is their daughter coming home for Christmas that night...

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.780
but she just met someone, and is getting married.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.360
Wow, that seems really fast and out of nowhere.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.840
We should obviously sit down and talk about her future--

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.680
[NORA]: We're having a party.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.500
[NC]: Or throw a Christmas party. That's obviously much more important here.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.340
[LUTHER]: What about our trip?
[NORA]: This was all your stupid idea.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.180
[LUTHER]: Five minutes ago I was a genius.
[NORA]: Yeah, well, now you're an idiot.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.240
[NC]: Hey, that's what every fan said about John Grisham after watching this movie.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.060
[LUTHER]: Five minutes ago I was a genius.
[NORA]: Yeah, well, now you're an idiot.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.940
[NC]: This moment is apparently so wonderful, that Frosty goes back to smiling again.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.620
I... is that snowman possessed?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.980
Should we make the next one out of holy water?

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.180
So, the always loving Boy Scouts rake up the price for their shittiest tree.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.780
Kind of surprised they allowed their name to be attached to this, actually.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.280
So, Allen asks his neighbor if he can borrow his.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.580
Christ, that's not a tree. That's a stoner's breakfast!

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.660
But that's OK. He uses one of the kids still chanting outside his house to help him out.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.660
[KIDS]: Free Frost! Free Frosty!

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.280
[NC]: OK, seriously, who would waste so much time on something so pathetic?!

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.080
[MALCOLM]: Uh, Critic?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.140
[PNC]: Free Critic! Free Critic! Free Critic!

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.640
[NC]: In never thought I'd say this, but you have my permission to beat the shit out of me.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.680
[PAST NC]: Free Critic!

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.320
Free Critic! Free Critic! Wait, wait wait wait!

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.060
He barely had you in this episode, didn't he?

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.240
[TAMARA]: That's true.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.440
[PAST NC]: What if I told you, I could get you an even more important role?

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.180
[NC]: So, Curtis goes to pick up the last hickory honey ham in the store.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.680
But another woman has her sights on it.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.180
[ Strangely jazzy rendition of "Trepak"
from the Nutcracker. ]

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:46.160
OK, can we agree that any movie with comedic Nutcracker music should be dead to the world?

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.760
[WOMAN]: Happy Holidays.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.340
[NC]: You know, I feel like "slapshit" is too good a word for this now.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.060
How about... "Shit-shit"? That's...

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.000
You just watch the movie and say "shit-shit".

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.040
Can you think of any other perfect word for this? A little kid can look at this and be like...

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.720
[BABY]: Shit-shit!
[NC]: Yes, yes. Very good, Billy. Shit-shit indeed.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.800
[BABY]: Its comedic foundations are seriously lacking.
[NC]: Yeah, OK, don't oversell it.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.320
But she comes across with what Martin Short would look like two years from now...

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.540
who somehow gets invited to the party.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.560
[MARTY]: Thank you.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.240
[NORA]: Who are you?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.060
[NC]: Meanwhile, Allen tries to put Frosty up on the roof.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.820
[VIC]: Hey kids!

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.040
Guys!

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.860
Mr Krank is putting up his Frosty!

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:35.100
[NC]: To hell with these boring video games. We can watch the wonder of a man slowly plugging in a light!

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.740
OK!

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.700
Is that thing made out of Satan's saliva?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.260
[NC AS SNOWMAN]: Do you wanna kill Tim Allen?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.960
[NC]: But emergency vehicles come, pointlessly parking on the lawn...

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.600
and cutting him down in a way that injures him even more.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.400
Pffft. Firefighters. Bunch of hacks, right?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.360
So, they finally let everybody know that they're celebrating Christmas again...

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.360
and they need their help to get ready.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.740
[VIC]: Drop what you're doing and pitch in.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.420
[MAN 1]: Why should we do this for him?

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.260
[MAN 2]: Yeah, he's a jerk!

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.840
[VIC]: Regardless of how you feel about Luther, I know a lot of you have mixed feeling about him now.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.900
[VIC]: But we're a community.
[NC AS VIC]: A dangerously OCD community, with issues we'll address another time.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.820
[VIC]: People in a community stick together.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:35.480
Even if one of them has been behaving for most of the holiday season like a spoiled selfish little baby.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.720
[NC]: Unlike us! Bottom line: peer pressure always works.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.320
If someone doesn't do what you want, harass them until they do it. Christmas!

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.900
So, as everyone tries to prepare for the party, a couple of cops, who should be on duty, pick their daughter up.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.480
All while partaking in what I can only call "seizure-inducing editing".

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.540
[SPIKE]: Officer Fromheyer here. Yo read me?

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.420
[NC]: Wow, if that doesn't give you a medical condition, I don't know what will.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.140
In fact, is it me, or is it repeating?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.880
Boy, if that really was repeating,  that could really mess up your mind a little bit.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.660
Maybe even causing you to... pass out...

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.660
[PAST NC]: Excellent! Now the Nostalgia Critic will be like the old days!

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.680
Nothing but clips! Memes! And if there is time, an actual analysis of the movie!

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.680
[MALCOLM]: You'll give us a more important role, right?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.180
[PAST NC]: Of course...

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.380
[NC]: Why is it, whenever I wake up, I always have a 50/50 chance to be held against my will?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.180
OK, well, special closet storage edition!

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:13.360
We see one plug somehow takes out an entire block, but it's turn right back on again.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.940
I'll alert you if this ever becomes relevant.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:21.080
As the cops are told to stall dropping off Blaire, because they're not ready for the party...

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.100
so they fake a break-in going on again.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.240
Only to discover there really is a break-in going on.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.300
What are the goddamned chances?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.840
[OFFICER SALINO]: There he is. Police!
[BURGLAR]: Eat this!

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.240
[NC AS BURGLAR]: I was talking to that ladybug on the ground, as I clearly didn't throw that anywhere near you!

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.820
They eventually catch and arrest him. Yeah, guessing that was a fun ride home.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.160
As per obvious police protocol, they don''t take him to the police station...

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.920
drive him instead to a suburban home, abandon him and go inside to enjoy the party...

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.660
leaving him all alone in the car with the window open!

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.540
Christ, is there a speed limit for how much stupid this move is doing?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.560
And get this: purposefully overlooked "Malcolm in the Middle" joke comes up to the criminal...

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.740
and actually falls for the lie he's telling him.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.720
[BURGLAR]: I'm starving out here. I haven't eaten in seven days.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.860
[SPIKE]: Seven days?!
[BURGLAR]: Yeah.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.040
Any scraps I get, I give it to the kids.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.760
[NC]: You look about the age of... idiot. You believe anything I say, right?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.900
[SPIKE]: No funny business, right?
[BURGLAR]: Right.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.060
[SPIKE]: Swear?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.920
[BURGLAR]: On my kids' lives.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:26.120
[NC]: I mean, come on! If you can't trust a guy in the back of a police car, who can you trust?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.600
Thankfully, this doesn't interrupt the toast that our family is making.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.040
[NORA]: I-I just wanted to say, thank you.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.480
You really have shown us the true meaning of community.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.920
[NC]: Through your constant harassment,  you came through after we gave exactly what you wanted.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.660
Cheers, assholes!

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.980
But Allen is mad, because he didn't get to go on his trip.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.800
And also because this movie clearly doesn't know how to stop.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.760
Why is this still going?!

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.160
[NORA]: Everyone out there sacrificed their Christmas Eve to help us.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.400
I thought maybe, that might affect you.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.600
Maybe? Have you started thinking about putting others first, instead of yourself?

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.300
[NC]: Why can't you join the rest of the neighborhood, in their one selfish need?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.640
But Allen gets the idea to go to the neighbor, whose wife has cancer.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.360
[LUTHER]: How's Bev?
[WALT]: Oh, she's having a good day, yeah. Thanks, so...

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.380
We started over to see Blair,  but you know, snow started...

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.660
[NC]: Yes, and it was a whole two more feet, so...

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.760
Seeing how Allen and Curtis aren't using their tickets anymore, they decided to give it to the couple...

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.100
allowing them go go on the trip instead of them.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.660
[LUTHER] This is a sincere, heartfelt Christmas offering.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.700
To two very selfless people.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.820
[NC]: Hmm, yeah. Should we look at those "selfless" moments again?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.140
[WALT]: Think you can run away from Christmas, huh?

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.580
He's kind of weird. Isn't it old Scrooge again.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.680
Thought they would've made you a partner by now.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.140
What a jerk!

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.560
[NC]: Real saint!

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.620
[LUTHER]: I got airline tickets, I got cruise passes, I got a brochure...

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.400
[NC]: Half of those you can't transfer over as everybody knows. But hey, is the last-minute thought that counts.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.200
[BEV]: But what about the cat?

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.580
[LUTHER]: I'll take the cat.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.840
[WALT]: Are you sure?

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.440
[NC]: Yes, because after stepping on it, hissing at it and freezing it nearly to death...

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.380
I totally trust you to look after his well-being!

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.360
By God! Remember the days when scenes had one or two dumb moments in it?

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.420
This has got to be a Guiness record!

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.780
But even still it's not over! As the burglar decides to rob the Kranks' house.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.820
As opposed to literally any other empty house on the block!

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.660
No wonder you ever freaking got caught.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.740
And we finally find out who that guy was who Curtis invited to the party.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.920
[SANTA]: I told you you could use an umbrella.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.600
[LUTHER]: Wait a minute...

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.960
You're the guy who was selling umbrellas in the rain?
[SANTA]: It's a living.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.400
Merry Christmas!

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.440
[NC]: What a twist!

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.460
An incredibly weak, tying in to absolutely nothing important, twist!

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.980
And here it finally ends, thank God!

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.100
I can't imagine, in the last few seconds, they possibly make this any dumber...

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.860
OK, I can't imagine it possibly getting any dumber that in the last part...

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.880
[SANTA]: Merry Christmas!

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.480
[NC]: Merry Christmas to all! And I spiked all your eggnog!

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.340
What the hell was that?!

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.060
He was Santa... who dresses as Santa, because he doesn't look like Santa.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.280
And flies a Volkswagen... after selling umbrellas...

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.780
For money...

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.720
Santa sells umbrellas for money!

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.720
But he has reindeer! We at least got that part eight about him.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.960
You know, seeing how we pretty much got every other conceivable thing about him wrong.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.660
But hey, at least Christmas with the Kranks set us straight!

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:57.320
Proving once again that they have an unbelievable understanding of everything Christmas!

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.780
It's so stupid, it's so stupid, it's so stupid, it's so stupid!

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.760
I've got to  have this exploding problem looked at.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.960
[PAST NC]: And that was my eight-minute review of "The Last Airbender". I'm sorry the wall was the wrong color...

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.540
but hey, at least it's not as bad as a Bat-Credit Card! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!I'll kill you!

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.520
[NC]: What the hell are you doing?

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.360
[PAST NC]: I did it! I did a traditional Nostalgia Critic review, with no visuals, no cutaways...

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.500
just me in front of a white wall!

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.640
[NC]: What'd you do with Malcolm and Tamara?
[PAST NC]: Oh, I put them to good use.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.920
[NC]: OK, get the hell outta here! You're exactly like this movie.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.060
You think that never changing and just repeating the same traditions over and over is somehow what's most important.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.640
[PAST NC]: Well, I'm about to show you! I just posted this on the Internet...

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.140
and I'm gonna prove that people like to see the exact same formula over and over!

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.440
And soon you're going to have to change that wall to off white. Off white!

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.400
[NC]: Yeah, well, I'm embarrassed you were ever a part of me. I'm gonna wrap up this review telling the world that.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.160
[PAST NC]: Aha! Here we go!

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.300
Barely anybody is watching it.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.680
Nobody cares that this is like one of the old reviews.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.080
[NC]: Yeah. There you go, idiot.
[PAST NC]: And the comments... They're not positive at all.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.220
Gosh, it's like the majority of online comments are usually...

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.620
negative.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.520
[TAMARA]: Look you're still pretty new to this, but there is a saying that most of us know.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.740
[MALCOLM]: Yeah, you never read the comments.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.680
[PAST NC]: But that's why I did it.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.280
To make them laugh.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.960
I figured, maybe if I can make them laugh...

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.980
I can finally get them to like me.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.080
That's the whole reason I started doing this.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.540
[KID]: Hey loser, where's Patty Mayonnaise?

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.080
[MAN ON PHONE]: Hey Spielberg, what's the name of your next movie?

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.620
"Attack of the 50-foot Forehead"?

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.640
[PAST NC]: I was thinking, maybe, if you weren't doing anything this Friday night, maybe we could hang out--

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.160
[GIRL]: You're gross!

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.280
[PAST NC]: I just thought...

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.500
this would change everything, you know...

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.560
[NC]: We're not who we were.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.120
We change.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.940
Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. But we all change.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.900
Movies like this don't want us to change.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.640
They try to shame those who do things their own way.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.640
They act like the importance is in the details and not in the overall message.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.480
This is a horrible thing to change, especially when talking about Christmas.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.840
But we shouldn't be ashamed of our past.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.920
Not should we glorify it.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.840
It's like anything: there's positives and negatives.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.320
There's good moments in bad times, and bad moments in good times.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.400
Because of this, traditions can be hard to figure out, too.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.040
Sometimes we obsess over things, when we don't need to.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.100
Other times, we try something new, when we probably should have left "good enough" alone.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.040
But in between one foot in the past and one in the future, lies what matters most.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:28.260
The choices we make now are what always has and always will define who we are.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.720
So, this Christmas, when you remember to be kind and understanding of others...

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.300
remember to be kind and understanding of yourself.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.540
And those moments you remember as being embarrassing, you may find are not only the most precious moments...

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.900
but often the most important.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.680
And sometimes should be looked at with more appreciation than you think.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.820
We're always going to get angry at ourselves, but as long as you always try to learn and get better...

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.180
you'll find it doesn't last that long.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.260
And trust me when I say...

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.320
you're definitely worth the time.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.240
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.920
This movie can suck it.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.100
Don't touch me! You'll give me a seizure!

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.860
[TAMARA]: Hey, you barely put us in the review!

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.720
[NC]: Oh, yeah, he made that a lot better!

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.860
[MALCOLM]: Hey, it's not easy being a table.
[NC]: It's not easy being unconscious!

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.160
[TAMARA]: Do you know how hard it is to balance a camera on top of your head?

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.080
[NC MOCKING]: Oh, good for you!

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.240
(And now...)

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.340
(Bloopers!)

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.480
[NC]: Tamara! Pan left!

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.740
Pan right!

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.580
Dutch angle!

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.260
White balance!

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.000
[TAMARA]: OK, this is as white and as balanced as it gets!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.180
[NC]: You're fired!

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.640
