00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:02.102
AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME,
WHAT'S YOUR VICE?

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.771
WHAT'S YOUR VICE?

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:10.944
VICE IS AN AWARD-WINNING MEDIA
ORGANIZATION THAT DOES HARD-

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.014
HITTING STORIES ON PROVACATIVE
ART, CULTURE AND NEWS.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.183
THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY GET THEIR
WRITERS TO PARTAKE IN BIZARRE

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.585
SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS, RESULTING IN
A WEBSITE FULL OF ATTENTION-

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.758
GRABBING HEADLINES LIKE "MY
SHORT-LIVED CAREER AS A TEENAGE

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.326
FEMALE WRESTLER" AND "GEORGE
LOPEZ GAVE ME A MAKE OVER."

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.096
COMEDIANS, I WANT YOU TO COME UP
WITH AS MANY FAKE VICE HEADLINES

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.130
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.732
I'M GOING TO PUT 60 SECONDS ON
THE CLOCK AND GO.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.866
JESSE.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.170
&gt;&gt; I LIVED IN ITALY FOR SIX
WEEKS AND NOW MY DICK PULLS

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.538
ITSELF OUT IN PUBLIC.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.972
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS. ROY.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.741
&gt;&gt; I WATCHED YOU SLEEP LAST
NIGHT.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.977
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS. SARH.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.647
&gt;&gt; I WAS A CHILD BRIDE AT 83.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.881
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.049
JESSE.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.118
&gt;&gt; I USED TO [BLEEP] WITH
RACCOONS A LOT AND THAT'S HOW I

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.219
LOST THIS EYE.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.587
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: YES, POINTS.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.522
JESSE.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.391
&gt;&gt; I PERFORMED A DOUBLE
MASECTOMY ON JUSTIN BIEBER AND

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.027
THEN HAD A TALL SEMEN SODOMITE
LATTE.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.127
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: YES, POINTS.
