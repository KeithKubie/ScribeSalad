other lectures delivered

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.970
by current and past Kluge scholars.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.090
Today's lecture is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.780
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.340
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capitol Hill

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.870
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.510
to stimulate and energize
one another to distill wisdom

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.580
from the library's rich
resources and to interact

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.070
with policy makers and the public.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.180
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.230
post-doctoral fellows and Ph. D
candidates to conduct research

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.650
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.730 position:56%
and other programs such as this one.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.160
And we administer the Kluge Prize,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.140
which recognizes lifetime
achievement in the study

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.160
of humanity, and which
we recently awarded

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.260
to philosophers Jurgen
Habermas and Charles Taylor.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.670

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.380
Today's lecture is titled
The Struggle for Fairness:

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.480
National Origin Quotas and
the Immigration Act of 1965.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220
Our speaker is Ruth Wasem,
this year's Kluge staff fellow

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.320
at the Library of Congress
Kluge Center.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.750
Ruth's research at the Kluge Center
this past year has used the Library

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.460
of Congress collections to
retrace the legislative debate

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.510
that culminated in the
passage of the Immigration Act

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.230
of 1965, 50 years ago this month.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.010
A landmark piece of legislation

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.400
that 50 years later has profoundly
altered the composition and makeup

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.810
of our nation and our
immigration system.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.420
Her work examines the past
toward the passing of that act,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.450
as well as the act's
legacy 50 years later.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.900
Ruth is the latest example of the
work that Kluge staff fellows do

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.190
in changing our understanding
of the world around us.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.680
The Library staff is full of
brilliant and esteemed experts

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.500
who are passionate about
their areas of expertise.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.650
And the Kluge staff fellowship
allows one or sometimes two

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.030
of such staff members
the opportunity

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.980
to pursue their scholarship
using the resources here

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.080
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.990 position:56%
The fellowship is funded by the
gift left by the late John W. Kluge,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.110
who founded the Kluge Center.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.230
And a staff fellow is one of
nearly 100 scholars who pass

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.260
through our walls each year,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.560
creating a vibrant scholar's
center on Capitol Hill.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.680 position:56%
And for information about additional
fellowships that we offer and how

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.460 position:56%
to conduct your own research at the
Library of Congress, please take one

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.460 position:56%

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.660
And we have been most delighted,
eager, happy to have her with us.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.400
A quick word about today's
program and how it will go.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.580
Following Ruth's talk we are very
privileged to have commentary

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.020
and discussion from two
distinguished scholars

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.350
of immigration, Susan F.
Martin and Marta Tienda.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.050 position:56%
Dr. Martin is Donald G. Herzberg
professor of international migration

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.000 position:56%
and director of the Institute for
the Study of International Migration

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.510
at Georgetown University.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.510
And Dr. Tienda is Morris P. During
professor in demographic studies,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.600 position:56%
professor of sociology and public
affairs, and director of the program

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.840

Princeton University.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.850 position:56%
Ruth Wasem will deliver her lecture.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.610
We will have commentary from
Dr. Tienda and Dr. Martin.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.990
The three of them will engage in a
short Q&amp;A and then engage with you,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.090
the audience and we will
conclude at about 5:30.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.510
So without further ado, please
join me in welcoming Rith Wasem.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:10.050
[ Applause ]

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.530
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Thank you
so much for coming today,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.600
particularly on a beautiful
day to be inside rather

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.340
than enjoying the world around us.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.950
I especially want to thank
the John Kluge Center

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.450
for this year, this opportunity.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.500
I've worked in the
library for 25 years,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.230
have enjoyed all of those years.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.800
But this year at the Kluge Center
I found treasures and experiences

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.680
that I had no idea
were in this library.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.580
So I thank the staff of the Kluge
Center and the scholars in terms

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.450
of enriching my research project.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.890
And I thank you for coming.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.650
So this is the 50th anniversary

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:04.640
of when Lyndon B. Johnson signed
the Immigration Act of 1965.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.710
It's, as Jason mentioned
at the onset,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.000
it's a legislation that's
had a profound effect

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.710
on what America looks like today.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.000
At the time they weren't
as convinced

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.430
that it was going to
have that effect.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.090
They were really struggling just
to have fairness in the system.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.440
And that's why I chose that
as the title of my talk.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.530
It was a legislative battle to try
to remove race and national origins

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.730
from the criteria that we
use to admit immigrants.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.760
And I have a really long lecture
that you're not going to hear.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.880
You can applaud now.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:53.460
[Laughs]. And I've reduced my
research into three concepts.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.350
And the first of the three concepts

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.020
of course is race and
national origins.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.290
Because that's the
subject of my research.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.600
But you can't talk about these
in the context of immigration

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.010
without also dealing with two
other very fundamental concepts.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.190
One that I'm calling the
ideology of the deserving.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.670
That's the selection process,
the selectivity in immigration.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.010
And the other is what I'm
calling apportionment politics

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.310
or power politics.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.820
There we go.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.190 position:56%
When we talk about race and
national origins, when we're talking

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.460
about the early 20th
century, the concept of race

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.670
and national origins
was very different

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.720
from what we would have
today, the 21st century view.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.310
The government had over
39 different categories

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.190
of race and national origin.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.160
And I chose this cartoon from
the library's collections.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.340
It's by the famous cartoonist
Thomas Nass from Harper's Weekly.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.600
And Nass did it right
after the passage

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.020
of the Chinese exclusion laws.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.050
And there's two points that I
want to make about this cartoon.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.550
Because they illustrate
fundamental points of my talk.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.910
The first one is that it's talking

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.580
about what color will
be tabooed next.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.900
It's an open acknowledgement
that there was a perception

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.110
that the immigration
law that was passed

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.540
in the Chinese exclusion
laws were fundamentally based

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.460
on color and race.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.920
But it also shows if you look at
the depiction of Pat the Irishman,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.290
it's not exactly the most
favorable depiction of the Irish.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.110
He has a monkey-like quality.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.080
And Fritz, the German in the
cartoon, has thick glasses

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.070
and is also you might
say racially stereotyped

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.520
or ethnically stereotyped
in this cartoon.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.140 position:56%
So that's the first point, is to get
the sense of how tribal the views

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.980
on race and nationality were in the
late 19th and early 20th century.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.430
They weren't just black,
white, Asian, Indian.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.040
They were much more specific
in how they viewed people.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.430
The second point, and this
gets to the selectivity,

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.690
some might say class element
that I'm talking about.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.580
It's harder to see in the cartoon,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:33.840
but it points out that Chinese
laborers shall not come.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.490
And the Chinese exclusion acts
are wonderful illustration

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.860
of the overlay of class
in selectivity

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.530
on race-based admissions.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.850
Because the Chinese exclusions
laws excluded Chinese laborers.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.930
But if you go through
the congressional record,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.890
when they talked about
the legislation,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.920
they wanted to get
Chinese merchants.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.380
They wanted the wealthy
elite Chinese.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.340
It was the laborers
they didn't want.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.810
So there's no question that they
were aimed at racial exclusion,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.880
but the overlay of class
was most certainly present

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.480
from the earliest days
of these exclusion laws.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.890
Now the other way that
you see the selectivity,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:28.430
and I chose this classic picture
that Siglex took from first class,

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.150
looking at the immigrants coming
on the passage across the Atlantic,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.070
was that there was a range
of different people who came

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.400
as immigrants to the United States.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.570
But there was a concern
about what groups came in.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:50.770
And I stand on the shoulders
of the two people that --

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.780
Marta Tienda and Susan Martin,
who were introduced at the onset

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.480
and who will be talking shortly --

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.200
because both of their
research points

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.600
to these fundamental
elements of my research.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.650
Susan in her book A
Nation of Immigrants

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:11.960
in 2009 developed how the selection
of immigrants were modelled

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.650
as either a Virginia
model, a Pennsylvania model,

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.920
a Massachusetts model and how these
different concepts were interwoven

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.460
throughout our history in terms
of how we selected immigrants.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.480
Marta's work that I'm
stealing or building on comes

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.550
from a 2002 speech she
gave when she was president

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.300
of the American Sociological
Association.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.710
And that was on demography
and the social contract.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.110 position:56%
And this is where the
apportionment power politics element

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.490
that I have been looking
at really comes into play.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.320
Because in that speech
which was later published,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.880 position:56%
she talks about how people are
counted, how immigrants are included

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.080 position:56%
in the census, how fundamental that
is to the defining of our democracy.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:09.170 position:56%
The point I am taking from Professor
Tienda is that in the writing

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:17.110 position:56%
of the 1924 Immigration Act, because
it's very clear from my reading

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.940
of the materials that a lot of
the legislators were concerned

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.490 position:56%
about how the wave of immigrants
was going to affect reapportionment.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.940
That they could even reapportion
Congress based on the 1924 census.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.610
Because it would have shifted the
power around the country so much.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.290
And they also, I think, I argue --

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.050
one of the reasons they
did the exclusions,

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:48.750
the national origins exclusions of
the '24 act was because they wanted

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.790 position:56%
to try to have a little more control
over the distribution of power

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.380
so that rural and southern
areas wanted to retain

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.870
as much electoral power,
legislative power that they could.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.900
And so controlling immigration was
seen as one of the ways to do that.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.240
This slide just gives
you a quick snapshot

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.970
of the features of the 1924 act.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.350
This was when Asians
were formally barred

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.060
because they could naturalize.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.990
I'm not even -- we could talk
about this if you have questions,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.920
but it's pretty complex
to get into now.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.490
The eastern hemisphere was
limited to the 1890 census

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.810
and this is the part of
the law that led to norther

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.840 position:56%
and western Europe dominating in the
numbers and minimizing the numbers

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.260
from southern and eastern Europe
because it was scaled back

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.040
to go before the great wave
at the turn of the century.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.850
Also, the western hemisphere, all
the migrants from this hemisphere,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.200
were not held to any
numerical limits.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:00.140
But they were still held to
qualitative restrictions based

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.680
on what we call in the immigration
world, the ground for exclusion.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.610 position:56%
So if you were a criminal, likely
to be indigent, or more importantly,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.040
coming to work without
proper authorization

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.160
as contract labor,
you would be barred.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.820
So that was the way we
controlled migration

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.520
from this hemisphere in 1924.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.840
This gives you a sense of
how that actually was playing

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.200
out by the post-World War II era.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.530
And as you can see, the
allocation of visas to northern

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:37.920
and western Europe was much
greater than their actual usage.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.940
Whereas the other parts
of the world were pressing

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.970
against the numerical limits.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.840
You can also see from this figure
just how small the numbers were

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.090
that could come in from these
other parts of the world.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.150
Now initially in the
postwar period, those who --

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.260 position:56%
there had always been people opposed
to the national origins quotas.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:04.780 position:56%
Emanuel Celler, and it was his
papers that are the kind of the body

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.230
of work that I have relied on
here at the Library of Congress.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:14.300 position:56%
Emanuel Celler was a new congressman
who argued against the 1924 act.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.630
In 1952 he offered an amendment
as an alternative to that act.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.220
And he was chairing the
judiciary committee, by the way,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.000
when the 1965 act passed.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.230
So this man, he was
from New York City.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.520
He spent his entire career
fighting against race

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.520
and national origins admissions.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.960
They thought originally
after the war

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.540
that they could get rid
of the national origins.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.060
That it was the right time.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.480
We were coming out of World War II.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.600
The public diplomacy aspects of
having national origins were seen

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.490
as a liability when we dealt with
other countries around the world.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.100
The economy was roaring.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.820
We had a full employment economy.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.770
We were sending marshal
plan money to Europe.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.860
And it looked like a good time.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.090
However, even with the displaced
persons after World War II,

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:13.140
it was very clear the public did
not support increasing immigration.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.110
And when Congress was trying
to deal with displaced persons,

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.370
they were still wedded
in that process

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.330
to the national origins
quotas in terms

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.050
of how they responded to refugees.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.590
So in 1952, Congress
took up the McCarran Act.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.070
And I want to just
read some quotes to you

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.380
to give you a flavor for the times.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.120
Because I must admit, when
I was doing my research some

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.550
of these things surprised me and I
didn't think I would be surprised

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.800
at this point in my career.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.970
There was a senate
report on immigration

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.710
that was almost 1,000 pages long.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.060
And it had an amazing, amazing --

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.400
it drew an amazing
conclusion from my perspective.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.120
Maybe you'll share my view.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.650
The Senate report criticized
national origins quotas

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.900
for not admitting the
proper mix of white people.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.280
More precisely, the report
stated, "Only about half

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.540
of the anticipated proportion of
immigrants have come from northern

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.010
and western Europe, while twice the
contemplated proportion have come

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.730
from southern and eastern Europe."

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.300
The report concluded, "As a method
of preserving the relationship

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.470
between the various elements
in our white population,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:45.650
the national origin system
has not been effective."

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.360
Interesting.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.750
McCarran also -- Senator McCarran,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.430
Patrick McCarran was a
democrat from Nevada.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.410
He was also quite concerned
about illegal immigration.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:19:00.090
And before you think
this sounds contemporary,

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.900
when he did a press conference
on 5 million illegal aliens

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.760
that had poured into the country,
let me give you a little more

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.240
of a sense of who he
was talking about.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.400
McCarran referred to these
5 million illegal aliens

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.570
as "militant communists,
Sicilian bandits, criminals,

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.800
and he warned that they were
a readymade fifth column

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.170
for the enemy.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.670
And potentially more dangerous
than an armed invasion."

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.720
That's Pat McCarran, 1951.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.970
He was joined by Senator Herbert
O'Connor who was from Maryland,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.200
who pointed out that these
unauthorized illegal aliens

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.500
as they called them were coming

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.630
into the United States
from Canada and Cuba.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.030
I had to pause for that.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.040
[ Laughter ]

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.780
There were alternative views at the
time and a Senator, Herbert Layman

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:00.070
of New York, he took a
totally different tack.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.120
And he said on the senate floor,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.330
"This philosophy is a
xenophobic philosophy.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.570
It is a racist philosophy.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.640
It is a philosophy of fear,
suspicion and distrust

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.000
of foreigners outside our country
and of aliens within our country.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.180
It is a philosophy which is plainly
prejudiced against immigration."

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:28.530
Emanuel Celler put it this
way in debating the '52 act.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.520
He said, "What is America?

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.670
It is not so much that
you were born in America.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:39.100
The important thing is that
America has been born in you."

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.140
So these were two very
different streams struggling

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.740 position:56%
for control over immigration policy.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.810
Herblock. The Library of Congress
has the Herblock collection,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.880
so that was another
great fun this year.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:59.140
Herblock was quite pointed in his
conclusions about the 1952 act.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.440
And he ran this cartoon
shortly before Harry Truman,

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.140
President Harry Truman
vetoed the act.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.180
And I want to just do one quick
excerpt from Truman's veto,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.210
again to give you a
flavor of the 1950's.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.310
"In no other realm of our
national life are we so hampered

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:23.540 position:56%
and stultified by the dead hand of
the past, the dead hand of the past,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.420
as we are in this field
of immigration.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.120
We do not limit our cities
to their 1920 boundaries.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.460
We do not hold corporations
to their 1920 capitalizations.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:39.620
We welcome progress to meet the
changing conditions in every sphere

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.900
of life except in the
field of immigration.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.860
It's the time to shake off this
dead weight of past mistakes.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.450 position:56%
The time to develop a decent policy
of immigration, a fitting instrument

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.490
for our foreign policy
and a true reflection

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.070
of the ideals we stand
for at home and abroad."

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:07.810
I did a fair amount of
analysis on the '52 act

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.330
because I got a little too sucked
into it, considering I was supposed

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.420
to be working on the 1965 act.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.520
But I wanted to point
out how this graph,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.650
which is of the Senate vote -- but
the House vote is almost identical

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.840
when you do this graph -- shows
what I'm talking about in terms

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.510
of apportionment politics.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:31.230
And the regional distribution
of power and the foreign born.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:36.370
And I want to point out to you are
what I would call the two deviants.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.570
The two deviants -- I shouldn't
probably say that word --

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.450
but they are the Republicans
who supported Truman's veto

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.530
and the Democrats who
didn't support it.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.150
These were the people that
broke with their parties.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.090
You can see that the Republicans,
and there were a sizeable number

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.480
of Republicans throughout
the 1950's and '60's

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.310
who supported very
strongly immigration reform.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:04.280
Jacob Javitz, Hugh Scott,
Kenneth Keading, Prescott Bush.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.580
A large number.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.050
And they are the ones that you see
from the high immigration states

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.600
and the top immigration
states who crossed over

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.770
and supported Truman's veto
of the McCarran-Walter Act.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:20.290
Similarly, the democrats
who voted for McCarran

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:27.090
and supported the veto
override were from the south.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.400
And I want to point out -- I pulled
Texas and Florida out separately

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.770
because they're not
low immigration states.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:38.280
But they were solemnly against
immigration reform at that time.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:45.360
And also show the dark purple in
the high column, that's Arizona.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.360 position:56%
Those are the two senators from
Arizona who were democratic senators

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.310
but they supported the
McCarran-Walter Act.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.320 position:56%
So this gives you kind of a feel for
what I'm talking about when I talk

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.340
about the political power

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.220
and apportionment dynamic
of immigration.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.000
All through the '50's of course,
after the McCarran-Walter Act,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.710
there was a lot of legislative
activity on trying to come

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.850 position:56%
up with alternatives to immigration,
the current immigration law.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:22.210
And the Truman commission
made a series

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.730
of recommendations including
increasing immigration

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.120
to 250,000 a year and totally
eliminating the national origins

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.350
quotas and putting
everybody under one ceiling.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.900
And that was very similar to
what Senator Herbert Layman

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.040
and Hubert Humphry and Congressman
Emanuel Celler introduced in '53.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.470
President Eisenhower
also came out strongly

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.530
for immigration reform in 1956.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.520
It was featured in his
state of the union.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.870
He had a proposal that while
it retained national origins,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.940
it would have substantially
increased legal immigration

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.250
in the United States,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:03.880
thereby through that increase
addressing the suppressed treatment

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.490
of southern and eastern Europe.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:11.030
That was how Eisenhower was
responding to the backlogs

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.120
in that part of the world,
was to increase the numbers.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.720
Needless to say, those
proposals didn't go anywhere,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.950
but the new senate majority
leader, Lyndon B. Johnson,

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.100 position:56%
was cooking up something on the side
with Everett Dirkson the Republican

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.900
and minority leader, who
was also quite sympathetic

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.480
to immigration reform
throughout this period.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.040
They came up with an amendment that
they brought to the senate floor

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.750
at the very last day, next
to last day of the session.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.460
And it passed.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.700
And it was similar to the
Eisenhower, picked some things

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.290
from the Eisenhower proposal
from some of the Humphry,

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.030
Layman and Celler proposals.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.840
It was a compromise.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.550
This is going to sound
familiar to you.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.810
It passed the Senate
but died in the House.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.130
Very little was known
about that since it kind

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.120
of disappeared from our history.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.950
In the late '50's there were
also some incremental revisions

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:10.950
to the law that actually were
quite substantial in the long run.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:16.030
But really nibbling on the edges
from the broader perspective.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:21.680
And in the early 1960's Emanuel
Celler introduced a new bill.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.290
And his bills were getting
shorter, by the way.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:29.560
They started in 1953 at over 200
pages, and covered the full range

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.760
of immigration reform
that you can think of,

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.810
including administrative
efficiencies

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.240
and naturalization reforms, changes
to the grounds for admissibility,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.980
as well as elimination
of national origins.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.530
By the end, it was
down to about 12 pages.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.370
Also new on the scene was Senator
Phil Hart from Michigan who came

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.460
with a very strong record
on civil rights and labor.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.850 position:56%
And he embraced immigration reform
and introduced a very important bill

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.300
that included features that
were subsequently picked

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.750
up in the Kennedy administration
proposal.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.580
When I talked about
selectivity at the onset,

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.030
I want to also give you
a data way to look at it.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.900
And this is not necessarily
something

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.600
that the legislators
of that time looked at.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.790
And that is they set
these priorities.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.650
Half were supposed to be
high-skilled immigrants.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.920
But when you look at the pie
chart for actual admissions,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.290
you see that only 6%
were high-skilled.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.110
And the parents of US citizens,
which was supposed to be 30%,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.430
well they were 4% and so on.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.730
And it rolled down.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.840
The overwhelming proportion
of immigrants that came

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.320
in under the McCarran-Walter Act
were what we call non-preference.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.360
They were largely from
northern and western Europe.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.800
And they were you know, not
coming in under the priorities

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.390
that had been set by Congress.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.010
So you can see there
was already a mismatch

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:03.410 position:56%
between what the Congress had wanted
and how it ultimately played out.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:09.440
Well in 1963 Senator -- well,
he had been Senator Kennedy.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.350
He had chaired the immigration
subcommittee when he was

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.840
in the senate and been instrumental
in pushing for immigration reform,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.920
and was truly the champion of
the immigration reform movement

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.920
in the late '50's and early '60's.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.430
He did not introduce
his administration bill

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.710
until the summer of '63.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.600
And it was not nearly as
ambitious as people had expected.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.320
It did not immediately
repeal national origins.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.500
It was a phase-out over five years.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.630
It emphasized high-skilled
immigration,

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.510
much like McCarran-Walter.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:45.260
And instead of increasing overall
immigration levels to 250,000

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.690 position:56%
which had been pretty much the
standard throughout the alternatives

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.560
of the 1950's, it only increased
immigration by about 10,000.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.670
And these were largely aimed
at refugee populations.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.220
So there was not to be an
increase overall in immigration.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.710
Now tragically, as we all know,

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:07.350
President Kennedy was
assassinated in the fall of 1963.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.730
And it was very unclear what
was going to happen next.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:16.390
The immigration reformers
were suspicious of Johnson.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.700
He had not been seen as
someone they were close to.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.950
But similarly, the defenders of
the status quo were also suspicious

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.410 position:56%
of Johnson because they had worked
with him in the Senate and they knew

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.010
that they were up against
a very effective adversary

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.570
in terms of getting things done.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.490
And that proved to be right.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.740 position:56%
And Johnson came up with a strategy.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.630
It was fascinating.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:49.620
I went to the LBJ library and went
through a lot of his materials.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:56.780
And a strategy to get the votes,
to get the bill through and I guess

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.600
in Texas they call that
giving them the Johnson.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.660
One of the things I found in the
collections that gives you a sense

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.190
of how they did it back then,
50 years ago, is Myer Feldman,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.320
who was a wonderful political
strategist who had been

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.490
with Kennedy -- and Johnson
kept him on for good reason --

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.490
developed all these
different targeting maps based

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.290
on the populations of foreign
born where the votes would be.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.500
They used it in the '64 campaign.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.950
They also used it in '65 --

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.730
much more elaborate things
that this -- to win the vote.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.420
Having detailed information

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:35.260
about the congressional districts'
foreign born population in order

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.750
to buttonhole people that
they needed to support.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.720
Now public opinion at this time
was deeply divided on immigration.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.910
And I think almost
all the polling --

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.230
and I was quite fortunate
to get access to a wealth

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.040
of historic polling data.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.260
The public did not support
increases in immigration.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.190
And I believe that's why, though
I have no direct evidence,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:04.090
I think that's why the Kennedy
drafters of the bill chose not

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.420
to increase immigration
beyond 10,000.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.290
Because it was so strongly
opposed by the public.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:17.240
What is interesting though is how
it shifted in terms of the support

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.660
from the national origin system.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:25.120
And Lou Harris did a
survey in May of 1965.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.540
You can see from the first
pie that the populace

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.100
that they interviewed was divided
up what I would say into thirds.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.470
A third that supported, 29%

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.850
that supported keeping
the country quotas.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.750
36% that supported
basing it on scales.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.790 position:56%
And then 35% that were either unsure

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.800
or didn't think it
made a difference.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.900
A month later, Gallop did a survey,

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.700
but they framed the questions
a little differently.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.050
So don't read a whole lot into
this as a substantial change

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:59.150
in public opinion, though there
was a concerted public relations

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.650
campaign that was kicked off
in May and June of that year.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.820
But what you can see
happening is those opposed,

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.630
and Gallop said there was a
hardcore group of about a third

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:15.490
of the population -- because they
did much more detailed analysis --

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:21.360
that opposed increasing immigration
and also supported the race

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.550
and national origins-based
exclusion.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.910
What started happening
though was the shifting away

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.570
of the no opinions.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:34.790
More of the undecided no
opinions were coming in support

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:42.660
of basing the admissions on merit,
rather than country of birth.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.450
Well there were still a
lot of people opposed to it

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.220
in a lot of these tracks.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.970
I'm just putting this pamphlet up.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.940
I know you can't read it.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:58.800
But you can probably read
what's in the bold type in red.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.160 position:56%
And that's where you can see this
really sums up most of the arguments

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.610
that were for the status quo.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.140
And I'll just run through them.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.840
How are we doing time-wise?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.530
Okay. I'll run through
them very quickly.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.350
The mirror of America was one

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.020
that was used throughout
the 20th century.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.770
And that's basically that northern

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.630
and western Europeans were the
people that settled the country,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:28.050
that arguably they made the
country great and it's only fair

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.450
that they get a disproportional
number

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.710
of the visas issued every year.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.070
This was the status quo
argument of fairness.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.090
And then the corollary
that it was much easier

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.620
to assimilate these immigrants

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.550
because they were more
like us, so to speak.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:51.170
Now anti-communism was a very
important issue in the 1950's.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.720
But it really waned by the '60's
and didn't come up as much.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.210
But the issue that really
came up even more was

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.570 position:56%
that looking out for the little guy.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.160
And you see this in the pamphlet.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.760
They talk about immigrant
workers that would be competing

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.570
with US workers and
taking jobs away.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.870
Another argument that
was just emerging

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:12.420
in the '50's was population
explosion.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.890
And House immigration subcommittee
had hearings on population

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:19.320
and immigration, which spent
a lot of time looking at this.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.800
And this was right about -- for
some of you that might remember,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.860
this is right about the same
time the book The Population Bomb

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.540
came out.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.980
And so there was concern
about that issue.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:36.930
But at the end of the day, what
I found time and time again

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:42.090
in the research is that race
was still the driving force.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.780
And even when you look
at this pamphlet,

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:50.000
if you look at that last page,
shuffling quotas to admit Asians

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.700
and unlimited nonquota orientals
and Negros will be admitted.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.390
That came up again
and again and again.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.820
And I'll just do a
couple quick quotes.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.790
The Daughters of the
American Revolution warned

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:10.980
against the proliferation of
African immigrants coming.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.680
Senator Sam Irwin of South Carolina
said the legislation discriminated

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.020
against northern Europeans

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.440
because it treated them
the same as Ethiopians.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.440 position:56%
"And I don't know of any
contributions that Ethiopia has made

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.420
to America," Senator Irwin said.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.080
Willis Robertson, who is
Pat Robertson's father,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.920
was a senator from
Virginia at the time.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.900
He was the first one that I
found to publicly build the case,

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.220
which I then started finding
everywhere in the primary sources,

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.770
that because -- and this
is a very technical point,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.770
but it turns out to
be quite important.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.640
The western hemisphere, as I
told you, had been exempted.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:58.140
But not the colonies, if you were
a French of a British colony.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.400
Well, Jamaica, Trinidad and
Tobago had become independent.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.590
And this legislation
would have treated them

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.090
like any other western
hemisphere country.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.170
It would have allowed
them to be unlimited.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:15.910
People went ballistic about the
Negroes that would be coming

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.850
in from Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:23.820
So much so that it became one of
the most compelling arguments used

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.780
to try to put a cap on
the western hemisphere.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:34.380
And it's interesting, because --
well, I don't have that much time.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:38.430
[Laughs]. Suffice to say, I was
surprised about that finding.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.140
Then the other issues
that came up --

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.050
and this came out in the
hearings that the house had.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.750
But it also was becoming much
more commonplace knowledge

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.670
as they led into the final debate.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.030 position:56%
And that was that the limited quota
immigrants weren't the major portion

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.020
of people coming into the country.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:01.470
The western hemisphere was
the largest single category.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.630
And that nonquota, which I
have depicted in gray here,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.380
but that's mostly at this point
in time immediate relatives

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.280
of US citizens, was also sizeable.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.590
So this was leading to the push

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.630
to put all immigration
under a worldwide cap.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.260
And so when the time came
to be working on this,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.640
the issue of how many were we going
to let in became quite important.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.730
And I'm just sharing with you
Congressman Celler's handwritten

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:32.050
notes as he was calculating, "Well,

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.430
how many people will
my bill let in?"

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.980
And if you look over in the
far corner, I don't expect you

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.700
to be able to read his handwriting
on the monitor, but he was guessing

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.900
that it was about 366,000
that would be coming in.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.390
The Immigration Naturalization
Service did formal estimates

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.920
and they're depicted
in the yellow bar here.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.000
And this is based on when
the bill was introduced,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.820
which was a five-year phase out
of the national origins proposal.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.710
So you can see they anticipated
an increase in immigration

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.620
and they anticipated
an increase from Asia.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.750
But they did not, as it turns out,

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.470
anticipate the levels
that we actually had.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.780
Again, they were using
different legislative language.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.180
But there are some other things
we can talk about in the Q&amp;A

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.910
if you want to, because I've
taken a pretty long look at this.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.280
So here are the key features
of what Congress passed.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.790
They repealed national origins

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.600
and gave a per-country
cap, 20,000 at that time.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.750
They expanded family-based.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.900
The employment-based, the push
for high-skilled didn't happen.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.420
It was set at only 10%.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.400
So it was a cutback
from current law.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.410
And the compromise on
the western hemisphere,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.440
which was a hard-fought
battle ended up --

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.740
they didn't put the
western hemisphere

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.170
under the preference system
at that point in time.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:01.130
But they capped it at 120,000.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.720
The selectivity, I
showed you some pie charts

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.890
of how the McCarran-Walter
Act priorities played out.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.810
They were a little
better matchup in '65.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:17.090
But again, you can see first
preference, US citizens,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.740
unmarried sons and
daughters were allocated 20%.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.820
And the first five years used 1%.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.090
The numbers rolled down.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.470
And this is the beginning of where
you can see the growth in brothers

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.870
and sisters, which were given --
for the first time they were added

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.170
in the preference category.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.510
They were given 24% and because of
the roll down they ended up at 28%.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.610
And over time this
number would grow.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:45.150
So this is how the
selectivity was playing out.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:50.450
In terms of the western hemisphere
caps, it did have an effect.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.930
This is just two quick slides.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.980
You can see that Mexican
migration shifted

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.690
from the western hemisphere
category,

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.010
which was largely employment-based
because you pretty much had

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:04.500
to have a job to come here.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.730
To being much more family
oriented and spouses and children

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:12.050
and other preference categories.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.020
Similarly, what you see with the
Caribbean and Central America --

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.250
and these numbers at this point
in time are mostly Caribbean.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.310
You see the Caribbean
was a big winner.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:27.880
Their numbers went up substantially
after the '65 act passed.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.880 position:56%
And they particularly took advantage
of the new preference categories.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.480
I'm going to drill through
these rather quickly

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.710
but we can come back
to them if you want.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.850
This is the non-preference
category, which you know

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.670
from the pie charts mopped
up a lot of unused numbers.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:48.650
You can see that as that shrunk
the employment-based numbers

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.130
weren't recouped.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:56.760
And so employment-based of all
kinds was much smaller post-'65

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.900
than it had been before.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.900
When you look at professional
and exceptional ability by region

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:06.290
of the world, again this is not
news, but it points out how Asia

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.260
and opening up Asia, which
had been barred before 1965.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.280
Asian migrants, Asian
immigrants took full advantage

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.390
of the employment-based
high-skill category.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:23.910
And US employers were happy to
recruit and hire Asian workers.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:30.170
And in fact, the only thing that
really had those numbers shrink was

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.540
when they put everyone
under the caps,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.520
when they added the
western hemisphere.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.060
And when enough of the
family members started coming

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.360
in that they started bumping
against their per-country caps.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.110
In terms of unskilled
workers and shortage workers,

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.940
the other 10% of the preference
system, it's interesting.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.970
This kind of plays out like
I think people had intended.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:59.800
You can see it's a fairly diverse
flow from all regions of the world

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.610
that were coming in
in this category.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.490
Family-based is the other big one.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.500
And when you begin to understand
why did the numbers seem

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.140
to lowball future flows.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.960
If you look throughout the
'50's, spouses and children

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.780
of US citizens were unlimited then.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.550
But the numbers were
pretty constant.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:28.820
After the '65 act, you see a
growth in immediate relatives.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.080
And I also pulled out the two
categories that were added

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.870
to immediate relatives
in the 1965 act.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:39.300
Most importantly the
parents of US citizens.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:43.700
When you look at how the
continuous pattern of spouses

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.070
and children play out, again you
can see Europe stayed pretty much

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.370
the same.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.420
But you see growth in
Asia and also the shifting

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.590
of the western hemisphere to coming

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.660
in through the family-based
categories.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.610
Now this one is a key,
because you see parents.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:08.200
And I think it's important to
note here that a large portion

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.310
of the growth in parents
of US citizens that came

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.100
after the '65 act were
Asian parents.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.470 position:56%
Asian families were much more likely

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.980
to bring their parents
to the United States.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.310
Other parts of the
world followed suit,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.160
but never in the numbers
that Asian families.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.950
So this gets into a
fundamental concept.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.250
So here we are.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.550
This is the flow today.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.850
It's much more diverse
than it had been,

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.440
and a lot has been made
about the diversity.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.120
But I would argue we still
have issues of fairness today.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.340
They're just not framed
in the context

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.360
of race and national origins.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.730
They're framed in different ways.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.050 position:56%
And they're tough choices, just like
they were in the '50's and '60's,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:53.520
to decide what is the proper
balance that we should have

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.160
in our immigration policy.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.950
Who should we select?

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.320
How will that affect
apportionment and politics?

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.280
And so I am going to conclude
my remarks and turn it

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.850
over to Susan Martin and Marat
Tienda to offer some commentary.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:27.360
[ Applause ]

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.660
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: Hi.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.960
Congratulations.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.260
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Thank you.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.560
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: It was excellent.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.860
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Thank you.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.160
Go ahead.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.460
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: Me first?

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.760
Okay. Thank you.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.890
Thank you so much to the
Kluge Center for hosting Ruth,

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.870
because this is a phenomenal
project.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.320
And when Ruth told me that she
was applying for this fellowship

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.300
and wanted to work on the
1965 act, I was very excited

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.930
because there really hasn't been
the type of analysis of the act

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.850
that she has been able to do.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:03.010
And seeing the results now,
I'm absolutely delighted

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:07.440
that she spent the
last year doing this.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.820
And great use of cartoons too.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.120
That was one thing
Ruth mentioned to me

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.600
when she was developing
the proposal,

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.350
that she had cartoons
and wanted to use them.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:25.400
But hearing the way in which she
was able to tease out the thoughts

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:32.060
of the time and the concerns from
those graphics is just fantastic.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.300
I really want to congratulate
you on this.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.860
I agree with most of the
assessment, or just about all

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.680
of the assessment of
the core issues.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.350
I think the three areas are
perfect ones in terms of the role

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.900
of prejudice and xenophobia.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.420 position:56%
It's not that everyone who's opposed
to immigration is xenophobic.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:57.370
And I think that's an
important point to carry away.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:59.840
There are a lot of good
reasons for being concerned

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.340
about that aspect of immigration.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.480
The problem is that the
emotions that are carried

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.420
because of this fear of the other
is what makes it so difficult

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:15.220
to have a rational discussion
about those very concerns.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:21.020 position:56%
And as a result, it becomes a binary
action of you're for or against.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.500
Not one where you can actually
talk about what are the strengths

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.870
and weaknesses and
what are good policies.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:32.430
And I think we saw that very much
in that period leading up to 1924

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:38.900
and then continuing
through until 1965.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.930
Selectivity is a major issue
in today's debate as well

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.140
as it has been historically.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.270
Prior to the Nash Largins
quote is the US mostly tried

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:59.250
to regulate immigration from
the 1870's to '24 by determining

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.470
who had the qualities
we wanted to admit.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:06.460
And it was issues that I think
everyone could agree with:

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.510
not to admit people
with criminal records,

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.670
certain contagious
diseases, things of that sort.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.920
But then it got to
very, very shaky grounds

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.210 position:56%
like who is of good moral character.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.230
That's very, very subjective.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:24.690
And I remember also
there were crimes

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.250
of moral turpitude
and what that means.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:35.200
And there's a famous case in which
there was a British aristocratic

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.910
couple who had a divorce and
each had accuse the other

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.960
of adultery as the basis for it.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.250
They were coming to the
US on different boats

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:49.240
at almost precisely the same time.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.680
He was admitted and she was barred

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.470
because she committed a
crime of moral turpitude.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:48:00.510
So you've got very interesting
ways in which the policies play

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.730
out when you're talking
about selectivity.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.180
And then the importance of power

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.880
and apportionment is
absolutely right on,

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.250
as we can see today in the debate.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:17.390
But I must say quickly in my time
also, what I see as the lessons

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:21.370 position:56%
of the 1965 act and what preceded it

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.590
for today's debate on
immigration reform.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.980
The first key issue I think is
that it takes an awfully long time

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.570
to get immigration reform.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:38.580
And it's been since 1990 that
there's been the last major reform

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.830
in legal admissions to the US.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:45.290
1986 was the major
reforms for dealing

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:49.570
with unauthorized illegal
immigration into the country.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:53.690
And the last series
of serious debate

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.980
on immigration started
about 10 years ago.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:00.510
So we've had 25 years
since the last reforms.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:05.280
We've had 10 years of bills
being introduced, debated,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:11.300
passing sometimes one
house, never both on that.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.560
But as we've heard from Ruth,
the same thing exactly happened,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.430
both in terms of getting
to the '24 legislation.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.380
It took 50 years or
so of debate to decide

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.880
on the national origins quotas.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.930
And then from '24 to '65
before we could get the change

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.340
in those policies.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.640
Although there were incremental
changes in the interim.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.620
But the fundamental changes
really take a long, long time.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.470
And so we shouldn't be surprised
that we're having difficulty today.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:52.120
That's part of our -- almost the
DNA of immigration in this country.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.670 position:56%
Part of the reason for that is we
are so ambivalent about immigration.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:01.310
I think if most people realized
that what they are saying today

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:05.220
about immigrants is exactly
what was said against them

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.720
when their forefathers came,
they'd be absolutely shocked.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.850
They don't see that connection,
although it is so strong.

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:17.380
We always look with rose-colored
glasses at our forebears

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.620
and deep suspicion about the
people who are coming in today.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.410
And so that's a problem.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:27.390
The second problem is there
have always been bedfellows

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.690
on the immigration issue.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.580
As that chart showed,
you can't predict

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.970
in very easy ways who's
going to be in favor

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:38.610
and who's going to be opposed.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.350
And one of the divisions that
I've written a lot about --

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:45.350
and Ruth mentioned some
of the work I've done --

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.530
is that there are always
divisions between what people think

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.950
about immigration -- meaning how
many people should be admitted --

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.860
and what do they think about
immigrants, meaning what kind

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.900
of right people should have.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.230
And these coalitions
change depending on which

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.900
of those issues you're
really talking about.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.800
And the selectivity issue
gets into play on both levels

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.580
of immigration and of immigrants.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.850
And we're still seeing
strange bedfellows.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:19.650
Although I think today we're
seeing more partisan politics

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:23.170
on immigration than at
least historically was true.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:28.880
And I've been working on public
policy issues on immigration

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:34.610
since 1979 and it's more
partisan than I have ever seen it.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.730
And that makes it very,
very difficult

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.920
to get to where we want to hit.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.890
And that means another point that
came out of Ruth's talk is the need

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.190
for political leadership.

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:51.570
It's those political figures
particularly presidents

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.670
that really have to lead the way.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:58.730
But what's difficult about that
in the context of immigration is

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.610
that immigration is a congressional
prerogative and is seen as being

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.710
in the purview of Congress.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.600
And presidents generally,
executive branches have not had

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:10.900
much influence.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.290
So trying to pull that influence

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.680
into the debate can
be very difficult.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.820
And so you also need strong
congressional leadership

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:24.850
which is willing to take on a
lot of interest to get there.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:31.060
Final point that came out
of Ruth's presentation is

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.480
that there are always
unintended consequences

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.850
of whatever legislation
is developed.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:40.610 position:56%
She mentioned that there was a shift

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.880
from national origins
to per-country quotas.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.080
And those per-country quotas after
a certain period of time then led

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.130
to huge backlogs and problems

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:54.590
in having an efficient
system for immigration.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:53:02.100 position:56%
One of the solutions to that, the
one that has not been a part of much

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.410
of the legislative debate is
having more flexible policies

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:10.360
that can be changed
as conditions change,

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:17.870 position:56%
as we have new economic conditions,
new technology, new everything else.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:21.410
Instead we have this
written in concrete

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:24.170
and not change for
decades and decades.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:30.610
The signs I don't think are very
promising today for having any kind

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:34.330
of comprehensive immigration
reform in the near future.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:37.850
Perhaps after the next election,
depending on where it goes.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:42.550
But depending on where it goes it
could be super good or to the bad,

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:47.010
depending on where you're sitting
as to what actually happens.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:50.960
I think incremental changes,
as was true in the '50's

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.600
and other periods, are more likely.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:57.130
But they have to be
carefully tailored

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:59.840
to make the system more effective

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.550
but not become the barrier
themselves to further reform.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.670
That's the more fundamental nature.

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.970
But you know, it did
take 40 years to get rid

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.990
of the national origins quotas.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:19.180
I'm an optimist by nature and
I really hope that the kind

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:24.540
of information that is coming
out of Ruth's project can be used

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:30.560
by policy makers as well as
advocates to press for the type

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.160
of immigration reform
that we need now.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.820
Which ultimately is going to have
to be as fundamental as the reform

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:40.770
in 1965 that she's describing.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.310
Thank you for your work.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Thank you.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:51.040
[ Applause ]

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.520
&gt;&gt; Marta Tienda: So I want
to thank you for inviting me.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.000
I had the privilege of sitting
with Ruth this summer when she was

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.020
in the MUD library of
Princeton University.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.680
So we connected and
talked about the project.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:04.880 position:56%
And it's an honor that you would use
my paper, my presidential address.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:10.120
But you know, the balance is
clearly where I'm taking from you.

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.830
I use all of your reports
for my classes.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:15.900
And they're so clearly
written, so intelligible

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.390
that even my undergraduates
use them and pass them on.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.710
So they're all over Australia.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.010
They're all over.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:24.640
Anybody who shows up and they want
to know US immigration, read this.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.550
And she updates them all the time.

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:31.340
So the rake has -- I
mean I'm in your debt.

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.560
And it's very refreshing to see
that this act that has been written

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.720
about so much will have a
refreshing lens imposed on it,

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.300
which is what you've done.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.360
I didn't know about the
Caribbean blacks bee

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.170
and the basis for the ceiling.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:47.880
So that was a new one.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:52.120
And this framing of fairness
is really an important lens

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.570
for thinking not only of
the past, but of the future.

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:59.200
Because that future we can't see
yet, any more than the framers

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.900
of this legislation could
anticipate the future

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.000
in which these consequences are
playing out, intended or not.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.160
And so there are many critics of
the broken immigration system,

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.450
and they point out these
unintended consequences

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.150
to pick up where you left off.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.660
And I was a piece of that.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.590
It was not going to
change the racial mix.

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:22.070
Well, it sure did.

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:25.130
It won't displace US
workers, and we made sure

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.390
by restricting the unskilled visas.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:28.980
Except that there's a back door

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.070
and human ingenuity
always trumps legislation.

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:34.000
It won't raise the level.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.800
Well, yes, if you think
it's a linear process.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.200
But by design, by design,

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.460
the legislation was actually
designed to have a multiplier.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.650 position:56%
Immigration is not a linear process.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.810
You could set the ceilings,
but when you're allowing --

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:55.090
or you change it with family
reunification, families don't come

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:57.260
in packages of one or two.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.950
They come in multiple packages.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:02.960 position:56%
So one could argue that in many ways
the legislation did exactly what it

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.430
was supposed to do.

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:08.380
We made family reunification,
put our values on the table.

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.680
Civil Rights.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.100
You cast this in the
context of the Civil Rights.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.010
We were hoping not to be racist.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.190
So that context turns out
to be really important

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.940
about what was acceptable
at the time.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.580
So family reunification
is actually working.

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.170
Two-thirds of our admissions
are family-based immigrants,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:27.280
whether they're within
cap or out of cap.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.340
That's just the opposite of what
happened in Australia or Canada.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.470
They deliberately made sure
when it was going toward family,

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.780
they deliberately changed
their policies

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.670
so that they would have had
the skill mix and be two-thirds

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:42.470
and the other be one-third.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.170
Because they were going
in the same direction.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:47.230
So they took legislative acts
and we can learn from them,

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.530
because they learned from us.

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.830
And they said, "Oh, we
don't want to do this.

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:51.130
We're going to fix it."

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.430
And they did.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:53.730
They didn't fight.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.030 position:56%
I mean, it wasn't easy there either.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.430
But I just published a paper
-- well it just got accepted.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.740
I've done a couple of
them that focus a bit

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.160
on the unintended consequences.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.860
One that's just going

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.070
to be forthcoming is called
Multiplying Diversity.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.810
And what I've done is actually
compute the immigration multipliers

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:13.040
by the family categories
to show why it is

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.470
that the Asians surpassed
the Latin Americans.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.260
Not recently, as many people write,

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.250
but actually much before
the Immigration Reform

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:24.990
and Control Act allowed
the legalization program.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:29.080
But the Asian multiplier
took off big time.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.760
But it was by design.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.170
You could argue that
it was by design.

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.470
They didn't expect it.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:38.400
They were thinking linear,
but they crafted multiplier.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.480
So they did not anticipate how many
people were going to naturalize.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.070
If you made citizenship a
requirement to sponsor relatives,

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:48.730
well how do you become a citizen?

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.310
You naturalize.

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:52.720
Bring in immigrants, let them
naturalize and then they bring

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.170
in their relatives, right?

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.140
So you could put caps
on certain categories.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:59.230
We did. But that didn't stop
the uncapped categories.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.610 position:56%
And those uncapped categories turned
out to be a really important driver,

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:04.800
but also the family caps.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.630
So this expansion, I've
written about the expansion

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:10.900
of the definition of
immediate family relatives

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.100
that you highlighted in your
presentation to include parents.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.740
I mean, who's against grandparents?

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.960
You want to bring them in to
take care of your children.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.610
That's what they told me
when I was presenting some

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.330
of these materials early
on at the PA meeting.

00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:27.230
And I said, "You know, one of
the unintended consequences --

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.040
we wanted to reunite family.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.340
That was a design.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.720
But the default has
been that we have a rise

00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.080
in late-age immigration."

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.800
We want immigrants to
be in the labor force,

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.840
but the share that are ages 50
and over has increased from 11%

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.320
in 1980 to I think it's 17% now.

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.620
That's a big change.

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.370
You say, "Well, 17%
ages 50 and over.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:53.240
At 50 you still have a
lot of working life."

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.740
Maybe. You have to learn English.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.470
You have to see if
you can be certified.

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.650
You have to see if you can earn
your social security credits.

00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.950
We move on.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.640
So this is an issue.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.530
This linear extrapolation
was an oversight.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.270
I don't think that
they had anticipated,

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.230
and you mentioned that
in your address.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.530
So how does it matter?

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:13.420
Well, Congress did legislate
this, but recall 1965 --

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.090
what else was going on
besides the Civil Rights Act?

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:18.110
We were in a great mood.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.060
We were reeling from the baby boom.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.460
That would be moi.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.530
So the Congress was really from the
baby boom, and schools and states

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:30.490
and localities were all fussing
about these classrooms of 36.

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:33.650
We weren't worried
about population aging.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:39.040
So we modified Social Security Act
to create Medicare and Medicaid.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.930
Today, 50 years later we're not
saying, "Ooh, wait a minute.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.060
We've got to think
this through again."

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:49.490
So at the time, at the time it made
sense, but it was done in a way

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.070
that has not been modified.

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.000
And these unintended consequences

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.160
which were not intended
continue to play out.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.740
So times have changed.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.420
The world has changed.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.380
The desired sending
countries, they didn't pan

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.080 position:56%
out from the very beginning because
of the Martial Act and other changes

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.890
that were taking place in
Europe in the postwar period.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.170
They've aged even faster
than the United States.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.950
So they're not going to be
coming here any time soon.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.490
We have aged as a nation
less quickly

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.870
than our other OECD competitors,
thanks to immigration,

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:23.820
because the immigrants
are having children

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.350
and they had higher fertility.

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:27.340
So that's kept us a little younger.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.540
It's intensified our
diversification.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.350
So if we're all over
the diversity issue,

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:35.080
well that's a program
that's already in process.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.960
And that's not going to
change any time soon.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.450
So there's a glaring age
divide also in the world

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:46.630
with the southern nations are very
young and they're growing rapidly.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:49.280
Some of them have still
very high fertility.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.570
The north is aging quite rapidly.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:54.720
So these are the facts.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.430
So future immigration
is not going to come

01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:57.850
from our former sending countries

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.070
and it never did really
when we expected.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.300
Spain, Italy and Germany, they're
now countries of immigration

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.280
and they've had this really
rapid turnaround from sending

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.220
to being receivers of immigration.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.090
So if we're going to have
immigration, let's face it,

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:16.490
it's going to come mainly from
Asia and Africa, Latin America.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.550
But Latin American
fertility has slowed.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.350
Mexican immigration
today is net zero.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:23.740
It has been for several years.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.050
And a lot of people find
that really hard to believe

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:28.570
because they're looking
in the rearview mirror.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.550
We should tell our politicians
when they open their mouths

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:36.150
to look forward and not in
yesterday's projections.

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:38.520
So demography is not destiny.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.540
That is certainly not
the position I take.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.840
But it's highly relevant

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.730
for understanding the future
contours of our immigration.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:47.430
And the question is, will
those contours result

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.140
from deliberate rational
policy decision making?

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.380
Which Susan and I haven't
lost hope for and I won't,

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.720
as long as I'm still writing.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.730
Or the default of a failure to act?

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.670
The default of a failure to act.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:04.130
Not to decide is to decide.

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:08.190
So what I asked my students when
I teach as a policy exercise,

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:13.470
I love this Legomsky paper
called Immigration from Scratch.

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:17.350 position:56%
And I tell them from the outset that
all sovereign nations have the right

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:22.850
to decide who to admit, how many,
when and under what auspices.

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:25.380
The balance of family,
humanitarian and skills.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.130
Every nation has that as sovereign.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.790
That's what national
boundaries are for.

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.940
So they exist and that's
why we have immigration.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.270
That said, abiding by international
conventions for refugees,

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:39.320
which is always still
a dicey challenge.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.430
So that said, given
your lens of fairness,

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.730
how will fairness then
play out in the future?

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.620
If 50 years from now
we wanted to project

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.740
and have your protégé looking back
and doing the same Kluge lecture,

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.650 position:56%
what would they say 50 years from
now about fairness and our adherence

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:07.550
to our democratic ideals through
immigration, through inclusion.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:12.260
We can either harness and
manage immigration by design,

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.010
as we have tried to do, and
it's a very difficult one

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.100
when you're dealing
with human ingenuity

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.600
and moral and ideological issues.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:25.380
Broadening the front door,
strategically, deliberately.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.170 position:56%
Acknowledging the current realities.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:30.930
Or are we going to manage it by
default and allowing the back door

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:33.900
to swing back and forth and going
in a circle the way we're doing?

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.100
That's to do nothing, to be frozen.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.350
And not to decide is to decide.

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:43.470
So proactive versus incremental
reactive, which is what we've done

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:46.800
with little legislation and raising
the ceiling on temporary workers

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.620
and raising the caps here and there

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.680
without doing the fundamental
questioning of what is it

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.500
that we're expecting from
our immigration policy?

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.650
And I will go with one
final thought about the need

01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:00.810 position:56%
to also consider integration policy.

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:04.080
I am on the National
Academy Panel on Fiscal

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.370 position:56%
and Economic Impacts of Immigration.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.270
But the twin panel is on
immigrant integration.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:12.000
It shows that immigrants
are integrating,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.670
but we could do a much better job

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.990
and really harness the immigration
dividend going forward instead

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:19.400
of having the default option

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.960
and sub-optimally let immigrants
contribute to this great nation.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.510
Thank you.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:33.100
[ Applause ]

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.670
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: I want to
add a little bit more just

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.410
for clarification and understanding

01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:42.760
about how the Civil
Rights legislation

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.370
and the Civil Rights movement
affected immigration reform.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:51.640
And in part, in response
to Susan's comment.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:57.090
Because the Civil Rights
movement heightened the conscious

01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:00.210
of Americans about racism.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.510
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: Exactly.

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.620
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And a lot of --

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:08.670
and I read some of the quotes of
the people who were the defenders

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:13.900
of the status quo that
used racist rhetoric.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:19.540
And by doing that, they really kind
of forced out some of the people

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:26.360 position:56%
that Susan referred to who would
have wanted to moderate immigration.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.570
But they didn't want to be
associated with these other people.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.710
And this was true in both parties.

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:40.400
People that would have been
kind of more moderate or middle

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:48.360
of the road went over to doing
the reform because of the rhetoric

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:54.650
of racism that became pervasive in
the debate over national origins.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.190
So it's not that everybody
was racist.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:00.350
That was probably a small portion.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:05.170
And I think that some of the people
used to rally their base, frankly.

01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:11.260
I'm not sure in the 1920's and
the 1950's and in the '60's.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:19.220
Some of the people that used that
rhetoric clearly were doing it

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.060
to rally their supporters.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:28.940 position:56%
Now the bad public opinion data that
I only touched on kind of flew back

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.570
in their face, because by
the time the '65 act passed

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.100
when they did a survey in December

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.150
of '65 it was overwhelmingly
popular.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:41.430
Everybody jumped on the
bandwagon after the fact.

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:45.970
But I think it really had to
do with the behavior of some

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:51.190
of the key groups that were against
changing the law that forced --

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.690
that really kind of
helped reform it.

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.580
Because nobody wanted to
be associated with it.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.020
Or few people did.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: Yep.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.110
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: We have
some questions.

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.850
Diane, hi.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:10.470
This has been wonderful and thank
you for the comments as well.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:11.770
My question is this.

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:16.420
I've been holding a thought
that I haven't heard you say

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.460
and I may have missed it, but I
thought it was pretty important.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:25.950
I thought that in passing the
1965 act there was an important,

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:29.400
like a compromise that ironically
by today's standards came

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.780
from those status quo people

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:38.570 position:56%
who favored the family reunification
feature as a way to pass the bill.

01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:42.060
I mean, the other people
wanted them to pass it.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.620
But they favored family
reunification as a way of slowing

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.370
down the change in the
demography of our country.

01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:49.670
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Yes.

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.840
That was certainly -- the Wall
Street Journal actually said,

01:08:52.840 --> 01:09:00.490
"We will preserve the makeup,
the racial mix of the countries

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.240
through family reunification."

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.540
These guys weren't demographers.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.130
They were attorneys.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:10.910
And they -- in the Wall Street
Journal I found it in the notes

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.380
of a lot of the members
that were working on it.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:19.410
They thought it was one of the
ways to perpetuate the makeup.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:23.580
They were more worried about
expanding employment base

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:28.130
and running the risk of
opening it up to the world.

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.250
So yes, you're absolutely
right, Diane.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.550
&gt;&gt; But the big miscalculation
was underestimating the

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.210
family multipliers.

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:39.340
So here's the deal: they
thought we had restricted

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.390
with the Asian Exclusion Act that
was renewed and renewed and renewed

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:46.630
until finally the small
one, the Asian triangle,

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:48.800
the Asian Pacific triangle,
was left in place.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.390
And they thought, "Well that's
just going to generate like 5,000

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:53.850
and then there will be no more."

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:58.310 position:56%
They totally miscalculated something
that the employment categories.

01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:02.640
They were expecting German
doctors and English engineers

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.050
or whatever, German engineers.

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:09.720
But they got Asian doctors
and engineers, et cetera.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.830
And the problem is when you
bring somebody of high skill,

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:16.660
the probability of
naturalizing is much higher.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.870
So the skill categories, the
Asian influx was slow at first.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.570 position:56%
It came through those two employment
categories that were lower

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.090
in the preference system.

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:30.540
But they had the fastest,
highest migration multiplier.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.410
So it's the multiplier
through those two categories

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:36.590
that actually generated
that huge spurt

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.640
and then it could continue
to multiply.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.790
Add to that other events
like Tiananmen Square

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:43.650
where we make exceptions and
we bring in a few extra here

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:47.450
and a few extra there, and
you have a huge potential.

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:49.070
And that's what's happened
with the Asian complex.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.370
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Yeah,
except it's very interesting

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:54.390
that Congress didn't seem to be
looking at what was happening

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:57.960
in Europe when they
made these calculations.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.420
I mean, western Europe
had established all sorts

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.430
of guest worker programs because
they didn't have enough workers.

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:09.280
Southern Europeans could easily
stay in Europe and do work

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.650
because they had all
of these openings.

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:13.970
And Eastern Europe was
behind the Iron Curtain.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.270
They couldn't get out.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.040
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's exactly right.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.300
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And so going
through a thought process --

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:24.980
by 1965 it was really unlikely

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:28.330
after the displaced
persons had been admitted,

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.410
that there was literally
no one from Europe

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.210
that was going to need to migrate.

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:38.150
That it would only be
migration by choice.

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:44.200
But also adding to what Marta
said was that part of our policies

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:51.100
in the 1960's and to the '70's
were having Fullbright scholars,

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.930
foreign students coming
in from Asia.

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:54.230
&gt;&gt; Marta Tienda: Exactly.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:57.600
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And so that
became the draw for --

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.910
not only were we bringing in high
skilled, but we were training them

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:06.900
to stay in the country on that and
creating a totally different --

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.000
also in '64 the Bracero
program ended.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.250
So the legal migration from
Mexico, which had been accompanied

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:20.060
by very high levels of undocumented
migration for most of that period,

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:25.900 position:56%
but that combination of things also
meant that there would be a new push

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:30.770
for the western hemispheric
migration to increase.

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:34.950
Because the permanent system
became the only route in.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.090
And there was enough
family reunification

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.090
to get that started as well.

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:43.110
So I think it was a
lot of miscalculations,

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.360
some of which were not foreseeable.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.920
Others of which were the result
of US policies and other areas.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.220
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: Exactly.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.520
Cuba and et cetera.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And
even though the act,

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.710
and I mention it was
only 12 pages long,

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.120
which by today's standards
is unheard of.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:04.810 position:56%
That a 200-plus page bill would be
reduced down to 12 pages is amazing.

01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:06.110
&gt;&gt; Yep.

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: But they left
out a lot of other things.

01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:11.820
It was another 15 years before
they did the Refugee Act.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.610
&gt;&gt; Right. We had signed.

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:19.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And it was another 25
years before they dealt with a lot

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:23.290
of the grounds for admissibility
and some of the other issues.

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:27.090
So it wasn't like they
did everything in '65.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.750
But they did the key thing
that changed legal flows.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:36.280
They also -- and again you talk
about not thinking about Europe.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.010
The woman who was the head
of immigration statistics

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:44.440
at INS testified in
'63 I believe about --

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.320
she pointed out that the largest
number of skilled immigrants

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.440
that were coming to the
United States were coming

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.600
from the Western Hemisphere.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.000
They were Canadians.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.310
We weren't getting skilled
workers from Europe.

01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:01.390
They were the non-preference people
that were qualifying for visas

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.700
that were coming from
northern Europe.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:08.850
Our high skilled immigration was
already coming from this hemisphere

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:11.430
and in some adjustments
coming from Asia.

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:15.360
I think there are some
more questions.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:17.900
Julie, hi.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.850
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much.

01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:21.150
Splendid talk.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:23.240
And thank you for the
commentaries also.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.540 position:56%
I wondered what you thought about --

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.960
this kind of builds on what
you've just been getting

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.920
into with the ending
of the Bracero program.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.190
May Nigh argues in her book
that part of the problem

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:39.090
with the 1965 act was that it
was trying so hard to be fair

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:42.690
in principle, but it failed to take

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:45.930
into account the historic
relationship

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:50.030
between the United States and
certain countries, say Mexico.

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:53.200
Which had had through the Bracero
program and through the need

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.830
for labor, millions of
workers crossing the border.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:02.920
And by putting such an affair,
equal but a very low limit

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.260
on Mexican immigrants,
that in fact it lead

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.670
to this you know historic
rise in more

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:11.540
and more undocumented immigration.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.450
And thus created real tensions
and problems in the relationship

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:18.150
between the two countries.

01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:22.820
I wonder if in your work you're
dealing with issues like that.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:26.540
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: I've taken a
good long look at how the act

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:31.250
and then the subsequent capping
and putting the western hemisphere

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:34.590
under the preference
system has played out.

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:41.150
And I don't think it was as much
-- and I want my colleagues up here

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:44.360
to weigh in with alternative
perspectives.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.640
But I think the end of the
Bracero might have created

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.240
unauthorized migration.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.710
But the '65 act, and I
presented a slide that shows it,

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:59.630
it shifted Mexican migration away
from who an employer would sign off

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:03.450
to come in through western
hemisphere, into family-based.

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:08.090
But the numbers stayed
at the same level.

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:10.760
And when you look at the role

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:13.670
of family-based, how
it shifted the flow.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:19.150
But the argument that it
limited them that much,

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:24.330
I think it's really
more Bracero, the loss.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:28.870
And this is where the
unintended consequence

01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:33.570
of two important policy changes
happening virtually simultaneously.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.740
The Bracero program, for
those of you that don't know,

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:40.520
was a temporary worker
program that we had with Mexico

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.260 position:56%
for agricultural workers to come in.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:47.060
And it had been highly
controversial for a long time.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:51.850
And efforts to reform it to not be
as exploitative of both the workers

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:55.130
who were brought in from Mexico
as well as the domestic supply

01:16:55.130 --> 01:17:00.410
of migrant workers, there were
always efforts to reform it.

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.970
It was ultimately ended in '64.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.970
But one of the key things
that was part of that,

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:10.230
if you look at a very young Henry
Gonzalez who was a new congressman

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:15.310
from Texas, or Ed Roybal who was
a new congressman from California,

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:24.050
who had both been very active
in the movement of Latinos

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.220
in the labor movement and kind

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:29.720
of the growing Latino
Civil Rights movement.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.360
They wanted the shift away
from Bracero to a legal flow.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.220
They did not want to
come in as temporary,

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.930
do the job and be sent back.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:42.900
They wanted it to be a
permanent flow on a track

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.500
like every other LPR, to be a
citizen if they chose to be.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:51.860
And that was why I notice -- one
of the reasons I noticed a shift.

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.720
Because the western
hemisphere exemption

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.240
in the 1920's was supported
by the south.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.880
And the south supported Bracero.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.870 position:56%
By the time we got to '65, it wasn't
-- and even in the '50's, Phil Hart

01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:07.510
and Emanuel Celler who I think

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:10.100
by anyone's standards would
be considered liberal,

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.200
they had put the western hemisphere
under the worldwide ceiling.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.340
There was a flip, and I'm
still trying to understand it.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:24.170
But part of it was, "Let's end
the temporary exploitative flows.

01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:26.780
Let's create a permanent flow."

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:30.100
And also in terms of why
the south pulled away,

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.660
I think it was the mechanization
of cotton and sugar cane

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.990
that dramatically affected
the desire of the south

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:41.420 position:56%
to have unlimited workers coming in.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.770
So it was largely the --

01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:45.310
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: It was
much slower in Texas.

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:46.930
They had the citrus industry.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:48.230
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Yes, yes.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:49.530
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: They
had cotton still.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:50.830
I mean, I'm from Texas, y'all.

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:54.770
So it took a longer period of time
for that type of mechanization.

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:57.130
But remember the Bracero
program had two pieces.

01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:59.260
The first part, Texas
was not allowed

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.650
to participate in the first half.

01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:04.600
1945-48, that was World
War II, labor shortages.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.040
And then they had a hiatus, but
they continued it informally.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:14.290
And the demand, the taste for
having this cheap, pliable,

01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:17.640
no-regulation labor force
got to be really good.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.900
The appetite for that kind of
labor force became really high

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.200
in California and Texas.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.110 position:56%
So everybody was doing it like we do
today with unauthorized immigration.

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:26.520
We turn a blind eye.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.880
And so that was going
on for a long time.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.390
For the second, for the renewal,
the impetus for the public life

01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:35.190
in '78 was for the Korean conflict.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:39.330
In between those two
formal bills was the peak

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.590
of Braceros coming to the US.

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:45.160
It had temporarily ended.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.200
Texas was allowed to
participate the second round

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.620
because they had the
Texas Proviso, right?

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.110
And that's where we wrote into our
legislation that it was a felony

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:58.300
to be in a country,
but it was not a --

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.270
it was a felony to
transport to harbor,

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:05.020
to do everything except
purposes of employment.

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.750
So we had la viva la contratoin
in our legislation written

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.590
that made it okay for employers

01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:16.420
to hire unauthorized immigrants
alongside the Bracero program

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.530
which made the exploitation
of the Bracero program --

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:20.830
there were several incidents
in California that led to this.

01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:23.220
They said, "We've had enough."

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:27.900
So we had these two, the formal
and informal guest worker program.

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.520 position:56%
Which is kind of what we have today,

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.990
except that the fertility
in Mexico has declined.

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:36.490
The demand for the supply of
extra workers has been shrinking.

01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:39.280
So this is a window of
opportunity starting to close.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.170
And we haven't figured
out how we want

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.460
to handle low-skill
workers in our country.

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.320
Which is really the bottom line.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:50.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: And to follow up your
point, I did a role call analysis

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.170
of support for the Bracero program,
which was the same Congress --

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:54.860
the legislation you were referring

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.550
to that passed the '52
act, and it was identical.

01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:01.880
The people that supported
Bracero also supported national

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.180
origin quotas.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.500
It was temporary.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.800
Yeah?

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.240
&gt;&gt; I think he has a question.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.590
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: One more question.

01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:15.890
Right here.

01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:17.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ruth.

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:19.340
I found this to be a very,
very stimulating discussion.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:25.680 position:56%
My question has to do with what your
views are on using amnesty as a way

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.930
to bridge you know, some of the
shortcomings of the legislation.

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:34.020
And perhaps including
also adjustments

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.990
in the caps in the quotas.

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:37.290
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: One of
the things that struck me

01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:44.190
in my research was how frequently
in the past there were provisions.

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:46.450 position:56%
Some called the registry provisions.

01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:49.960
Others were just -- they
just adjusted people,

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.400
that today we would call
amnesty or legalization

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.140
and it would be big news.

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.050
But it happened all
through the '50's.

01:21:57.050 --> 01:22:01.640
And even Congressman Walter
of McCarran-Walter sponsored.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.350
You know, when I mentioned
some of the incremental bills,

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:08.430 position:56%
one of them was an outright
legalization of certain populations.

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:10.800
And you could just
come in and register.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.400
So those kinds of things weren't

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.510
as controversial back
then as they are today.

01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:19.730
And I would love to
hear from my colleagues

01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:23.360
because I don't think
illegal presence was

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.380
as stigmatized back then.

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.890
Nor was it an illegal
concept then to be

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:31.480 position:56%
in the United States without status.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.840
&gt;&gt; Marta Tienda: The
amnesty gets a lot of play

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.800
when it's seen as a
national activity.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.100
We've been doing it.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.780
Congress has been doing
amnesties ever since '86.

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.080
They do it on a rolling basis.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.330
Nacara. They've done this
population, that, so they do this.

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:50.350 position:56%
There are all these little ones that
are done by congressional decision,

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:51.650
but most people don't hear about it

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:56.110
because it's not an
amnesty like a big amnesty.

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:58.020
Therefore they're little
secrete amnesties.

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.620
Those little amnesties
have added up to hundreds

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.180
of thousands to date, since 1986.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.480
But because each one
is not like yes or no,

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.360
the whole everybody who's here,

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.410
it's a series of small
incremental changes.

01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:16.290
Of course the federal
government got sued

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:21.070
for not handling systematically
the temporary protected status

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:24.140
of individuals who were here

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.050
as temporary workers,
refugees, et cetera.

01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:29.800
And they kept extending it.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:35.340
So they were systematically
allowing the Nicaraguans,

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.790 position:56%
but not allowing the Guatemalans
and the Central Americans to qualify

01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:40.890
under the same conditions
until they were sued.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:45.330
Then they did retroactive
amnesty for many of them.

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:47.240
But if we just go through,
there's a really nice paper

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.920
by the Migration Policy Institute

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.450
that documents how many
have been amnestied since.

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:56.270 position:56%
I don't share the view of the author

01:23:56.270 --> 01:24:00.940
that it's greater than
the '86 amnesty.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.950
It's not, but that's the claim.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.860
But there have been
additional rolling additions

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:11.910
to the initial amnesty where people
are grandfathered es post facto.

01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:14.200
But we're doing amnesty
all the time.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.570
We're just not drumrolling it.

01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:18.680
And it's the drumrolling
it in today's media

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.870
and highly polarized environment
that Susan was talking about,

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:24.820
that makes it seem like it's
out of line and out of course

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.120
and like it's not what we're doing.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.460
They're doing it all the time.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.760
&gt;&gt; Ruth Wasem: Yeah.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.460
And getting I think to the
fundamentals of what you're asking,

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.560
if you think about
fairness and equities

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.630
as being what should drive
immigration policy, then it's hard

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:46.560
to justify a situation where
11 million people are outside

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.830
of that frame work and have
no ability to gain access

01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:57.330 position:56%
to legal status and/or an underclass
in a society which is built

01:24:57.330 --> 01:25:01.800
around bringing -- or should
be built around bringing people

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.740
into the society rather
than excluding them.

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.650
While often exploiting their labor.

01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:10.840
And so I think the country
at some point has to realize

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.440
that it can't have its
cake and eat it too.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.160
That in fact this dependence
and you know,

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:23.150 position:56%
kind of love of your own
undocumented gardener or housekeeper

01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:28.470
or you have a person working in the
Chinese restaurant that you go to

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:32.850
or order from is fine, as long as
they're out of sight, out of mind

01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:36.600
and not legally here and
becoming part of our society.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.860
And I think, I want
to say one more thing

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.640
and then I'll let him shut us down.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.520
And that is building
on the fairness, yes,

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.340
there is the fairness question

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.510
of how we treat unauthorized
aliens who are currently here.

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:53.310
But we also have -- and I'm
looking at my colleague William --

01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:59.360
we have 4 million approved
petitions of relatives

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.340
who are waiting to come in.

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.800
And they're waiting, and
how gets to go first?

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.540
Who gets the green card first?

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:08.980
What is fair?

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.720
The brother and sister?

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.340
Because we've put that
in the priorities.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:16.640
And the parents, the people
that are waiting to come in,

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.300
what is the fairest way to do this?

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:22.250
And I think that these are
pretty tough questions.

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.030
&gt;&gt; Susan Martin: And they're aging
in place while they're waiting.

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:27.050

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:28.350

&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: This is a
conversation that we can keep going

01:26:29.650 --> 01:26:31.340
for much longer than
we have this afternoon.

you would, please join me again

in recognizing and thanking
Ruth for her work today,

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:56.050
her work over the past year and
for her successful completion

01:26:56.050 --> 01:27:01.510
of a Kluge staff fellowship
for 2014-2015.
