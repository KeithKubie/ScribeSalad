00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Voiceover] So, let's
see if we can figure out

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.868
what the limit as X approaches infinity

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:07.320
of cosine of X over X
squared minus one is.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.736
And like always, pause this video

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:11.879
and see if you can work
it out on your own.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.578
Well, there's a couple
of ways to tackle this.

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:16.631
You could just reason
through this and say,

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:19.777
"Well, look this numerator,
right over here, cosine of X,

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:22.328
"that's just going to oscillate between

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:23.497
"negative one and one."

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:27.604
Cosine of X is going to
be greater than or equal

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.793
to negative one, or negative
at one is less than or equal

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:32.450
to cosine of X which is
less than or equal to one.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.107
So, this numerator just oscillates

00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:36.403
between negative one and one as X changes,

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.454
as X increases in this case.

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:40.710
While the denominator
here, we have an X squared,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.132
so as we get larger and larger X values,

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:46.575
this is just going to become
very, very, very large.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:47.927
So, we're going to have something bounded

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:50.141
between negative one and one divided

00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.173
by very, very infinitely large numbers.

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:57.556
And so, if you take a, you
could say, bounded numerator

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.977
and you divide that
infinitely large denominator,

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:02.274
well, that's going to approach zero.

00:01:02.274 --> 00:01:04.200
So, that's one way you
could think about it.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.660
Another way is to make this same argument,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.534
but to do it in a little
bit more of a mathy way.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:13.473
Because cosine is bounded in this way,

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.806
we can say that cosine of X

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:20.493
over X squared minus one

00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:23.671
is less than or equal to.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:27.906
Well, the most that this
numerator can ever be is one,

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.302
so it's going to be less
than or equal to one

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:32.385
over X squared minus one.

00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:36.418
And it's going to be a
greater than or equal to,

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:37.654
it's going to be greater than or equal to,

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:40.319
well, the least that this
numerator can ever be

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.055
is going to be negative one.

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.555
So, negative one over X squared minus one.

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:48.822
And once again, I'm just saying,

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:51.198
look, cosine of X, at most, can be one

00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.621
and at least is going to be negative one.

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:56.408
So, this is going to be true for all X.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:00.052
And so, we can say that also the limit,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.563
the limit as X approaches infinity of this

00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:06.228
is going to be true for all X.

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:09.262
So, limit as X approaches infinity.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.845
Limit as X approaches infinity.

00:02:12.907 --> 00:02:15.201
Now, this here, you could
just make the argument,

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.374
look the top is constant.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:19.956
The bottom just becomes infinitely large

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:22.910
so that this is going to approach zero.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.054
So, this is going to be
zero is less than or equal

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:29.137
to the limit as X approaches infinity

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:33.355
of cosine X over X squared minus one

00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:36.545
which is less than or equal to.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.213
Well, this is also going to go to zero.

00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:42.534
You have a constant numerator,
an unbounded denominator.

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.663
This denominator's
going to go to infinity,

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.450
and so, this is going to be zero as well.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.363
So, if our limit is
going to be between zero.

00:02:50.363 --> 00:02:52.907
If zero is less than
or equal to our limit,

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:54.425
is less than or equal to zero,

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:56.151
well then, this right over here

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.151
has to be equal to zero.
