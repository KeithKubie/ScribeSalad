00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.160
Only by comparing the SNVs with the third option here do we achieve an IBS

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.298
score of 50%. So this is the only right answer here. So how did we figure

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:15.191
this out? Let's take a look at the first SNV. GC, CC. There's a

00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:20.495
0.5 match. 50%, right? TG, TG is a 100%

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:25.575
match, GG, AG is a 50% match, and TT, AA is

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:30.604
a 0% match. If we average this, 0.5 plus 1 plus 0.5 is

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:35.611
2, and we divide it by the total number, which is 4. 2 over 4 is

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:40.688
one half, or 0.5, or 50%. Now, let's look at the

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:45.782
first option. GC, CC is 0.5, 0.5, 0, and then

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:51.264
0.5. This gives us 37.5%. So that's not right.

00:00:51.264 --> 00:00:56.336
The second answer is low, only 25%. We have two SNVs that have a half match and

00:00:56.336 --> 00:01:01.590
two SNVs that have no match at all. And the last answer is even lower,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.706
at only 12.5%. Only one allele in one SNV matches,

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:11.871
at 50%. So the average is 12.5%
