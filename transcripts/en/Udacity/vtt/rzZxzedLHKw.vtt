00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.320
Here's what we ended up with.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.450
Log shows you a list of commits so you can say that it operates on commits.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.460
You could also say that commits are a part of log, so

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.630
if that was your first thought, that's also valid.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.540
This way just stays a little more consistent with

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.370
the way we've been constructing the map so far.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.540
You could also make an argument for connecting directly with repository as well

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.250
since log shows commits in a particular repository.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.200
But this way, the map just stays a little bit cleaner and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.845
the two are still connected through the commit node.
