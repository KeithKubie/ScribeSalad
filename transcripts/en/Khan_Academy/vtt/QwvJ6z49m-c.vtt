00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.310
In the last video, we
gave a basic outline

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.310
of the different scenarios
that might play out in 2013.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.670
Or at least the different
budgetary proposals

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.750
on the table from
the administration,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.570
from the Republicans,
and what will

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450
happen if they don't
come into agreement,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.730
which was the fiscal cliff.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.510
Which is this fairly
unusual situation

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.700
where the both parties
to the negotiation

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.850
set up this thing that
will automatically

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.410
happen at the beginning of 2013.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.730
That it would be painful
for both parties,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.770
and the thinking
being that it'll

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.590
force them to come, maybe,
to some type of an agreement

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.450
sooner than later.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.610
The fiscal cliff is what
neither the Republicans

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.070
or the administration want
because it raises taxes, which

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.680
the Republicans don't want,
and, it reduces spending,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.350
which the president
doesn't want.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.976
And the core argument, and we
touched it on the last video

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.600
and we'll go in more
depth in this one,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.330
is just as we're
beginning to recover

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.790
from our last
recession, it might not

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.360
be useful for our economy to
try to suck out $1/2 trillion.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.970
So let's think about the
different issues at play.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.599
So right over here,
we have some charts.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.890
Most of these are from the
Congressional Budget Office.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.220
And there's a bunch of
assumptions that go into this.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.270
And there many people
will debate the assumption

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.000
that they make.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.900
But they at least directionally
show the right things.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.650
So this right over
here, this first chart,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.940
compares deficits or surpluses.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.370
And really, ever
since the early 2000s,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.610
we've been running deficits.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.140
And as we got into
the late, I guess,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.610
'10s, or 2008, 2010
timeframe, 2009 timeframe.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.760
As we went into a
financial crisis.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.280
When the economy
contracts, you get

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.110
hit in two ways when you
think about deficit spending.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.290
On one end, you bring
in less revenues.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660
The economy is shrinking.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.150
And on the other end,
you have to spend more.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.733
You have to give
people more benefits.

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:51.900
More unemployment benefits.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900
Things like that.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.670
So whenever you see the
economy shrink, you will see,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.920
naturally, all other
things being equal,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.460
you will see deficits increase.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.830
And that's what you
saw right over here.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.246
And on top of that,
the government

00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:07.180
is trying to bail things out as
doing stimulus spending and all

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.550
that in order to minimize
the effect of the deficit.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.840
And that's why you see
here in 2008, 2009,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.020
we start running
significant deficits.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.940
Now, what's
interesting is what's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.710
going to happen going forward.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.740
And going forward, there's two
of these scenarios right here.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.900
There is the CBO's
baseline projection

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.930
and then there's the
alternative fiscal scenario.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.210
And just to be
clear where we, we

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.550
are entering this phase
right over here in 2013.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.640
And the baseline
projection is essentially

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.020
if the government
takes no more action.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.260
And if the government
takes no more action,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.870
then the fiscal cliff
will be triggered.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.640
We will essentially have $500
billion less in 2013's deficit.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.750
And so what you see here
is that the deficits

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.760
go down dramatically.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.230
We have to borrow less
on an annual basis.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.990
Now, the alternative
to fiscal scenario

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.930
is if we essentially continue--
if we extend our existing

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.940
spending, and if we continue to
extend the Bush era tax cuts,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.250
we go along this path.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.940
And so if you care a lot about
deficits, the fiscal cliff

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.684
scenario, which
is this top line.

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:29.100
This is actually the fiscal--
let me write that in a color

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.090
you can see-- that's actually
the fiscal cliff scenario.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.340
It actually looks pretty good.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.410
Hey, look, we have much, much
lower deficits in that scenario

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.810
than if we were to
continue the tax cuts,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.000
and if we were to
continue the spending.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.960
So there that looks
like, actually,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.300
an argument for
the fiscal cliff.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.491
Now let's look at this.

00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.990
Now, this is-- we're going to
talk about the aggregate debt.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.500
When we say deficit,
we're talking

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.470
about the shortfall
in a given year.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.750
The debt is the aggregate
amount that the government owes.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.810
So this is federal debt
held by the public,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.310
historically and as
projected in CBO's baseline.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.060
And CBO, when they
project, they can only

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.270
do so much in projecting how
good the economy might be,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.250
or how bad it might be.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.950
To a large degree,
they extrapolate

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.310
from where we are right now.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.130
And right over here, you see
debt as a percentage of GDP.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.430
So you could imagine
during World War II,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.560
we had a lot of debt
as a percentage of GDP.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.810
See over here after the
end of World War II,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.660
we start crossing over
100% of GDP as our debt--

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.620
the aggregate amount
that the government owes.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.980
And then it delevered.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.080
And then you see this
rough trend, roughly

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.150
from the early '80s
until now, where

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.240
we've had increasing
aggregate debt.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240
There were some moments in the
late '90s, early 2000s, where

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.250
we took it down-- very,
very, very strong economy.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.500
We started running surpluses.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.580
We started to pay
down some of our debt.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.670
But then we hit back on this
debt increasing trend line.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.870
And once again,
if we continue in

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.400
the alternative fiscal scenario,
which is really continuing

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.370
to do what we do today,
which is extend the tax cuts

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.640
and continue to have roughly
the same level of spending,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.810
you see that the debt only
continues to increase.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.080
In the baseline
projection-- this

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.760
is actually the
fiscal cliff scenario.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.490
This is where no new
legislation has passed.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.350
Those triggers in which the
Bush era tax cuts expire,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.020
and the spending cuts that are
triggered by the fiscal cliff

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.500
scenario hit, we
run lower deficits.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.520
And we actually see that
debt, as a percentage of GDP,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.590
actually starts to go down.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.160
Which is, at least from a
balance sheet prospective,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.164
seems like a good thing.

00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.580
So these first two charts say,
hey maybe this fiscal cliff

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.830
thing isn't so bad.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.760
It will actually
significantly lower

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.060
the deficit on an annual basis.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.352
And as a percentage of GDP,
we will as a country, delever.

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:06.810
Now let's think
about the arguments

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.790
why well, maybe we don't want
to be that aggressive when

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.650
it comes to reducing
our deficit,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.280
or reducing our debt
as a percentage of GDP.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.620
This first chart
right over here is

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.760
the-- we'll read
it right over here.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.122
It's the percent of our
population that is employed.

00:06:26.122 --> 00:06:27.580
And you see right--
so it's a proxy

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.464
for employment or unemployment.

00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:30.880
Or, in this case,
it's employment.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.650
And you see we hit
a major recession

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.984
at the end of end of 2008.

00:06:35.984 --> 00:06:37.650
You saw the percentage
of our population

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.650
that is employed go
down dramatically.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.740
We kind of hit bottom
over here, and we're

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.170
having a shaky-- hopefully,
a shaky recovery right now.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.760
It's not even clear
how good that will be.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.120
But hopefully we're having
a shaky recovery of sorts.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.920
And so just as we're
starting to recover,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.610
it might not be helpful to
take, essentially, $500 billion

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.360
out of the economy in
order to pay down debt.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.420
So the fiscal cliff
scenario might

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.770
make us go back into a
little bit of a lurch.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.850
And most economists
are predicting about

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.450
on the order of 1% slower
growth if the fiscal cliff

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.390
scenario were to hit.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.490
Actually, most
economists-- not 1%,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.610
they're actually expecting
about a 2% hit to the economy

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.120
if the fiscal cliff
scenario would happen.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.570
And rather from going
from 1.7% growth,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.860
we might go to negative--
a slight recession,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.130
slight receding of the economy.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.990
So that's obviously not a good
scenario that we want to be in.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.370
The other chart that I
have right over here,

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.800
these are yields on 10
year treasury notes.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.029
This seems like a very
technical thing to talk about.

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:52.570
But this is essentially
the interest.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.320
One way to think
about it is this

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.778
is the interest
that the government

00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:57.960
is paying when it borrows
money for 10 years.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.570
And one of the main arguments
for paying down debt

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.510
is that, if the government
keeps borrowing money,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.890
it's going to crowd
out other borrowers.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.480
It's going to make
demand for money high.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.880
And maybe the supply will
be more and more scarce.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.400
And interest rates will go up.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.210
So a lot of borrowing could
make interest rates go up.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.470
And then the other
idea is, well,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.880
if there's a lot of just
borrowing and spending going

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.950
on.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.410
And if we don't have a lot
of productive capacity,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.110
it could also lead to inflation.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.400
Or maybe when the
government has a huge debt,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.600
they have an incentive to try
to have inflationary policies.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.309
So that in real terms,
that debt seems to be less.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.679
But when you look
at the debt markets,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.030
and these are market
driven numbers.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.710
The Federal Reserve does
not control 10 year yields.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.110
The Federal Reserve
controls short term yields.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.630
You see that we have
historically low interest

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.380
rates.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.600
So the bond market-- and
there's some very smart people

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.650
who make their living
investing in the bond markets,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.830
one of the biggest markets,
if not the biggest.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.400
It is saying it's really
not worried about deficits.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.290
It's willing to lend
to the US government

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.930
at all time low interest rates.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.500
It's not expecting
any inflation.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.500
If anything, the
bond market is saying

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.000
that the biggest
risk in the economy

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.830
is continued sluggish growth.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.010
The biggest risk in
the economy is maybe

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.670
even some form of deflation.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.880
So this super low bond
yields right over here

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.344
would be an argument
that well, yeah,

00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:32.260
if you believe what the
bond market is saying,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.710
we, one, definitely should not
suck money out of the economy.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.640
And the risks of maintaining
high levels of debt

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.660
might not be as high as some
people are saying-- that you're

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.880
not going to see interest
rates and inflation go

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.280
through the roof tomorrow.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.150
Now, if you ascribe to the
second point of view that,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.630
OK, yes, we should
be responsible.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.000
We should start to at
minimum lower our deficit,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.550
and over time, as a percentage
of GDP, lower our debt.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.550
The other question is,
how do you do that?

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.380
The Republicans would
want to do it mainly

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.570
through spending cuts, while the
Democrats would want to do that

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:14.177
possibly through spending
cuts, but also by letting some

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:15.760
of the tax cuts on
the wealthy expire,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.800
and maybe even adding
some other tax.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.680
And so these two charts inform
some of those positions.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.540
And I'm trying to give as
balanced of an approach

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.400
as I can.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.240
So for a Democrat,
they might look

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.020
at this chart right over here.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.070
And they might say, well,
look, average tax rates

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.880
for the highest
income taxpayers--

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.930
if you look at a
historical basis,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.740
it looks like it's
relatively low.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.580
And a lot of this
comes out of the idea

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.170
that even though
the marginal tax

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.686
rates are higher than
what you see here,

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.560
high income taxpayers--
a lot of their income

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.870
might be from capital
gains, from dividends.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.630
Those are taxed at 15%.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.550
They also might have a more
sophisticated accountants

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.140
who can get them
more deductions.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.059
And so that's why you
have them paying--

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:00.350
and they're getting more
sophisticated as time goes by.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.310
And that's why you see
this trend going down.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.330
And so this could be an
argument, well at least

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.880
relative to historical basis,
that this category of folks

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.170
might be able to
afford to pay more.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.190
There's also another argument
in terms of a stimulus argument,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.065
or how to minimize the
impact on the economy.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.000
So if you have $1 that you
want to somehow stimulate

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.180
the economy with.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.370
Well one, the government
could spend the money.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.030
And there are many
arguments-- very

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.071
good arguments-- why the
government is not always

00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:35.650
the most efficient
spender of money,

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.544
and not always spending
it in the best way.

00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:38.960
But they will
definitely spend it.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.560
So you give it to
the government.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.710
You give to the
government, they'll

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.230
definitely spend
it, and then some.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.580
So they'll definitely
spend that dollar.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.440
At least it will enter
into the economy.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.150
Now, if you give it
to the middle class,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.670
they are also
likely to spend it.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.646
Or, to spend a good chunk of
it-- maybe save a little bit.

00:11:57.646 --> 00:11:59.520
And the argument would
be that if you give it

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.690
to someone who's affluent,
they are likely to save it.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.620
Now, saving is not
always a bad thing.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.420
If you are low on investment,
you need more savers.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.410
If interest rates were
going through the roof

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.170
right over here.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.890
That means that we don't
have enough supply of money.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.390
In which case, it
would make sense

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.540
that we would try
to incent savers.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.330
So if you have a situation
of-- in the late '70s,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.660
where you have inflation
going through the roof.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.810
You want people to
actually invest more.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.310
You want a higher
supply of money.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.270
Makes complete sense
to put more money

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.110
in the hands of people who
are likely to save and invest

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.110
that money.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.230
But here, at least if you
believe the bond market,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.410
it looks like we have
a demand problem.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.880
That it's actually very
cheap to get capital.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.640
If anything, there's a
surplus of capital out there.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.620
But there's not
enough demand in order

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:58.190
for people to get the economy
to run at its potential.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.950
So a Democratic
argument would be,

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.320
look, if we're going
to have this dollar,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.040
the person that
we're best off giving

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.550
it to is the middle class.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.620
Or possibly to some
degree, the government.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.120
Because at least
they will spend it.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.320
It will help stimulate
the economy here,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.310
it will go into
savings, but that

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.590
doesn't seem like what the
government needs right now.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.090
Now, the counter argument that
you might get from someone

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.830
at the right is that, first,
the government is just

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.300
a hugely inefficient
spender of capital.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.630
And there's a lot of
evidence to-- you definitely

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.796
need a government, but they
don't always spend money

00:13:31.796 --> 00:13:34.270
in the most efficient--
and even sometimes it

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.400
leads to levels of corruption.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.360
And often times,
when you do something

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.915
in the name of stimulus,
maybe it might make sense

00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:44.960
to do it in the short term, but
once that program is in place,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.250
it's very hard to
remove that program.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.267
People start to depend on it,
even when you, in theory, you

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:51.600
don't need the stimulus anymore.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.140
It's a very hard to shrink
the size of government.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.450
And there's some
argument for that.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.730
If you look at outlays--
government expenditures

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.230
as a percentage of
GDP-- it does look

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.210
like, on a historical
basis, it is high.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.600
Now, to some degree,
this is due to the fact

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.750
that we have entered into kind
of a major recessionary phase.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.460
You see that in all of
the major recessions,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:22.540
the government gets less revenue
and has to do more outlays.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.320
This happens in every-- well,
I would say in most recessions.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.210
And this happened
in dramatic form,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.450
where we started to
have more outlays.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.720
We had-- actually this point, we
had wars that we were funding.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.010
And we were doing these trillion
dollar stimulus packages.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.690
And we have these
trillion bailouts.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.980
At the same time
that the economy

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.450
was receding right over here.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.920
But just when you
look at this, it

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.150
does look like the
government spending,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.910
as a percentage of GDP,
is at historical highs.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.170
And as we say, as the
arguement would have it,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.740
it's very hard to
get that to shrink,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.310
even when it should
be shrinking.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:05.660
And it's often being deployed
in less than efficient ways.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.620
So I will leave you there.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.610
My intent really is not to
sway you one way or the other.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.660
But to really just hope that
you have good information when

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.544
you think about the issues
surrounding the fiscal cliff.
