00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.930
People often talk about the importance of

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.939
detecting and dealing with outliers in your

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.850
data. But there are many types of

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.320
outliers and anomalies and how your analysis proceeds

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.420
should depend on what type you're dealing

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.920
with. Outliers can have many causes. For

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.940
example, an outlier might be accurate data

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.910
about an extreme case. For example, someone represented

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.040
in your data set might really be tweeting 1,000 times a day. On the other

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.220
hand, sometimes outliers, or anomalies represent bad data,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.620
or the limitations of your data. For example,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.540
what otherwise would be a normal value of a variable might be replaced with an

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.470
extreme value. Or, in other cases, extreme values

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.520
might be replaced with a more normal value.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.590
For example, in a lot of census data or surveys, income information

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.380
is top coded. So individuals with very large incomes have their incomes

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.480
replaced with some other value. Let's get back to Mora's story about perceived

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.470
audience size, and hear about a particular anomaly that popped up there.
