00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] So in
each of these pictures

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.920
we have a different scenario.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.840
We have someone standing at
the edge of a cliff on Earth,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.550
and in this first scenario,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
they are launching a
projectile up into the air.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.980
In this one they're just
throwing it straight out.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.640
They're not throwing it up or
down but just straight out.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.723
And here they're throwing the projectile

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:22.140
at an angle downwards.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.680
And so what we're going
to do in this video

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.080
is think about for each of
these initial velocity vectors,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.930
what would the acceleration versus time,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.530
the velocity versus time,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.930
and the position versus
time graphs look like

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.840
in both the y and the x directions.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.780
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.880
and think about it on your own
or even take out some paper

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.930
and try to solve it
before I work through it.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.210
So let's first think about acceleration

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.200
in the vertical dimension,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.020
acceleration in the y direction.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.550
We're assuming we're on
Earth and we're going

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.890
to ignore air resistance.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.440
We can assume we're in some
type of a laboratory vacuum

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.350
and this person had maybe
an astronaut suit on

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.120
even though they're on Earth.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
What would be the acceleration
in the vertical direction?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.830
Well the acceleration due to
gravity will be downwards,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.670
and it's going to be constant.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.960
We're going to assume
constant acceleration.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.470
So the acceleration is
going to look like this.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.540
And if the magnitude of the acceleration

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.670
due to gravity is g,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.070
we could call this negative g to show

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.470
that it is a downward acceleration.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.570
Once the projectile is let loose,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.800
that's the way it's
going to be accelerated.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.870
Now what about in the x direction?

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.010
Well if we assume no air resistance,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.260
then there's not going
to be any acceleration

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.130
or deceleration in the x direction.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.560
So it's just going to be,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.420
it's just going to stay right at zero

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.210
and it's not going to change.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.550
And what I've just drawn
here is going to be true

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.000
for all three of these scenarios

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.800
because the direction
with which you throw it,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.930
that doesn't somehow affect
the acceleration due to gravity

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.830
once the ball is actually
out of your hands.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.070
So now let's think about velocity.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.320
So what is going to be the
velocity in the y direction

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.173
for this first scenario?

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.780
Well we could take our
initial velocity vector

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.350
that has this velocity at an angle

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.240
and break it up into
its y and x components.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.543
So this would be its y component.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:19.020
We just take the top part of
this vector right over here,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.930
the head of it, and go to the left,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.580
and so that would be the
magnitude of its y component,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.510
and then this would be the
magnitude of its x component.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.410
So the y component, it starts positive,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.610
so it's like that,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.720
but remember our acceleration
is a constant negative.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.000
So our velocity is going to
decrease at a constant rate.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.670
So our velocity in this first scenario

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.960
is going to look something,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.600
is going to look something like that.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.060
Now what about the velocity
in the x direction?

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.440
We see that it starts positive,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.130
so it's going to start positive,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.820
and if we're in a world
with no air resistance,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.610
well then it's just
going to stay positive.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010
Notice we have zero acceleration,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.270
so our velocity is just
going to stay positive.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.140
One of the things to really keep in mind

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.540
when we start doing
two-dimensional projectile motion

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.100
like we're doing right over here

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.140
is once you break down your
vectors into x and y components,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.640
you can treat them
completely independently.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520
That something will
decelerate in the y direction,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.330
but it doesn't mean that
it's going to decelerate

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.130
in the x direction.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.450
Now what would the velocities look like

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.990
for this blue scenario?

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.690
Well our velocity in our y direction,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.610
we start off with no
velocity in our y direction

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.940
so it's going to be right over here.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.380
But then we are going to
be accelerated downward,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.150
so our velocity is going
to get more and more

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.690
and more negative as time passes.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.750
And notice the slope on
these two lines are the same

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.490
because the rate of
acceleration is the same,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.310
even though you had a
different starting point.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.860
Now what about the velocity
in the x direction here?

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.770
It looks like this x initial velocity

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.240
is a little bit more than this one,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.890
so maybe it's a little bit higher,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.353
but it stays constant once again.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.610
Now let's look at this third scenario.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.090
In this third scenario,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.940
what is our y velocity,
our initial y velocity?

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.040
Well it would look something like that.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.540
And our initial x velocity
would look something like that.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.160
If we were to break things
down into their components.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.260
So our y velocity is starting negative,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.550
is starting negative,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.950
and then it's just going to
get more and more negative

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.010
once the individual lets go of the ball.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.840
Because you have that
constant acceleration,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.250
that negative acceleration,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.420
so it's gonna look something like that.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.660
And what about in the x direction?

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.930
Well looks like in the x
direction right over here

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.350
is very similar to that one,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.440
so it might look something like this.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.570
I'll draw it slightly higher
just so you can see it,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.340
but once again the velocity
x direction stays the same

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.450
because in all three scenarios,

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.923
you have zero acceleration
in the x direction.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.210
Now last but not least
let's think about position.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.600
So they all start in the exact same place

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.640
at both the x and y dimension,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.440
but as we see, they all have
different initial velocities,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.190
at least in the y dimension.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.500
So let's start with
the salmon colored one.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.870
So the salmon colored one,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.370
it starts off with a some
type of positive y position,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.710
maybe based on the height of
where the individual's hand is.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.310
And then what's going to happen?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.500
Well it's going to have
positive but decreasing velocity

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.680
up until this point.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.170
At this point its velocity is zero.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.380
So its position is going to go up

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.780
but at ever decreasing
rates until you get right

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.680
to that point right over there,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.820
and then we see the velocity
starts becoming more

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.010
and more and more and more negative.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.600
So it would look something like,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.510
something like that.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.340
Now what would be the x position

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.050
of this first scenario?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.620
Well if we make this position
right over here zero,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.870
then we would start our x
position would start over here,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.650
and since we have a constant
positive x velocity,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.690
our x position would just
increase at a constant rate.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.050
It would do something like that.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.200
Now what about this blue scenario?

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.430
Well this blue scenario,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.920
we are starting in the exact same place

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.610
as in our pink scenario,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.730
and then our initial y velocity is zero,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.700
and then it just gets
more and more and more

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.810
and more negative.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.520
So it would look something,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.403
it would look something like this.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.760
Now what about the x position?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.220
Well our x position,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.340
we had a slightly higher velocity,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.120
at least the way that I drew it over here,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.410
so we our x position would
increase at a constant rate

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.330
and it would be a slightly
higher constant rate.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.080
So it would have a slightly higher slope

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.190
than we saw for the pink one.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.090
Now the yellow scenario,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.700
once again we're starting
in the exact same place,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.947
and here we're already starting
with a negative velocity

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:57.410
and it's only gonna get more
and more and more negative.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.380
So it's just gonna do something like this.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.480
It's gonna get more and
more and more negative.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.420
It's a little bit hard to see,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.800
but it would do something like that.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.792
And if the in the x direction,

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:11.490
our velocity is roughly the
same as the blue scenario,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.430
then our x position over
time for the yellow one

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.360
is gonna look pretty pretty similar.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.840
So this is just a way to visualize

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.250
how things would behave
in terms of position,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.530
velocity, and acceleration
in the y and x directions

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.990
and to appreciate, one,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.000
how to draw and visualize these graphs

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.690
and conceptualize them,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.760
but also to appreciate that you can treat,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.890
once you break your initial
velocity vectors down,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.120
you can treat the different dimensions,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.963
the x and the y dimensions, independently.
