00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
I'm on the council long term investing
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.099
I'm on the council long term investing
and the issues that we'll be working on

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
and the issues that we'll be working on
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.940
and the issues that we'll be working on
is what are the requirements for

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950

institutional investors to be truly

institutional investors to be truly
long-term and we said looked at two sets

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
long-term and we said looked at two sets
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640
long-term and we said looked at two sets
of issues one is the regulatory

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
of issues one is the regulatory
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.279
of issues one is the regulatory
environment that the investors operated

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
environment that the investors operated
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620
environment that the investors operated
and the other set of issues relates to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
and the other set of issues relates to
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.939
and the other set of issues relates to
the governance structure of these

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
the governance structure of these
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.490
the governance structure of these
institutional investors and what we find

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
institutional investors and what we find
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.880
institutional investors and what we find
is that in married very many cases

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890
is that in married very many cases
 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.200
is that in married very many cases
institutional investors have a governor

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
institutional investors have a governor
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.849
institutional investors have a governor
system which is not really well matched

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
system which is not really well matched
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580
system which is not really well matched
with their investment strategies so the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
with their investment strategies so the
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.790
with their investment strategies so the
investment strategies are long-term per

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
investment strategies are long-term per
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.209
investment strategies are long-term per
se but the governance structure the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
se but the governance structure the
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.490
se but the governance structure the
government system of the investor is not

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
government system of the investor is not
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.380
government system of the investor is not
resilient enough to to handle the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
resilient enough to to handle the
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.720
resilient enough to to handle the
short-term volatility that may come from

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
short-term volatility that may come from
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670
short-term volatility that may come from
a long term investing strategy so a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
a long term investing strategy so a
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.639
a long term investing strategy so a
long-term investor can try to to exploit

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
long-term investor can try to to exploit
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.849
long-term investor can try to to exploit
the comparative advantages by accepting

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
the comparative advantages by accepting
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670
the comparative advantages by accepting
shorter term volatility but then you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
shorter term volatility but then you
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380
shorter term volatility but then you
have to make sure that the governance

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
have to make sure that the governance
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090
have to make sure that the governance
system is robust enough to handle that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
system is robust enough to handle that
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070
system is robust enough to handle that
sort of volatility so what we're looking

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
sort of volatility so what we're looking
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.429
sort of volatility so what we're looking
at is what sort of metrics do we need to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
at is what sort of metrics do we need to
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.950
at is what sort of metrics do we need to
measure the long term returns and what

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
measure the long term returns and what
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.630
measure the long term returns and what
sort of requirements for a good

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
sort of requirements for a good
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
sort of requirements for a good
governance system do we need to have in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
governance system do we need to have in
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920
governance system do we need to have in
order to make long-term investors truly

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
order to make long-term investors truly
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350
order to make long-term investors truly
