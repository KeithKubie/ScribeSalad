00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:03.570
- You ready?
You all set?

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.041
I got you.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.275
Mm.

Hey, people.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.148 align:end position:100%
Kevin Hart here,
and I'm comfortable.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.283 align:end position:100%
Real comfortable.
I got my shoes off.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:18.384 align:start size:63% position:38%
I got my thighs out.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.153 align:start size:66% position:34%
Why am I comfortable?

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.388 align:end position:100%
I'll tell you why, because I'm
in Birmingham, Alabama.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.258
It's a city with good people
and people who love to laugh.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.659
How do I know that?
Because I've done comedy

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.795
here several times, man.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.663 align:end position:100%
This penthouse
that I'm in right now?

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.632
The first penthouse
that I've ever stayed in.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.768
I ain't lying, 'cause I've
stayed--that's a lie.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.370
I can't lie to you guys.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.505
I--I wanted to stay
in this penthouse,

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:42.442
when I was coming to Birmingham,
but I couldn't afford it,

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.578 align:end position:100%
so I stayed in the junior suite.
It's not about me.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.213 align:end position:100%
Let's not even
make this about me.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.815
We're here to find new talent.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:52.618
The new generation of comedians
that are coming--

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.153 align:end position:100%
What are you--
what are you doing?

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:55.655
- Have you seen a phone?
I'm trying to

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.356
order room service.
- Brother, I'm doing--

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.592
- Where the phone at?
- I'm doing the intro.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.527
- Hey, you got cable?
- I'm doing the intro!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.329
- My room ain't got cable.
- Ju--

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:04.797
This is not your room.
It's mine.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.299
- You right, you right,
you right, you right...

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.700
- Where the phone?
- This is my room.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.102
- Where the phone?
- I ain't got no phone.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.503
- What--? I said it's--
[yells]

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:11.537
- There go the phone.
There go the phone.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.072
- Now I got the phone.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.708
- Ha, how y'all get
keys to my room?

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.444
That's the question
of the day.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.280 align:end position:100%
People are gonna think
that we--that we're grouping up,

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:24.650 align:end position:100%
but that's not the case,
'cause I'm a star.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.252 align:end position:100%
We're here to talk
about the new gen--

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.287
- Kev, how much you say
I got to put in on this?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.986
- I said get your ass
to the room, Harry.
