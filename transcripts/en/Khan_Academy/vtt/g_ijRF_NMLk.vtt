00:00:00.407 --> 00:00:04.099
- [Voiceover] Triangle ABC
undergoes a translation,

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.917
and we're using the
notation capital T for it,

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:12.087
and then we see what the
translation has to be.

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.642
We're gonna move,

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:14.803
it's kind of small, I hope you can see it

00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:15.999
on your video screen.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.218
We're gonna move positive eight.

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.798
Every point here is
gonna move positive eight

00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:19.621
in the x direction.

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.442
Its x coordinate is going
to increase by eight,

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:24.404
or the corresponding point in the image,

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:26.834
its x coordinate, is going
to increase by eight,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:27.868
and the corresponding point

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:29.435
in the image's y coordinate

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:32.616
is going to decrease by
one, so let's do that.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.322
And I'll focus on the vertices,

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.609
whoops, let me drag that to the trash,

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:37.992
I didn't mean to do that.

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm going to focus on the vertices

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.561
well, that's just the
easiest thing for my brain

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.057
to worth with.

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:47.431
And actually, this is what
the tool expects as well.

00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.533
So the point B, is going to move eight

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.065
to the right, or its corresponding point

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.586
in the image is going
to have an x coordinate

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.572
eight larger.

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:55.047
So right now, the x
coordinate is negative four,

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:56.209
if you added eight to that,

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.123
it would be positive four,

00:00:58.123 --> 00:00:59.306
and its y coordinate is going

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:00.422
to be one lower.

00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:03.040
Right now, point B's
y coordinate is eight,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.677
one lower than that is seven.

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:06.454
So, in the image, the corresponding

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:07.916
point of the image would
going to be right over there.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.711
And you see we moved eight to the right,

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:11.568
and one down.

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:13.043
Let's do that with point C.

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:14.610
It's at x equals negative seven,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.038
if you move eight to the right,

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:17.930
if you increase your
x coordinate by eight,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.973
you're gonna move to x equals one,

00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:21.715
and then if you change your y coordinate

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.176
by negative one, you're
gonna move down one,

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:24.930
then you're gonna get to that point

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.533
right over there.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.934
Now, let's do it with point A.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.069
So point A's x coordinate is negative one.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.556
If you add eight to it,

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:35.796
it's going to be positive seven,

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:37.631
and its current y coordinate is two.

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:39.035
If you take one away from it,

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.218
you're gonna get to a y coordinate of one.

00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:43.702
And so there you have it.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.384
Let's see, how do I connect these two?

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:47.406
Oh, there you go,

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.822
and we can check our answer.

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:50.239
And we got it right.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.193
We have performed the translation.
