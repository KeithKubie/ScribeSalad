00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:04.142
- Omojobi is 220 centimeters tall.

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:05.971
He wanted to fill up his pool

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.823
so that the water level would be

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:09.860
as high as he is tall.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.152
So that the water level, I guess,

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:13.480
would be 220 centimeters tall.

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:17.353
The water level rose by
six centimeters each minute

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:19.338
and reached the desired height

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:21.092
after 20 minutes.

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.589
Graph the pool's water
level, in centimeters,

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.011
as a function of time, in minutes.

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.808
Well, they do tell us
one interesting thing.

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:31.665
They say that the water level

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.951
reached the desired
height after 20 minutes.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.583
And we know what the desired height is,

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:40.004
the desired height is to be as tall as,

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:41.721
or to be as deep as he is tall,

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.198
or as high as he is tall.

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:45.839
And that is 220 centimeters tall.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:46.872
So they're telling us essentially

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.244
that the water level of the pool

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:53.502
after 20 minutes is 220 centimeters,

00:00:53.502 --> 00:00:54.614
so we can plot that.

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.019
So after 20 minutes, so we can plot

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.241
that point right there.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.198
After 20 minutes, we
are at 220 centimeters.

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:03.713
So we would be right there.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:04.560
Now the other question is

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.683
where would we put this point?

00:01:05.683 --> 00:01:09.968
We need another data point
in order to define a line.

00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:12.425
And so they tell us that the water,

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:13.381
you might be tempted to say,

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:14.313
"Okay, maybe the water level was

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:17.335
"at zero to begin with," but
they didn't tell us that.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:19.622
Maybe when he started filling the pool

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.302
there was already some water in there.

00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:22.746
So we have to be a
little bit more careful.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:24.547
But they do give us some information.

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:29.652
The water level rose by six
centimeters each minute,

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:32.476
it rose by six centimeters each minute.

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:36.745
So at 20 minutes, we know we're at 220.

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:40.691
And if we rose six
centimeters each minute,

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:44.885
where would we have been, let's say

00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.448
10 minutes ago?

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:50.583
So, where would we have been at time 10?

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.444
So, every 10 minutes, if the water level

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:56.112
is rising six centimeters a minute,

00:01:56.112 --> 00:02:00.088
it would be rising 60
centimeters every 10 minutes.

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.739
So 10 minutes ago, we would
be 60 centimeters less.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.311
So 60 centimeters less than 220.

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:08.279
That's 20 centimeters less,

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.935
that's 40 centimeters less,

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:12.821
that's 60 centimeters less.

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:15.197
So, if you go back in time 10 minutes,

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:19.176
you would be 60 centimeters shallower,

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:24.162
or less high, and 220 minus 60 is 160.

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:27.230
Now, I think I'm done. I
think this describes it.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.571
Now let's see if it makes sense.

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:30.760
This is telling us that at time zero

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.438
there was, before he started filling it,

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:35.543
there was already 100
centimeters in his pool.

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:38.652
And then after 20 minutes, he's done.

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:41.121
And is that consistent with
six centimeters a minute?

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.839
Well, based on this,
it took him 20 minutes

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.282
to get to 220, but that's
an incremental 120.

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:55.138
To go from 100 to 220
is 120 more centimeters.

00:02:55.138 --> 00:03:00.138
So in 20 minutes, he got 120 centimeters.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:02.516
Well 120 centimeters divided by 20 minutes

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.198
is six centimeters per minute.

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:09.532
So this is looking good
and we got it right.
