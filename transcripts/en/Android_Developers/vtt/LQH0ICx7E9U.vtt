&gt;&gt; With Android, you can easily customize
your home screen just like you can on the

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.350
computer. Android allows you to adapt your
handset in many ways. Tailoring the look of

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:16.199
your home page is simple by changing the image
for your wall paper. You can do this with

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.350
a nifty feature across Apps called “Long
Press.” Every time you select and hold an

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.869
item on the touch screen, you find an additional
set of actions. Using “Long Press” on

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.610
the home screen, I can select an existing
image from the wall paper gallery, go to the

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:42.569
web to grab an image, or choose one from my
picture album. You can also customize the

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:55.859
applications on your home screen. You can
select Gmail, or other useful Google Apps

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:07.390
or Bonsai Blast, even bookmarks for websites
or sites you want easily accessible. What's

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.140
great is that you can do this with contacts
and Gmail labels you frequently use as well.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.840
Android fits your diverse lifestyle. You can
create a work page, or play page, an entertainment

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.700
page, or a communication page, making it simple
to navigate your needs as you move throughout

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.110
the day.
