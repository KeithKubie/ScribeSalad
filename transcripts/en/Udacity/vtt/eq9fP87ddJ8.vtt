00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
Now here's a question. What does the average program print if you immediately

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.511
type Q when prompted for a value? You may to try this out in BlueJ. Does the

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:12.250
program print zero? Does the program terminate with an arithmetic exception?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.220
Does it print NaN? Or does it do something else?
