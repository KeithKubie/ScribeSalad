Question on homework autograder about whether or not it parses like feedback on that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Oh, to get more feedback? Yeah. This is a good question.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For the quizzes in lecture you get immediate feedback, and we think that's useful. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For the homeworks, you don't get any feedback until after the deadline

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is something we're thinking about how to provide some feedback on the homeworks

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but still make them different from the quizzes in lecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're getting some feedback but not getting the answer until after the deadline.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Until we have something like that in place, though, it's important that--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've seen a lot of people that edit it in an external editor, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and then they paste it into our programming environment.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It can mess with the formatting, and Python is one of those languages where formatting matters.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Right. It's a good idea to run your code when you submit the homework to see the output.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I got three questions wrong in homework 2 for not doing that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's a good idea for everyone.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's good the grading policy drops one homework. &gt;&gt;Yeah. You're going to need that one.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I think I'll do a canned exam, but we'll see.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So we have are you enjoying teaching a massive online open course?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Okay. So Michelle is asking if it's my first experience in a MOOC. It is my first experience in a MOOC.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The largest course I taught before this one had about 100 students, less than 100 students in it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It was for CS? &gt;&gt;It was actually the data structures and data representation class.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The intro CS course that I teach at UVA last semester had 50 students in it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's been a typical size.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The first time I taught I had 9 students.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So the great thing in teaching small classes is getting to know all the students

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and being able to understand at that level what everyone was doing,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but it's really terrific to be able to teach a class like this and have many thousands of students

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
from all around the world and the range of backgrounds.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There was a post in the forum about the background that several hundred of you posted in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and it's really interesting for me to see that and to see 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
how diverse the group of students that we have in the class is. &gt;&gt;It's inspiring.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's inspiring and it is an opportunity that I think we're very humbled by and I'm humbled by

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to have a chance to introduce this many people to computer science.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I hope we don't lose people, but I hope people are enjoying it and getting a lot out of it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's really gratifying to me to see what's happening and see how many people are contributing

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in the forums and other ways to make the class better.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It is a really wonderful and amazing experience.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We have a question from Graham. How did you learn to firm program?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I think it is how did you both, so you can answer this as well.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I guess I'll go first, because I learned earlier since Peter was not alive when I learned to program.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I got started in programming when I was in elementary school. &gt;&gt;What?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
My school got a Teletype computer.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This was a computer where it had paper and it was printing on it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The year after that we got Apple 2s, and you had colors in screens.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But my first experience was with this Teletype computer that you called in "put a phone"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
on coupler, and you could log into the computer--

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Did you have to have a trial CD?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There was no trial CD. You just called in.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The cool thing about computing in those days was the code was written in a language called "Basic,"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and all the programs you could see what they were.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I started playing these games on the computer. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I wanted to do better in the games, because I was trying to win the games,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and you could type "list" and see all the code,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and it didn't make much sense to me at first, 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but I started to look at it and try to understand what's going on and tried to change the code.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You were cheating? &gt;&gt;I was cheating in the games.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Once we got Apple 2s you could start to do cool things with colors and make pictures. It got really fun.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
That's how I got started in programming.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I got started with little Legos.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
There were these Lego sets--they're called Lego Mindstorm.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So basically it's a bunch of Legos with a couple motors, 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and it's hooked up to a little processing unit that also powers the motors,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and you just hook it up to a computer.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The programming environment is block-based.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You just have a little Lego block that you do to do the command,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so it might be move forward for 30 seconds.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Things like a conditional that's like an if statement.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That's really the first thing I did programming.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I built a little robot that crawled around on my floor and would pick up "trash."

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It couldn't pick up anything that heavy. Bits of paper.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Couple it tell whether something was trash or not? &gt;&gt;No, no.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It would basically patrol my floor until I threw things on the ground,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which was often, I suppose.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's called the Roomba now.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Yeah, it's called a Roomba. They beat me to it. Dang. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I was always interesting in playing with the stuff--kind of building computers and things like that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Then I went to a summer camp in middle school where we programmed in C, 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and programming in C is not the funnest thing.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Yeah. Programming in Python is a lot more fun than the languages.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Yeah. You kids have it so easy.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
When something breaks, it tells you what happened. Not in C.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Do we have any other questions?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Okay. We can go to the forums.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Do you want to pick one from the--

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Let's see. We've got many pages of this.
