00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.740
There’s always some new diet touted as the
one that will give you a celeb body in two

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.540
weeks, and Keto Diet is currently making the
rounds.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.769
But what is Ketogenesis?

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.200
Did someone say Sega Genesis?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800
Ketogenesis has a super scientific name, and
a lot of science behind it… which is probably

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.890
why people use the shorter name for the diet: Keto.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.890
Keto is a cutesy term for ketosis, a process
where living things break down fats to sustain

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.119
life -- it usually happens during starvation
or out of control diabetes.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.110
But artificially putting your body into a
ketogenic state is growing in popularity.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.930
The Keto Diet is basically, a temporary food
restriction program that is high in saturated

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.550
fat and almost entirely cuts out carbohydrates.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.650
Suggestions include having bacon with everyday,
meat at every opportunity, and SIDES of veggies

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.430
… but like three leaves of lettuce or AH
tomato.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.040
And meal suggestions often include using both
butter and olive oil.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
I mean, I like a tasty meal but that’s just
making my arteries hurt thinking about it…

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.670
And some follow this diet for months or years
at a time!

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.120
But let’s back up and explain some simple
biology.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.790
Your brain and body run on glucose, a simple
sugar.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.520
Glucose is made from lots of things, but a
big source is carbohydrates.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.850
Once carbs are converted to glucose it enters
the bloodstream and can either be used immediately

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.850
or stored.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.850
Stored, if you’re eating more calories than
you’re burning, can mean as fat.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.550
People see the Keto diet as a way to cut out
carbs, and thus sugar storage, removing a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.800
source of fat from the body…

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Except that doesn’t actually happen.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.510
Even without carbs coming in, the body needs
glucose, so once glucose drops to less than

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.530
100 grams, the body enters a ketogenic state
-- none of this is news to Keto Practitioners,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.050
but really for everyone else…

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.670
The brain needs glucose, glucose is The Precious
and we wants it!

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.390
“Ketogenic” comes from ketone bodies.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.850
They’re another source of cellular fuel,
not the body’s preferred fuel, mind you,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880
but an alternative supply for vital organs.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.490
This is like an emergency backup system for
your body.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.340
The ketogenesis kicks in when your body is
starved of glucose, starting a lipolytic process.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.920
Basically, it breaks down fat.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240
Glossy Keto Instagrammers rejoice!

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.140
Except, the keyword in there is starved.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.389
Creating ketone bodies to replace missing
glucose is what your body does as a response

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.909
to starvation!

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.930
And people are still willing to try the diet!

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.420
Which can be dangerous.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.120
Carbs typically account for about 50 percent
of a balanced diet.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.799
If you tell someone to replace those calories
with proteins and fats, people can end up

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.299
eating too much protein and fats from processed
foods.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.799
That paired with few fruits and vegetables
is a recipe for ill health.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.260
Plus, Lots of red meat and fatty, processed
foods have been linked to heart disease, kidney

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.340
problems, and even osteoporosis.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.409
Some people experience nausea, vomiting, and
constipation on the diet.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.189
But they also do lose weight!

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.700
The problem is, like with all fad diets, the
weight loss doesn’t last.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.919
As a former personal trainer, I suspect it’s
the initial cutting out bread that kickstarts

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.029
weight loss.

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.129
Cutting out this common source of simple sugar
is every trainer’s first comment.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.889
But fat has an evolutionary purpose, it is
the buffer from those ancient days when we

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.260
couldn’t just walk over to the store to
pick up food.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.749
So once you stop Keto, you’re likely going
to gain weight again as your body tries to

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.279
protect itself from starvation.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.499
There is some research that says a longer-term
stint on the Keto diet can help with weight

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.329
loss and cholesterol management.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.189
But that’s in a study with supervision.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.819
It’s a hard diet to manage alone.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.749
Interestingly, there are significant health
benefits from following the Keto diet.

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.669
It’s been used since its development in
the 1920s to effectively treat children with

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.779
drug-resistant epilepsy.

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.819
And in some cases, children with certain genetic
mutations can’t get enough glucose to the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.819
brain.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.540
This hypoglycemic state causes seizures in
infancy and, if untreated, can lead to serious

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.099
complications like microcephaly and ataxia.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.582
The keto diet takes away the glucose from
the bloodstream, forcing the brain to use

00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:53.139
the alternate energy source of ketone bodies
for fuel, allowing for proper neural development.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.439
But unlike body builders looking to get super
lean, this diet is done all-in for 1-2 weeks

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.819
with management over months or years, depending
on the case.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.620
All under close supervision of a physician,
a registered nurse, and a registered dietitian.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.730
The diet is slowly dialed back to include
more and more foods that produce gluten, allowing

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.650
the child to adjust.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.480
Again, it’s supervised.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.090
Because there shouldn’t be guesswork when
putting a child — or yourself! — into

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.489
a starvation state.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.629
Scientists are now looking into other applications
the Keto diet might have for other metabolic,

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.810
oncologic, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric
disorders.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.180
A fad diet is a temporary way of eating that
is targeted at those of us who don’t like

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.699
exercise but want to lose weight quickly.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.370
This kinda sounds like that, but with some
science words.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.919
The best kind of diet is one that you work
out with a nutritionist that suits your body,

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.960
and that you adopt for yourself and for the
rest of your life.

Diets are so much more than just food; I can

here.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.580
Amazingly, use of the Keto diet can be traced
all the way back to the 5th century BCE by

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:09.770
Hippocrates who realized seizures are biological,
not spiritual.
