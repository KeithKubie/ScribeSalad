1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,253
[inaudible]

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,050
all right. I got behind this dump truck,

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:09,550
but this is one of my favorite
things on the road as far as, uh,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,050
one of the best skylines you can
ever see. I mean, uh, Pittsburgh,

5
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:18,980
Pennsylvania, you go through this town
and you're like, oh, I, this looks like,

6
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:23,870
you know, shit all fucking titled
Smells like exhaust in here.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,690
And uh, when you come through
the other tunnel though,

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,270
I'll show you the view here. This
is where you, people can't either,

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,990
you don't travel, but you know, vacations
in Pittsburgh, right? Let's be honest,

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,930
I didn't realize this tunnel
was this fucking long.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,130
I'm running under shift the SEC. This
is like when there's like a rain delay,

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,360
they go back to two fucking
greenhorn announcers.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,450
They run out of stories all day. They

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,440
already had a hot done here these
days. What time? Well, you know,

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,850
I was in the middle of
telling a story and yeah,

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,160
I guess I went to inhale as
I was swallowing in shelter.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,310
Shut up fucking whore. I know what to
do. All right, so here we go. Well,

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,660
come on out. I see daylight,
I see things. All right,

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,830
so you coming through here, you're like,
whatever. Pittsburgh gives a flock,

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,460
right?

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,050
The hockey team with all that cheap shot
artists and that crybaby players, um,

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,010
Kabaka with you.

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,010
I respect him and all of a sudden
you come out of the tunnel and Bam,

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,370
you're going to ask, when
you see that, look at that.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,470
There's hides field over there where the
fucking steel lattice would they play?

26
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,550
Can you see it? There's a
fucking guardrails in the way.

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,290
I think it's supposed to make
a left yet. Two 79 north.

28
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,500
Okay, sweetheart. We've
got all the bridges. Ah,

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,420
exit 70 p four 40
mention center. You know,

30
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,100
you're really fucked
up this video. Anyways,

31
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,960
that's one of my favorite
things in the road. Okay, bye.
