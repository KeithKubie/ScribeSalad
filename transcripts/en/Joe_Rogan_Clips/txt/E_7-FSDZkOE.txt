Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So what would you think about if they abandoned weight cutting [inaudible] they just opened up more weight classes and abandoned weight cutting. I mean I wouldn't mind it. I would, I would like to see that. Don't think it'd be better for the fighters. I think it'd be better for the fighters and [inaudible] really cool matchups yeah. You know what I mean? Cause there's some guys that cut a lot of weight and there's some match ups that would be really cool at different weights too. I think it's one of those dumb things that's existed in the past and we never corrected. Yeah. I think, I think we should stop it. It's not helping anybody to lose weight for a fight so that you can be fit and in great shape. Yeah. F okay, sure. But how do you go about that? But I mean losing weight, like losing weight and training, not like massive dehydration.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Yeah. For weight cut day and then rehydration the next day for fight day. I think it's, it's a crazy strain that guys are doing to their kidneys and their bodies. I mean many fighters have told me that they don't feel like they can take a body shot as well when they cut a lot of weight like that. Sometimes the your head, my head, I remember on the Johnny Walker fight, I'd cut, excuse me, it could have been from the Weight Cup, but that morning, like if I've been tapped on my jaw, I just felt like my head was just like off like rally, you know, like yeah, it felt very sensitive and he does from the weight and the same night I get knocked out. I don't know what it was from, but I remember feeling that morning when I woke up. Cause usually I like, I'll shake everything off. I'll like, you know, like punching myself in the jaw, all that stuff just to get ready for the fight.

Speaker 1:          01:31          And I remember that that morning when I was like tapping myself on the jaw, my head just didn't feel right. Dude. That's not a good feeling. No. But I gotta checked after I didn't have any like concussion or anything. Did you have some particularly hard sparring session or something close to that? Uh, I don't think close to it during that camp. Uh, like I said, I didn't feel it all the way until I didn't have it. The only, the only time I ever felt it was like after the weight cut. So it could have been from that. Right. Yeah. And I think that morning I actually ended up cutting the last little bit of my weight, the morning of weigh ins too, which is not usually like me. I'll usually cut it the night before. So you said you like to start your day off with a run.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Um, are you doing that every day? Yeah, definitely. So that's one thing that I learned too is just training every day. Not Learn, but it just feels different. Now I have to go and train every day when I was in Vegas, like, ah, I've got to drive 30 minutes, you know, all of these things. I had a lot of excuses to make up. And now with the convenience of how training is now, I don't even make up excuses. I'm like, if I'm tired, I still, it's two minute walk, get your ass to the gym. You know, and so yeah, every, every single day training and then weekends off for sure. So you're running every single day, then you're training every single day before Moitai it's mandatory. You run. But like the train, train, train and real, she ruined first. You show up, you run the day. The first day I showed up, uh, at, at Tiger's Moitai class, I didn't even, tennis shoes.

Speaker 1:          02:59          I just showed up with my flip flops because I was staying right across the street and I showed up. I start wrapping my hands in the trainer. He's like, are you going to train? And I was like, yeah, I think so. He's like, you think so? We'll go run. And I was like, I don't have shoes. Only had my flip flops. And he's like just pointed like so go run. And I had to run like, I think it was like eight kilometers in, in flip flops before I even trained. Yeah, that's like four miles. Yeah, somewhere around there. Five and a half. Yeah. It's like four, like four miles, something like that. We just had to run, run, run, run, run, run. I asked the girls like, how long do we run? Four. She's like usually like five to six kilometers or something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Yeah, it was like five ks. Like three and a half months. Yeah, I'd say like just cutting it short. Five K. Wow. And then in flip flops and I was like, okay, cool. Yeah, I never, I never forgot my shoes again. I would always show up at that. Fuck your feet up. It wasn't too bad actually now because I wasn't wearing shoes a lot anyway. Oh yes. Thailand. Sometimes you had to take off your shoes before you enter the store. So, so they're, they're hard assed in their discipline with the wanting you just serious about very serious. Yeah. They're just serious about it. They're like, show respect, you know? And when you're running, you're running with a group of guys or everybody, guys, girls, whoever shows up to class. But is it is like, okay, so when they're running, are they running, like organize like in a group or are they just, is everybody running a few miles before class?

Speaker 1:          04:17          Every time. The first, the first Muay Thai gym that I trained at the straight Moitai Jim in Bangkok, they run as a unit every day 5:00 AM. Wow. As a team. They live at the gym, they eat at the gym, they sleep in the gym. They are like, they don't have homes there. Home is the gym and their job is just fight and eat, sleep, train, fight. That's it. It's crazy when they even take on the name of the gym. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that's a whole different life. Like that is what made me respect and learn and love Moitai so much as how these guys trained in just they live together, everything. It was amazing. So they run as a group, but the other like the other place, we all start off, but if you, if someone's laughing you and they just want to run fast, like it's, it's totally fine.

Speaker 1:          05:04          But before the class everybody has to go. Yeah. Wow. That's a smart way to do it, man. I mean if you could really convince them to be conditioned all the time and there's no like you have no option. You can't be out of condition if you're going to run five miles every day, no five miles. And then hitting, kicking, hitting and kicking pads for five to 10 rounds a day, clinching 45 minutes a day, like clenching at after every session. It's like you run knee bag, sit ups, all that stuff. Second, second session is, um, kick the bag three to five rounds until a trainer picks you up. Like for me, I had to wait for a trainer to actually even like want to hold pads for me. If you just show up, you'll just be hitting the bag until the trainer was like, Hey, okay, I'll hold for you.

Speaker 1:          05:53          And then once you actually find a trainer that wants to work with you, then you kind of, whatever their schedule is for you that they'll create it though you'll hold the whole pads, you'll kick the bag, you'll do pushups, he'll do sit ups and then clinch 30 to 45 minutes after and it's the same thing every single day. Wow. And do you ever worry that this might be something that would be monotonous because you're doing the same way every day? Or did you think we just concentrate on excellence? No, because it's also, uh, like going to the fights and there's so many different styles. So like people are doing the same thing every day. The repetition, but the styles are completely different. You know, like nobody fights like sand Chai. Right, right. He does the same thing everybody else does. But he has his own style.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Yeah. You know what I mean? Or some guys will do the same thing, but they don't even like to kick or knee. They just like to throw elbows. I know plenty of guys like that where they just like, you know that when he goes, he's just throwing elbows all five rounds. Yeah, this guy's just going to throw knees. So it's just like, which tools do you use the, it's like, are you a near, are you at a kicker? Are you an elbow guy or you left cake? Are you a low kicker? It's kind of like what's what strikes are your, are your thing. And then you go watch the chaos and these guys are getting split open every night fucking on the stretchers. They take them stretchers on the rig, man, it's amazing. Wow. It's like not to see someone get hurt, but like just the, the fact that like these guys are all out brawl every night. Every single night there's a fight at the stadium. Sure. Thursday nights are the nights that like the, like the higher guys go and they're packed with people. Thousands of people. Like the one I went to, there was a few thousand people there for the stadium. It looked pack and everyone's betting like, ah. And then when the kicks land, I'm like, Oh hey, I just, the energy is crazy. Wow. They never showed up, man. I'm getting hyped thinking about it. Going back to Thailand right now.
