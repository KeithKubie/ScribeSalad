This episode of Crash Course is brought to
you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.880
Hello, I'm Craig again and this is Crash Course:
Government and Politics and today were gonna

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.290
look at why Congress acts the way it does.
More specifically we're gonna try to figure

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.210
out as much as we can without being mind readers,
the factors that influence congressmen when

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.080
they make decisions. And then after that we'll be mind
readers and then we'll -- we'll see if we were right.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.699
This should be a welcome change of pace from
the last couple episodes where we delved into

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.259
the gory details of how Congress works or
is supposed to work anyway. [shudders]

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:38.379
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.140
So, to over simplify greatly, but also to
help those of you who studying for tests there

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.120
are three main factors or agents that influence
congressmen in making their decisions: their

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.330
constituency, interest groups, and political
parties. And they vary in importance depending

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.220
on the situation that a congressmen is in. Our basic
understanding of democracy and representative

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.810
government suggests that constituents would
matter most to representatives and senators

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.840
and fortunately, this is sometimes the case.
Unfortunately, this is sometimes the case.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.640
If a congress person ignores what the voters
in his or her district want they're probably

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.189
not going to be in office for very long, representatives
pay the most attention to their constituents

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.950
when they are actually voting on bills because
votes are a record that constituents can easily

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.560
check, say right before an election. If this
is the case then the relative lack of important

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.640
congressional votes in recent years tells us something.
Nowadays, congressmen are more likely to depend on

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.570
direct service to constituents, what is sometimes
called case work, to build up their record.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.759
This might be why congressmen tend to spend
much more time in their home states and districts

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.590
than in Washington, they might also want to
check up on their lawn, you know grass grows

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.170
you gotta mow it. Constituent's views can
affect congressmen without the threat of unseating

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.819
them in an election though, because congressmen
can anticipate what the voters will want and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.600
respond to this. They manage this through
public opinion polling. The more sophisticated

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810
polling is, the better representatives are
at crafting their message, and maybe even

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.549
their votes to what their constituents want.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.549
We're going to devote a number of episodes
to interest groups in the future, explaining

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.749
what they are and where they come from. I
know this because I'm psychic. But for now,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.639
it is important to recognize that they are
incredibly important to congressmen although

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.499
not for the reasons you might think. Let's
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:05.039
OK, when I mention interest groups or say
the phrase "special interests" you probably

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.950
imagine some guy in a suit -- maybe even a
fedora -- surreptitiously handing a suitcase

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.780
full of money to a congressmen in return for
his vote on some issue of supreme importance

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.030
to the interest group that the suit guy represents.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.250
Or maybe you think interest groups are more
subtle than this, buying votes with campaign

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.250
contributions, this stereotypical view presents
a dramatic story and paints picture that sticks

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.340
in your head but there is no empirical evidence
that it's true. I hope the fedora part is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.470
true though. That's probably true.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.630
The main thing that interest groups provide
to congressmen is information that they can

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.380
use in writing a bill or making a policy case
to their constituents.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.760
One of the big things in American government
is that information is very important and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.700
very valuable. On the other hand, interest
groups do give an awful lot of money to campaigns.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.880
They also provide a lot of research and assistance
in the writing of bills.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.480
Interest groups are most influential at the
committee stage of legislation, rather than

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.150
when congressman are casting floor votes and
their influence tends to be mostly negative.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.770
This means that rather than inserting items
into legislation, it's much easier and more

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.800
effective to exclude potential provisions
from laws. Plus, this practice -- and maybe

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.580
the fedoras a little bit -- makes it easier to obfuscate
special interest influence on laws. It's harder to show

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.960
that interest groups have kept something
out of a law than that they put something into it.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.480
Thanks, Thought Bubble. That brings us to
our third big influencer, political parties.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.320
Whoo Hooo [popper pops]. Oh, not that kind
of party. The way that political parties effect

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.460
law makers is even more complex than the role
of interest groups. A disciplined party leadership

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.920
can put pressure on a congressmen to vote
a certain way. They call them whips for a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.540
reason. But this only works when the party
is unified and strong. The weaker the party

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.050
the more freedom the representative has to
go rouge on some issues and votes if there

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.300
are many different factions within a party, there's less
of a consequence for voting along the party line.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.600
This is why I don't have friends. Freedom.
The clearest example of this is the so called

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.100
Hastert Rule named after formed speaker Dennis
Hastert who would only bring a bill to the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.960
floor of the house for a vote if a majority of the majority
party, in his case, Republicans, supported it.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.150
Side note, if you've got the majority and
the party unity to pull of a stunt like that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.110
you really end up looking like an effective
speaker.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.950
Parties also help to organize logrolling which
is relatively straight forward quid-pro-quo

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.840
bargaining. You vote for my farm bill senator,
and I'll support your banking bill. You vote

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.150
for my not punching eagles bill, Eagle and
I won't punch you. Not voting for it? [clacks

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.470
to ground]. You've been logrolled. Is that
how that word works?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.980
Logrolling occurs most obviously at the voting
stage but can also be part of the writing

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.790
of legislation in committees. When we talk
about parties we talk about me. But when we

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.970
talk about political parties we can't leave
out the president. Who is the de facto leader

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.420
of his party and it's own most influential
member. I'm pretty sure you're aware of that.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.880
The president has the most power when his
party and the majority part in congress are

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.470
the same. When this happens, Congress usually
follows the president's lead and allows him

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.120
to set the policy agenda. That way they can
take some credit if the policy is a winner

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.510
and avoid some blame if turns out not so great.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.180
We saw this most recently with the creation
of The Affordable Care Act (Obama Care) which

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.650
was written and passed during the first few
years of the Obama presidency when his party,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.230
the Democrats, also had the majority in both
houses. Divided government, when the president

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.970
and the congressional majority are in opposite
parties works well for Congress too because

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.670
it makes it super easy to set a policy agenda,
they just oppose what ever the president wants.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.300
This type of obstructionism is unfortunately
pretty common in Congress today, just look

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.380
at the years from 2010 to 2012 when Congress's
program could be summed up in four words,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.160
"Repeal ObamaCare and replace it." Wait, that's
not true, that's five words.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.900
To sum up, political parties are most influential
over Congress when a single party controls

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.780
both houses and the presidency and when the
party leadership is strong enough to exert

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.090
discipline and a degree of uniformity of policy.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.270
So that's about it for the factors that influence
congressional decision making. Really Stan,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.170
that's it? That's all? I'm going on break.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.660
Well, obviously there are other factors like
the personal lives of individual congressmen

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.829
and maybe congressional history but since
this is broad survey of American government

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:32.800
and politics we can't easily get into that without
taking less breaks. And, I'm gonna go on break.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.340
For my money, it's the structures of congress
and most of all which party has the majority

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.760
and thus controls the leadership and the committees
that makes the most difference. Even though

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.880
I want to say and believe that constituents
matter most because I don't want to feed into

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.880
this cynicism that seems to come so naturally
to discussions of Congress.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.340
But I think we should try to avoid any cynicism
and conspiracy theories when we try and figure

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.470
out why a congressperson acted a certain way
and recognize that any congressional decision

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.169
is the product of the complex interaction of a
number of factors, only some of which will

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.750
be apparent. Each of these decisions will
be conditioned and constrained by the structures

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.610
and procedures of Congress itself. Thanks
for watching. I'll see you next time.
