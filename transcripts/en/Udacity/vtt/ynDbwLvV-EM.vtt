00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.330
At this point, we've created
a prototype that has interactivity.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.740
The hot spots that we've created will
allow anyone viewing our prototype

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.780
to interact with the images as
if they were the real thing.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.810
It's important to note that while
there is some level of interactivity,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.640
we don't want to add too many
interactions at this point.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.360
Remember, the key here is having primary
navigation points, which enable you

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.680
to get feedback on whether a user can
achieve the intended task of your app.
