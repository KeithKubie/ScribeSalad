because of the the gap between what we

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
because of the the gap between what we
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.490
because of the the gap between what we
articulate and what we don't know

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
articulate and what we don't know
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.340

something has to fill that gap like I

think the law could be could could
replace it if the law was total but it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
replace it if the law was total but it
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779
replace it if the law was total but it
isn't it's it's it's bounded and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
isn't it's it's it's bounded and
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.390
isn't it's it's it's bounded and
incorrect and there's something it rests

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
incorrect and there's something it rests
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.519
incorrect and there's something it rests
it has to rest on something inside

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
it has to rest on something inside
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860
it has to rest on something inside
that's like this mediator between what

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
that's like this mediator between what
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.090
that's like this mediator between what
we articulate and what we don't

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
we articulate and what we don't
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100
we articulate and what we don't
understand it's something like custom

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
understand it's something like custom
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470
understand it's something like custom
it's something like expectation it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
it's something like expectation it's
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090
it's something like expectation it's
something like the intrinsic sense of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
something like the intrinsic sense of
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.490
something like the intrinsic sense of
justice you know that the law itself is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
justice you know that the law itself is
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979
justice you know that the law itself is
aiming at and those aren't fully

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
aiming at and those aren't fully
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.229
aiming at and those aren't fully
articulated but without them there'd be

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
articulated but without them there'd be
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.979
articulated but without them there'd be
no grounding like without the body the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
no grounding like without the body the
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590
no grounding like without the body the
law would be a dictionary you know and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
law would be a dictionary you know and
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.930
law would be a dictionary you know and
if you don't know what a word means

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940
if you don't know what a word means
 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.369
if you don't know what a word means
using the dictionary is helpful but not

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
using the dictionary is helpful but not
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979
using the dictionary is helpful but not
that helpful because like unless you've

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
that helpful because like unless you've
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779
that helpful because like unless you've
had the experience of anger the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
had the experience of anger the
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.340
had the experience of anger the
dictionary can't tell you what anger

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
dictionary can't tell you what anger
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350
dictionary can't tell you what anger
means it's just refers to other words

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
means it's just refers to other words
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630
means it's just refers to other words
but the words themselves refer to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
but the words themselves refer to
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880
but the words themselves refer to
something else and the law refers to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
something else and the law refers to
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.520
something else and the law refers to
something else and without that it has

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
something else and without that it has
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380
something else and without that it has
to be in tune with that something else

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
to be in tune with that something else
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.140
to be in tune with that something else
and has to be in accordance with it and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150
and has to be in accordance with it and
 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.690
and has to be in accordance with it and
so I I don't think we can ever delineate

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
so I I don't think we can ever delineate
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.719
so I I don't think we can ever delineate
the proper body of laws and that's also

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
the proper body of laws and that's also
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.929
the proper body of laws and that's also
why you like ideological utopians see

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
why you like ideological utopians see
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.300
why you like ideological utopians see
the unity illogical utopia is dispensed

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
the unity illogical utopia is dispensed
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.749
the unity illogical utopia is dispensed
with the transcendent they say this is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
with the transcendent they say this is
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.420
with the transcendent they say this is
what we need to do it's like no you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
what we need to do it's like no you
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550
what we need to do it's like no you
don't know that's not good you have to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
don't know that's not good you have to
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499
don't know that's not good you have to
leave space for what you kind of know

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
leave space for what you kind of know
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.620
leave space for what you kind of know
and for what you don't know and I mean

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
and for what you don't know and I mean
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630
and for what you don't know and I mean
you know in the story the Tower of Babel

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
you know in the story the Tower of Babel
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210
you know in the story the Tower of Babel
human beings make this massive building

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
human beings make this massive building
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100
human beings make this massive building
that's supposed to reach up to the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
that's supposed to reach up to the
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.690
that's supposed to reach up to the
heavens so that it'll take the place of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
heavens so that it'll take the place of
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910
heavens so that it'll take the place of
God well that's that's the earliest

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
God well that's that's the earliest
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.630
God well that's that's the earliest
warning we have of the danger of making

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
warning we have of the danger of making
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359
warning we have of the danger of making
things so big that you confuse them with

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
things so big that you confuse them with
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.910
things so big that you confuse them with
God and God gets irritated and comes

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
God and God gets irritated and comes
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380
God and God gets irritated and comes
down and makes everybody speak different

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
down and makes everybody speak different
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999
down and makes everybody speak different
languages and scatters them it's like

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
languages and scatters them it's like
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.740
languages and scatters them it's like
well that's what happens when you try to

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
well that's what happens when you try to
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.499
well that's what happens when you try to
make something a totality is that it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
make something a totality is that it
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.449
make something a totality is that it
starts to fragment inside and and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
starts to fragment inside and and
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.220
starts to fragment inside and and
disintegrates into katashi

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
disintegrates into katashi
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.619
disintegrates into katashi
and so it's it's almost as if we have to

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629
and so it's it's almost as if we have to
 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.559
and so it's it's almost as if we have to
maintain this articulated space inside

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
maintain this articulated space inside
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.990
maintain this articulated space inside
the dream inside the custom something

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
the dream inside the custom something
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.280
the dream inside the custom something
like that because otherwise it doesn't

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
like that because otherwise it doesn't
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.850
like that because otherwise it doesn't
work

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
work
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440
work
and I think that's the same as having

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
and I think that's the same as having
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.420
and I think that's the same as having
respect for the fact that we have bodies

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
respect for the fact that we have bodies
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280
respect for the fact that we have bodies
you know we're not just abstract

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
you know we're not just abstract
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740
you know we're not just abstract
creatures that follow rules we're not

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
creatures that follow rules we're not
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.670
creatures that follow rules we're not
bad at all we only follow certain rules

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
bad at all we only follow certain rules
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.470
bad at all we only follow certain rules
we won't follow the other ones and our

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
we won't follow the other ones and our
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.619
we won't follow the other ones and our
societies will crumble and so and we

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629
societies will crumble and so and we
 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.509
societies will crumble and so and we
just don't know enough to articulate the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
just don't know enough to articulate the
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.420
just don't know enough to articulate the
entire landscape of behavior with

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430
entire landscape of behavior with
 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.180
entire landscape of behavior with
articulated rules not at all we can't do

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
articulated rules not at all we can't do
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.060
articulated rules not at all we can't do
it it's beyond us
