00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:06.233
NARRATOR: Out of water, this
hippo would soon overheat.

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:13.100
But the waterhole
is already full.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.333
It may not look very inviting.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.767
Oxpeckers ravage cracks
in their delicate skin.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.100
And 20 tons of waste a day
has turned it into a cesspit.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.200
But this hellhole
could save his life--

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.266
if he's allowed in.

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:09.233
[hippos growling]

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.133
[dramatic music]

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.467
This resident bull is bigger.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.867
But the outsider is desperate.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:26.300
Five tons of hippo
clash, testing bulk,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.300
bite size, and brute force.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.133
The outsider accepts defeat.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.700
He must venture into the
unknown as the stranglehold

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.300
of drought tightens.
