00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.190
In this lesson we've learned just a teeny bit

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.210
more about ways we can trace through our maternal

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.560
or paternal lines. So in the case of mitochondrial

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.870
DNA we only inherit that from our mothers. So

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.390
you can trace your maternal line back through the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.270
mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondria have been passed down from

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.070
generation to generation. From great-great-great grandmother to great-great to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.530
great to grandmother to mother to you. Now the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.820
same thing is true for the Y chromosome for males.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.950
Every male is genetically XY and he had to have

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.430
gotten that Y chromosome from his father, who got it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.630
from his father who got it from his father, who

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.260
got it from his father, and so this Y chromosome

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.110
has just been passed down. From generation to generation, through

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.910
all of the male line. One of the big distinctions

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.550
here, is that Mitochondrial DNA, everybody has. But the Y

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.910
chromosome, only males have. We're going to revisit these

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.060
concepts a little bit later, in lesson seven.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.300
When we actually try to trace an individual's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.330
lineage, on both his mother's and father's side.
