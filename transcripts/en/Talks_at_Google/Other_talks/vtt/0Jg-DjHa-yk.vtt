00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.690
DAVID LEVIN: OK, today
I'm pleased to introduce

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.460
Jon Morris.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.030
Jon is the first author that
that has us do a finger pop,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.510
so he has that honor, for sure.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.280
He's also been writing humor
and culture-related content

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.690
for more than a decade.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.940
His long-running blog
on failed, ignored,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.490
or just plain weird comic
books gone and forgotten

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.450
contains more than 800 entries
on the abandoned and dusty

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.490
corners of the comic book biz.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.820
Not only did Jon score an
appearance on This American

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.280
Life to discuss what
makes a superhero fail

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.320
to catch the
popular imagination,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.530
but it also provided the
foundation for his first book,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.690
The League of Regrettable
Superheroes, published

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.520
by Quirk Books of Philadelphia.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.140
And that led to
the book he's here

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.787
to discuss today, The Legion
of Regrettable Supervillains.

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:52.620
Please join me in giving
Jon a warm welcome.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.953
JON MORRIS: Thank you very much.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.520
That's good, I
like that applause.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.760
My name is Jon Morris.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.570
I'm the author of The Legion
of Regrettable Supervillain.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.000
It's a collection
of more than 100

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.430
of the weirdest, the wildest,
and the most underrated

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.250
supervillains in
comic book history,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.132
and is the successor
to the book The League

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:15.900
of Regrettable Superheroes
which did the same thing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.650
for the good guys.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.191
And as I mentioned,
I've been writing

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.240
the blog Gone and Forgotten
for 20 years this year.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.300
It's an anniversary.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.140
And all of that has served to
make me a walking encyclopedia

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.570
of weird comic book
knowledge, which

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.210
is a direct middle finger
to my college education.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.110
Tough luck, mom and dad.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.590
You scrimped and
saved for nothing.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.410
This also is my second
visit to a Google campus.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.040
I actually visited the
Mountain View Campus.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.150
That's your corporate
headquarters, right?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.760
Back, it's got to be about
eight, nine years ago.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.370
And it is literally
the one place

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.062
I've been that looks most
like a supervillain's lair--

00:01:58.062 --> 00:01:59.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.939
--complete with metal dinosaur.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.230
And this part I swear is true--

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.930
I had two very lovely young
people guiding me around,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.801
giving me a tour.

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.300
One of the things
they showed me was

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
a concert hall on the
campus with a lone piano.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.737
One of the young
folks, unprompted--

00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:16.820
we didn't ask her to do
this, nobody mentioned it,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.910
sat down and started playing I
believe it's called the Toccata

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.910
in D Minor, it's that Phantom of
the Opera [VOCALIZING] music--

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.700
the most evil thing you can
play on a keyboard instrument.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.840
Which does remind me,
if I'm not mistaken,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.390
the corporate motto
of Google is--

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.650
don't be evil.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.360
Do I have that correct?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.552
All right.

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:40.760
And how many of you are evil?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.540
[SIGHS] Hands, fair enough.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.870
Now the thing, is in the
booming tech industry,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.660
I think it's a mistake
to cut yourself off

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.600
from a potential new
kind of technology,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.070
or a new realm of business.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.820
So if Google does ever
consider going evil,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.640
I have some potential
tech startups for it

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.490
that might be positive
avenues for them.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.890
So we're going to Shark
Tank a few of them today.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.280
I'm going to bring you
five great tech start--

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.290
I'm sorry, I mean
five great evil--

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.960
--tech startup opportunities.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.551
Take notes.

00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:17.300
And if you're in the
corporate department,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.940
my finder's fee is 20%.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.030
Number one, prosthetics.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.860
The prosthetics
industry in America

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.290
is increasing exponentially.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.730
And that fact is terrifying.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.000
Sales of prosthetic arms have
gone up like 300% this year.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.890
And why, and who do we blame,
and how do we stop that?

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.100
But in the meantime, it's
still a growing industry.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.840
And if you're going to look
for your supervillain who

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.790
is most likely to give
you the in on prosthetics,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.300
we're going to go back
80 years to vicious Nazi

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.310
super-criminal-- and
I promise I will often

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.710
make you look at the technology
of vicious Nazi super

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.526
criminals, but we're going
to look at The Crane.

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:56.900
Now, you might
ask yourself, what

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.480
does the character called The
Crane use for prosthetics?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.170
Wings?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.950
A beak?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.210
Knees that bend backwards?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.710
Nope.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.740
Extending telescoping arms.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.902
And I know some of you
might be interested, or work

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:10.610
on prosthetics, and
you are concentrating

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.520
on haptics and neurofeedback
and instantaneous response.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.770
None of you thought about
what it takes to reach stuff

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.700
on the top shelf.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.310
This is the one
supervillain who's

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.400
power is, he never has to ask
an associate for assistance.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.020
He can just get his little
mini fridge for his dorm,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.580
check out, walk
right out of Walmart.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.140
To give more credit
to The Crane--

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.750
and again, I'm not going to
push too much Nazi technology

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.450
on you, but he has
a second invention

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.780
to his credit, the
Nazi-saurus Rex.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.930
This is a metal dinosaur
beholden to the Nazi cause,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.469
and is a robot
driven by The Crane.

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.760
The most wonderful thing
about comic books, by the way,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.830
is, this is an image of a
robot t-rex with a Nazi garter

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.030
fighting a naked stone giant
in the middle of the ocean,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.620
and the giant has a tiny
teenage King on his shoulder,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.040
and a man with telescoping arms
are in the head of a dinosaur,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960
and I don't feel like
I need to explain this.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.530
There's no context that
will make it better.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.580
That's great.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.970
As a runner-up to the
prosthetics industry,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.500
I do want to point out another
character, the Mr. Pointer, who

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.330
kills with the
power of rudeness.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.420
Your mom told you
not to do this.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.190
Mr. Pointer's hand is fake--

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.860
or, it exists, but it's not
a hand as we think of it.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.690
It's hollow, and
it contains a gun.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.040
But it's a special gun.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.310
It's a gun that shoots
frozen slivers of poison

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.080
at the speed of a bullet.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.842
This is a dangerous
man to dapper with.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.800
Well, that didn't work
as well as I was hoping.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.440
Fair enough.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.150
Second field-- wearables.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.180
This is a huge technological
opportunity these days.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.289
You've got your Fitbit,
you have your watches,

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.080
you have your Google
Glasses-- three pieces

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.630
of technology I don't own.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.420
But if I did own them,
I would very much

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.664
want them to be
what The Dude wears.

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.580
The Dude is the best-dressed
villain in comic.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.380
In fact, he's dressed to kill.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.200
That's such a good joke,
they put it right there.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.500
Just as an aside,
The Dude's nemeses

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.700
were Bullet Man and Bullet Girl.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.040
These were police scientists
who invented a metal

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.250
they fashioned into a helmet
that allowed them to fly,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.140
and was hyper magnetic, and
so it attracted bullets.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.690
That's a short
lived use, at best.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.540
The Dude had--
for instance, here

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.960
he's got a hat with
a razor sharp brim.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.830
He's got a cigarette holder
that can shoot darts or gas,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.010
and he's got a cravat, which
is just a really nice cravat.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.860
And the diamond pin explodes.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.450
A couple of the
things he does do,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.360
he has a boutonniere that shoots
burning, corrosive acid gas,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.640
and cuff links that
shoot poison darts.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.020
It's always a big day
in a young man's life

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.490
when his father gives him his
first pair of murderous dart

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.110
cufflinks.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.080
Another field you may have
some interest in, adhesives.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.740
I know that's a little
out of Google's range,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.350
but you can't let 3M have
a throttle on that forever.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.350
Now, in the world of
superheroes, who knows more

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.110
about adhesives than your
friendly neighborhood wall

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.620
crawling amazing
spectacular Spider-Man?

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.010
Who knows more?

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.780
Spider Man.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.570
20 years before Peter
Parker walked face first

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.640
into an angry
radioactive spider,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.940
Captain Marvel was
facing this fella.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.570
His-- I'll walk over
here to point it out.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.680
He tells us that he has
invented an invention which

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.670
squirts out plastic, which
hardens into a sticky thread

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.870
when it meets the air.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.720
And he learned this by
watching spiders at work.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.805
Point of order, spiders
know nothing of plastics.

00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.920
Also, if you ever do
give up, don't be evil.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.020
I weave my webs of
crime everywhere

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.310
is a super good motto.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.630
The delivery vector that Spider
Man uses to fire off his goop

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.860
lacks a little finesse.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.310
It appears to be a pillow with
a fire hose attached to it--

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.510
--or a crippled bagpipe.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.550
The most alarming thing
about this sequence

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.170
is that we learn
in a single panel

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.477
that Captain Marvel has
had taffy all over his face

00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:29.560
at some point in his life.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.809
Also, just a point, some
of you aren't that clever.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.380
I know what that
looks like, too.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.942
Looks like the top searched
category on Pornhub.

00:08:41.942 --> 00:08:43.650
Ooh, that one didn't
go over well either.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:44.656
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:47.030
We're all a little embarrassed
about the category search.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.470
Not a problem, I'll remember it.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.260
Number four, the
internet of things.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.344
This has always been a
huge focus of technology.

00:08:53.344 --> 00:08:55.510
We want every appliance and
every piece of furniture

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.920
to be interconnected so that our
refrigerators can send nudes.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.650
But nobody does it--
there was si-- just

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.984
for the record, silent laughter.

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:05.400
There was so much
silent laughter.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.100
That one worked.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.470
But your inner connectivity will
never top that of Lord Lazee,

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.690
or as I like to call
him, Lord Lay Z,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.120
Like Jay Z, because
he's got 99 buttons.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.949
He also looks real familiar.

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:26.240
I think I see that guy in
the mirror every morning when

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.030
I shave.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.210
Still, Lord Lazee has
a fiendish recliner

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:37.670
with a sort of, frankly,
children's attachable tray full

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.740
of buttons and devices.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.300
And he can do amazing
things with these devices.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.020
He can send warships out over
the capitals of the world.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.400
He can steal satellites.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.500
He can shoot lasers.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.680
And, if there's something that
requires the personal touch,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.730
he can send his robot
double into effect.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.850
Now, I may not have the
confidence of Lord Lazee,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.418
but if I had a robot double,
I'd make him thinner.

00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:01.917
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.120
A little bit.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.130
To give Lord Lazee
a lot of credit,

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.230
he's one of the
few supervillains

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.890
who, in the course of
fighting his foe, wins.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.350
This is him destroying
the Washington

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.990
Monument, and the
hero, utterly helpless

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.340
to do anything about it.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.040
Go Lord Lazee.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.770
However, Lord Lazee has
a rack full of buttons.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.340
There is another villain who
can get it all done with one,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.792
and that's Bloor--

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:31.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.737
--Dictator of Uranus.

00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:35.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.100
I want to plead with you--

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.580
if ever the word Uranus
is not funny to you,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.220
stop laughing at everything.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.471
They're sending a
probe to Uranus.

00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:47.220
You can see Uranus
through this telescope.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.572
(WHISPERING) It's always funny.

00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:51.280
What can Bloor do with
his single button?

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.670
Well, let's walk through it.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.690
He can sound powerful
sirens, he can

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.200
launch entire fleets of rocket
ships to conquer other worlds,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.590
he can make two
huge robots appear,

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.150
and apparently one
not-so-huge robot.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.164
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.164 --> 00:11:09.580
If the caption had
been bigger, it

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.770
would have been-- two
huge robots and one

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.090
of the two huge robot's cousin.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.720
He came along.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.380
We didn't ask.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.730
But most importantly, he can
summon an Amazon regiment

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.940
of fighting women.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.069
Amazon is really reaching.

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:26.860
That's one of the many
things you can order

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.600
with a push of a single button.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.690
And lastly, doomsday weapons.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.955
This is an untested field.

00:11:33.955 --> 00:11:37.420
It's a great opportunity
for Google to blaze a trail.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.430
What kind of doomsday weapons?

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.420
Well, here's Dr. Dracula,
part of a crew of,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.860
and we'll quote here,
vampires as large as men.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.320
Not sure how tall they normally
are, to be perfectly frank.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.980
Dr. Dracula doesn't
invent anything,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.700
but he does steal a death ray
from an American scientist.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.820
A death ray that
is hell on mice.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.370
And for that matter, if you've
ever heard that smoking kills,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.150
it sure does if you're in
the path of the death ray.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.220
Also armed with some
beautiful death weapons

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.900
is Mr. Hydro, the
man made of spit.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.430
He's gross.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.780
He is a fellow capable of
turning himself into water,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.660
and he has a habit of
escaping down toilets,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.340
sinks, and drains.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.120
So my guess is, he smells like
laundry you forgot to take out

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.160
of the wash for two days.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.990
He again, steals his inventions,
created by this young fella

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.680
here.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.250
This includes a death ray
pistol, a disintegrator,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.430
and a gold-maker machine.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.010
But luckily, he
locks it in a vault--

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.326
a vault with a huge
crack on the ceiling

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:49.450
that you can slip through
if you can turn to water.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.070
Nice job.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.700
And lastly, probably the best
known inventor of a doomsday

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.620
weapon, Lepus the Fiend.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.360
This is a creation
of Fletcher Hanks,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.060
a creator that you should look
up because he's bugnuts insane.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.400
I shall destroy all
the civilized planets.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.310
How is he going to destroy
all the civilized planets?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.800
With a ray.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.570
That's how I'd do it.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.610
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is your list

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.730
of potential new markets
for Google to enter.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.266
Again, 20% finder's fee.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.640
Contact me after
the show, I have

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.806
most of these guys' numbers.

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:24.734
Thank you very much.

00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:26.150
DAVID LEVIN: This
book is a second

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.315
in a series of books
about superheroes.

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.730
And how did you start
writing these books?

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.770
JON MORRIS: Well at this
point, it's momentum.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.060
I've been writing about these
weird characters since 1997.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.940
And a lot of--
actually, weirdly,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.460
a lot of the characters in the
book do come from the blog,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.070
but I was able to
find dozens more

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.055
that I had never
even, to be honest,

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:48.930
heard of before I started
doing the research.

00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:53.255
DAVID LEVIN: Also, like
I mentioned in the intro,

00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:55.390
it sounds like
after the blog you

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.590
went on This American Life, and
then Quirk Books, and so on.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.692
In your episode of This American
Life, you had something where--

00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:04.900
there's another piece in
there where John Hodgman ask

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.530
people about whether they'd
rather the power of visibility

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.646
or flight.

00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:11.020
In that sphere,
could you give us

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.450
two regrettable
superhero/villain powers

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.290
to choose between?

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.190
JON MORRIS: I very
much will, but I really

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.648
want to ask everybody
in the crowd.

00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:19.270
So the question is-- this
is John Hodgman before he

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.840
was famous, asking
if you could have

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.642
either invisibility or
the power of flight,

00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:25.600
which would you choose?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.860
How many people would
want invisibility?

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.380
And the power of flight?

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.300
How many people want the
power of invisibility

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.560
so they can steal things?

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.924
There you go.

00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:38.590
How many people want
the power of flight

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.440
so they can save money
on airplane tickets?

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.620
We're simple creatures.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.050
There are a couple
I really like.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.810
I'm very fond of
Batroc Ze Lepair

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.130
who is a French supervillain.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.171
Actually made it into one
of the Captain American

00:14:55.171 --> 00:14:56.400
movies, bless his heart.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.230
He's a master of
savate, which is

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.370
a French foot-fighting style.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.690
And he leaps like a frog, which
is where his name comes from.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.820
Of course, it's Batroc
as in batrachian.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.650
And I very fond of not just his
acrobatics-- because obviously

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.600
I'm not doing
cartwheels every day,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.500
but I really love his
giant handlebar mustache,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.590
and the fact that he speaks with
Marie Chevalier accent, which

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.950
I can never (FRENCH ACCENT)
personally master, myself.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.711
Oh, and then otherwise, Swarm.

00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:28.950
Comics are filled with people
either made of or themed

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.647
about bees.

00:15:29.647 --> 00:15:31.980
Swarm is--and do you mind if
I tell a little story about

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.370
Swarm?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:32.760
DAVID LEVIN: Please.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.426
JON MORRIS: Want to
tell you about Swarm

00:15:34.426 --> 00:15:36.290
because he has the
most avoidable origin

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.540
in the history of comic books.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.650
Swarm is formerly a
Nazi horticulturalist

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.510
who escapes Germany
at the end of the war,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.870
goes to South America.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.330
One night he sees a meteor
fly over his property.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.820
He goes and hunts it down.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.820
He finds that it's crashed
next to a hive of killer bees,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.860
but the radiations
from the meteor

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.400
have made them docile,
easy to command, and twice

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.780
their normal size.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.400
Now, he is a Nazi hoping to
reinvigorate the 4th Reich

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.860
and take over the world,
and he has in front of him

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.310
a meteor that makes
its victims twice

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.070
their size, but
completely docile,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.230
and some fat bees
who want to sleep.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:20.200
And he thinks, (GERMAN ACCENT)
I'm going to take the bees.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.184
And so he takes the bees
back to his laboratory,

00:16:23.184 --> 00:16:24.600
and the first thing
he wants to do

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.140
is teach them to kill
again, which they do--

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.640
him.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.870
And if they actually flense
the flesh from his body--

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.820
because these are
industrious bees.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.070
And then they take
over his body,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.410
and then he is a
man made of bees--

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.870
or I prefer to call, a
man made of Nazi bees.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.910
Now, I could very happily
be made of democratic bees.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.390
I would much prefer that.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.082
But being made of bees seems
to have some advantages.

00:16:52.082 --> 00:16:54.040
If you can name one, I'd
be appreciative, but--

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.980
--mostly it's cool.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.420
AUDIENCE: Lots of honey.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.552
JON MORRIS: Lots of honey.

00:16:58.552 --> 00:17:00.510
DAVID LEVIN: So these
may be hard to summarize,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.792
but I think frog legs,
or made of bees, right?

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:03.500
Which one would--

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.511
JON MORRIS: Frog--

00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:05.719
DAVID LEVIN: Sorry, go ahead.

00:17:05.719 --> 00:17:06.770
JON MORRIS: Uh, bees.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.069
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.568
Bees?

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:08.220
Made of bees?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.200
JON MORRIS: I was actually
fooling when I took a moment

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.950
to think about it.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:11.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:13.500
Because the answer
is bees, every time.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.400
DAVID LEVIN: Made of bees.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.775
JON MORRIS: My
favorite superhero

00:17:15.775 --> 00:17:17.619
from the first book,
if I can zing off,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.170
is a character
called the Red Bee.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.724
This is a golden age character,
came out in the 1940s.

00:17:21.724 --> 00:17:23.849
I'll tell you before I tell
you anything about him,

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:25.500
he was obviously
tongue-in-cheek.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.200
The creators used
the pseudonym B. H.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.320
Apiary for his stories,
the B. H. probably standing

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.280
for Bee Hive.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.370
Still, the Red Bee was an
assistant district attorney

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.620
named Richard
Raleigh who was tired

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.240
of criminals
overrunning his city,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.370
and taking advantage
of the justice system.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.810
So he dressed up in a diaphanous
shirt, stripy leggings,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.590
and went into battle with
a single bee named Michael

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.630
that lived in his belt buckle.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.820
And when he was in
trouble, click, [BUZZES].

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.170
Now you might be asking,
what can a single bee

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.070
do against crime?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.010
He can startle bad guys,
he can sting bad guys.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.750
And one time when the
Red Bee was tied up

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.520
in a shack, Michael [BUZZES]
escapes, finds a razor blade

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.120
on a nearby table, brings
it back to the Red Bee

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.270
so he can cut himself free,
or, reflecting on his life,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.538
maybe kill himself.

00:18:19.538 --> 00:18:21.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.812
DAVID LEVIN: Makes sense.

00:18:22.812 --> 00:18:24.020
We have an audience question.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.853
JON MORRIS: Oh, hey.

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:25.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.930
So it looks like a lot of
the material you look at

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.720
is from the golden
age or earlier.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.460
Do you have-- who's
your most favorite

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.230
recent regrettable supervillain,
and superhero, actually?

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.230
I don't know if you still
read comics regularly.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.938
JON MORRIS: I do.

00:18:37.938 --> 00:18:40.920
You know, the number of comics
I have to read for the books,

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.830
and for Gone and Forgotten,
and another comic book

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.320
blog I write called the
Chronological Superman,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.340
means I--

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.620
about 90% of my comic
reading is really

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.570
focused on the '40s
through the '60s.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.520
It's usually-- there's always a
nice redux to some characters.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.070
One of the characters in
the book is called MODOK.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.440
This is a giant
head flying around

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.610
in what appears to be
a Japanese toilet--

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.570
--with his little arms
hanging out of the side.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.050
And he was always a difficult
character to take seriously.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.681
In recent years,
somebody realized, oh,

00:19:14.681 --> 00:19:15.930
that's actually kind of funny.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.970
And he's become more
of a comedic villain.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.340
I really love that.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.310
And then, this is
not a funny answer,

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.060
but there's a superhero
called the Vision.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.610
I think he's actually been one
of the Captain America movies.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.320
And he just got a great story
by a writer named Tom King.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.180
And it's one of
the best superhero

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.150
comics I've ever read.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.350
So now I couldn't think of a
regrettable one there, but--

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.990
oh, and Squirrel Girl who was
actually in the first book,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.924
and is now the most popular
superhero at Marvel.

00:19:41.924 --> 00:19:44.340
I'm going to take a little
credit for that, just a smidge.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.058
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:47.224
DAVID LEVIN: Let's go for
another audience question,

00:19:47.224 --> 00:19:47.973
since we have one.

00:19:47.973 --> 00:19:49.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.970
So when I look at
your cover here,

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.670
the one that stands out,
that inspires me the most

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.870
is the Horrible Hand.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.170
JON MORRIS: Ah,
the Horrible Hand.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.285
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
if you could share with me

00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:00.680
the story behind that one.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.430
JON MORRIS: I would love
to share my horrible hand.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.400
The Horrible Hand is a villain--

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.980
there's actually a factotum
of a former wizard,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.240
and a foe of a character
called Ibis the Invincible.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.656
Ibis had something
called the Ibis

00:20:13.656 --> 00:20:15.680
Stick, which could make
anything come alive,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.120
and it would obey him--

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.860
which is pretty good.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.280
And the Horrible Hand
was a demon's hand

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.430
that was summoned by one of
Ibis' enemies to kill him.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.010
And mostly what he can do is
do the poking, the pushing,

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.970
the choking--

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.324
the usual hand stuff.

00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:32.240
So you probably could
have just gotten a dude.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.042 --> 00:20:36.500
The reason the Hand is in there,
besides the fact that it's

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.020
a good graphic and it
is a weird villain,

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.530
is that in the first book, there
was a character called the Eye,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.980
was a giant, flaming,
disembodied eye

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.410
that would show up in people's
bedrooms or their living

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.951
rooms when they
weren't expecting it,

00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:53.450
command them to fight evil,
and then pfft, disappear.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.430
And I just thought
between the two of them,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.820
that's a stupendous pairing--
the Eye and the Hand.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.260
Although I think
the Eye probably

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.890
is going to come out the worst.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.122 --> 00:21:06.080
DAVID LEVIN: It's
[INAUDIBLE] the cover, right?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.970
I love the cover.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.804
It feels very nostalgic to
me with the whole little bin

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:11.470
and all the white
dots, and all of this.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.867
Remind me of old comics.

00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:14.450
How did you come up
with these covers?

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.070
JON MORRIS: Well, I was
working in conjunction

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.820
with Tim O'Neill.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.800
He's the designer
at Quirk Books.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.530
Very young guy, just got
out of design school.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.080
And Regrettable Superheroes
was the very first thing

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.340
he designed.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.800
So I'm super proud of him.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.090
And feel very blessed to have
him be the designer on my book.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.360
I will say, I got to
contribute two things when

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.770
we were putting this together.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:40.280
I said, can we make it look like
a really old, worn comic book?

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.590
And can we put a stripe there?

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.290
And I'll count that as a credit.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.972
DAVID LEVIN: But why the stripe?

00:21:48.972 --> 00:21:50.180
JON MORRIS: On older comics--

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.940
so one of my obsessions
that I'll probably point out

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.320
is mastheads.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.560
I really love the design on
old comic book mastheads.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.510
And one of the things
they did for awhile,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.350
each company has done stripes
in one capacity or another--

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.750
big Marvel and DC when I
say the companies, but also

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.704
the old golden agers.

00:22:06.704 --> 00:22:08.120
Sometimes you just
put that stripe

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.970
because, when you're
looking at a rack of comics,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.515
you really only see about
that much of the comic

00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:15.782
because all that's
below the cover.

00:22:15.782 --> 00:22:17.990
And then if you've got a
bunch of comics on the rack,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.720
sometimes you only see
this much of the cover.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.180
So companies used to put little
pictures of the characters

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:23.679
there.

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:25.154
They would put the title there.

00:22:25.154 --> 00:22:27.070
Sometimes they would
just put a colored strip.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.092
There was a company
called Red Band,

00:22:29.092 --> 00:22:31.050
and Red Band always had
their red band on there

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.060
so you could always pick
them out of the crowd.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.130
I always liked those.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.880
DAVID LEVIN: Cool.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.140
Another audience.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.320
AUDIENCE: So a question
more meta about the book.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.780
You've been writing this
blog for 20 years now,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.160
and you really
kind of carved out

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.750
a niche of this subject matter
expert of an unusual subject

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.280
area.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.814
JON MORRIS: I like to think so.

00:22:49.814 --> 00:22:51.230
AUDIENCE: So just
for other people

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.690
kind of interested in
pursuing oddball passions

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:57.489
and fixations and things like
that to their logical extremes,

00:22:57.489 --> 00:22:59.030
could you talk a
little bit about how

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.571
you got into this
in the first place,

00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:03.200
and how you've carried it
through all these years?

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.120
JON MORRIS: I will
say, the number one

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.730
technique for carrying it
all the way through 20 years

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.980
is, periodically say you're
going to take a month off,

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.480
and stretch that
out to three years.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.660
Bless Gone and Forgotten.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.882
I've always enjoyed doing
it, but sometimes life

00:23:16.882 --> 00:23:18.090
gets in the way a little bit.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.798
And I have, probably
out of the 20 years,

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.830
taken about seven years off.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:27.499
But still, it helps to
have a crew of folks

00:23:27.499 --> 00:23:29.540
to test yourself against,
because you will always

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.600
find other people
with weird obsessions.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.160
Andrew Otis Weiss,
Matt Maxwell--

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.930
I blanked on his
name, and Chris Sims

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.810
over at ComicsAlliance
also always do these kind

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.040
of weird comic book things.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.510
And it's really great
to bounce off of them.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.510
Also, if you can get an
enemy in the field, that

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.696
is hugely helpful because you
look at what they do, and then

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.070
sometimes you're
like, hmm, I can

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.410
be funnier about that
very same book, bop.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.140
And you just try to
bury them a little.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.437
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:01.437 --> 00:24:03.770
Not the friendliest advice,
but it's really good advice.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:06.830
DAVID LEVIN: Another
audience question.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.720
AUDIENCE: In the recent
Lego Batman movie,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.070
there was throwaway joke about
all the bad Batman villains

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.374
that have come out in the past.

00:24:14.374 --> 00:24:16.040
Do you feel like
you've influenced this?

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.510
Have they contacted
you and asked, hey,

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.593
can you come up with a
list of weird supervillains

00:24:19.593 --> 00:24:20.270
we used to have?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.220
JON MORRIS: I think there's been
a real turn towards enjoying

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.020
the goofier villains
because we have

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.390
been kind of darker and darker.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.984
When Tim Burton did Batman--

00:24:27.984 --> 00:24:29.650
or actually, when Tim
Burton did Batman,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.170
and when Richard
Donner did Superman,

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.390
their villains, played by big
celebrities, were kind of fun,

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.890
still.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.723
There was something
kind of wacky and weird.

00:24:37.723 --> 00:24:40.360
Even Batman Returns, which
has Danny DeVito turning

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.420
in a amazing, creepy,
gross performance.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.230
It's still kind of funny
and over-the-top and campy.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.385
But what other TV and movie
producers took from that

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:52.510
is trying to make it darker
and darker, and grimmer

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.350
and grimmer.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.790
And I think this
is just backlash.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.206
I think we now like the idea
of really goofy supervillains

00:24:57.206 --> 00:24:59.639
because you can only take
really grim stuff for so long

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:01.180
before you want to
see something that

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.886
makes you laugh a little bit.

00:25:03.886 --> 00:25:06.260
DAVID LEVIN: When I first hear
the term regrettable here,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.540
it just sounds like
something that somebody

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.340
wishes they hadn't done.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.870
That isn't quite the meaning,
I think, you meant for this.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.020
What do you mean by
Regrettable Supervillains?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.270
JON MORRIS: Almost everybody
in here, I like to think,

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.820
had the potential to
become something great.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.430
And actually, a few of
the characters in the book

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.170
are still used, and
are still popular.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.540
Batroc, MODOK, a couple
characters I mentioned still

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.830
show up in the comics.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.730
I think there's a
good chance MODOK's

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.040
going to be in an upcoming Iron
Man or Captain America movie.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.920
But for the most part,
some vaguery of the market,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.830
or a failing publisher,
or just being

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.230
buried in the back of
an anthology title kept

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.920
a lot of these characters from
reaching any kind of potential,

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.340
or reaching the big audience.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.420
And then there are some
that are genuinely awful.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:48.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.510
But they are the
minority in the book.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.510
I always try to find something
that celebrates about them,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.010
because I'd like
to see all of them,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.920
in one fashion or
another, come back.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.270
DAVID LEVIN: Oh.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.720
So you mentioned some
that are genuinely awful.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.480
Which-- could you name
a few of those for fun?

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.330
JON MORRIS: So
comics, of course,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.210
are influenced by the current
events, and about our culture.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.784
And we were at war.

00:26:10.784 --> 00:26:12.200
I guess we are at
war, but we were

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.710
at war with Germany and
Japan back in the '40s.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.690
So you got a lot of Japanese
villains who were awful,

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.180
just terrible
racial caricatures.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.950
And then during the Red Scare,
a lot of Chinese supervillains

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.970
who were equally awful.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.110
And there is one
called Egg Fu, who

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:35.590
is a 40 foot tall egg with
a giant prehensile Mandarin

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:40.450
mustache, who could use it
to-- he beats up Wonder Woman.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.830
He actually kills Wonder
Woman in this story.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.600
But it's a comic book,
so [SNAPS] she's back.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.390
And he was one of those
things where he would

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.850
reverse his Rs and his Ls.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.440
And he had buck teeth,
and he had yellow skin.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.160
And it was a grotesque
thing to look at.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.610
And the problem with them is,
they keep trying to have--

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.365
well, the second problem is--

00:27:02.365 --> 00:27:03.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.680
--they keep trying
to bring him back

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.115
in some fashion or another.

00:27:07.115 --> 00:27:08.740
He was brought back
in the '90s, and it

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.960
was meant to be like, let's
be ironic about the racism.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.090
Not that good.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.760
And then a very good
writer named Grant Morrison

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.290
brought him back.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.390
Didn't call him Egg Fu, made him
an egg-shaped weird scientist

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.950
from another planet.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.550
And it worked until
someone called him Egg Fu,

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.340
and then all of the
associations come flooding back.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.270
So kind of wouldn't-- if Egg
Fu disappeared from the planet

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.747
tomorrow, it wouldn't be bad.

00:27:34.747 --> 00:27:35.580
Nobody would suffer.

00:27:39.582 --> 00:27:41.040
DAVID LEVIN: Some
villains probably

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.970
made it, even though they had
the chance to be regrettable.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.380
Which ones do you think slid
through that little thin line

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.880
there, whatever you
want to call it?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.280
JON MORRIS: I
might make enemies.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.920
DAVID LEVIN: If it's too
sensitive, we can skip that.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.780
JON MORRIS: As a really
big Superman fan,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:03.180
I think I was prejudiced against
putting any of his villains

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.900
in, even though a lot of
them are major goofballs.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.330
His most important-- one of
his most popular villains

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.430
who, his entire run, is
a character Mr. Mxyzptlk

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.766
from the fifth
dimensional land of Zrfff.

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:17.390
And he's a funny
little man in a derby,

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.620
and he's got magic powers.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.150
And I love him and I think
he's a great character,

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.990
but he is-- he looks ridiculous
next to the most powerful

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.030
mortal being in the universe.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.002
And he still wins,
which is great.

00:28:28.002 --> 00:28:29.960
There's a character called
the Prankster, who's

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.580
a pencil-necked, pumpkin-bodied
guy who pulls pranks, scams,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.044
and cons, and he always
gets the best of Superman.

00:28:37.044 --> 00:28:38.210
And I'll tell you this one--

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.970
he's the first villain to
knock Superman unconscious.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.120
And here's how he did it--

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.280
he frustrated Superman,
got under his skin.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.450
He irritated him so much that,
against his better judgment,

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.800
Superman hauled off and threw
a legitimate super punch

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.920
at the Prankster's head, a
shot that would have killed him

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.170
if the Prankster hadn't ducked.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.810
And Superman's fist goes
all the way around and--

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.710
--knocks him out flat.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.500
And there's also Terra-Man,
who was a space cowboy.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.560
And he had weapons like
radioactive tumbleweeds,

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.990
or he had a tobacco
pouch that was a grenade,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.700
and he flew on a Pegasus.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.730
And I-- oh, and he's based
off of Clint Eastwood,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:17.950
and I kind of love him.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.980
So, couldn't put him in.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.296
But yeah, he's made it.

00:29:21.296 --> 00:29:23.870
DAVID LEVIN: And there
were a few villains that,

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:27.380
as a parent I couldn't-- as a
parent of a teenager I did kind

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.340
of relate to.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.824
There was Tino the Terrible
Teen, Sinestro, Boy Fiend.

00:29:32.824 --> 00:29:33.740
JON MORRIS: Boy Fiend?

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.010
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah,
boyfriend, boy fiend,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.202
what's the difference?

00:29:37.202 --> 00:29:37.910
JON MORRIS: Yeah.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.080
If you've got a
teenage daughter,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.330
they're all boy fiends, right?

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.200
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.820
JON MORRIS: Comics,
of course, are

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.640
really reflexive of culture,
and whatever seems to be scary

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.812
and menacing becomes a villain.

00:29:48.812 --> 00:29:50.270
And you have to
keep in mind, these

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:54.650
were all being written and drawn
by men in their 40s and 50s.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.920
And they must have looked at
the Beatles scene and the mods,

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.310
and just went, oh, these kids--

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.160
and actually made
villains out of teenagers,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.470
which is sort of
the opposite of what

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.761
you want to do for your market.

00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:07.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.364
Teenagers love being
told they're monsters.

00:30:10.364 --> 00:30:11.780
So yeah, Tino or
the Terrible Teen

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.050
was the biggest rock star
in the world who ended up

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.700
hating the Challengers
of the Unknown

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.640
because secretly his brother was
a member of the Challengers who

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.240
was murdered.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.870
And so he used his powerful
empire of rock music

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.020
to attack the Challengers
of the Unknown, which

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.150
is the perfect thing
that a 50-year-old thinks

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.050
a young kid would use
as weapon, is like, oh,

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.588
they got that rap music,
and they're on my lawn.

00:30:34.588 --> 00:30:37.879
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:38.670
DAVID LEVIN: Well--

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.230
JON MORRIS: Is that it?

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.890
DAVID LEVIN: That's about it.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.000
Thank you very much for coming.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.365
JON MORRIS: You have a question?

00:30:41.365 --> 00:30:41.865
What?

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:44.320
DAVID LEVIN: Oh, sorry,
one other question.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.310
You can say it, we'll
repeat it up here.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.981
AUDIENCE: What you say is
probably your favorite villain?

00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:51.230
Since you always look at it,
what makes a bad villain.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.550
What makes a really
good villain?

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.466
DAVID LEVIN: I'll repeat
it for the recording,

00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:57.200
but what's your
favorite villain?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.630
JON MORRIS: So I'm
a big fan of anyone

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.620
who gets a little morally
ambiguous because villainy

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.280
is great, and it's
wonderful to have

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.720
a big, over-the-top, campy
arch, even Grand Guignol

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.580
kind of like exciting villain.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.920
But it's great when they
get into a villain's head

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.820
a little bit.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:18.130
Lex Luthor started off his--
first 25 years of his existence

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.090
is just Luthor the evil
scientist, the war profiteer.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:25.330
In 19-- I think it's 1959,
and I should know this

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.165
because I just wrote about
it, he gets a backstory.

00:31:28.165 --> 00:31:30.040
And it turns out he and
Superman were friends

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.510
when they were teenagers.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.260
And it was an
accident that Superboy

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.140
caused that made him
lose his hair and turn

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.380
evil, which happens.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.000
And then this became
a story, really,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.460
about the potential of
this young boy genius,

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.460
and how it was wasted on
this meaningless feud,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.240
and for his ego,
and how it really

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.130
destroyed what could
potentially have been

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.296
someone who saved the world.

00:31:55.296 --> 00:31:57.871
That's a really good background.

00:31:57.871 --> 00:32:00.370
There's also a character named
Bullseye who fights Daredevil

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.450
very often.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.100
And he started off as just--

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.380
like all supervillains
do, he's got a costume

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.120
and a gimmick and a name.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.270
But the more they
interacted, the more we

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.556
learned about Bullseye
has mental illnesses,

00:32:13.556 --> 00:32:15.430
and Bullseye has
hallucinations, and Bullseye

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.370
had a promising career, but
he just has these commands

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.030
and voices, and sees things,
and he has to listen to them.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.412
And it made him more
sympathetic while making

00:32:24.412 --> 00:32:26.620
him a lot more terrifying,
because the fear of losing

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.560
control is always a
big fear for everybody.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.469
There's a couple.

00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:34.760
DAVID LEVIN: Just waiting to
see if anybody else stands

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.360
up quickly.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.526
Looks like we have one more.

00:32:36.526 --> 00:32:37.700
JON MORRIS: We got one more.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.616
No respect for chairs.

00:32:38.616 --> 00:32:40.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.065
AUDIENCE: So I'll admit that
I have spent very, very little

00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:45.877
time of reading comic books--

00:32:45.877 --> 00:32:46.460
AUDIENCE: Boo.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.780
AUDIENCE: So I don't know-- oh.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.849
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:49.682
JON MORRIS: Get out.

00:32:49.682 --> 00:32:51.640
AUDIENCE: I don't know
a lot about the culture,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.670
but some of these just
seem very, very out there.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:33:00.320
Is that-- are people going for
kind of these weird characters,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.470
or is it a function of having
to come up with so many villains

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.270
that they just come out weird,
and sometimes fall flat?

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.312
JON MORRIS: That is it.

00:33:09.312 --> 00:33:10.520
So a couple of things happen.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.130
A lot of the
characters I discussed

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.860
today were all from the golden
age, and there were no rules.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.000
They had just made up the genre.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.900
So everything was possible,
nothing was forbidden.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.830
That's how you get a flaming
hand that just pokes people out

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.910
of windows, because no one
says, that's a little goofy.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.092
Run with it.

00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.300
But yeah, we change our
attitudes every decade or so,

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.050
and the audiences want
something different.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.000
I'm really shocked that
the Joker continues

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.250
to be a very popular
villain, because he

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.340
was very good for the '80s where
we were really into bloodshed,

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.280
and we wanted the villains
to be super bad and evil.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.390
And he had a good comeback in
the 2000s right after September

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.330
11th because we were,
again, looking for really

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.740
objectively evil characters.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.199
And I feel like
we're kind-- wel we

00:33:58.199 --> 00:33:59.990
do have some objectively
evil characters we

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.370
have to deal with in real life.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:05.954
But I feel like in fiction, we
should be a little beyond that.

00:34:05.954 --> 00:34:07.370
But yeah, the other
thing you said

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.380
about having to make so many--

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.020
either of the big two
companies produces 60, 70, 80,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.210
90 titles a month.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.545
And if you're a writer,
you've got to crack through--

00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:18.920
every third, fourth
issue, you've

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.449
got to have somebody new.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.969
So they're just creating
them hand over fist.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:27.409
There was a trend in
the 1960s and '70s--

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:31.320
because editors usually are the
people who flesh out the ideas,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.812
and sometimes name
the characters,

00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:34.270
there was a flood
of characters who

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.000
were clearly named after things
you'd just see on a desk.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.909
There was the Eraser who
got mentioned before, there

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:45.110
was the Human Eraser, there's
Calender Man who was mentioned.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.010
I'm sure there was a
paperclip somewhere.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.210
Oh, there's something
called Paste Pot Pete.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:52.062 --> 00:34:54.925
DAVID LEVIN: Before-- it
even sounds like Spider-Man

00:34:54.925 --> 00:34:57.570
was considered one of these
that was a throwaway character.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.780
Stan Lee's publisher's
like, no way.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.570
It's spiders,
people hate spiders.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.720
It's a teenager, we can't
have teenagers at all.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.803
JON MORRIS: Yeah, him
making Spider-Man a teenager

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.040
was a huge deal.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.040
This was-- it's
not unprecedented.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.920
There were teenage and
child heroes in the 1940s

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.010
and '50s, but making it a
teenager into whose head you

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.005
can go, and really see--

00:35:18.005 --> 00:35:20.180
you know, Stan was channeling
his own teenage fears.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.210
He was pretty young.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.605
He'd been writing comics at 14
back in the golden age-- or 16.

00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.735
But yeah, the story behind
all of Marvel Comics

00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:32.610
falls down to a guy
named Martin Goodman, who

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.560
was the president of the
company, who would go golfing

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.890
with the guys who ran what
we know now as DC Comics.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.320
And they were golfing one
day, and the president of DC

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.570
was just bragging, oh, this
comic book Justice League.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.506
Oh, it's great, we
couldn't be selling more.

00:35:46.506 --> 00:35:48.130
So Goodman went right
into the offices,

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.780
knocked on his nephew
Stan Lee's door

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.600
and says, give me a Justice
League, and walks out.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.624
And then Stan creates
Fantastic Four,

00:35:54.624 --> 00:35:56.290
and he creates
Spider-Man, and the Hulk,

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.854
and with the assistance of
course of Jack Kirby and Don

00:35:58.854 --> 00:36:00.520
Heck and all these
other great creators,

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.340
and Steve Ditko of course--

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.140
and creates a phenomenon,
because basically Martin

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.490
Goodman had a bad day golfing.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:10.060
DAVID LEVIN: Another
audience question.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.650
AUDIENCE: So there's
a lot of stories

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.860
in the golden age of [INAUDIBLE]
where the superheroes were not

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.360
very well-defined,
and they ended up

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.380
with changed powers,
or that sort of thing.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.322
But I'm not aware
of any villains that

00:36:19.322 --> 00:36:20.530
have had that drastic change.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:24.730
Are you aware of any?

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.550
JON MORRIS: So there's a villain
called the Ultra Humanite,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.610
which is a great name,
and he started off

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.142
as actually Superman's
first arguable supervillain.

00:36:33.142 --> 00:36:35.350
Superman when he debuted
went about a year and a half

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:39.210
just fighting crooks
and finks and jerks.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.900
The Ultra Humanite,
when he shows

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.560
as Superman's
physical opposite--

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.850
he's an old, wiry, creaky
dude, and he naturally

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.445
dies at the hands of one
of his own evil plots.

00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:51.640
But he comes back
about a year later

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.910
because his assistants
have transported his brain

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:59.140
into the body of a young
Hollywood actress named Delores

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.066
Winters, which makes,
by the way, the Ultra

00:37:01.066 --> 00:37:03.190
Humanite the first transgender
character in comics.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.940
Pack that one away
for bar trivia night,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.898
it might come in handy.

00:37:05.898 --> 00:37:07.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.970
Frankly, the editorship
and the audience

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.880
were a little not sold,
because this was, again,

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.910
the 1940s, on a man's
brain in a woman's body.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:20.800
So they transplanted him
to a more palatable body,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.290
which is a giant, weird,
mutant monkey creature.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.212
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:25.212 --> 00:37:27.170
So his tremendous intellect
is still his power,

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.961
but now of course he
has the physical power

00:37:28.961 --> 00:37:32.800
of a giant, weird monkey.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.440
That's a real drastic version.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.960
There are powers that
change periodically.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.130
Poison Ivy, one of Batman's
foes is a really good example,

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.660
because when she debuted, she
was just a master of poison.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.660
And so she would scratch
people and poke people.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.580
She had the poison
lipstick gag which

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.350
is always in comics
because you've

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.590
got to have a way for
boys to kiss the girls.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.040
But now she controls plants,
and she makes evil plants.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.970
And now she can make
plants do her commands.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.404
Because someone basically
just looked at that costume

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:02.320
and said, oh, it's got
to be a plant creature,

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:02.950
and just wrote it.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.450
And nobody corrected him, and
pfft, now she controls plants.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.372
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.372 --> 00:38:10.830
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
one of the things that

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.020
makes having a really focused
position on this easier

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.300
is having an enemy.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.790
Is that-- I don't know if
they're actual enemies,

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.767
you probably don't
want to share stories,

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.225
but if it's a
frenemy relationship,

00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:26.503
do you have any good
stories of competitions

00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:28.660
you've done with people?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.690
JON MORRIS: My closest
frenemy is Chris Sims

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.291
over ComicsAlliance,
which started

00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:35.790
because he's been trying to get
one of these books published

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.305
for decades.

00:38:36.305 --> 00:38:38.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.960
Oh, tough luck, Chris.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.810
But I don't have a
story about the rivalry.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.490
I usually just-- I bust on
him a little on podcasts,

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.510
and he busts a little on me.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.580
My favorite Chris
Sims story is, he's

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.530
in West Virginia
or North Carolina,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.720
somewhere that I
don't know what states

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.850
look like in that
part of the country.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.030
And despite that, I was
at an Aaron Brothers

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.050
buying some frames, and I heard
two of the clerks talking.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.469
I heard one of them
say, I have an opinion

00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:08.760
about the new Spider-Man
movie, but I'll keep it short,

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.037
I'm not Chris Sims, here.

00:39:11.037 --> 00:39:12.870
Which is amazing to me
that people were just

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.572
dusting him that, as far I
was aware, never met him.

00:39:16.572 --> 00:39:18.780
So that's one of my favorite--
he doesn't believe me,

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.800
but that's a true story.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.050
And I want you to pass it
around, if you'd be so kind.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.022
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:23.022 --> 00:39:24.480
But there's another
one where there

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.681
was a-- it's a pretty famous
comic creator actually

00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:28.680
whose work I really
appreciate and really liked.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.780
When I was a kid,
I used to copy him.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.840
And he started doing
a wacky comics thing.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.770
And I was just chatting with him
about it, and his was monthly,

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.250
and mine was three times a week.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.730
And I mentioned that,
and he got real angry.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.340
And I can't remember what he
said, but it was really snide.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.459
And I just decided next year
is dedicated to burying you.

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:50.000
I'm going to take
the nuclear option.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:56.430
AUDIENCE: So on all the
examples I can think of,

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.590
the name on the top
of the comic book

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.410
is the hero not the villain.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.890
And villains also tend to be
associated only with one hero.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.400
They don't move
from place to place.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.370
I'm wondering if you
know of any examples

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.720
where a villain has
managed to transcend that,

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:19.006
to become bigger
than just one hero,

00:40:19.006 --> 00:40:20.630
or get their name on the top.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.860
JON MORRIS: If you are
planning on seeing the Justice

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.920
League of America-- it's just
Justice League, isn't it?

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.410
Justice League movie.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.520
Darkseid, the big
bad guy in that

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.940
was originally created just to
be part of this little enclosed

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.480
universe of characters created
by the great Jack Kirby.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.060
And he kind of filtered out
into the Superman universe,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.580
and then he filtered out into
the Justice League universe.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.280
Now he's the big bad
guy for everybody.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.450
Kingpin is another
character who--

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.302
you probably saw him
on the Netflix show.

00:40:49.302 --> 00:40:50.760
He started off as
a Spider-Man foe,

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.817
and he kind of
transplanted over.

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.900
And I will mention, too,
there's a lot of villains

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.250
who get their own books.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.580
In fact, in the '70s,
they were so popular,

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.972
still riding on the
Batman '66 wave,

00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:03.930
that there was a book
called The Secret Society

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:08.752
of Super Villains that featured
25, 30 of these characters.

00:41:08.752 --> 00:41:10.710
All, by the way, all
dressed in weird costumes,

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:11.980
all with explosive powers.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.666
One of them was a giant monkey.

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:14.790
And they were still secret.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.320
But the Joker's had
his own book, Catwoman,

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.090
Harley Quinn have
had their own books.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.480
Kingpin just got a title,
Lex Luthor has had a book.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.010
They get their props and
dues every now and again.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:28.260
DAVID LEVIN: So last question.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:28.820
JON MORRIS: Oh, boy.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.367
You mentioned MODOK as an
example of a supervillain who

00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:33.950
was originally
supposed to be serious,

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.360
but then they realized he
was silly and made him silly.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.170
Are the-- can you think of any
examples of a supervillain who

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:41.785
started out being
silly, but then they

00:41:41.785 --> 00:41:44.610
decided that he was actually
more serious than intended?

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.410
JON MORRIS: Sure.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.380
That is the story of the 1980s--

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.289
--particularly in DC Comics.

00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:55.580
They had an event called the
Crisis on Infinite Earths.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.850
It was their 50th anniversary.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.600
They created a huge,
complicated continuity

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.760
with multiple universes
and multiple versions

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.819
of single heroes.

00:42:03.819 --> 00:42:05.610
And it was incredibly
confusing to everyone

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.870
who didn't grow up reading
them since they were five.

00:42:10.324 --> 00:42:12.240
So they simplified and
streamlined everything.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.340
And that involved making
a lot of the villains

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.590
much more terrible.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.270
Mr. Mxyzptlk I
mentioned earlier,

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:21.930
who's a funny little imp who
torments Superman with magic,

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:26.580
actually after being tricked out
of the universe the first time,

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.090
comes back furious that he's
been tricked-- because that

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.740
wasn't playing the
game right, and he

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.340
becomes a legitimate menace.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.550
I'm blanking on one that
was a really good example,

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.330
so you tell me--
oh, no, that's OK.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.480
The Penguin again, started
off in a little tuxedo.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.110
After 1987, after the
crisis, he comes back

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:50.920
as a dude with filed down
teeth, and he's a cannibal.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.180
That's unnecessary.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.417
I'm OK with a tuxedo--

00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:56.791
again, that was
probably inspired

00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:58.210
by Danny DeVito's performance.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.135
But yeah, they did amp them up
and make them a lot more evil.

00:43:01.135 --> 00:43:03.010
And there is a comic
called Whatever Happened

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.884
to the Man of Tomorrow?

00:43:04.884 --> 00:43:05.800
written by Alan Moore.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.830
And it's supposed to be
the final Superman story.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.720
And it brings back
all of his villains.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.760
And there's a pretty
famous line from it,

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.040
after one of his oldest
friends is killed by two

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.870
of his silliest villains.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.390
And it's-- when the menaces
come back as murderers,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.330
what are the murderers
going to come back as?

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.630
Which, not just a
chilling line, but really

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.550
an excoriating statement
for what comics

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.195
had become by the late '80s.

00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:31.570
DAVID LEVIN: Well,
thank you very

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.280
much for coming and joining us.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.196
JON MORRIS: Thank you.

00:43:33.196 --> 00:43:35.940
[APPLAUSE]
