00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:01.730
JOHN HUNTON: Well, as far as I'm
concerned, the important

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.980
thing about five is that it's
not three, four, or six.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.380
And three, four, or six are each
numbers that have really

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.510
special properties in relation
to tiling the plane--

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.570
so creating repeating
patterns of tiles.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.330
So I brought some props.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.170
And here they are squares.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.440
These are the sort of squares
that we all put on our walls.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.370
And the pattern is
very simple.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.690
And anyone can carry on putting
down square tiles, and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.630
the pattern repeats itself
on, and on, and on.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.220
You don't need instructions
because

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.740
you know how it continues.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.810
Now, suppose you want
something a bit

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.910
more exotic than that.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.630
Let's say you wanted
triangle tiles.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.080
Say your tiles were
triangles--

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.335
like that.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:56.500
Well, you could put the next one
upside down, and the third

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.780
one back the same way.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.260
And then you can continue, and
then you put the next row in.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.430
And you can continue this
for as long as you want.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.020
So that would carry on for as
long as you want, using the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.040
same rule, again and again and
again, just so you know how to

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.250
put down the tiles--
one up, one down.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.430
So that's gonna be the three.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.120
So these are tiles with three
sides, three corners.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.050
Our original squares had four
sides, four corners.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.640
But maybe you want something
more exotic still, and you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.710
want to use hexagonal tiles.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.450
So I can use this
pattern again.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.600
I'll just draw over it.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.480
So there was a hexagon.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.330
You see this red.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.400
And I could have another
hexagon.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.350
It would come in, and that
one, and my third

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.450
hexagon, and so.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.080
And I can continue to put
hexagons down, as well.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.660
This is what the bees know.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.220
And all the bees have to know
is where to put the next

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.390
little cell of their
honeycomb.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.490
So here's the question--

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160
can we use 5-sided?

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.360
So the answer is,
no, we can't.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.200
five sides, equal sides,
equal angles.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.715
So I might put the next
one down here.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.600
And now you begin to
see your problem.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.520
Because the bit I'd have to
fill in around here is a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.920
bigger angle than my pentagon
has at its angle.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.060
I'd get something like that, and
there'd be this little bit

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.300
of extra space.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.165
Now you see, it didn't happen
with the hexagons, because the

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:31.370
hexagons had just that little
bit extra angle.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.210
And so they filled
in these gaps.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.482
So here you'll have another.

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:38.110
And you get another gap.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.160
Triangles, 3-sided figures,
squares, 4-sided figures, and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.260
hexagons, 6-sided figures, are
all good for tiling your wall.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.340
But five, pentagons--

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.250
they're no good.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.950
Six is the last one
you can do.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.070
As soon as you start getting
even bigger figures, again,

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.460
there with many sides, then the
angles become too shallow.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.630
So that the next one would only
have a little bit-- if I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.240
put in another polygon out here
to match that one there--

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.490
I'd end up with only a little
sliver, and I'd never get

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.210
something in there.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.530
So you can't do 7-sided
figures,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.260
8-sided, 9-sided, whatever.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170
The realization there were
problems with pentagons goes

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.100
back a very, very long way.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.210
Kepler knew that there were
problems, and no doubt the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.280
ancient Greeks did, as well.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.530
The ancient Greeks had
a lot of these

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.340
interesting tiling patterns.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210
Kepler made a real concerted
effort to get interesting

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.290
patterns using as small
a number of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.370
different shapes as possible.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.000
And he had something that
was pretty nice.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.300
It contained a lot
of structure.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.290
But it wasn't as good as what
Roger Penrose managed to come

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.220
up with in the 1970s, which was
a tiling using these, plus

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.270
three other shapes--

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.490
shapes appropriate for filling
in these gaps and rules again

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.610
to tell you when to put down a
pentagon and when to put in a

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.850
filling-in shape.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.740
And he was able to come
up with a pattern

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.100
that went on forever.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.680
It had a curious property that
it never repeated itself.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.000
It kept on changing little
bits as you go along.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.360
What Penrose had was he had a
systematic way of filling in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.130
the gaps, and coming up with
a pattern where the local

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.760
configurations of all the
tilings kept on appearing

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.150
again and again-- just
in a different order.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.060
So there were constant slight
changes, but the local patches

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.380
all looked more or less the
same as each other.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.530
And this was the beginning of
the realization that there

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.230
were a lot of different patterns
that had this strange

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.020
property of non-repeating and
yet highly, highly structured.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.400
How do we know patterns like
this never repeat themselves?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.820
That really depends on the rules
that they're given by.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.300
So each one of these has to
come with some kind of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.160
description as to how
you make them.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.250
One of the most common ways in
which patterns like this are

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.580
found are by taking a very
regular pattern, but in a much

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.260
higher dimensional space, and
then cutting through that

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.870
space at an irrational angle.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.010
And the irrationality of the
way you've cut it will mean

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.060
that you'll never get
complete repetition.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.670
Penrose tilings have been the
origin of a lot of excitement

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.160
for some time-- really
since the mid-1980s

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.320
when this story started.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.180
Penrose discovered his tilings
in the '70s, and 10 years

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.180
later they were discovered to
be out there in nature.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.220
And Dan Schlectman found that
he could make an alloy of

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.080
various different
types of metal.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.280
And the atomic arrangements that
went into this alloy, the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.180
way the atoms sat, arranged
themselves on a

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.070
three-dimensional version
of a Penrose Tiling.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.890
It took quite a while for it to
be fully established, but I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.460
guess it now really is
definitively established that

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.660
this is so as he got
the Nobel Prize for

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.130
Chemistry this last year.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.750
BRADY HARAN: Why had people not
found it in nature before,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.160
if there's a natural tendency
towards it?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.240
JOHN HUNTON: Well, this is a
very interesting, perhaps

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.450
philosophic, question about
the nature of language.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.780
Because one good answer--

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.000
I do believe this is
a good answer--

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.690
is we didn't see it, because
we didn't look for it.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.910
I think the story to tell at
this point is the way in which

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.450
some years ago--

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.880
I think it was the 1930s--

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.430
material was found that, with
hindsight, we realized was

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.360
based on similar sort of
non-repeating patterns.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.730
But we didn't have the
mathematics, the pure

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.290
mathematics--

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.110
the geometry had not
be discovered--

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.990
and we didn't have the language
to be able to either

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.540
talk about it or see it.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.070
So I find it a great example of
how science can't see what

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.420
it doesn't have the language
to describe.
