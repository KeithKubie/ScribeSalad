1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.240
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad,

2
00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:06.591
this is a more perfect a mini series a that we're just getting going about some

3
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:10.770
of the ideas and the cases that flow through the supreme court.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.780
And we're going to start the series off with, uh,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.720
with a story that isn't so much a courtroom drama.

6
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.160
This one is about an issue that I think everybody agrees is about to land at the

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.990
Supreme Court. Again, in a big way.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.280
Story comes from reporter Karen Duffin and it begins with a mystery,

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.980
right? Uh,

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.520
<v 1>all right, so we're starting with Maya, right? With Maya Maya Fella.</v>

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.090
I am the director of the death penalty team at reprieve.

12
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.820
Okay. So Maya PFOA lives in London and um, when she was about 25,

13
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.060
she had graduated from college, she was doing some theater things,

14
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:50.080
but she was like having this quarter life crisis and didn't know what to do with

15
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:53.140
her life college, that's Sorta nice central crisis.

16
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.360
And I wrote to a couple of organizations and said, you know, please,

17
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.230
can I be useful to you?

18
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.850
She ended up volunteering at this place called reprieve legal organization that

19
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.240
the death penalty cases, are they like a bunch of lawyers or what do they do?

20
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.640
Yeah, like they do legal work and advocacy.

21
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.750
They've been working on the death penalty for like years at that point to try to

22
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.584
abolish it.

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.570
I've used the death penalty and I viewed it at the time as sort of the sharp end

24
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:20.360
of a series of societal injustices. So anyway,

25
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.390
she's at reprieve. One night,

26
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.080
this was 2010 I was sat in the office and she's sitting there one night and

27
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.470
Clive Stafford Smith who's the president of reprieve or the head of reprieve

28
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.290
calls and says, look, we've got an execution tonight.

29
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.420
There's an execution in Arizona tonight.

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.590
Free Landrigan is set to be put to death for killing Chester dryer.

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Landrigan was found guilty of strangling and stabbing the man in 1989 so Clive

32
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:48.100
says there's an execution tonight and we just found out that the lethal

33
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:52.750
injection drugs that they're going to use, they came from a pharmacy in England,

34
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.550
but we don't know which pharmacy because Arizona refuses to release the name.

35
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.890
Does anyone in the office have some time to volunteer?

36
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.260
Have some time to figure out where those drugs could have come from.

37
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.200
And she raises her hand and she's like, I have 30 minutes, you know, I said,

38
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.000
yeah, sure I've got, you know, I've got half an hour. You know,

39
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.950
I didn't know what I was starting when I started it.

40
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.760
Why they want to find this supplier? Like why does it help them?

41
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.570
Well the drugs that they want to use in Arizona have to be FDA approved.

42
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.530
So if they can find who made these drugs and prove that they are not FDA

43
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.750
approved and they can probably stop the execution,

44
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.360
do they have any reason to think that drugs weren't FDA approved?

45
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.860
It was kind of a hail Mary.

46
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.250
So I started the half hour research task that has taken me now five and a half

47
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:37.480
years and I was trying to figure out with limited information where sodium

48
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:42.370
thiopental could have come from in the UK to get to the u s sodium thiopental is

49
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.880
an anesthetic and for a long time it was one of the most common anesthetics used

50
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.990
in surgeries, but it's also one of the drugs used in lethal injection.

51
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.230
I was sort of, I didn't,

52
00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:56.080
I don't think I knew the puppets of all the resets that I was doing,

53
00:02:56.081 --> 00:03:00.160
but I was doing it very quickly because of course they an execution that night

54
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
Landrigan is running out of time and options and it was, I was in the UK,

55
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.020
so it was the evening, which is morning Arizona time.

56
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.760
We had just a number of hours.

57
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.940
She's like frantically searching through all these like global medical

58
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.680
regulations and you know,

59
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.830
she can't figure out exactly what the name of the company is because there was

60
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.090
no way to know at that point.

61
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.240
But ultimately she does figure out that there are no UK companies authorized to

62
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.691
ship this drug.

63
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:30.520
To the u s there was no effectively no FDA approved supplier of the stuff.

64
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.110
So whatever this mystery pharmacy was, it probably wasn't FDA approved.

65
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.390
And I remember, you know, I emailed that over.

66
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.630
I think we either tend to intern affidavit from me or from Clive.

67
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.430
They write up a quick affidavit,

68
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:47.431
they send it back to the states and the execution that night was stayed like

69
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:51.880
halted when I went to sleep. It had been stayed and I just thought, okay, great.

70
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.810
You know, we've got a bit of time and the next morning I woke up,

71
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.670
I was couch surfing, I was in someone's hand. I turned on wealth service and a,

72
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.343
they announced

73
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.960
<v 2>Jeffrey Landrigan was executed at 2126 hours.</v>

74
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.210
Um, yeah,

75
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.740
his final meal was a piece of steak.

76
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.710
His last words were, well,

77
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.900
I'd like to say thank you to my family and boomer sooner.

78
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.050
It turned out while Maya was asleep,

79
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.810
the state appealed all the way to the supreme court.

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.190
And late yesterday the justice is by a five to four vote lifted the stay of

81
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.050
execution, allowing land are going to be put to death. Last night they was,

82
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.070
was put in place due to concern over lethal injection drugs.

83
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.880
One of those drugs obtained from Britain was not FDA approved,

84
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:49.200
but the u s supreme court did rule that there was no reason to believe that the

85
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:50.730
drug wasn't safe. So jeopardy,

86
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.370
<v 1>I've had a rude awakening. The literal sense</v>

87
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.893
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

88
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.530
<v 0>yeah, that rude awakening would, uh, Send Maya on a journey around the world.</v>

89
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.830
It would get her called out by the United States Supreme Court and it would

90
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:11.831
spark a global conversation about the American death penalty and about those

91
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:16.070
little words, cruel and unusual that are embedded in our eighth amendment.

92
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.820
<v 3>The honorable, the chief justice,</v>

93
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:22.860
and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

94
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.110
Oh, Yay. Yay.

95
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.850
Watson's having good than before. The honorable,

96
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.670
the Supreme Court of the United States red mine to draw on Aaron Canberra

97
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.950
[inaudible] space in this honorable card.

98
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.170
Oh yeah.

99
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.430
<v 1>All right. Back to Karen. So we in London with Maya,</v>

100
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:01.280
who just learned that Jeffrey Landrigan had been executed,

101
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.590
but to understand what she does next,

102
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.180
let me just give you a little bit of context.

103
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.390
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

104
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.950
<v 1>fall of 2010 when Jeffrey Landrigan was executed, the drug that they use,</v>

105
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.390
the lethal drug sodium Theo pentacles, suddenly in really short supply,

106
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.190
there was a nationwide shortage because the only us company that's still made

107
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:26.860
that drug with having like a manufacturing problems.

108
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.920
So they had stopped manufacturing or producing this drug.

109
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.920
So you actually see these emails between states like, Dude,

110
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:37.600
do you have any sodium thiopental California got help from right next door.

111
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.960
Arizona agreed to lend California a cup of death and there's actually been some

112
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.590
one great email exchange between like the California Department of Corrections.

113
00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:52.591
They send Arizona this thank you email writing and I quote you guys in Arizona,

114
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.770
our lifesaver. Buy You a beer next time I see you.

115
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.430
You're a lifesaver. Yes. Come on. Yeah.

116
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.790
So when Jeffrey Landrigan is set to be executed,

117
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.080
Arizona is out of that drug and this is how they end up at this mystery drug

118
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.950
company in London.

119
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.740
So after the execution, my is doing all this research,

120
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:18.590
she said she's calling Pharma companies on through these documents.

121
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.340
And very quickly she learns that the same company that is sending drugs to

122
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.580
Arizona had sent drugs to like lots of different states, wheelchair,

123
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.210
South Carolina, Kentucky, the Fornia and various other places.

124
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.930
They'd actually become one of the primary suppliers of lethal injection drugs to

125
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:34.670
the United States. Wait, tell me again,

126
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.040
why was it so hard to find out information about this company?

127
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.760
So what happens is that um, anybody involved with an execution,

128
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:44.660
your name is kept confidential and states have started keeping companies names

129
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:46.090
confidential to oh I see.

130
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.120
So next she starts calling suppliers and distributors.

131
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.750
Kinda tried to trace like how did this drug get to that company thinking that

132
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.070
maybe that'll lead her to it.

133
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.870
We had figured out it had come originally from,

134
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.630
there was an active ingredients made in Australia.

135
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.460
Some of those was sent over to Germany. The package put into vials,

136
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.300
those were sent over to the UK. There was one company that had,

137
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.710
it has the marketing authorization for the product.

138
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.851
They were sold to another one.

139
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:18.851
That company changed it and then they were sent to this company in England,

140
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.140
which he still can't figure out the identity of.

141
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.430
But then the real breakthrough came just a couple months after Jeffrey Landrigan

142
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:28.700
was executed. I think there was lots of material coming out at that time.

143
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.110
I remember California and the ACR,

144
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:34.070
you've got a batch of documents and in one of these batches of documents,

145
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.780
she finds an invoice and this invoice has a name on it. Yeah, I just,

146
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.810
I just remember getting the court documents and I was,

147
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:44.330
I was working with this very slow Internet connection.

148
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.770
She was actually in Malawi at the time, just sort of, you know, perfectly,

149
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.700
you know, willing the computer to download the documents so I could start,

150
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.840
you know, looking through them and figuring out this stuff.

151
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.320
And those were the documents that had the name of the middleman.

152
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.670
What was it? Dream Pharma Dream Pharma Dream Pharma Dream Pharma.

153
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.420
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So she's in Malawi,

154
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:12.840
so she, you know, rings up her colleague and says, can you go,

155
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.960
just look at this place. It's in West [inaudible] London

156
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.790
and it's this um, residential area,

157
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:23.000
but also like with sort of warehouses kind of class.

158
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.220
You have a couple of petrol stations,

159
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:28.610
a couple of cafes and then this pharmacy,

160
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.780
except that it doesn't look like a pharmacy because it's got a big sign on the

161
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:36.260
front that says, uh, l gone driving academy.

162
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.903
<v 5>You can try and</v>

163
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:44.230
knock on the door of the gum driving academy.

164
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.480
<v 1>This is Nina Paris. She's a freelance producer in London.</v>

165
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.260
<v 5>It doesn't look too good as is. There's a</v>

166
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.090
tiny little storefront by the,

167
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.260
can't see any evidence of driving. And if you walk in,

168
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.393
hello,

169
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.220
<v 1>you walk in and in the front it's just this reception area, but in the back,</v>

170
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.640
<v 5>hi, I'm, I'm looking for dream farmer.</v>

171
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.730
Is that you? Hi, I'm recording.

172
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.710
<v 1>Well, there's a guy sitting at a desk. His name is many Alavi.</v>

173
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.800
He's in his fifties, gray feathered hair, kind of like square glasses.

174
00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:24.850
Looks a little bit like William hurt. He is dream Pharma. In other words,

175
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.960
the company that is helping prop up the death penalty system in America.

176
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.000
It's a one man operation operating out of the back of a driving school.

177
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.760
One Guy, one guy. And I thought,

178
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.720
well this can't be true,

179
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.310
<v 5>but they're interested in speaking to you, um,</v>

180
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.430
about the injections for that you supplied to the states from the get go?

181
00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:54.730
I had no comments and I still have no comments. So,

182
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.350
um, what was it like when the brief, uh, came to find you?

183
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.900
Ask them yourself, what was it like for you? Ask them for yourself.

184
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.710
Okay.

185
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.210
Are you still supplying the states with no

186
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.410
rights? Did you, were you aware of that? It wasn't illegal at that point, right?

187
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:19.450
So then it became legal? Correct.

188
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.590
Would you mind me asking how you came to get involved in that in the first

189
00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:28.090
place? How they came to find you or you to find them? They found me.

190
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.190
They found you. Wow. Were you surprised when they got in contact with you?

191
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.923
I don't know,

192
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.840
but I guess it unraveled somewhat to

193
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.500
no further comments. Okay. Well, thank you very much for

194
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.571
doing that.

195
00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:56.140
And thank you for bringing me to acting cause I very much enjoyed walking around

196
00:11:56.141 --> 00:12:00.220
that in the meeting. People around here. Okay. Yeah. So at what do you,

197
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.780
what do you sell now? [inaudible] your case.

198
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.570
I'm just quite interested, isn't it? As a citizen of London,

199
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.840
you're 11 you're not in the business. That's irrelevant to you. Okay.

200
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.280
Okay. Well thank you very much for your [inaudible]. Sure.

201
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.380
And what was your name again? Please will know my name if not, find out. Okay.

202
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.500
Thank you very much. Well they year. Bye Bye.

203
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.740
Do you think actually do driving lessons?

204
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.980
You don't do driving lessons?

205
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.370
<v 1>It's Maya and reprieve. Found that guy,</v>

206
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.340
meti Alabi in his pharmaceutical broom closet of death.

207
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.050
The next step was pretty simple.

208
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.430
They went to the UK government and they told them because in the UK it's illegal

209
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.620
to be part of capital punishment in any way.

210
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.430
We have a law that prohibits exports of product

211
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.670
<v 5>for the facilitation of capital punishment or torture.</v>

212
00:12:55.671 --> 00:12:58.700
It's called the torture regulation, anti torture regulation.

213
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.860
With this text you need in the world.

214
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.370
The EU is profoundly committed to the fight against torture on the death

215
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:07.700
penalty. And when they realize

216
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.270
<v 1>that the sole purpose of the export of this drug was for executions,</v>

217
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:16.730
they put an export control in place and just like that,

218
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.020
the supply of this drug is turned off. So the states are just out of luck. Well,

219
00:13:21.021 --> 00:13:21.381
I mean,

220
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:25.070
60% of Americans support the death penalty so that they're not going to give

221
00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.350
this up without a fight. And so

222
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.580
over the next few years you have like this arms race,

223
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.550
Missouri says we're going to find the drug in Germany.

224
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:39.551
So Maya goes to Germany and then she hears that a company called Hospira is

225
00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.840
about to make the drug in

226
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.670
<v 5>eight to eight. And so I spent a bit of time there.</v>

227
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.530
The Italian government really didn't want drugs made in the seat of the pope to

228
00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:55.370
be, um, dues for execution. The Hospira aspects person said,

229
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.940
we cannot take the risk. That's,

230
00:13:56.941 --> 00:14:01.580
we will be held liable by the Italian authorities if the product is diverted for

231
00:14:01.581 --> 00:14:03.140
use in capital punishment. Yeah.

232
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:07.960
<v 1>And then Denmark, bunch of states, Florida, Ohio,</v>

233
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:09.340
Alabama, 11 other states,

234
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:11.880
they all decide they're going to get their drug from this company called Linde

235
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.490
back. Maya calls them up and I remember my first call with that. She was like,

236
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.670
um, did you know that your drugs being used in executions? And they were like,

237
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:19.360
what?

238
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.560
<v 6>It certainly came as a huge surprise for us. This is Andrew Schroll,</v>

239
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:26.120
he's vice president for communications at booned bag.

240
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.710
We have been a in the Pharma Industry for a little more than a hundred years and

241
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.320
we are here to save people's life.

242
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.180
This was a complete opposite of the intention of this product.

243
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.000
<v 1>And Maya says that she heard the same thing all over the world.</v>

244
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.710
Even when states like Nebraska and South Dakota go to India to get their drug.

245
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.970
And it's interesting in India because India has capital punishment.

246
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.610
So this isn't an objection to capital punishment.

247
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.010
This is from every company I've spoken to in India. They say, but why?

248
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.090
Why would they use medicines? Like if you're going to kill someone,

249
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:05.924
just kill them.

250
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.850
Why are you using something that saves lives to do it?

251
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.880
And actually there's a really interesting story about why we do it that way.

252
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.070
<v 7>Oh, Yay. [inaudible]</v>

253
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.950
<v 8>that's coming up on more perfect.</v>

254
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.830
<v 9>He's from Washington, from snap, snap, Dakota live walks,</v>

255
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.290
Nashville Wyman theater flooding March 16th and I'm bringing the best Doritos in

256
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:44.060
the world. Fry laughs a more amazing night out. And yes,

257
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.720
she's coming. The funniest woman in the world. Jen Kober.

258
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.420
I do my hung in the lady forest, Jen Cobra rocks a brand new story.

259
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.300
GIG tickets. It snap judgment that org.

260
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.870
I've never gotten applause for it before. If you guys could call my mom,

261
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:01.640
that'd be awesome. She's still pissed.

262
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.270
<v 1>I am Jen. I boom Rod, this is more perfect.</v>

263
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.710
A mini series about some of the ideas in cases that are flowing through the

264
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.890
supreme court. Back to our story from reporter Karen Duffin.

265
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.060
So we left off with Maya in India and they're wondering why do you guys use

266
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:20.720
drugs to kill people? Why? Why would they use medicines?

267
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.300
So what is the answer to that question? Why do we, well,

268
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.210
the answer to that goes back to this guy named bill Wiseman.

269
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.390
It's a terrible thing to have. One,

270
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.630
it's reputation and B, B, based on, on, uh,

271
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.770
coming up with a new way to kill people,

272
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.910
Bill Weisman was a rising star back then. He loved politics.

273
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.320
Wiseman died in a plane crash in 2007 and this is him in an interview with a

274
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:50.090
reporter named Scott Thompson on t v in Tulsa back in 2005.

275
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.890
So what is, what's Bill's story? So he grew up, um, his dad's a minister,

276
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:57.950
his GRANDPA's a minister and he's like, I don't want the family business.

277
00:16:57.951 --> 00:17:00.650
And he wanders for years. He, he by his account,

278
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:04.280
wanders through like two and a half literature degrees. He becomes a poet,

279
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.130
he drinks a lot of corn liquor and you know,

280
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.100
he finally ends up in construction where he starts working with politicians and

281
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.120
he's like, oh, this is my calling. I want to be a politician.

282
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:19.121
So he gets elected to the Hook Oklahoma state legislature in 1974 and he's

283
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.180
opposed to the death penalty. And Luckily for him, this had just happened.

284
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.640
The Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional today and spared

285
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:31.040
the lives of 600 men in death row cells across the country.

286
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.510
In 1972 the supreme court actually abolished the death penalty because they said

287
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:40.511
it was being applied unfairly or haphazardly in a way that could only be called

288
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.010
freakish. So Bill Wiseman is in the Oklahoma legislature and he's like, great,

289
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:48.080
this is not a problem I'll ever have to worry about.

290
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.000
The problem is the public is furious about this decision.

291
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:51.540
<v 9>Okay.</v>

292
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.230
<v 1>Support goes from 50 to 63% in just two years.</v>

293
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.670
Death penalty should be reinstituted. Yes, I think so. Absolutely.

294
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.600
I very much in favor of Holly in favor of it and we get some law and order enter

295
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:05.990
this country. There's people writing furious. I bet.

296
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.250
I don't think you should have taken it away in the first place.

297
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:11.580
And almost immediately, 35 states rewrite their death penalty laws,

298
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.860
essentially saying like, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can do this. Right.

299
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.460
And in 1976 the supreme court says, all right,

300
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.970
if you can administer the death penalty fairly and humanely,

301
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.013
you can have it back.

302
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:28.240
So 1972 the death penalty is abolished in 1976 it's reinstated.

303
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.270
Bill Wiseman gets elected smack DAB in the middle of this. So you know,

304
00:18:32.271 --> 00:18:36.920
in 1976 suddenly there's a bill in the Oklahoma state legislature about whether

305
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:39.980
to reinstate the death penalty and bill has to vote on that.

306
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.190
<v 10>I know the capital punishment, it just, it doesn't work.</v>

307
00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:48.520
Doesn't make sense. I couldn't see any way to justify it.

308
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.080
I also knew that if I'd voted against it from my district,

309
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.830
I would run a high chance of getting whooped

310
00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.770
<v 1>because 80% of his constituents were in favor of the death penalty.</v>

311
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.180
After all that wandering, he finally found this job that he loved. I was just

312
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.950
<v 10>best time and I didn't want to get whooped. So I was in a real dilemma.</v>

313
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.700
What'd you do? The wrong thing.

314
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.360
He voted to reinstate the death penalty for whatever reasons of ego or vanity or

315
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.110
need or the motivation to get reelected to whatever the reasons.

316
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.300
I knowingly made a decision when I knew it was wrong.

317
00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.390
And that's, that's tough.

318
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:33.963
<v 9>Nope.</v>

319
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.890
<v 1>So he's in the legislature and he's feeling like he just sold his soul and as</v>

320
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:43.190
they're debating various amendments to this law,

321
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.340
someone brings up something sort of vaguely about a more humane way to execute

322
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:51.870
people. And he's like that. Yes. That, and he becomes obsessed with this idea.

323
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.210
Oh, it's like a way to assuage his guilt. Yeah.

324
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.120
So he rings up some anesthesiologists and doctors and says,

325
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:59.160
I want to find a better way to do this. And they say,

326
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:02.280
we can't help you because the, you know, hippocratic oath do no harm.

327
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:03.660
Death is a little bit of harms.

328
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.690
So he goes to the state medical examiner at guy named Jay Chapman and Jay just

329
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:09.241
sort of like,

330
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.770
freestyles is one line that that bill literally just sits with a yellow legal

331
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:14.420
pad and, right. Yeah.

332
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.020
<v 10>It's word for word. It said a, uh, um,</v>

333
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.500
an intravenous saline drip should be established to a,

334
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:23.810
into which would be introduced a, uh,

335
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.130
ultra short acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic.

336
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.830
<v 1>The idea is that these three drugs would allow them to execute people but,</v>

337
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.190
but painlessly and right there in that office with just like this yellow legal

338
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:41.370
pad, they invent lethal injection in America.

339
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.240
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

340
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.240
<v 1>it would be hard to overstate just how important this moment in this office is</v>

341
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.350
because you know,

342
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.540
the supreme court had just given the country back the death penalty on the

343
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.350
grounds and the ideal that we could, we could do this right.

344
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.070
And what bill has just handed America is,

345
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.910
is that a way to have the death penalty but, but have it be humane,

346
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.620
the ideal penalty. Yeah.

347
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.620
So Oklahoma adopts it and then the very next day Texas does and then dozens of

348
00:21:15.621 --> 00:21:17.840
states. And since that moment,

349
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.040
88% of all executions have been done by lethal injection.

350
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.000
I don't hear the word lethal injection or execution or anything else without

351
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.160
feeling a tug cause it, it's tied to me. I'm in, I'll always be tied to it,

352
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.450
which he lives to regret.

353
00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:36.320
He thinks that he actually extended the life of the death penalty and he

354
00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:37.850
actually eventually quits his job,

355
00:21:37.851 --> 00:21:42.851
becomes a pastor and becomes a very strong anti death penalty advocate.

356
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.120
How does the man who came up with the recipe for lethal injection or does he do

357
00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.820
on Judgment Day and the same thing everyone else does?

358
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.490
Throw ourselves on the mercy of God.

359
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.420
Say that we have done wrong and we're sorry.

360
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.800
And the thing that I find really interesting is that if you look at the modern

361
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:07.950
lethal injection cocktail, it's three drugs, the firstrex buster,

362
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.731
nice the ties you,

363
00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:12.930
the second drug paralyzes you and the third drug is the asset that stops the

364
00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:15.720
heart and kills you in this drug cocktail.

365
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:18.930
You kind of see everything that we want and need from the death penalty,

366
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:23.100
just kind of all mixed together. The third drug,

367
00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:26.070
the drug that stops your heart, that's kind of our sense of justice.

368
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.560
The first drug, the anesthetic,

369
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.450
that's kind of our sense of humanity or kindness. That second drug,

370
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.340
the one that paralyzes their muscles. The second drug is purely cosmetic.

371
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.370
It serves no medical purpose.

372
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.400
The reason it was put into the lethal injection cocktail in the first place was

373
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.340
so that if the first drug doesn't work effectively,

374
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.060
the second drug will mask any signs of visible suffering and it would be

375
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.470
extremely significant because the potassium cried.

376
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.540
This potent acid that people have described as being like fire going through

377
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:11.210
your veins and being burnt alive from the inside. She says,

378
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.110
just imagine that that's happening to you,

379
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.710
but something goes wrong with the anesthetic and you become conscious.

380
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.770
You have this burning acid going through your body and you are paralyzed.

381
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.550
All your voluntary muscles are paralyzed. So you can't say, I'm awake.

382
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.130
I can feel everything. This is agony.

383
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.510
She says that it's that second drug that is both the thing that could make the

384
00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:38.490
execution most torturous. And the thing that meant that we,

385
00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:39.690
the witnesses, the viewers,

386
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.100
the public wouldn't know that it was torture because we weren't supposed to know

387
00:23:44.101 --> 00:23:45.980
that. So does she

388
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.180
<v 11>end up going after that second drug, the paralytic? No, actually she,</v>

389
00:23:49.181 --> 00:23:52.670
she goes after the first drug, the anesthetic and it's total coincidence.

390
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:56.450
This is just the one that had manufacturing problems that started the arms race,

391
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.370
but it turns out that this drug, sodium thiopental,

392
00:24:01.371 --> 00:24:05.360
the anesthetic is the one that's the most constitutionally important drug

393
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.930
because in 2008 when the supreme court ruled on lethal injection,

394
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.550
they said parties agree that successful delivery of the first drug is necessary

395
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.150
to prevent the prisoner from experiencing severe pain.

396
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.800
<v 1>So there's no anesthetic, there's pain which would be too severe.</v>

397
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:24.770
And then B, therefore what an eighth amendment violation.

398
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.990
Coral unusual punishment. Exactly. So that drug, the anesthetic is the key drug.

399
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.670
But over the past five and a half years as Maya has like whack of mold her way

400
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:36.200
across these different companies,

401
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.320
she's just made it harder and harder to get there.

402
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.500
Now 20 plus companies who have,

403
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.520
they've said we disapprove of the misuse of medicines and executions and we're

404
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.940
going to take steps to prevent it and that has stayed scrambling.

405
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.950
<v 12>The drug use did a 32 death penalty date or now running out.</v>

406
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:57.430
They have run out of drugs. And as a result,

407
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.020
what you've seen is that things have gotten very DIY,

408
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.010
are changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of

409
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:07.310
execution. Prison officials are in a difficult position,

410
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.120
<v 1>even have the DA start rating prisons complicating the drug during the import</v>

411
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.980
process because they're essentially using illegal drugs at this point.

412
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.400
And so reporters are just starting to pay more attention.

413
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.360
And in the middle of all that, he began kicking his feet,

414
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.240
lifting his head and his chest off the gurney grimacing.

415
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:31.010
You also get scenes like this clinching a season and a couple of moments,

416
00:25:31.011 --> 00:25:31.850
he actually mumbled,

417
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.720
he would open his mouth and you'd see his chest move and it would go all the way

418
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:40.330
down to his stomach. So it was a clear gas. Yeah. April 29th,

419
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.260
2014 in Oklahoma, a man named Clayton Lockett was being executed for murder,

420
00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:48.090
rape, and kidnapping block. It's execution used in new drug combination,

421
00:25:48.091 --> 00:25:51.780
whose source is unknown. He was sedated and declared the unconscious,

422
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:56.180
but he started thrashing, clenching his teeth and started losing the arm.

423
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.580
It took him 43 minutes today, grisly, horrific spectacle,

424
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.910
and this kept happening after an hour and 57 minutes.

425
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:09.710
The state pronounced him dead. You had situations like this in Arizona, Ohio.

426
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.090
This drug formula is unconstitutional because people started filing a bunch of

427
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:18.820
lawsuits and one of these eventually got to the Supreme Court case,

428
00:26:18.821 --> 00:26:23.821
1479 55 blossom and interestingly when it got to the Supreme Court.

429
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.060
Yup. I mean let's be honest about what's going on here. Things got very tense.

430
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.420
This is Justice Alito is saying essentially, come on guys,

431
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.390
this isn't actually a problem. You made it a problem.

432
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.290
Executions could be carried out painlessly. There are many jurisdictions,

433
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.970
there are jurisdictions in this country,

434
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.670
their jurisdictions abroad that allow assisted suicide.

435
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.190
Now the have gone through two

436
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.210
<v 13>different drugs and those drugs have been rendered unavailable by the</v>

437
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:52.590
abolitionist movement and this is justice Scalia or putting pressure on the

438
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:57.591
companies that manufacture them so that the states cannot obtain those two other

439
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:01.170
drugs and now you want to come before the court and say, well,

440
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:04.320
this third drug is not 100% sure.

441
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.300
The reason it isn't 100% sure is because the abolitionists have rendered it

442
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:11.760
impossible to get the hundred percent short.

443
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.910
Is it appropriate for the judiciary to countenance what amounts to a guerrilla

444
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:21.620
war against the death penalty? What do you think he means by that

445
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.400
<v 1>guerrilla war efforts? Thank you. Yes. Trying to say there are ways to to,</v>

446
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.700
if you want to make the death penalty illegal, you have ways to do it.

447
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.030
You can call your legislator, you can pressure them, they can pass a law,

448
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:38.070
but you're trying to like hide in the trees and like pulled drugs off and make

449
00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:42.690
them so scarce that you're forcing a legal problem that doesn't exist without.

450
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:47.691
You should not have bearing on whether it is concierge answer to the question.

451
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.500
You've been interrupted several times. The justices called you guys out,

452
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:55.980
kind of. You know, it's, look, you know,

453
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:59.940
there's a lot of narrative around this being guerrilla activism,

454
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.170
but this has nothing to do with me or anyone else.

455
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.580
It's that the companies don't want their medicines used in executions.

456
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.760
The manufacturers, the distributors, the pharmacist, the anesthesiologists, the,

457
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.630
you know, European governments or whoever else. It might be the Indian industry.

458
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.340
None of them asked to be part of Ohio's capital punishment machine.

459
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.700
<v 0>But isn't there an argument to be made here?</v>

460
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.450
I mean I get what she's saying that like all these different people in different

461
00:28:25.451 --> 00:28:29.290
countries have been like unknowingly drafted onto Ohio's execution team,

462
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.151
which doesn't seem fair,

463
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:35.151
but isn't there an argument to be made that like even so the effect is that she

464
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:41.121
has taken a death penalty that is kind of humane maybe and made it more cruel.

465
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.690
I mean, cause that's kind of the accusation, right?

466
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.680
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's, I'm going to say two things. One of them is a throwaway.</v>

467
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.120
Um, she didn't cause it. She's,

468
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.510
the states are chasing the companies and she's chasing the states. Right?

469
00:28:53.511 --> 00:28:56.660
So like you can't say that she caused it, but what you, more importantly,

470
00:28:56.661 --> 00:29:01.661
what you also can't say is that it is actually more cruel because there's no

471
00:29:01.671 --> 00:29:05.180
evidence that there's been an increase in botched executions.

472
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.470
What I think is happening is just that we're paying more attention to lethal

473
00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:11.690
injection. Right. We're just looking at it more.

474
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:12.051
<v 0>Oh,</v>

475
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:15.170
you mean like it's botched executions have been happening forever and we're just

476
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:16.004
now noticing them.

477
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.670
<v 1>Yeah. Nonetheless,</v>

478
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:21.360
people do accuse her of making this more cruel and not just because of the

479
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:26.310
drugs, because states in their sort of desperation to still be able to do this,

480
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.290
are looking for other ways to do it.

481
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.350
And some of those ways might seem like we're going backwards.

482
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.320
<v 0>The lady that was, uh, spearheaded the, getting rid of the injections,</v>

483
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.630
all she did is basically forced people to be shot.

484
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.720
This is Paul State Representative House, District 13, Utah.

485
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.370
He says one day he was sitting in his office that was actually listening to the

486
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:51.250
local NPR station and federal judge in Oklahoma is,

487
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.690
and they were talking about European pharmaceutical companies used to provide

488
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:59.070
this controversial drug, but now refuse to sell it to American prisons. Ah,

489
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.380
the European drug companies no longer selling the drug cocktail.

490
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.780
And so I called our department of corrections and says, Hey,

491
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:08.290
do we have access to the drug? And they said, no, we don't. Uh, you know,

492
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:11.500
we have a set amount and then we're out. He says, he hung up the phone,

493
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:13.810
did a little bit thinking, a little bit of research,

494
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.680
kind of deep into the history and, and eventually he came to the conclusion,

495
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.630
well, let's revert back to the firing squad.

496
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.960
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

497
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.220
<v 0>do you mean like firing squad John Wayne firing squad?</v>

498
00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:26.480
Like line up against the wall?

499
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.300
<v 1>No, it's like they have a chair and they bring the person into the room and they</v>

500
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.830
strap them to the chair. They put a hood over their head.

501
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.580
<v 0>Physician will locate the heart and they'll pin a target where the heart is.</v>

502
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.850
And then there's five men with rifles and one of them has a blank.

503
00:30:38.851 --> 00:30:41.990
But none of them know which one it is. And then on the, when the orders given,

504
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.250
they all shoot the individual in the heart.

505
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.520
<v 1>Law Makers in Utah have voted to bring back executions by firing squad if lethal</v>

506
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:55.000
injections are not readily available. All races,

507
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.670
he was just trying to solve a problem.

508
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.650
<v 0>But I was completely taken off guard by the media frenzy that cruel holdover</v>

509
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.150
from the state's wild west days that happened to create relic of old West

510
00:31:06.151 --> 00:31:09.970
justice, real n. It's international condemnation by the unitize.

511
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.300
A document now is an embarrassment of barbaric.

512
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.580
We shouldn't be shooting our people. This is ridiculous.

513
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:17.800
This is not the time of Moses.

514
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.320
<v 1>Why is it that the, that do you think the firing squad itself,</v>

515
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.150
it created this response?

516
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:29.030
<v 0>Well, it, it's brutal. You know, it's, it's certainly not the easy,</v>

517
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.590
give them a couple of injections and they quietly go down. You know,

518
00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:37.130
this is calling it for what it is. In fact, Paul would argue,

519
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.670
if you want to look at at something that's more humane, he definitely,

520
00:31:40.671 --> 00:31:42.800
the firing squad of what a

521
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.540
<v 1>caught my attention was that it was so sudden, so quick. Ah, boom, boom.</v>

522
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.440
Just like that.

523
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:52.400
These are reporters talking about witnessing at firing squad execution in Utah.

524
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.950
It was over pretty quickly.

525
00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:58.370
It was cleaner than I expected and it was fast.

526
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:03.000
<v 0>With the firing squad, you know, you're, you're dead within seconds of the,</v>

527
00:32:03.001 --> 00:32:06.720
of pulling the trigger five bullets directly to the heart. It's over.

528
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.180
There's not the paralytic that hides it. It's done.

529
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.700
<v 15>But, but he moved, he moved a little bit. And</v>

530
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.610
<v 1>to some degree that bothers me.</v>

531
00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.020
<v 15>Yeah.</v>

532
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.020
<v 1>That seemed to carry on the last a 60 to 120 seconds.</v>

533
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.113
<v 3>Okay.</v>

534
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.930
<v 0>So this is how you tie, has chosen to solve the whack-a-mole problem. Yeah.</v>

535
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.600
And the firing squad has already been upheld by the Supreme Court.

536
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:40.010
We have approved electrocution. We have death

537
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.580
<v 1>by firing squad cats, Justice Scalia. In 2008,</v>

538
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:47.040
the Supreme Court actually approved the firing squad in 1879.

539
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.510
No local jurisdiction the first time.

540
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:52.190
And the people who are part of the firing squad are actually volunteers.

541
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.330
Do you have a lack of volunteers or an abundance of volunteers

542
00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.870
<v 16>in abundance? I know the last death penalty, they had hundreds of,</v>

543
00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.420
nobody's forced to do it. As you know, there, there are people that are willing,

544
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.170
they kind of see as their civic duty, uh, you know, to help carry these out.

545
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.940
<v 1>And while I was down there, I actually asked Paul,</v>

546
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.090
I really want to talk to a volunteer member of the firing squad.

547
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.210
If you'd put me in touch with somebody who's actually been involved with the

548
00:33:16.211 --> 00:33:19.270
firing squad when we're done, let's call my office. I'll call somebody. Okay,

549
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.470
uh, I'm gonna wait til this thing. Passionate about go.

550
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.740
That's an air 16 pillar four split bombing. Right. All right. I like it.

551
00:33:28.741 --> 00:33:32.070
The founder of freedom, but this is Kenny. We agreed not to use his last name.

552
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.730
And Ken's Dad ran the firing squad for a couple of decades.

553
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.960
<v 16>So as you see, there's two cottonwood trees over here.</v>

554
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.740
Those old cottonwood trees they'd set up and that's where they would drill the

555
00:33:41.741 --> 00:33:45.280
firing squad at. These men were selected because for one,

556
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.990
there are absolute marksman too. They just hadn't moral clarity,

557
00:33:49.991 --> 00:33:53.890
just they, many of them did not want to be on there,

558
00:33:53.891 --> 00:33:57.760
but once they were called, they felt obligated to see it through.

559
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:01.320
<v 1>Ken told me that on execution days, his dad and the other shooters,</v>

560
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.480
they would sit down together at the kitchen table

561
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.190
<v 16>and you know, it's just like a little family family breakfast and his mom,</v>

562
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.660
she'd make coffee and she would do scones or biscuits and gravy and she wanted

563
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:15.620
those men to know that it wasn't easy and that she appreciated him.

564
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.310
I know there was a lot of prayer full times around the house when those men are

565
00:34:20.311 --> 00:34:24.350
over getting ready. I know that, uh, I,

566
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.570
it's pretty solemn moment. I,

567
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:31.220
I the prayer is it for the person being executed, the victim with the prayer?

568
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.550
I think you have to pray for strength to follow through on what you have to do.

569
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.490
I think that, you know,

570
00:34:39.491 --> 00:34:42.950
you might need a little guidance and you might need a little understanding and

571
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.980
something bigger than us out there and

572
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.310
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

573
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.380
<v 16>I think that if we're going to have the death penalty,</v>

574
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:51.530
people just have to understand that there's some savagery involved in it. And,

575
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.520
and uh, it's unfortunate that it is,

576
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:59.660
but if we have it to do, let's, let's do it. But let's do it humanely.

577
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:01.680
<v 9>[inaudible].</v>

578
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.910
<v 1>One of the things that I found kind of striking is that Maya FOA is against the</v>

579
00:35:05.911 --> 00:35:08.760
death penalty and you have the folks in Utah that are for it,

580
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.130
but everyone seems to agree that

581
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.440
<v 16>we shouldn't fool ourselves. I favor the death penalty.</v>

582
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.400
But one thing I've never favored in some common ground between me and the

583
00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:24.401
abolitionists is that lethal injection is a terrible method of execution.

584
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.720
<v 1>That's Robert Blecker at a New York law school professor sounding a little bit</v>

585
00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:32.750
like Maya, but he says he objects to lethal injection not because of

586
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.450
<v 16>cool, not because it might cause pain,</v>

587
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.070
but because it certainly causes confusion.

588
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.930
I attended an execution in Florida of Benny Demps,

589
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.210
and I also was with my father in law when he was in a hospice dying from an

590
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:50.220
incurable and very painful cancer.

591
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.940
And the death scene in both situations was bizarrely similar.

592
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.480
In both cases, the the,

593
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.300
the person dying was lying on a Gurney with an ivy coming out of his arm,

594
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.340
wrapped in white sheets,

595
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.600
medical technicians at his side surrounded by loved ones.

596
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.990
And it struck me as bizarre that we are killing those whom we love in a fashion

597
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.940
that so nearly resembles how we are killing those we rightfully detest.

598
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:28.080
There should be no resemblance. This isn't medicine, this is punishment. So the,

599
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:33.081
the firing squad is honest and it acknowledges itself for what it is.

600
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.500
I have one objection to the traditional firing squad that Utah uses.

601
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.050
<v 1>He says he doesn't like the fact that one person gets a blank and that nobody</v>

602
00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:43.590
knows who that person is. That to me is

603
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.110
<v 16>symptomatic of our failure.</v>

604
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:50.100
Once again to take responsibility for what we do. Nobody should have a blank.

605
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.270
And if we cannot face what we're doing and acknowledge it,

606
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.740
then we shouldn't do it.

607
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.920
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

608
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.030
<v 1>and we may be coming to a moment where we are about to do that,</v>

609
00:37:07.031 --> 00:37:11.980
to look at this and acknowledge it because in 2014 in a case that was really

610
00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:15.070
just about lethal injection, justice briar said, look like,

611
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.520
let's stop just talking about the details,

612
00:37:18.521 --> 00:37:20.560
like questions about which medicine that we use.

613
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.600
<v 13>The time has come for the court to again consider a more basic question.</v>

614
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.700
Uh, whether the death penalty itself is constitutional.

615
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.551
<v 1>In other words,</v>

616
00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:35.551
what he's saying is it's time to talk about not just like the mechanics of what

617
00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:37.024
we're doing,

618
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.770
<v 4>um,</v>

619
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.230
<v 1>but whether we should even do it at all.</v>

620
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.103
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.453
<v 13>reporter Karen Duffin</v>

622
00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:57.913
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

623
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:00.980
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

624
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.580
<v 17>Now, when Briars said that in 2014, he was into the scent,</v>

625
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.103
lost the case,

626
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.180
but a lot of people saw that statement as this invitation like Briar saying to

627
00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:14.360
the lawyers of America send us cases. And in fact,

628
00:38:14.361 --> 00:38:18.020
some of those cases have just started to arrive two days ago.

629
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.610
A case made it in front of the court or almost made it

630
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.490
<v 13>the last supreme court on Tuesday,</v>

631
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.840
refused to hear an appeal asserting that the death penalty violates the u s

632
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.340
constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to have the eight justices

633
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.100
liberal Steven Briar and Ruth Ginsburg said

634
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.190
<v 0>they would have accepted the case. Clearly more cases are on the way.</v>

635
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.560
Here's something else that happened while we were reporting this story.

636
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:44.410
This one from about two weeks ago, no pharmaceutical giant.

637
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:48.970
Pfizer has announced that it will no longer allow its drugs to be used in lethal

638
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:49.720
injections.

639
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.920
That closes off the last remaining open market source of drugs use and

640
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:54.754
executions.

641
00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.180
This basically can't quite see spells the end of lethal injection in the United

642
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.410
States, but it's close because now any states that want to keep doing it,

643
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.770
they essentially have to go underground to get those drugs

644
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.380
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.810
<v 18>more perfect. It's our first radio lab spinoff sideband,</v>

646
00:39:15.811 --> 00:39:18.090
whatever you want to call it. A, it's produced by me. Chad.

647
00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:20.100
I'm rod with Susie Lichtenberg,

648
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.540
Kelsey paget and Tobin low utopian.

649
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.480
Do you want to do the rest of sharp with a Soren Wheeler, Ellie Ms Sal,

650
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.640
David Herman, Alex Overington, Karen Defin, Sean Ramas from Catherine Wells,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.080
Julie toll and the death penalty information center.

654
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.410
Supreme Court audio is from OEA,

655
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.610
a free law project in collaboration with illegal information institute at

656
00:39:50.611 --> 00:39:51.444
Cornell.

657

The Charles Evans Hughes Memorial Foundation and the Joyce Foundation

659
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.480
<v 0>coming up next week on more perfect,</v>

660
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.230
the most important Supreme Court case in the 20th century,

661
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.443
and you've probably never heard

662
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.590
<v 19>December. Why didn't have their do stray Charles? Stop your banker at out</v>

663
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.950
<v 0>case was so dramatic, so traumatic.</v>

664
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:21.010
There was an instance in which my brother found my father going upstairs to get

665
00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:26.330
a shotgun that it actually ended up breaking two justices.

666
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:31.280
That is next week. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. I'm jad boom. Ron,

667
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.590
thanks for listening more. Perfect.
