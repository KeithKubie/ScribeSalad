00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.497
The last personality disorder that we're going to discuss, some of you may of

00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:10.901
heard of. It's called, antisocial personality disorder, or ASPD. Now this is

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:15.536
formally know as psychopathic or sociopathic behavior. Now antisocial

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:19.622
personality disorder, is a serious and potentially dangerous disorder. It is

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:23.838
marked by extremely impulsive deceptive, violent, ruthless and callous

00:00:23.838 --> 00:00:29.086
behavior. The key here is antisocial personality disorder focuses on outward

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:33.805
behaviors. Where as the term, psychopath typically focuses on inward

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:39.110
characteristics. People with antisocial personality disorder are more likely to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.378
engage in criminal, deceptive and violent behaviors. For example, an individual

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:48.972
with this disorder may break the law repeatedly. Be able to act charming and

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:53.554
witty, steal and fight often. They won't show guilt or remorse, and they can

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:57.770
become very angry and arrogant. Now, they're really good at manipulating other

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.890
people, and have a complete disregard for the safety of others. Many more men

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.262
than women have this disorder. And it's common among people in prison. As with

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:11.611
other disorders, genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute. For

00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.202
example, children who suffered from child abuse people with an antisocial

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:18.565
parent, or people with alcoholic parents, are at an increased risk for

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:23.640
developing this disorder. In addition a lot of research has revealed, that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.117
those are the antisocial personality disorder, especially the violent

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:30.879
criminals, have amygdala that are unusually distorted in size, activity, and

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.160
function.
