00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.662
So we have all our bands.

00:00:01.662 --> 00:00:01.782
&gt;&gt; Yup

00:00:01.782 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; And I want to start putting them on

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.390
stages. They have to, they have to play.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Right. So I'm going to go into these records. Okay, so here's

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.290
the band, and the stage field is blank, as is set time.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.242
&gt;&gt; Yep. And let's say we want to play, they're

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:22.670
going to play at what, 10 a.m., at stage four stage.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's good.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.990
but what if I actually wanted them to play at

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.520
two different set time? Like, you know, one at 10:00 a.m.,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.730
and maybe again at 11:00 or maybe at a totally different

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.890
stage? Is there a way to do that? It feels like

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.400
I would have to create an entirely new band or something,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.390
a new record. That's turning a relationship into something a little

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.630
bit more complicated than just a simple one to many. So,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.150
let me actually show you on the tablet what I mean.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.910
&gt;&gt; We're starting off with, we have our stage records.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.670
And I'm only representing it as one stage box, but this could be any of the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.830
stages that we have. And then each of these stages has a specific time we can

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.007
book them for. So like, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m., etcetera.

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:09.902
&gt;&gt; Sure

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:13.760
&gt;&gt; And then, for each of these time slots, you could have any sort of band

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.194
playing there. So, let's say we had you know, our first band playing at 10 a.m.,

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:23.400
but then for your second band, you want them playing at 11 and 12.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.930
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right, this

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.460
is getting more complicated as a data model.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.580
&gt;&gt; So this is clearly not how we represent something in sales force.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.110
&gt;&gt; Instead of now having a one to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.940
many relationship, we have a many to many relationship.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
Where a stage can have many bands But bands

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.310
can be playing at multiple stages at many times.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.720
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.280
&gt;&gt; We're no

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.070
longer tracking you know, what stage are the bands playing at, but it's more-so

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.820
what time are they playing at those

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.780
stages. Because now there's another unique classification there.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.000
&gt;&gt; Mm. So we've added this sort of like intermediate object.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.840
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.980
&gt;&gt; And what we'd call that intermediate object in

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.210
Salesforce is a junction object And what a junction

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.220
object does is it represents every unique instance that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.660
we relate a band record to a stage record.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.110
But what would, this isn't how we draw our scheme

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.250
in SalesForce, so, what would this actually look like in SalesForce?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.150
&gt;&gt; Right. Before, we had just stages and bands.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.840
&gt;&gt; Right. And the relationship had that little

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.450
line with the three forks at the end.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.896
&gt;&gt; Right, our stage had many bands. But now, we

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:33.600
have stages, bands and this junction object called Set Time.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.890
&gt;&gt; How do

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.330
you think that this relationship will look, when mapping it out?
