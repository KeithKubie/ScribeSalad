[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.600
JESSE HAINES: Welcome to Google.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.812
SARAH KESSLER: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:09.812 --> 00:00:10.770
JESSE HAINES: So this--

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.260
I loved reading this book.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.220
And definitely jumped into
this book with the perception

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.830
that I think many
folks might have,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.790
that the gig economy is
this great thing that

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.950
allows everybody to
be their own boss,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.999
and play by their own
rules and so forth.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.040
And I think what you have
done so powerfully here

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.260
is really kind of unpack that.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.560
But why don't we, just
to kick things off,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.400
start with the basics?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.240
What is the gig economy?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.790
SARAH KESSLER: So that is a
surprisingly controversial

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.570
question.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.210
People will fight
about this for hours.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.600
Because some people
think that gig economy is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.060
only kind of apps that
give out jobs, like Uber.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.400
Some people think
it's all freelancers.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
Some people think it's
kind of this shift away

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.590
from full-time employment,
whether that be

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.320
contract workers
or temp workers,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.630
or other things that
aren't traditional jobs.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.710
I think it's kind of
just a buzzword used

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.940
to describe these set of
companies that came up

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750
with this new idea
of-- well, let's say

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.720
[INAUDIBLE] was a new idea.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.820
We can control independent
work through an app.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.610
In the book, I was looking
at how does technology

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.540
impact this long-term trend
towards freelance workers?

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.290
JESSE HAINES: Definitely
a little bit more

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.020
controversial than you
would have thought.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.035
So maybe let's dig in on that
technology piece a little bit.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:53.220
So how have all the advances
that we've seen in technology

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.554
impacted the gigging culture?

00:01:56.554 --> 00:01:57.720
SARAH KESSLER: So let's see.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.300
I started getting
introduced to this topic,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.600
and started looking at it
when I was a tech blogger,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.270
and I was hearing three
to four startups a day

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.310
pitch me their companies.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.980
Maybe there are three or four
of those still around today.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.970
That was in 2010.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.830
And I noticed this pattern of
pitch, which went something

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.200
like, hey, we've
created this app that's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.640
going to solve unemployment.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.350
Because in 2010, that
was still a problem.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.350
And it's also going to make
everybody love their jobs.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.210
It's called Uber.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.760
It's called Uber for car
washing or it's called Uber

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.620
for brushing your teeth--

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.019
whatever.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.560
But now, you can
just press a button.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.460
You can get work.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.270
Problem solved.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.740
You're welcome.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.690
And I think as that played
out-- and in the book,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.760
I follow people in very
different positions

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.690
within that world, and
how it plays out for them.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.030
But they found ways to take what
had been a totally independent,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.450
"I'm my own business," which is
something that totally exists.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
And really is that great,
work-from-the-beach situation.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.359
But they found a way to make
it the same classification

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.400
and still give people the
responsibility of being

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.110
your own business, but
actually, in reality,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.220
manage you a little bit.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.610
It's also much easier
to hire a freelancer

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.750
than it's ever been before.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.310
There are these
online platforms.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.400
There's easy ways to search.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.949
You can keep track of them.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.490
Some of these
platforms have features

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.140
where, if you hire
a freelancer, you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.784
can also watch a
video of all the hours

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:32.700
that they are working
for you on their desktop

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.650
to make sure that they
didn't check their email

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.149
or something while they were
supposed to be working for you.

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.540
So there are all these
things that make it easier.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.890
And while this has been a
shift since the '70s, companies

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.140
outsourcing more and
more of their work

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.970
out to people who
aren't their employees,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.305
I think that technology makes
it easier in more situations.

00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:54.180
JESSE HAINES: What I
love most about the book

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.710
is that you brought us
into the gig economy

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.050
through stories of individuals
who are all interacting

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.800
in very different ways with--

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.210
participating in the gig
economy in very different ways.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:18.209
So let's dig in a little bit
to some of those stories.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.550
And I'll let you decide.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.950
The takeaway, I
think, for me, was

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.860
that there's a lot to offer.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.030
Some are thriving, some are not.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.990
And there's just a lot
more nuance and challenges

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.700
in this gig economy.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.180
So tell us about--

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.130
maybe start with
someone who's thriving.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.690
Tell us about Curtis.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.440
SARAH KESSLER: OK.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.890
So Curtis is a
software programmer.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.400
He just graduated from college.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.290
He went to work his full-time
job for the first time,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.410
and realized it
was super boring.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.180
He was done with his work at
noon, and he had nothing to do.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.330
So he watched people play
video games on the internet,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.250
and tried to pitch projects,
but they went nowhere.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.390
So he was extremely
frustrated and bored,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.620
and was looking for jobs.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.380
And ran across this
platform called

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.170
Gigster, which doles
out freelance jobs

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.340
to independent contractors
who are software developers.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.920
And he quit his job, joined
this, and in his first month,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.200
made $12,000.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.984
Didn't have to go out and
find clients, or advertise,

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.150
or do any of the things
that are normally associated

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.010
with a small business.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.420
Totally loved it.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.150
Got to pick his own projects,
grew as an employee.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.580
And then, ended up
leaving the gig economy

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.160
because he had built
his resume enough

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.225
where he was able to land his
dream job, which was at SpaceX.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.845
JESSE HAINES: So that's kind of,
I think, maybe a little bit--

00:05:59.845 --> 00:06:00.720
SARAH KESSLER: Right.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.600
That's the happy side.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.183
JESSE HAINES: --the
gig economy dream.

00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:05.170
But there were a
lot of other stories

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.760
that didn't quite
turn out like that.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.430
So tell us about another person.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.760
SARAH KESSLER: Sure.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.450
So Curtis's situation was
a specific, highly skilled

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.780
professional situation.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.480
And I think a lot
of what's happened

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.350
is people who are
promoting this kind of work

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.960
for work that's not that have
taken that narrative and said,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.626
that's what it's like for, also,
these people who are giving you

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:35.170
rides, or fixing your scooters,
or whatever it is that is not

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.820
highly paid, professional
work, which is not necessarily

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.610
the case.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.350
So before Curtis quit
to join the gig economy,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.497
he saved a year's worth
of living expenses.

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:49.330
He met with an accountant
to see how much he

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.230
had to save for taxes,
and what else did he do?

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.940
He bought health insurance.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.150
So he kind of created this
social safety net for himself.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.780
You know, if he got called
to jury duty, which he did,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.200
and he couldn't work, he
just moved his projects

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.410
to the next week, you know?

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.520
It wasn't like he
couldn't buy groceries.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.240
So for other people in
these situations, where,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.010
when you're working
as a freelancer,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.930
you don't have any protections
from any labor laws.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.930
Not even discrimination
or sexual harassment.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.270
You have no minimum wage.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.990
No right to unionize,
which is a big one.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.700
And that's a much
bigger problem if you

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.090
don't have the power of a
year's worth of savings.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.040
So there was this other
project in rural Arkansas,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.230
where a nonprofit
heard this pitch

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.692
about if opportunity
isn't around you,

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:43.150
you can just press
a button and you

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.820
can get connected
with these gigs

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.220
and have instant employment.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.250
And they thought, we'll take
to rural Arkansas, where

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.350
the normal workforce
development thing to do

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.400
is build businesses, attract
businesses to give jobs.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.390
But instead, we'll teach people
how to use the gig economy.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.890
And they'll get jobs that way.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.450
So I followed this project
for two or three years.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:13.990
And the false thinking
of "we can make an app

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.910
that fixes this
problem" became very

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.150
apparent very
quickly to everyone

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.630
who was involved in it.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.690
It works if you're a programmer
to just download an app

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.530
and use your skills.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.120
But that's not the problem
for people who are--

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.549
40% of whom are living in
poverty in this small town.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.820
They don't have high-speed
internet that works.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.549
They don't have educations
that allow them to get jobs,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.520
like social media
consultant, where

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.380
you need perfect grammar to
be able to gracefully meld

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.010
a sale into a punchy joke.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.010
So they just ended up
applying and applying and not

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.770
getting anywhere.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.680
And I think, at the
end of the program,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.500
there was something like
over four years, four

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.190
people had gotten
any work, one of whom

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.990
I actually follow in this book.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.282
And you can cut me off if I'm--

00:09:06.282 --> 00:09:07.406
JESSE HAINES: Yeah, no, no.

00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:08.870
I think this is interesting.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.340
SARAH KESSLER: But the
man from the program,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.110
who I followed in the book,
his name is Gary Foster.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.320
And the digital job he got
was as a customer service

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.180
representative for Sears.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.020
You remember Sears.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.298
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.430
And so his relationship
to Sears was--

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.130
he would pick up
the phone, be like,

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.710
thanks for calling
customer service at Sears.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.370
He was an independent
contractor to a small business.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.570
And that small business had
a contract with a call center

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.880
that had a contract with Sears.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.480
So that's a lot of
layers, to the point

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.020
where, if something
happens to him,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.360
Sears is not going
to be like, oh, yeah.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.276
That was our employee.

00:09:50.276 --> 00:09:52.840
They're going to be like, I
don't know who that guy is.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.550
He had questions
about his check,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.220
and he was afraid
to say anything

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.800
because he knew that there
was nothing protecting him

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.750
from wrongful termination.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.750
And then, when they required
him to take a three-week class

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.840
to train, which his instructor
had negotiated that he wouldn't

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.740
have to pay for.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.950
Because, usually, you would
have to pay for the training

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.180
class for three weeks that you
would take in order to work.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.690
But he wasn't making
any money, and so he

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.510
wasn't paying his bills.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.180
There's also a
questionable flexibility

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.830
because the pitch is you
can work whenever you want.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.520
But if you're doing something
like customer service, how

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.270
you get hours is whenever
they have hours available.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.977
And so they release the
hours onto this platform,

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:40.560
and everyone scrambles
to pick them up

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.360
as quick as they can
anytime they're available.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.690
So if that's 20 hours
this week, that's great.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.420
It might only be four, and
you didn't get another job

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.900
because you thought you
were going to work 20.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.730
JESSE HAINES: So I think
this rural Arkansas example

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:05.010
definitely highlighted
certainly a lot of the pitfalls

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.690
and challenges of
the gig economy.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:13.840
But I think Terrence,
who was the guy who said,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.830
let's give this a try.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.910
Let's see if I can
make this gig thing

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:25.260
work in my small, rural hometown
that is challenged, and is

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.540
on such hard times.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.790
Do you think there's any hope?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.910
Did you walk away
from that saying, no,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.355
this is just never
going to be able to--

00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:37.330
this is great for the
Curtises of the world,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.370
but not for small, rural
towns where there just

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.690
aren't enough jobs?

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.440
SARAH KESSLER: I think
it could be better.

00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:48.510
The fact that we've
structured everything

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.500
around this 9:00 to 5:00 job,
there's a lot of flaws in that.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.140
It was kind of built
for a time when

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.405
we thought an ideal
family meant a man that

00:11:57.405 --> 00:11:59.940
goes to work all day, and a
woman who stays home and works

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.354
all day for free.

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:03.270
And to the extent that
that was ever the case,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.040
that is very much
no longer the case.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.130
And that causes-- this
idea everyone should

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.250
work on the same schedule
causes a lot of families a lot

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.960
of stress.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.910
You have people who are going
to school or doing other things

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.250
that they want to work
less than full time.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.130
People are living
longer and healthier.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.270
And maybe they don't--

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.327
if they're going to have
a 60-year long career,

00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:28.410
don't want to work full-time
for that whole thing.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.640
So there are definitely
potentials for this.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.030
Also, the need to work
that way, technology

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.780
is taking away a
little bit, too.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.880
You don't have to come to
the office to get the files,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.731
or to talk to people
you're working with.

00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.230
More and more of
the country doesn't

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.635
have to go to work to
be in the assembly line.

00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:51.760
There's a lot of potential.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.260
It's just all of our structure
is around this 9:00 to 5:00

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.090
job.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.070
So when that was
created, which was

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.000
a new thing at the time in
the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.700
coming from being distributed on
farms, we screwed up at first.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.320
We sent children to work.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.130
We locked people inside of
factories that might burn down.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.280
It was bad, but then we
developed these structures--

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.490
like labor laws and
social benefits--

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.920
that supported it.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.490
And just don't have that at
all for this kind of work.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.690
JESSE HAINES: So let's stay
on that for a little while.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.175
Where do you think--

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.930
the gig economy is marching on.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.120
It's just growing.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.110
All the data would
point to the fact

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.420
that this phenomenon is just
getting bigger and bigger.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.760
And now, policy needs
to kind of catch up.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.060
What are your thoughts
on some of the things

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.277
that we need in that area?

00:13:54.277 --> 00:13:55.110
SARAH KESSLER: Sure.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.657
So this is something that
I think is interesting.

00:13:57.657 --> 00:13:59.490
Because when you talk
about the gig economy,

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.989
depending on your
definition, you're

00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:05.110
talking about a
small set of people.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.980
But here's a place,
I think, where

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.790
if you solved some
of their problems,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.680
you would solve other
people's problems, as well.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.770
So for instance, there's
a lot of employees

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.950
who are paying more and more
for health insurance provided

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.010
by their companies,
even, every year.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:26.340
Or their retirement savings
or 401(k)s with the company

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.380
instead of pensions.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.530
And they're accepting more
risk, and also feeling

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.220
tied to the company.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.040
So the big idea for how to
solve the gig economy's problems

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.500
is benefits should be portable.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.110
Either everyone should
have health insurance,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.010
or your health insurance
shouldn't be tied to your job.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.730
Maybe multiple employers
can pay into it.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:57.000
Maybe it's housed with a
union or another entity.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.330
And so I think that's kind
of the leading idea for how

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.030
to make things better.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.940
And the problem is everyone can
agree that that's a good idea,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.030
but they all mean totally
different things when

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.640
they say that it's a good
idea about who pays for it

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.220
and those kind of things.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.810
JESSE HAINES: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.360
Have you seen any
interesting developments,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.837
or any progress against any
of the ideas to support this?

00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:26.670
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.980
There's a group of
Democrats in the House

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.130
that are campaigning
for this idea.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.980
But again, short
on details, which

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.320
is really where it
needs to be worked out.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.050
A union leader will
say, what we mean

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.360
is everyone will have
a $15 minimum wage.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.460
Everyone will have
a full pension.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.010
And then you get the other
side, which is like, great.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.610
Companies will pay for
nothing, and good luck.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.980
But we both support
portable benefits.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.520
So few details on that.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.495
One thing I think is
interesting is the idea of--

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:04.870
I really think that these are
structural problems that we

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.850
need to solve with policy.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.300
But one interesting
idea, aside from that,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.780
is having cooperatively-owned
platforms.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:21.250
So if your Uber driver
owned part of the Uber app,

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.890
they would benefit from
this new efficiency

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.340
that they're creating by
participating in Uber.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.060
And the same thing that
makes it easy for Uber

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.010
to manage freelancers
in this way

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.770
could make a co-op
a lot easier, too.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.149
Like software scales.

00:16:39.149 --> 00:16:40.690
If I'm going to
start a new Uber app,

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:46.630
I can buy a white label
solution for, like, $30 a month.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.270
And everybody knows what a white
label solution is here, right?

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.000
Because I'm in Google.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.050
And if I want people
to vote on everything

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.610
I'm doing in the
co-op, I don't have

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.470
to go door to door
with my ballot.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.470
I can send them a
push notification.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.099
So I think there's some
promise in that idea.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.990
JESSE HAINES: Interesting.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.290
Getting back to the book for
just a second, another story

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.960
that I thought would
be interesting to share

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.940
with the group is the
story of Christie,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.890
who I think was able to really
benefit from the gig economy,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.849
but not without some
tough consequences.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.670
Can you share her story
with the folks here?

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.910
SARAH KESSLER: Sure.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.290
So I think she's a good
example of, in some ways,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.850
being a good thing that there's
this opportunity that exists.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.580
But also still, at the same
time, maybe not super fair,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.050
something we can
be too proud of.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.480
How many of what
Mechanical Turk is?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.340
Amazon Mechanical Turk?

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.330
Everyone?

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.580
JESSE HAINES: A lot of people.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.400
SARAH KESSLER: OK, awesome.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.534
So Christie, back
during the recession--

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.200
JESSE HAINES: I would
explain it anyway.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.991
There might be some--
not all the hands on.

00:17:59.991 --> 00:18:01.010
SARAH KESSLER: OK.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.020
So Amazon Mechanical Turk is
this platform where companies

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.590
can post small tasks, and
then thousands of people

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:14.410
pick them up and do them for
maybe $0.05 or less a task.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.730
An example might be like,
I have 1,000 products

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.900
on my e-commerce site.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.180
Label each one every time you--

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.680
or write a description
for each one.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.120
Every time you do
that, you win $0.05.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.520
Or another very common
thing that happens

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.510
is, label these
images which they're

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:40.872
creating data for machine
learning algorithms, which I--

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:43.330
do I need to explain machine
learning algorithms to Google?

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.260
JESSE HAINES: I think that
maybe we're good on that.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.135
SARAH KESSLER: I feel
like you guys got that.

00:18:46.135 --> 00:18:47.649
All right.

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:49.565
Usually, I have to spend
10 minutes explaining

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:50.370
what that is.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.080
This is kind of fun.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.340
So Christie, her husband
lost his job in a factory.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.870
She realized she
has to make money.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.630
She's never worked outside
the home before, really.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.040
She has no resume.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.450
She's applied at McDonald's.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.580
They haven't called her back.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.430
So she logs onto
Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.900
And because she is a genius,
makes $40,000 a year,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.360
$0.05 at a time.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.550
And the way that she
does this involves

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:24.110
all sorts of really
entrepreneurial thinking.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.830
She set up-- there
was a forum where

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.440
people on Amazon
Mechanical Turk alert

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.490
each other of good jobs, which
are ones that you can repeat

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.530
really fast, that pay well.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.997
And she had an alarm on her
computer that would go off--

00:19:37.997 --> 00:19:38.830
JESSE HAINES: Crazy.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.240
SARAH KESSLER: --if
someone posted there,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.980
after they checked
if she was qualified

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.390
and could do the task.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.780
And it had different levels of
alarm for how good the job was.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.260
And she would sleep
in her office in case

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.110
the alarm went off, and
she could do this quickly.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.850
So all sorts of
things like that.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.700
And so she did it.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.520
She made the ends meet.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.590
But after a while,
you don't want

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.950
to be sleeping in your office
and jumping up for an alarm.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.720
She developed a lot of injuries
in her wrists and shoulders,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.270
from literally sitting
at the computer.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.658
Most of this work is very--

00:20:16.658 --> 00:20:18.650
you have to use a
lot of keystrokes

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.550
and a lot of mouse work, and
there's no workers compensation

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.600
insurance.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.230
So even though her
job had hurt her,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.020
she had to keep
working through it.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.530
She couldn't afford the
medication, to get surgery.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.350
So it was just, for me, this--

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.620
OK, great.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.864
There was this opportunity.

00:20:37.864 --> 00:20:40.280
I don't know how you would
have made this money otherwise.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.150
But also, maybe we can
do better than this.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.279
Yeah.

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:45.070
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.240
A fascinating story of Christie.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.730
Let's zoom out a little bit.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.380
You've shared some
ideas of how you

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.350
think you could make gig work
a little bit more secure.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:00.220
What about-- how is the gig
economy impacting our culture?

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.040
SARAH KESSLER:
That's interesting.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.270
I think this break away
from directly employing

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.570
your janitor and your bus driver
and everything, that's been

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.700
in the works for a long time.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.030
A lot of these apps that are
a part of the gig economy

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.490
are also part of the
on-demand economy.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.510
And certainly, there's a
new immediacy with which

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.620
people expect certain things--

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.210
or certain people
expect certain things.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:33.560
And then, people talk about this
surf culture in San Francisco

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.400
when they talk about
the gig economy.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.410
JESSE HAINES: What
does that mean?

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.690
SARAH KESSLER: You have the
people who make the apps

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:45.120
and the people who work for
the apps, and it's become--

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.210
partly because of
this labor system,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.700
where labor is so
cheap, and also you only

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.240
pay for exactly
how much you use,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.520
it's never been less expensive
to have a personal driver

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.490
and someone who you can
press a button on your phone,

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.900
and they'll come do your hair.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.240
And it almost echoes this
royalty-feudal system

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.620
that we thought was something
for historical drama.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.080
I'm a big "Downton Abbey" fan.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.110
JESSE HAINES: Have
you ever gigged?

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.930
SARAH KESSLER: So it depends
which definition you're using.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:30.120
My book was technically a
supplemental income gig economy

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.130
assignment.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.100
I also-- where I started
to get interested

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.870
in the worker
perspective of this

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.990
was about two years
after that startup

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.640
blog, and hearing
all these pitches

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.280
about how I'd be
working from the beach

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.710
and doing what I love
whenever I want to.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.320
I pitched this self-serving
story to my editor

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.270
at "Fast Company,"
like, hey, why don't I

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.500
take a month off and do
this, and see how it goes?

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.440
And they said yes.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.740
And so I spent a month
trying to beat minimum wage,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.300
signing up for kind of--

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.660
I signed up for 30
or 40 platforms.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.560
Everything from virtual personal
assistants and TaskRabbits

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.650
and dog walking and all of them.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.900
I had a class on Skillshare,
and I failed miserably.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.650
I couldn't-- I thought
it would be easier.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.980
JESSE HAINES: You weren't
a good dog walker?

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.730
SARAH KESSLER: No.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.770
No one hired me.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.450
I guess I-- and I write
persuasively for a living,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.720
so I thought my profile
was pretty nice.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.920
I ended up--

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.510
I dissolved someone's
LLC at the Harvard Club.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.182
I was in a proposal
dance flashmob.

00:23:40.182 --> 00:23:40.890
JESSE HAINES: OK.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.360
SARAH KESSLER: And I'm--

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.390
you can definitely tell which
one is not trying to make it

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.155
as a dancer in New York City.

00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.280
I'm like, oh, yeah, chasse.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.720
And let's see.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.310
I did so many ridiculous things.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:57.170
I cleaned out people's closets
and tutored their kids.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.620
But it was really hard.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.030
And that was my
first realization

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:04.440
of this is complicated for
me, college-educated person

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.540
with actual full-time job
who's not relying on it.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.820
It must not be the same
story for everyone else.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.610
And that led to this
approach of trying

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:20.910
to find different windows
of perspective and places

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.170
in this bigger world that
we call the gig economy.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.515
JESSE HAINES: Fascinating.

00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:27.450
As I mentioned, I
think one of the things

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.110
that I love about this book is
how you bring this human face

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.170
to it-- the stories.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.600
Can you tell us a little
bit just around the writing

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.110
process?

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.970
How did you find these people?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.340
How did you piece
together these narratives?

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.940
How did you choose who
to bring into the book,

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.027
and who to leave out?

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:46.860
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:54.250
So that was a good year,
trying to figure out.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.790
And I was looking for
specific perspectives

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.970
that I had data around that
showed the bigger picture,

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.740
but I wanted to illustrate
by putting a face to it.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.230
I think that it's
important to tell stories

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.890
that people can be engaged
in, and present people

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.640
that they can care about,
instead of a white paper

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.474
version.

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:18.390
And so I was looking for
these certain people.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.910
Some of them, I came across
during my day-to-day reporting

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.970
because I was still working as
a reporter at "Fast Company,"

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.530
and I just stayed
in touch with them.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:32.370
Curtis, I met at a digital nomad
work meetup on his first day.

00:25:34.861 --> 00:25:36.360
And then, there
were a lot of people

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.420
who I began relationships
with, thinking that they might

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.710
be people I'd include in the
book, who I didn't end up

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.460
including, for various reasons.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.880
Most of the people in the
book were seeking attention

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.410
for one reason or another.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.270
Some people, their lives became
such that they really were not,

00:25:53.270 --> 00:26:00.087
and I, for the most
part, respected that.

00:26:00.087 --> 00:26:00.670
But it's hard.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.400
You have to spend--

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.030
to write about
people in a way that

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.890
allows other people
to care about them,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.660
you really have to
spend a lot of time.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.170
So in most cases, it was years
of building relationships

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.620
and talking to people about
their entire life story,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.440
not just this particular
little part of it.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.300
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.530
It really comes through.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.310
Awesome.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.144
OK.

00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:25.310
Questions from the audience.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.179
Yes.

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:29.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.550
Thank you very much.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.540
You touched quite a bit
on regulation and the lack

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.137
of regulation, really.

00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:37.720
Some of the things
that you mentioned,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.640
like portable health
care benefits,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.560
seem very US-specific.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.650
I'm wondering if you've got
any insights into how countries

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.110
abroad are tackling this
because I feel like this

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.887
is an issue that a lot
of different places

00:26:48.887 --> 00:26:51.030
are grappling with.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.540
SARAH KESSLER: So
various things.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:59.580
Some countries in-between
classification.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.020
So in the US, you can either
be an independent contractor,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.250
you can be an employee.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.690
If you're an employee,
you have all the rights

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.040
and all the benefits,
and your company

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.130
has to pay all the money.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.902
And if you're an
independent contractor,

00:27:08.902 --> 00:27:11.110
you have none of the rights
and none of the benefits,

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.050
and your company just
has to pay you whatever

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.840
they said your wage would be.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.790
Some companies have an
in-between category,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:23.000
where if you're a
dependent contractor,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.160
you have some rights.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.730
So there's an in-between.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.550
Some countries in
Africa, the gig economy

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.910
is just the economy.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:36.040
Everybody's an entrepreneur, so
this whole discussion probably

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.820
seems absurd.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.230
And then, some companies
have taken a more active role

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.910
in regulating--

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.890
saying certain
apps can't be here,

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.160
or you have to set
a minimum wage.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.270
Actually, New York just set a
minimum wage for Uber drivers.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.620
It's not exactly a minimum wage.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.280
It's an equation of
what they have to make.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.600
And that's about
all I have for that.

00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:07.486
AUDIENCE: What amount
of responsibility

00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:12.092
do the companies that
create these gig [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:18.830
feel they have to
their freelancers?

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.460
I think Uber gets--

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.730
which is the biggest example--

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.320
has a lot of
language about this.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.775
But what about the people
who just start something?

00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:30.051
Do they just think, OK, if
we build it, they will come,

00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:31.550
and we don't have
to worry about it?

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.642
Or do they-- what's the
landscape like there?

00:28:34.642 --> 00:28:36.350
SARAH KESSLER: How
much should they have,

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.180
or how much do they think
that they should have?

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.830
AUDIENCE: How much do you
think they should have,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.212
in terms just of where
there are some good examples

00:28:42.212 --> 00:28:43.571
of good guys, bad guys.

00:28:43.571 --> 00:28:44.320
SARAH KESSLER: OK.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.349
AUDIENCE: What's
your thought on that?

00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:48.140
SARAH KESSLER: I would
say, a lot of times,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.350
I think that it's
somewhat of a--

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.160
it gets away from
them, in some way.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.130
They don't understand the effect
that this would have on people,

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.360
or that even if it's great to
be a freelancer as a software

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.760
programmer, it might
be different to be

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.870
a freelance line
cook or whatever.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.910
I do think that
they're operating

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:14.180
in a system that was
fundamentally not

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.870
built for what they're doing.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.990
And that policy allows--

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:27.680
the way policy is written allows
for this in-between management.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.290
And if things are
going to make--

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.140
if we're going to make big
changes that fix this problem,

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.580
it needs to be a policy-driven
thing, and not a new app,

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.920
or a new way to buy
workers compensation

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.280
insurance for yourself because
your company has no obligation

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.210
to provide it to you.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.920
And so I think individual
companies can really only--

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.770
they should be good actors
towards their own ecosystem,

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.830
but can't totally
fix all the problems.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
AUDIENCE: From the stories
that you covered, to me,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.850
there seemed like there
is this idea of they're

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.900
in survival mode, just
trying to make it day by day,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.610
and figure out how--

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:17.780
solving short-term
life planning.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.540
Do you get a sense that any of
the people that you followed

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.600
had a long-term perspective
of where they envisioned

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.320
themselves in 10 years,
20 years where they

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.000
worried some about the future?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.760
To me, that just seems like
a little bit of the backlash

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.297
of this [INAUDIBLE] framework.

00:30:36.297 --> 00:30:38.380
SARAH KESSLER: I'd say,
in the hierarchy of needs,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.847
if you're there because
this is what you need to do,

00:30:41.847 --> 00:30:43.430
then you think about
your money first,

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.330
and health insurance
only becomes a problem

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.430
when you get in a car accident.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.430
And then it becomes
a big problem.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.040
But there were people who--

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.680
the Uber driver who I follow
in the book, Abe, he had,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.230
for a long time, been obsessed
with becoming a millionaire,

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.450
and falling for all these
get-rich-quick schemes,

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.617
which he kind of--

00:31:07.617 --> 00:31:10.200
when Uber made this pitch, like,
you can be your own business,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:16.350
and you can join this echelon
of entrepreneurs, he signed up.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.150
And yeah, today,
he still believes

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.840
he's going to be a
millionaire, which

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.480
I found really interesting.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:31.250
Because if you look
at mobility in the US,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.180
and think about why people
join get-rich-quick schemes,

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.620
there's really--

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.512
it doesn't feel like if
you work hard, and you--

00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:40.970
if you're not coming
from anywhere,

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.636
that you're actually
going to get ahead.

00:31:42.636 --> 00:31:44.300
It feels like you need that.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.070
So that was an
interesting thing.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.210
And then, the people
who are there by choice,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.430
I think it is a investment in
their lifestyle and future,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.152
and where they want to be.

00:31:54.152 --> 00:31:55.610
AUDIENCE: In all
of the people that

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.530
you followed in your
years of research,

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:02.210
did you come across any
particular tools that

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.642
are actually helping [INAUDIBLE]
really good resources that you

00:32:05.642 --> 00:32:08.060
came-- that you
encountered over and over?

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.290
Whether it's around health
care, or retirement planning,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.600
or non-payment protections
or anything like that?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.080
The thing about the gig economy
is that it's not one industry.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.670
It's not one job type.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.100
So information is
very fragmented,

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.000
and even for
freelancers and giggers,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.970
it's really hard to
find this information.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:32.190
So I'm just wondering if you
found any companies, startups,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.879
or tools out there that
stood out for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:38.170
SARAH KESSLER: I came across
a lot of interesting ones,

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.770
but I never came across one
that people who are working

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.690
knew about and told me about.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.580
So I came across a lot
of interesting ideas,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.790
but it didn't seem like
they were being really

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.530
embraced or used.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:54.460
One interesting idea are savings
tools, where a big problem

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.630
is your income is variable.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.230
You don't know how much money
you're going to make next week.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.960
So they take a bit-- if
you're having a good week,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.900
they take a bit of your
income, and save it.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.030
And then, if you're having a bad
week, they pay it back to you.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.200
So it's an attempt of
evening out the uncertainty

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.580
in the income.

00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:19.460
But I didn't actually find
anybody who was using it.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.340
There's attempts to
break down insurance

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.000
to make it easier to
buy as a freelancer.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.790
But again, in the hierarchy
of immediate needs,

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.620
maybe that's not first on your
mind if you're a freelancer.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.290
AUDIENCE: When it comes to
[INAUDIBLE],, in general,

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.760
if we look at it
more historically,

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.950
it would be more focused on
the goods than the services.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.620
A structure [INAUDIBLE] being
put in place [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.380
focus on the goods production
for [INAUDIBLE] time.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.680
This gig economy sounds,
from all the examples

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.600
you listed, really
focused to service skills

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.530
today, and only services.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:06.340
We know that service is taking
a lot more importance today.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.840
How do you foresee
some of those things

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.260
being able to be migrated
back to the goods production?

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.929
Or are we going to have
a split structure, one

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.694
for the services--

00:34:18.694 --> 00:34:20.110
[INAUDIBLE] and
all those things--

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.070
and another one which is
going to be the archaic legacy

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.870
level things,
exploiting workers?

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.230
SARAH KESSLER: This is
an interesting question.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:39.580
Because if you look at
Apple producing an iPhone,

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.690
they have something like 100
times-- something ridiculous--

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.690
of people who work on the
iPhone in different companies,

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:51.290
or on contract, than they
do employed in Cupertino.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.190
So this fragmentation
of work has already

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:59.580
happened in the goods
side of things, in a way.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.890
You also have temp workers
and contract workers.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.350
There are some things
about factories which--

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.890
safety things, which
make this a difficult--

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:13.860
having a new workforce every
day is just not practical

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.130
But I don't know what the
split is, in terms of it

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.610
being a totally different
economy for services.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.590
SARAH KESSLER: Sorry I
don't have a better answer.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.720
AUDIENCE: No, you
[INAUDIBLE] the question.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.590
I feel like, when we start
talking about those things,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.200
we always think
about the future.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.070
[INAUDIBLE] the
services-centric things.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:36.520
But we forget that in order
for us to be at the cafeteria,

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.970
someone's actually
growing some plants.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.780
Some people which are actually
building those chairs.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.030
Those are not at all even
close to being thought of,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.760
any type of those working
innovations that I know of.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.920
And I was wondering if it's a
reflection which is happening

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.570
within those people you've met.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.817
Or if it's totally abstracted.

00:35:58.817 --> 00:35:59.650
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.210
I think I see--

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:05.680
I see-- there's, on the one
hand, the big trend, which is--

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.820
the decades' long trend of
outsourcing, which is, I

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.070
don't want to hire my janitor.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.260
I want to hire the company
that provides my janitor.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:20.380
Or I don't want to hire people
directly that work in my field.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.611
I'm going to hire the temp
workers to work in my field.

00:36:24.611 --> 00:36:26.860
And I think if you look at
some of these basic things,

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.670
you'll find it.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.700
But it's just what we're
paying attention to is Uber

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.760
and this very extreme
version of that, which

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.850
is I'm employing
you for, literally,

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.750
when I get in your car
to when I leave your car.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:43.592
And so it's almost
a version of that.

00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:44.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:47.760
One of the shifts that
the gig economy brought

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.430
is that workers no longer get
training as part of their jobs.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.800
Did you find-- how do you
find these folks reflect

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.690
on the upskilling that they
have to do all the time?

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.400
Is this something they
pursue on their own?

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.018
Do they just not pursue jobs
they're unqualified for?

00:37:05.018 --> 00:37:07.614
How does education connect
to this very different--

00:37:07.614 --> 00:37:09.280
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.990
Because for some people, I
think it is an upskilling.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:18.370
They use it to go build a resume
by doing these freelance jobs.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:22.930
But on the other hand,
there's other types of work.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.940
I don't know who
said it's not a--

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.930
it's not a sector.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.510
It's a management strategy
is how I think of it.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.310
So it could be any kind of work.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.140
So some people use it
as an upskilling thing.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.450
But then there are others,
where there's no opportunity

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.800
to really learn something new.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.667
And if you're not
an employee that

00:37:40.667 --> 00:37:42.250
belongs to the
company, what incentive

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.190
do they have to teach
you how to do anything

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.360
you don't already
know how to do?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.430
I think you're seeing
a lot of companies

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.120
try to solve this problem by
offering free online classes,

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:05.170
or I think Salesforce,
LinkedIn, Google, and a Fiverr,

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:10.810
like this freelance platform,
they all offer online skills.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.670
You can take this
class and you can show

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.669
that you have this new skill.

00:38:14.669 --> 00:38:16.960
So the evolution of that, I
think, will be interesting.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.329
And I don't know what
will happen to it.

00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:21.370
JESSE HAINES: And I think
another dimension to it

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.580
is the need for
upskilling, and then

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.460
the gig economy allowing
you to have that flexibility

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.850
to work so that you
can go to school

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.680
and continue to skill up.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.320
So there's a lot a
lot of dimensions

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.050
to that, the skilling
conversation.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.050
I don't know if you know
the data around this,

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.740
but the takeaway I'm
getting from what I've heard

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.520
and from what I've read, is that
the gig economy, on average,

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.670
is not providing the
wages that people

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.530
think they might get by going
into it, yet it's growing.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.240
So to what extent do you
know the data behind,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.359
are people continuing
in these jobs?

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:05.150
Because-- I know there's
a lot of turnover.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:07.600
But on average, are people
continuing in these jobs

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.520
because they are not finding
full-time alternatives?

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.180
To what extent are people
looking for other options,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.300
or is it the flexibility
is giving them

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.895
enough value that it offsets
the fact that they're not

00:39:21.895 --> 00:39:22.812
making a lot of money?

00:39:22.812 --> 00:39:24.436
SARAH KESSLER: I
think one thing that's

00:39:24.436 --> 00:39:27.430
interesting about the data
is a large portion of people

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.600
are doing this part-time,
or on a supplemental basis,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.470
which, to me, suggests
unemployment is very low.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.680
But what does the quality
of those jobs look like?

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.360
And can people actually
make ends meet on a job,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.420
or do they have to do more?

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.830
I think it's too
soon to see data

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.930
about whether now that
unemployment is so low,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.210
will fewer people
be freelancers?

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.975
Will fewer people be doing this?

00:39:57.975 --> 00:39:59.350
But it's an
interesting question.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.600
JESSE HAINES: I will throw
in that, as I was preparing

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.180
for this talk, I came across
this stat, which I almost

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:04.900
couldn't believe.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.840
And I'm curious to
get your take on it.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.600
A recent survey commissioned
by the online freelancing

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.690
platform, Upwork and
the Freelancers Union

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.730
shows that the freelance
workforce is growing

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.620
three times faster than
the overall US workforce,

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.250
and that the majority of people
will be working independently

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:25.847
by 2027, which is right
around the corner.

00:40:25.847 --> 00:40:26.680
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.110
There's so much data.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.099
It's so hard to quantify this.

00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:31.890
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:40:35.617 --> 00:40:37.450
SARAH KESSLER: Different
government agencies

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.840
have suggested that the number
of freelancers in the US

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.314
is anywhere between 10% to 40%.

00:40:44.314 --> 00:40:45.730
JESSE HAINES:
That's a huge delta.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.500
SARAH KESSLER: So
Freelancers Union

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.770
is asking, have you done
freelance work this year,

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:53.910
which is a very different
question than the BLS

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.350
survey, which asks,
was your main job

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.940
this week independent
contractor work?

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.380
To which the person on the
other end of the phone says,

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.700
what's a main job?

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.170
What's an independent
contractor?

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.102
I don't know if I'm classified
as an independent contractor.

00:41:08.102 --> 00:41:09.560
Can I get you to
hang up the phone?

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.270
Sure.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.912
Yes, fine.

00:41:10.912 --> 00:41:11.620
That's what I am.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.260
Or no, I'm not.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.850
So it's hard to tell.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.800
People fight about this a lot.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.360
What is the percentage?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.880
And I think it's almost
a distracting question.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.160
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.780
So I think we're
going to wrap up.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.670
I'd love to just end
on, beyond the book,

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:37.060
as you've been covering
the future of work, what

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:43.150
are some other interesting
trends that you see,

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.310
or other sort of
emerging hot topics

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.137
in this interesting conversation
about the future of work?

00:41:49.137 --> 00:41:49.970
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.610
So we don't know, because
it's in the future, what

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.430
will happen.

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:59.070
But I think that how will
technology change work

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.170
is an interesting question,
just like it was 100 years ago,

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.050
and it will continue to be.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:11.340
And I think the culture of
even not being in the office

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.410
is really interesting.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.160
Maybe it will all start
to spread out more.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.290
But I don't have a big thesis
about, the future of work

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.320
is chat bots or
anything like that.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.110
JESSE HAINES: Anything
that, when you were writing

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.279
this book, surprised you?

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.820
SARAH KESSLER: I
think the thing that

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:36.030
surprised me is I started out
with, OK, Silicon Valley had

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:41.142
this idea, and made
this guess, or promise,

00:42:41.142 --> 00:42:42.100
about what it would be.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.810
What does that look like?

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.920
And then that-- just
how big that question

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.210
got, to the point
where you're like, OK.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.020
Well, then, there's
this bigger trend

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.150
of work moving this
way, in general,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.010
and risk moving to
workers, in general.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.260
And then, the history of
work and the Industrial

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.580
Revolution, and just how much
was packed into this one story

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.400
about apps like
Uber, and how much

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.040
it touches other
than Uber, which

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.180
is what we all talk about.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.388
Which, in a way, is great
because it brings attention

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:13.567
to this issue, but it's
much bigger than that.

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:14.400
JESSE HAINES: Great.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.240
SARAH KESSLER: Yeah.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.650
JESSE HAINES: Well, if
you guys can join me

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.260
in thanking Sarah Kessler
for being with us here today.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.610
[APPLAUSE]
