00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.390
Here you can see a simple app that
creates a table showing someone's

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.610
favorite things.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.430
Remember that at the very least,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.300
this table needs two things
from its data source.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
The number of rows, and
the cell for each row.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.820
If we focus on the ViewController.swf
file for a second, here we can see

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.575
the favorite things model,
which is just an array of strings.

00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:22.430
So how does the UITableView
know how many rows it has?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.300
A table view finds out how many rows
it has by asking its data source.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.970
More specifically, by invoking
the data source protocol method,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.990
number of rows in section.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.490
Check out the get branch
in the instructor notes.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.350
And inspect the project in
ViewController.swf files.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.090
Play around with the methods
to see what they do,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.700
and then indicate your choice below.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.170
Given that the table will invoke
this method on the view controller,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.780
which implementation seems right?
