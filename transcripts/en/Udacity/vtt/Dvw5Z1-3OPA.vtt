00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.980
&gt;&gt; So the only one of these six states that disobeys our one rule against having

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.000
more prisoners than guards on either shore, is this state over here. So,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.950
that's the only state that's going to get thrown out. These five states are all

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.620
legal according to our dumb testers understanding of the problem. So after we

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.500
dismiss that state, though. We'll notice that we only have two unique states,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.080
we have everyone on the left coast and one prisoner on the right coast. So

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.560
like we did earlier, we can collapse these two down into only these two states.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.640
It won't matter how we got there, once we're there.
