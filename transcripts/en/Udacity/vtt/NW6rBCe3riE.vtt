00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.794
We saw earlier, that if we multiply a complex number by its conjugate, the

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.605
middle terms cancel out and so we end up with a real number. This is exactly

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:11.570
what we're looking for in this situation, to make our denominator what we want

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.832
it to be. Since we don't want to change the value of this fraction that we had

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:20.218
initially, we need to multiply by 1 in the form of the conjugate over itself.

00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:24.616
Now, we just need to multiply the numerators of these fractions and their

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:29.386
denominators. At first start of multiplying out, gives us a fraction that I

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:33.562
think is pretty clear we can reduce a little bit more. So, let's keep

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:38.782
simplifying. Our final answer is negative 7 plus 22i all over 13. I think this

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:43.912
definitely looks a lot more manageable than what we started out with. Awesome

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:44.232
job.
