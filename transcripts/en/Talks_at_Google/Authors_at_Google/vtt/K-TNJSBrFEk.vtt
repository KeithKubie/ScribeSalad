MALE SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.420
We're extremely thrilled to
welcome Jon Meacham back to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.640
Google for his encore
appearance.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.770
We had him previously for his
Pulitzer Prize winning book,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.220
"American Lion, the Biography of
Andrew Jackson." And today,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.360
he returns to us going further
back in the pages of time to

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.260
his new work on Thomas
Jefferson.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.580
Jon takes a look at this great
American polymath.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.400
A lot of things are happening
during that time.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.170
There is uncertainty about
France and Britain, not to

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.000
mention all the work that Thomas
Jefferson did as a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.950
scholar and a statesman.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.840
And so we continue to look
towards the examples of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.800
past to highlight the present
time as well.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.170
And so we do have a Q&amp;A mic
that you can use for any

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.210
questions you may have.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.350
Just be sure to speak
up onto it.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.750
And then please join me in
welcoming Jon to Google.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.160
So thank you very much.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.740
JON MEACHAM: Thank you
all very much.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.610
I just realized I am
going back in time.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.830
So that's sort of troubling.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.069
My next J president could either
be, I guess, Andrew

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.720
Johnson or Lyndon Johnson.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660
I'm running out of
them as topics.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.200
But I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.290
Jefferson would have
loved Google.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.030
He would have loved the
whole idea of it.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.760
It would have absolutely
appealed to both his love of

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.010
adventure and discovery and also
his love of control in

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.340
the sense of being able to
manage masses of information.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.260
And so I think this
is a fitting place

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.690
to talk about him.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.910
I want to talk about his
intellectual work and how that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.710
informed his political work,
because he didn't see the two

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.880
as different.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.200
He saw them as contiguous
regions with

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320
a very porous border.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.730
And in the sense that we have
lost the sense, the feeling

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.600
that politics is informed
by the life of the mind.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.290
I think in the popular
conversation, they're seen as

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.260
very different things.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.560
There's politics, and then
there's culture, and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.350
intellectual work, reason,
depending on what state you're

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.720
in, is a different thing.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.520
And so I want to talk about what
both these things meant

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.210
to him, how they're connected,
and then a couple of thoughts

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.040
about what we can
learn about him.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.230
It's almost impossible, except
here to explain how exciting

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.190
Jefferson's world was to him.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.170
He was the first of the first
political generation of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.060
people, trying to create an
experiment in self-government

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.460
after the Enlightenment--

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.360
after Gutenberg, after
princely and priestly

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.940
authority had both given way.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.380
For at that point, they
didn't know--

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.840
we know how the story turned
out, they didn't.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.830
So in the sense that he came of
age in the middle late 18th

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.620
century, a student of
Enlightenment ideas, both the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.580
Scottish Enlightenment and the
European Enlightenment.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.940
He was very lucky in having a
professor at William and Mary

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.000
in Williamsburg, which as you
all may know is the alma mater

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.140
of Jon Stewart.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.220
So when I mentioned to Jon that
they were co-alumni, Jon,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.600
in his inimitable way,
said was he baked

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.210
as often as I was?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.690
And the answer is no,
just in case you're

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.130
keeping score at home.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.530
But he had a teacher named
William Small, who was from

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.000
Scotland and totally got the
Enlightenment force, the idea

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.530
of the scientific revolution.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.020
Jefferson overlapped with him
for only two years, a very

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.740
fortuitous two years.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.260
And so he comes blazing
out of the 1760s.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.846
He was born 1743.

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:55.660
He comes blazing out, believing
that this is a whole

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.460
new era in human affairs.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.220
We always believe that
it's a whole new

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.135
era in human affairs.

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:03.650
It's just we're not
always right.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.310
He was right, and we're in
the midst of one too.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.720
Because what's going on here and
around the world in terms

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.060
of a digital world is as
significant and as creatively

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.180
disruptive as Gutenberg.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360
We haven't worked out what
it all means yet.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.520
But what's happening, I think,
is of a scale with what

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.360
happened to make Jefferson's
world possible.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.080
And so, what fell to Jefferson
was to try to manage the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.460
political implications of this
incredibly disruptive

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.650
experience.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.990
For century upon century upon
century, priests and kings had

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.260
held authority, and individuals
were to take their

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.750
orders, salute, and move on.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.680
Jefferson, Hamilton, Adams,
Washington, Madison, Franklin,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.360
that generation of Americans
was the first to really be

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.000
able to engage in an experiment
in self-government.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.010
And this is where they're
connected, and I

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.570
think it's so important.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.290
Jefferson didn't believe that
the republic could survive

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.540
unless we were reasonable
creatures and we cared

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.320
somewhat about each other.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.800
We didn't have to
love each other.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.050
It wasn't a kumbaya kind of
thing, But we did have to have

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.950
a sense that your fate and my
fate are somehow linked.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.040
Because if we don't have that
sense, then there's very

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.640
little likelihood we will give
up the mutual concessions of

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.290
opinion that we need to
make a republic work.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.590
And if we don't give up those
mutual concessions of opinion

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.010
to make a republic work, then we
better hope the king we get

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.510
or the hereditary aristocracy we
get agrees with us all the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.410
time, because that's the
only alternative.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.040
Without sociability,
which is the fancy

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.760
word for saying this--

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.680
I was in LA the other night and
did a conversation with

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.360
Bill Maher at the LA library.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.660
He was late, because he was at
choir practice, because of his

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.750
ferocious religious beliefs.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.420
But I started a sentence,
saying, well,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.700
historiographically.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.960
And he said, don't never say
that again as an adverb,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.870
whatever you do.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:30.760
But in terms of sociability
and cultural connection,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.180
Jefferson believed that
citizenship, more than

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.000
leadership really, that
citizenship was the highest

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.010
virtue in a republic, because a
republic was only as good as

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.620
its citizens.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.180
And it seemed sort of banal to
say it that way, but the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.220
experience of Rome suggests that
it's not banal, that it

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.410
actually is very hard to
make these things work.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.820
And it required constant
attention, constant

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.090
cultivation, constant nurturing
of social ties and

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.750
the life of the mind in terms of
putting reason in the place

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.060
of revelation.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.150
Because without our being able
to think for ourselves, we

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.130
were going to fall back into
superstition and absolutism.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.000
And that was Jefferson's
great terror.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.780
I argue that we can't really
understand the American

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.770
Revolution and the early
republic if we don't see the

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.240
conflict with Great Britain
between 1763 and the end of

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.160
the French and Indian War and
the end of the War of 1812 as

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.090
a 50-year war with Britain.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.320
Sometimes hot, sometimes cold,
sometimes explicit, sometimes

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.090
implicit, but it was
a defining drama.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.100
And without seeing that, I
believe, and without trying to

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.700
feel the things they felt with
this possibility that Britain

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.960
would come back--

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.760
which they barely lost the first
time, so there was quite

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.110
a good reason to think this--

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.490
without understanding that, it's
like trying to understand

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.190
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy,
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.300
Reagan, and George HW Bush
without reference to the

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.770
Soviet Union.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.150
It's just an overarching fact of
their lives that because of

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.780
the way we think historically
sometimes, we simplify the

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.510
storyline for obvious, necessary
narrative reasons.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.470
But for them, it was messy,
and it was scary.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.570
And Jefferson lived in mortal
fear of this loss of the

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.970
American experiment.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.190
He and John Adams, in
particular, really saw the

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.900
American Revolution almost
as a child of theirs.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.370
It sounds very odd that
they would have a

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.490
child together, I guess.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.020
But it was an organic
living thing.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.260
They had given birth to it.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.650
They'd nurtured it.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.070
It was in an unruly
adolescence.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.690
You can play with this metaphor
all afternoon.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.150
Now we're aged and bent.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.510
Whatever you want to do.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.730
But it was a living thing.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.520
They were in constant
conversation

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.340
with it, what it meant.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.400
They disagreed fundamentally
about the

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.560
direction it should take.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.820
But they respected each other's
principles, even if

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.330
they disagreed about each
other's opinions.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.530
And that was, I think, what
the thinking behind

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.990
Jefferson's first inaugural
in which he says, every

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.540
difference of opinion is not
a difference of principle.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.480
We're all Federalists.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.030
We're all Republicans.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.870
And it was a plea for, not a
bipartisan Valhalla, where you

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.420
wouldn't pursue it as hard as
you could, the political

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.930
vision you believed in, but you
did acknowledge that the

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.360
warriors on the field or the
gladiators in the arena were

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.480
all men-- and they were men at
this point-- men of principle

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.560
who were trying to preserve the
existence and perpetuate

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.260
the life of the Republic.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.610
There was not as much of-- what
we've seen in the last 20

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.410
years or so in the United States
of hardcore political

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.810
bases that wanted to
delegitimize the winner of an

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:18.080
election, which we've seen from
1992 all the way through,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.220
was something that would have
been quite foreign and quite

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.100
disturbing to Jefferson.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.810
Because he understood that men
of goodwill could, would, and

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.000
should disagree.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.770
But they should not question
each other's

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.990
patriotism and motives.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.020
This is not to say that this was
a wonderfully placid era.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.730
The American founding sometimes,
I fear, is a little

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.030
bit like a historical
antidepressant.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.650
We don't like what's going on
now, so we read about the

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.920
founding, and we feel slightly
better about the country.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.240
Partisanship has been an
intrinsic element of the

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.490
American experience.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.500
And so, if we remember
Jefferson, the life of the

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.150
mind, the culture mattered,
reason mattered, sociability

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.890
mattered, all for politics,
then let's move to the

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:11.880
political side.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.750
So that's where Jefferson
is in terms of

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.090
the life of the mind.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.640
The life of politics was always
going to be contentious

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.850
and always going to
be frustrating.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.360
And I'm going to
start in 1790--

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.700
and you've got to love a life
where you can say those words

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.730
in that order--

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.910
1790, Jefferson comes
back from France.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.810
He becomes the first
Secretary of State.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.140
He and Alexander Hamilton go
at each other's throats.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.610
And they are daily pitted, as he
put it, daily pitted in the

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.370
cabinet like two cocks, just
fighting, fighting, fighting.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.610
And Washington was
tired of this.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.045
And he wrote a letter to both
men, saying, "how unfortunate

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.750
it is that while we are
surrounded on all sides by

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.380
insidious friends and avowed
enemies that we should be

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.420
riven by internal dissensions
that are harrowing and tearing

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.870
our vitals." "That are harrowing
and tearing our

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.870
vitals." It's a very
un-Washington phrase.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.120
A, because it's memorable.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.550
There's one thing.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.840
He had many virtues.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.290
Eloquence was not one of them.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.800
But it was a sense--

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.820
he really believed that their
arguments were going to spill

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.270
over and wreck the
whole thing.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.490
This is how well it worked.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.760
Jefferson wrote back about
Hamilton, the illegitimate

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.660
child of Nevis, saying that "I
will not suffer the slanders

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.930
of a man whose history, from
the moment at which history

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.800
can stoop to notice him, is a
tissue of machinations against

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.250
the liberty of the very country
that has not only

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.780
taken him and given him bread,
but heaped its honors upon his

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.560
head." So it was not a
successful intervention for

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.470
Washington.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.240
Hamilton said that Jefferson was
a fanatic in politics and

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.870
an atheist in religion.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.460
And an anonymous letter writer
wrote to Jefferson, "You ought

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.430
to get a damn kicking, you
redheaded son of a bitch."

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.060
So this has been going
on a while.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.440
The question becomes, how do
you manage partisanship?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.640
How do you marshal it and not
let it become so corrosive

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.830
that the whole cart tips over?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.020
Jefferson saw it as a historical
phenomenon.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.010
He said that men have been
divided into parties over

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.100
differences of opinion, of
whether the interests of the

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.420
many, or the interests of the
few should predominate since

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.370
those questions convulsed
Greece and Rome.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.600
So he was going all
the way back and

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.950
thinking all the way through.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.070
So what was his solution
for this?

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.600
It's a combination, in my
mind, of compromise and

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.290
citizenship.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.760
On the compromise point, short
of abandoning the life of the

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.330
nation, Jefferson would
compromise any principle.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.690
The great example being 1803
when the Louisiana Purchase

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.390
becomes a possibility.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.140
He learns about it on the
2nd or 3rd of July.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.730
He realizes that immediately
they were going to have to go

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.680
to the country and get a
constitutional amendment to

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.090
authorize doubling the
size of the country.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.630
That wasn't in the enumerated
powers.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.780
And he drafts the amendment.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.750
We get to about August 21, so
six, seven weeks later.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.010
And Jefferson gets another
letter, saying that Napoleon's

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.860
rethinking this deal.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.560
And suddenly, in what I think of
as Jefferson's Claude Rains

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.400
moment, he's shocked, shocked to
find out that anyone would

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.365
think we needed a constitutional
amendment.

00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:41.880
He totally dumps that idea,
expands the executive office

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.140
in ways that his head would have
exploded if Washington,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.290
or Hamilton, or Adams
had done this.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.660
But like a lot of small
government people, he was

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.760
perfectly fine with big
government as long as he was

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.810
in charge of it.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.740
I'm sure there are no examples
of that in our own lives at

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.400
all, where expedience
becomes central.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.460
So he compromised, he cut the
deals, because he believed

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.470
that politics was
ever unfolding.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.220
And that's the idea of
citizenship that I think is so

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.510
important and a key part
of the legacy.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:23.050
He said that men are not
participators in politics only

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.420
at elections, but every day.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.690
And that if one participates
every day, then they would

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.540
rather have, as he put it,
"their heart ripped out of

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:40.920
their bodies than submit to a
Bonaparte or a Caesar." So the

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.850
sense that we should all be
politically engaged, we should

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.170
all be following this, we should
all be participating in

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.380
the larger story of governance
is a very Jeffersonian idea.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:16:00.630
And it argues for a kind of
compromise and a sense of

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:06.560
forbearance among citizens that
has been lost, I think,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.840
to some extent.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.780
One of our problems now, as
a kind of sclerosis, in

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.380
Washington, but it's a sclerosis
that is derived from

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.570
the fact that the bases of each
party believe that any

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:23.590
compromise with the other side
is a total capitulation.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.860
And because of the means
of communication--

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.360
you can have congressmen
reading Twitter feeds.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.950
And that is a sign of the
apocalypse, I think.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:37.210
Because if you're going to be
that hooked into what everyone

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.520
thinks, then you have very
little chance to form your own

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.030
judgment and to form a reasoned
judgment, if you're

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.200
going to be a cat on a hot
tin roof to that extent.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.800
So I think that that's an
important element of what

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.100
we've lost in recent years,
because of the technology.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.280
All the benefits, obviously,
is that it makes everyone's

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.040
voice and the ability to
participate, to be a

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.740
participator, ever more
easy, ever more real.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.859
And that's absolutely
essential.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:12.569
But it needs to have some
element of forbearance in it,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:17.000
or it becomes a case where you
have two armed camps that are

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.220
quite well fortified and
nobody in the middle.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:29.000
Jefferson's belief in the
virtues of compromise were not

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.650
such that the middle way was
always the right way.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.820
I'm not arguing that
compromise is a

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.790
virtue in and of itself.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.080
Sometimes the deal you get is
the deal you don't want.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.620
The American experience with
civil rights and race is the

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.770
great example where the middle
way was not the right way.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.290
There was a right and there
was a wrong, and we should

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.730
have been stronger and more
dedicated to pursuing the

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.310
right earlier and more
assiduously.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.740
But six times out of 10, seven
times out of 10, the practical

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.880
constraints of history suggest
that taking the deal that you

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.000
have at that moment and then
working on it later

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.300
is the way to go.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.670
Jefferson said, "the ground of
liberty is gained by inches."

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.310
So for all of the sweeping
rhetoric, for all of the sage

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.950
of Monticello, for all of the
great achievements on the

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.750
tombstone, the author of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.780
the Virginia statute for
religious liberty, and the

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.250
founder of the University of
Virginia, all those things

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.400
about the life of the mind, and
equality, and the liberty

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.480
of conscience, all of that is
part of the Jefferson legacy.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.980
But it's also one of the great
acts of misdirection, because

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.550
it sends us in the opposite
direction of his political

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.080
career and what that
teaches us.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.660
I think it was quite
on purpose.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.540
I think he was quite conscious
that he wanted us to talk

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.000
about his ideas and not what
he had done for 40 years.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.760
Because what he did for 40 years
was going to be more

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.900
controversial, and it
was going to make

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.500
him look like a Paul.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.710
And the last thing he wanted to
look like was a Paul, even

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.330
though he was one.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.110
And so I think one of the
reasons I wanted to do the

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:09.760
book was to try to recover the
politician whom Jefferson

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.180
himself tried to hide.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.930
He hides in plain sight on so
many things, and his political

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.290
career is one of the great
examples, and slavery which

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.540
we'll talk about in a second.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.350
Understanding his political
skill and the fact that he was

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.310
irresistibly drawn to the work
of politics when he could have

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.560
done almost anything,
this was a man who--

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.610
if you had to get a hand dealt
to you in the last 300 years,

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.680
being a rich, white Virginian
in the middle of the 18th

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.670
century is pretty damn good.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.990
That's not a bad way to start.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.320
And you owned people.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.870
They're dedicated to doing
whatever you say.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.050
You can borrow endless money
from England, and no one

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.890
apparently ever calls
you on it.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:57.965
Jefferson was one of
these aristocrats.

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.770
It was like Winston Churchill.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.400
Never had any money, and
yet always had terrific

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.590
champagne at dinner.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.970
I don't understand
how this works.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:11.170
I can't get that deal,
but they did.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:18.240
He had every opportunity to
retire to Monticello, to be a

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.170
man of science, to be a
philosopher, to be an author.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.920
Irresistibly he was drawn again
and again back to the

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.510
political arena.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.770
And I think that's
a good thing.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.360
Until we find another way to
work these things out, which

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.200
is not on the horizon, we need
people who are willing to

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.170
suffer the slings and arrows of
our own anxieties and our

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.310
own unhappinesses with
politicians to go into the

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.250
arena to build something.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.210
And he clearly saw that this was
a moment in human history,

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.560
both because of the
Enlightenment and because of

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.950
the Revolution being what I
think of as an embodiment of

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.370
the Enlightenment in
many ways, was a

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.430
unique historical moment.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.250
To create something that would
then be subject to the

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.980
perennial forces and perennial
shortcomings of human

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.010
experience, very conscious
about all

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.800
those elements of it.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.550
And he was the one figure in my
view at the founding period

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.880
who did justice to both sides
of that equation.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.960
There were great politicians,
and there were great thinkers.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.500
Jefferson, with the possible
exception of Benjamin

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.510
Franklin, was the one who
straddled those two worlds and

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.020
brought them together in a way
that tangibly changed the

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.970
course of the world.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.200
The idea that individual destiny
should be controlled

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.730
by an individual was a raw,
new, untested idea.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.660
And Jefferson articulated
it as an ideal and

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.410
fought to make it real.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:56.400
And for that, he repays our
attention, I think.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.030
The great hypocrisy and the
great failing of his life was

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.670
his inability, his self-imposed
inability to

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.270
apply these formidable political
skills to doing

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.600
anything about slavery
after 1784.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.490
Jefferson's born in '43.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.990
He's elected to the House of
Burgesses in 1769, to the

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.410
Continental Congress in 1775.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:23.940
He stays in the Confederation
Congress in the 1780s.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.490
On four or five occasions,
through those years, he tried

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.110
to reform slavery.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.660
And he was defeated publicly
and decisively each time.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.650
And there are two things
politicians hate more than any

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.750
other, and that's being
defeated publicly and

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.040
decisively.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.250
And in 1784, he drafted a
Northwest Ordinance that would

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.990
have prohibited the spread
of slavery west.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.560
Sound familiar?

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.750
It lost by a single vote in the
Confederation Congress.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.630
A delegate from New
Jersey was late.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:59.110
And Jefferson said that "in that
moment, Heaven itself was

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.590
suffered an awful silence, and
the fate of millions yet

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.630
unborn hung in the balance."
Very eloquent, very charming,

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.480
much like all of Jefferson.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.710
Yet, yet, yet he continued
to be a public figure.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.790
He was the Secretary of State,
the Vice President, and the

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.430
President of the United
States, and the senior

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:25.420
statesman in the United States
for the next 40 years.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.470
And for those 40 years, he never
returned to the task of

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:36.300
emancipation or colonization,
any kind of reform of slavery.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.010
My view is that it's because he
simply could not imagine a

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.010
world without it.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.390
His first memory was of being
a child on a pillow being

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.590
handed up to a slave on
horseback to be taken on a

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.160
family journey.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.100
One of the last things that we
know that happened to him is

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.780
he was in his alcove bed
in Monticello and was

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.030
uncomfortable and was trying to
signal to his white family

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.200
what to do to fix it.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.310
And no one understood except an
enslaved butler who moved

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.870
the pillow and made him
instantly comfortable.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.980
So from the beginning to the end
of his life, his life was

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.750
suffused and made possible
by slavery.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.610
It's the central hypocrisy,
it's the central

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.690
tragedy of his life.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.380
Someone like me can't have it
both ways and say he was a

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.560
master politician.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.930
Then from 1800 to 1840, for 36
of those years, either Thomas

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.570
Jefferson himself or a
self-described Jeffersonian

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.810
was president.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.810
You can't salute that political
experience and that

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.490
political achievement and not
hold him to account for

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.660
failing to apply those
skills to slavery.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.650
He clearly knew it was
a moral wrong.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.180
His letters clearly show it, and
yet he just tied himself

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.100
into ever smaller knots about
it, because he did not believe

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.670
that his generation
could solve it.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.450
It was a very un-Jeffersonian
thing to do, to give up hope.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.930
In every other sphere of
American life, he was the

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.960
architect of a politics of
optimism that every great

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.330
American leader has drawn
on to achieve

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.510
power and to govern.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:19.060
Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy,
Johnson, Reagan--

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:25.200
all of those figures talked
about the price of present

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.730
pain and sacrifice being of use
to make a better world for

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.510
tomorrow and that that was the
American destiny and the

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.860
American way.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.200
It may sound homiletic.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.400
It may simple-minded.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.880
But it has been an incredibly
important central factor in

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.970
moving the cause of reform
forward throughout two and a

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.450
half centuries now
of American life.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.030
So Jefferson is not indicted.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.730
He's convicted before the bar
of history on slavery.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.420
One thing I would urge us all
to think about is that, as

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.100
Arthur Schlesinger used to say,
"self-righteousness in

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.950
retrospect is easy, also cheap."
So our wagging our

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:10.420
finger at the past might make
us feel better for a moment.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.420
But to my mind, the moral
utility of history is to look

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.760
back and realize that if one
generation's accepted practice

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.220
was another generation's clear
evil, then we are probably in

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.340
the midst of a very similar
drama right now.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.280
So what is the issue, the moral
issue of our time--

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.790
or issues, plural,
of our time--

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.920
that 20, 30, 40 years from now
someone is going to look back

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.590
and say, what were
they thinking?

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.710
What were they doing?

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.790
To my mind, on a personal level,
it's climate change.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.000
A compelling moral case
has been made.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.990
Largely for economic and
cultural reasons of

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.440
convenience, we've declined to
do anything about it, which is

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.550
kind of what Jefferson was
doing with slavery.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.490
So using the failures of the
past to try to raise our own

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.880
moral antenna, I think is one
way of making something out of

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.360
those failures and those
shortcomings.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.795
And I always learn
more from sinners

00:27:14.795 --> 00:27:16.790
than from saints anyway.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.600
So I want to give Abraham
Lincoln the last word, because

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.390
he had such a good box
office last week.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.500
Man.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.590
Harry Truman once said that
"heroes always know when to

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:36.110
die." Getting killed on Good
Friday, if your name is

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.220
Abraham, was really
smart stagecraft.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.750
That was good.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.270
Here's what Lincoln said about
Jefferson in 1859 about that

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.790
all men are created equal.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.370
He said, "all honor to
Jefferson, to the man who in

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.990
the concrete pressure of
a struggle for national

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.380
independence had the coolness,
forecast, and capacity"--

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.140
"the coolness, forecast,
and capacity"--

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.120
"to introduce into a merely
revolutionary document an

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.430
abstract truth, applicable to
all men and at all times that

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.800
today and in all coming days
it shall be a rebuke and

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.500
stumbling block to the very
signs of reappearing tyranny

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.460
and oppression." Not
a bad legacy.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.686
Thanks very much.

00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:24.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.950
JON MEACHAM: Thank you.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.740
AUDIENCE: With the fiscal cliff
looming, I'm curious if

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.180
you'd like to talk about
Jefferson's view on debt and

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.145
deficits, taxes, and how his
position may have helped or

00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:38.680
hurt him during his
presidency.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.930
JON MEACHAM: Oh, it's
great question.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.400
When he became president, he
thought there were too many

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.500
taxes and too many judges.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.420
And he wanted to get
rid of both.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.790
And did a pretty good job
on the judges front.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.490
He did a pretty good job on
abolishing internal taxes.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.410
He did not leave the treasury
in a very good place as the

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.910
War of 1812 came along.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.610
So it was not a brilliant
public policy moment.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.360
But like a lot of presidents, he
overreacted to the excesses

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.030
of his predecessor.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.410
So believing that Adams and
Washington had taken the

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.250
country too far in a Federalist
direction, he

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.740
proceeded to take it too far
in a Republican direction.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.890
The answer being somewhere
in the middle.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.960
He abhorred public debt, because
he believed that that

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.640
was the way to create--
does this

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.750
sound familiar to anyone--

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:33.320
create a financial class of
people who would speculate

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.020
without creating anything, and
devise financial instruments

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.290
and a culture of what
was called stock

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.380
jobbing at the time.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.930
A culture of stock jobbing that
would possibly put the

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:49.820
country in the--

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.870
weaken the country by weakening
this economy and its

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.310
potential national security.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:30:00.730
That turned out to be fairly
prescient as it turned out.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.830
This level of debt, none of
those guys could get their

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.970
brains around it.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.220
And we can't rip them out
of context in any event.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.450
I think the lesson of Jefferson,
for this moment, is

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.210
to take what you can get as
quickly as possible, if you're

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.360
the president.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.820
One thing that's really
important, I think, is a

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.160
second term president has one
clock, and everybody else in

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.150
the system has another.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.870
And a second term president's
clock is

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.770
ticking toward history.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.520
Everybody else's clock
is ticking

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.010
toward the next election.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.750
So every other stakeholder in
the system has a reason to

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.820
look at what's politically
palatable, except the

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.670
president who can actually
take a long view

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.820
for the first time.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.370
Because second term presidents
have all

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.620
fought their last election.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.340
I think one of the reasons
second terms often feature

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.800
some stumbles are presidents
take that second term victory

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.420
as a vindication.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.080
It's very clear when you talk
to former presidents--

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.400
nobody knows how to keep score
better than former presidents.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.690
They know who the one-termers
are, and the second-termers.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.030
It's very, very competitive.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.330
Surprise, surprise.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:24.360
But I think that if the
president doesn't keep in mind

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.370
that his clock is ticking fast
and his political capital is

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.450
diminishing by the day, any--

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.720
and I'm trying to ban
this phrase--

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.180
kicking the can down the road.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.540
How many cans can we kick?

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.770
It's a terrible--

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.840
we use it too much now.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.780
But anything that delays the
full reckoning weakens his

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.050
ultimate position.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:49.660
And so if I were advising the
president, I would say take

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.470
Boehner by the scruff of the
neck right now, and try to get

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.140
what you can in the
lame duck session.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.310
Because it ends fast.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.610
Yes, sir.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:03.230
AUDIENCE: I'm intrigued by the
subtitle or the tag line on

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.690
the book, "The Art of Power."

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.240
JON MEACHAM: We did it for
search optimization.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:09.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:09.675 --> 00:32:11.940
JON MEACHAM: Just kidding.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.460
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
if you could share--

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.900
JON MEACHAM: Not many places
where you make a search

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.730
optimization joke.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.945
AUDIENCE: Nor where
people will laugh.

00:32:18.945 --> 00:32:21.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.890
JON MEACHAM: Sorry.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:26.700
AUDIENCE: So intrigued by this
notion of the art of power,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.640
and wondering if you can share
an anecdote about Jefferson's

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.010
application of power as applied
to statecraft and how

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:40.670
that might be different than
predecessors or successors.

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.750
JON MEACHAM: Yep.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.700
I think Louisiana is the great
example, because he--

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.510
my definition of the art of
power is that the greatest

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.750
leaders can articulate an ideal
and inspire people to

00:32:54.750 --> 00:33:00.480
want to pursue it, but can also
bring that ideal as close

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.200
to reality as possible.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.300
And that most people can do
one or the other, and the

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.820
great politicians are the
ones that can do both.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.230
And that's why there's so few,
because they're two very

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.280
different skill sets.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.940
Painting a picture of what we
should be is a job for people

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.980
who are eloquent, and
far-seeing, and somewhat

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.160
detached from reality.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.160
Because it helps to be in an
intellectual off-site in order

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.520
to overcome your
own limitations

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.820
and envision a future.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.990
Politicians who are just deal
makers are just the guys who

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.380
know how to get a bill
through markup.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.520
I can't even remember
what markup is.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.620
But legislative mechanics are
also highly tactical,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.430
pragmatic guys.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.200
It's the two who can do it.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.660
And Franklin Roosevelt's the
great modern example, I think.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.130
President Clinton is
too in some ways.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.320
There's something poetic that
his middle name is Jefferson

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.970
in the whole sweep of things.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:05.670
But what he did in
Louisiana is--

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:10.500
and we forget how big
a deal this was.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.469
By adding Louisiana to the
United States, it transformed

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:19.469
the country politically and
culturally instantly.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.770
New England knew this, because
New England immediately drew

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.750
up articles of secession.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.379
Because they realized they were
going to be outnumbered,

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:29.810
and it wasn't going to
be pretty with the

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.330
South and the West.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:34.320
And so, there was opposition
to this.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.940
There was a sense that, wait a
minute, if we do this, it's

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:43.340
going to transform us more
quickly than we're ready for.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.719
And by the way, Mr. President,
Mr. Republican, you don't have

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.610
the power to do it.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:53.060
And he just swept
all that away.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.429
Grabbed the initiative and did
it when he found out Napoleon

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.600
was rethinking it.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.610
And I'm convinced, because I'm
a biographer, that the roots

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.860
of that decision lay back
in his failed wartime

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.520
governorship of Virginia.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.310
He was governor for
two years during a

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.460
time of British invasion.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.660
He failed to call out the
militia in time to repel

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.700
Benedict Arnold and General
Cornwallis.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.020
The British almost
captured him.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.800
He was about five minutes ahead
of them at Monticello.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.930
Could easily have ended up in
the Tower, facing treason

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.110
charges if they caught him.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.750
And he was censured for it.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.450
He was attacked for
it forever.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.630
To the end of his days, he
was seen as a coward.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.500
The flight from Monticello,
it was called.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.650
What would they have had him
do has been my question.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:48.550
But he decided then, in what I
think of as his Scarlet O'Hara

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.320
moment, that he'd never be
hungry again, that he was

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.620
never going to be caught
flat-footed again.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.540
And so Louisiana became
the great

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.980
political moment for that.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.930
The declaration itself
is an example.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.420
The embargo is an example.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.110
They're all the way through
his political life, but I

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.410
think that's the
most vivid one.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.530
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.160
In the beginning of your
remarks, you made a call to

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.060
action to each of us to get
involved politically each day.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.180
JON MEACHAM: Right.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.690
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to relay
some personal experience this

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.920
week, again, talking about the
fiscal cliff, where I have

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.330
some thoughts on policy.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.340
And I called into my
congresswomen and to my

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.610
representative.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.620
And basically, the pattern was
the same in each of these

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.800
three cases.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.490
Basically, hello, blah,
blah, blah.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:46.040
I asked to speak to the
legislative aide dealing with

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.750
tax and budget issues.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.780
They put me on hold
for a few moments.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.440
They come back.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.550
They say, well, can you
tell me which group

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.710
you're calling from?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.095
And I say, I'm a voter.

00:36:56.095 --> 00:36:57.200
I'm a constituent.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:57.930
JON MEACHAM: America.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.480
AUDIENCE: As if, that's
like embarrassing.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.860
I knew that was the wrong
answer, right?

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.190
And so then they go away for a
longer period of time, and

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.320
they come back.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.930
Well, the legislative aide
is not in the office,

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.790
or busy, or et cetera.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.920
Can I take your remarks?

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.400
And then I try to give my
remarks, but they're not

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.950
really up to speed on what's
going on with legislation,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.950
blah, blah, blah.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.520
So this is not something
that's just

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.060
happened this week.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.820
It's happened repeatedly.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.190
JON MEACHAM: Sure.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.450
AUDIENCE: Whenever I call in.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:34.340
If I write in to my senators or
congresswomen, I get back a

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.620
few months later a letter that
has me wondering what issue it

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.790
was that I originally wrote
about four months ago.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:43.340
JON MEACHAM: Right.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.560
AUDIENCE: And if I had the same
exact opposite opinion as

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.990
what I had, I could read that
letter and still feel the same

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.370
exact way about what
their response was.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.660
In other words, there was no
value in it whatsoever.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:07.970
So the question is, how do we
get involved in democracy in a

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.830
daily way that has an impact?

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.630
Because as I see it, it's
really more about TV.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.230
It's more about propaganda.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.740
And it is about these big
groups and money.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.400
But I'm wondering how people
in this room get involved.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.190
JON MEACHAM: Well, sorry.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.064
Go ahead.

00:38:26.064 --> 00:38:26.466
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:38:26.466 --> 00:38:27.270
All yours.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.050
JON MEACHAM: No.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.090
I totally get it.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.650
The fact that you get a letter
four months later is better

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.030
than I would've thought.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:39.010
So that's a good sign
in some ways.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:45.840
I think it does come down to an
organizational principle.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:52.890
The idea that one person can
call and make an impact is,

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.540
you've run into it, the
practical obstacles to that

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.450
are seemingly insuperable.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.970
So it puts us into a question
of, all right, so we need to

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.020
organize ourselves into groups,
into what Burke called

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.680
little platoons.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.260
And then we do that, and then
the groups, because of the

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.920
nature of groups, become
more reflexive.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.780
Because the people who are going
to be running the groups

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.300
are going to be very
devoted, right?

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.530
They're not going to be
kind of volunteering.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.340
They're going to be thinking
about all this stuff.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.510
So then do those groups then
become part of the base that

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.740
becomes reflexive and becomes
part of the problem?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.470
I totally acknowledge that
organic chain, and I think

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.620
that that is inevitable.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:39.600
I do think that there are the
means of organization in terms

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:46.750
of political pressure to put
on representatives is such

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.460
that there are two kinds.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:56.220
There's the money and the big
corporations, and then there's

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.750
the rest of us.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.310
And the rest of us have to fight
with the same means that

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.810
the corporations do insofar
as we can, and that's

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.190
organizationally.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.810
And so, clearly President
Obama understands this.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.470
The Obama campaign, I should
say, understands this.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:17.550
If the stories about their
technological capacities--

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.620
but you all would know much
more about than I do--

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.920
if the stories about their
ability to find voters who are

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.370
inclined to be with them, if
they can't figure out a way to

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:33.080
use that technology to turn
that into a useful army of

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.180
folks to email, to call,
whatever it is.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.290
Because they do keep--

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.860
I will say this.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.660
Your Congresswoman,
who is it by way?

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.492
AUDIENCE: Ann Eshoo.

00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:43.940
JON MEACHAM: OK.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.860
I was hoping it was
the speaker,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.110
because that'd be fun.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.520
They will get a count at the
end of the day about calls,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.650
pro and con.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.760
That's absolutely
quantifiable.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.610
But I think it has to be
organizational, and I think

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.730
it's kind of vital.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:08.970
Otherwise, it's going to be
totally run by the other.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.000
And so at least we should
all try to become the

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.610
other along the way.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.350
Does that make sense?

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:19.170
AUDIENCE: I agree with your
set up and your view.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.400
What I struggle with is I don't
see any path from your

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.900
remarks and where we are now to
basically get to where we

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.930
have an impact.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:31.330
So if I think that, for example,
on fiscal cliff, that

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.750
we should raise taxes,
the 39.6--

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:37.140
do exactly what Obama ran on,
which he seems now to be

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.580
moving away from maybe--

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.830
and not this idea that we give
up all the tax deductions,

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:47.090
where's my group for that?

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.140
JON MEACHAM: I would imagine
that emailing and applying

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.470
pressure to the House, which is
what we're supposed to do,

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.730
would have an impact.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.090
I think it's going to happen,
so if that's what you really

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.460
believe, well done.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.170
I think it's going to happen.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.560
I don't know.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.030
I'm not Ralph Nader,
so I don't know.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:10.470
Thank God for everyone,
including Ralph Nader.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.430
So I don't really have an
action plan for that.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.760
But I do think that if we don't
keep thinking about this

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.030
and talking about it, we're
going to be in a worse place.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.610
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.060
JON MEACHAM: Thank you.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.900
AUDIENCE: If you
come up with--

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.200
JON MEACHAM: I'll do it.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:22.530
You're the man.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:23.370
AUDIENCE: Write another book.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.280
JON MEACHAM: I'm going
to call you.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.050
JON MEACHAM: Wait a minute.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.080
You're the Google guy.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.160
You're supposed to do this.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.660
What are you talking
to me about?

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.320
I still kill trees
for what I do.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.800
AUDIENCE: So I've always been
fascinated by the Declaration

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.210
of Independence in
particular--

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:41.920
JON MEACHAM: A good thing
to be fascinated by.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.100
AUDIENCE: In particular a
section at the end, where

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.830
Jefferson writes, and I'm
paraphrasing, when a

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.550
government no longer represents
the interests of

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.180
its people, it's their right
and it's their duty to

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.340
overthrow it.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.060
That's always struck me as a
pretty remarkable thing, the

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.610
part where it's your duty as
a citizen to overthrow a

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.490
government.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.950
I'm curious if he ever expounded
upon that in his

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.960
later writings or political
philosophies.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.210
JON MEACHAM: That's
a great question.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.830
One of the issues about
writing 22,000 letters

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.370
eloquently over 80 years is that
you come down on almost

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.950
every side of every issue.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:16.500
It's like the Bible and
Winston Churchill.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.050
You can quote them on
both sides, too.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.420
He had these flights
of revolutionary--

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.590
lower case R--

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.190
revolutionary rhetoric,
particularly

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.980
when he was in France.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.470
And then again, there was a
big surge of it during the

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.440
period when he was trying to
protest the Alien and Sedition

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.180
Acts in the late 1790s
in what he called

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.480
the Reign of Witches.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.170
And so there are documents from
both those periods where

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:50.000
that's where there's lines
about the tree of liberty

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.150
requires the blood of tyrants
and patriots.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.650
It is its natural manure.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:59.850
Those kinds of quotations that
both right wing extremists and

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:03.440
left wing extremists have used
in past years to justify

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.750
certain courses of action.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.770
They date from these
two periods.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:16.210
So he definitely believed that
because he was doing it right

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.770
at that moment that there
was an inherent right of

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.360
revolution.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.370
Raises an interesting question
about was there an inherent

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.120
right of secession.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.400
According to his Kentucky and
Virginia resolutions, which he

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.870
and Madison wrote, that was
an intellectual path to

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:42.410
nullification and secession,
which honestly, I think is a

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.620
case that can be made.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.820
The great triumph of Jackson
during nullification, and

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:53.120
ultimately Lincoln, and Daniel
Webster, was creating this

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.240
case for union that really flew
in the face of the actual

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.630
strict letter of those
documents.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.200
And I think it's one of the
great political achievements

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.900
of all time.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.920
And thank God they did.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.580
But Jefferson's devotion to the
idea that institutions had

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.810
to be reformed, institutions,
if they weren't reformable,

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:21.930
needed to be overthrown,
was a consistent one.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:22.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.950
JON MEACHAM: Thanks.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.990
AUDIENCE: There is a lengthy
and often combative sort of

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.170
historiography around
Thomas Jefferson.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.090
A lot has been written
about him.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.780
JON MEACHAM: There is?

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:34.260
I was misinformed.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.690
AUDIENCE: I'm sure you
ultimately know.

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.500
I was wondering if you could
speak a little bit about where

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.510
your perception falls on the
line of that sort of

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.100
historiographical background.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.930
JON MEACHAM: Sure.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.620
What I wanted to do was recover

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.720
the political Jefferson.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.270
My sense is that, particularly
in the last 20 years, he has

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.530
been seen as either a hopeless
hypocrite, as opposed to just

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:06.480
a hypocrite, in terms of race,
or a fundamentally duplicitous

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.090
politician who had no
real principles.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:19.680
And the former is very much,
it's quite self-evident in the

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.380
historiographies, as you say.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.910
The latter is more subtle, but
all too real, I think.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.140
We've been in this golden era of
great biographies about the

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.360
people around Jefferson--

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.960
Washington, Hamilton, Adams.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:42.040
And necessarily, those books
have spent more time on

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.670
Jefferson's flaws than his
virtues for various

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.490
understandable narrative
reasons.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.630
And I thought that left a place
to have a conversation

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.430
about Jefferson as politician
as opposed to duplicitous

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.600
politician insofar as
that's redundant.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.710
So that's an issue.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:08.700
But I think the critical thing
for me was could I present a

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.940
compelling portrait of
what this man did

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.080
every day for 40 years.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:20.290
Because again, he didn't want
us looking at this too hard.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:24.480
I'm convinced that's why the
tombstone is the way it is.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.750
He understood history.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.470
He understood fame.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.560
The 18th century sense of fame
was really reputation.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.670
He knew we'd be talking
about him.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:37.380
He and Adams exchanged 158
letters in his retirement.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.610
And if you think those are the
first draft of those letters,

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.500
I mean, they're ciceronian.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.200
And I just don't think they
were dashing them off.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.060
Hey, LOL.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.160
That just wasn't--

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:49.052 --> 00:47:50.630
You hear that one
about Hamilton?

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.120
LOL.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.480
I also like to point
out that my guy

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.000
didn't get shot in Jersey.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.450
Let's keep that in mind, too.

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.600
So historiographically, I hope
that this is Jefferson the

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:09.340
politician, and a man who's
failings are universal in many

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.510
ways to the nation.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.230
Because Jefferson's tragedy
is also America's tragedy.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.070
One final thing on this.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.130
James Parton, who
was the first--

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.110
Henry Randall was really the
first biographer, and then

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.780
James Parton was the second,
1860s or so, 1880s.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.180
And Parton wrote that "if
America is right, then

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.425
Jefferson is right.

00:48:28.425 --> 00:48:31.250
If America's wrong, then
Jefferson's wrong."

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:34.680
That is one hell of a burden
to put on any one person.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.690
No one says that about
Washington.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:37.940
No one says it about Hamilton.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.140
No one says it about Adams.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.010
No one says it about Madison.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.450
But we do say it about
Jefferson.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.510
And why is that?

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.170
I think it's because he's
such a vivid human

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.470
figure to us still.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:50.990
He's the one founder I can
imagine having a drink with.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.890
I can't imagine having a
drink with John Adams.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:54.970
I mean, it'd be fine.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:49:00.570
But I really think that
Jefferson lives on in our

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:04.450
imaginations, because we
intuitively know that he

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:08.050
articulated the promise of
the best we could be, but

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.340
was far from it.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.710
And I think when we're being
honest with ourselves, we're

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.660
all kind of like that.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.134
JON MEACHAM: Thank you.

00:49:17.134 --> 00:49:18.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.870
When you think about our role
as citizens today and

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.740
confronting the political
challenges that we face now,

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.660
how do you see digital
technology

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.650
helping or hurting that?

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.630
And like is there
something that--

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.160
JON MEACHAM: There is going to
be a new plan in a few days.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.230
JON MEACHAM: Right here.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.830
AUDIENCE: Is there something
that we should be building?

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:37.220
JON MEACHAM: Well, that's
a great-- yes.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.200
That's a great question.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.160
Is there a public square beyond
the inadvertent one

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.260
that the internet creates?

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:45.830
Exactly.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:50.950
Is there some place where
digital democracy can

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.500
contribute to the good as
opposed to what I think it

00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:01.070
tends to do now, which is
reinforce preexisting biases.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.200
I'm speaking in vastly
oversimplified terms.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.200
But one of the things that the
digital revolution has made

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.870
possible is you can
get in contact.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.470
You can make yourself heard
anyway, whether it's in

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.710
comment sections, or Twitter,
or Facebook, whatever it is.

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.640
Every man is a pundit now.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.750
And that's great.

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:29.330
But with power comes
responsibility.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.660
And so as FDR once said, simply
screaming from the

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.950
rooftops doesn't help
us a whole lot.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:43.520
So is there a way to harness
this amazing tool to create,

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.870
what one would argue,
could be a more

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.490
constructive political dialogue?

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.000
I would hope so.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.635
And I think we're not even
halfway through this, right?

00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:57.300
These are the first
moments of this.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.950
And so I think you all--

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.553
I don't mean to preach at you--
but you all have a hell

00:51:02.553 --> 00:51:04.330
of a responsibility here.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:05.580
I mean, this is Google.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.970
Some guy last night in Seattle
asked me where he could find a

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.400
particular letter of
Jefferson's, and I thought he

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.220
meant the idea.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.740
No, he meant the letter, the
actual one he'd written.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.110
And so I said, well, I don't
have the date off

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:23.030
the top of my head.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.200
He said, well, do I
have to Google it?

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.040
I said, well, if you have
to ask, then yes you do.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.780
That's a key thing.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.660
So you're a verb.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:37.670
So you're one of the key
cultural landmarks of the age.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.960
So I think that there's an
enormous responsibility there

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:45.760
to try to figure out how do
you use this immense sea?

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.850
How do you channel it into
productive ways?

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:53.650
So I should be asking you
all this, is my point.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.910
AUDIENCE: Real quick.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.890
So Jefferson's hypocrisy and his
Machiavellian tendencies

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.290
are very well-documented.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.350
Is there any sense in the
letters with Adams anytime

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:04.150
later in his life, taking stock
of his political career,

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:08.380
any point in which he says, wow,
looking back, I really

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.410
maybe went a little bit
too far at times?

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.350
I regret some of my actions.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:14.680
I'm sorry, John, for all
the backstabbing.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.960
Any sort of kind of taking stock
and realizing there are

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.350
some things I would have
done differently?

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.320
JON MEACHAM: Yes, but.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:31.420
I think the resumption of the
correspondence in 1814, 1815

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.790
is, in fact, that.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.840
It's as close as Thomas
Jefferson was ever going to

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.560
get to saying I'm sorry.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.120
And I don't know if you've
ever tried to make a

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.610
politician apologize, but it
doesn't work out very well.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.990
And do y'all know the story of
the reunion very quickly,

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.450
because it's like high school.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:56.020
Benjamin Rush the Patriot
physician from Philadelphia

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.960
tells Adams--

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.750
he's been trying to broker
this and get them back

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.620
together for years.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.460
And so he tells Adams that
Jefferson is really desperate,

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.935
desperate to go out with you.

00:53:04.935 --> 00:53:06.970
And he tells Jefferson, well,
man, Adams really

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:09.140
wants to ask you out.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.960
And so finally, somebody
writes somebody.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.150
So that was a very
careful dance.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:16.870
And I think that the
resumption of that

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:21.300
correspondence was a sign that
the passions of the 1790s in

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.620
particular, which is
where most of this

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.320
happened, were receding.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.820
Adams always tried to introduce
the kinds of

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.810
questions you're asking about.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:32.120
Tried to refight a lot of
those political battles.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.430
Jefferson resisted it.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.750
He said we should not be like
Priam and buckle on the armor

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.990
of party once again.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.110
And so that was his sense
of closing the door.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.720
He mused in very interesting
ways about

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.030
the nature of politics.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.930
The line I quoted earlier, I
think, men have separated

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.510
themselves into parties over
differences of opinion between

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.870
the interests of the many and
the interests of the few.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:01.410
That was a later insight.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.860
But it was more implicit.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.310
And I would leave
you with this.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:11.890
I think the fact that he wrote
an epitaph for himself that

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:18.970
fails to allude to what he did
for 40 years is a sign that he

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:22.160
understood that this was
always going to be a

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.180
contentious topic.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.450
And politics is always
going to be that.

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:31.650
And so one of the reasons I do
this is I hope by pointing to

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.130
the past and pointing out that
things have been pretty tough

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.890
before, that it kind of
lowers our collective

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.740
blood pressure a bit.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.500
And I think if our blood
pressure is a little lower, I

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.710
think we make slightly
better decisions.

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.210
So thank you all very much.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.518
[APPLAUSE]
