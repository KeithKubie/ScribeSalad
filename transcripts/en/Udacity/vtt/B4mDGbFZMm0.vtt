00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.620
This was the correct answer. Fantastic job if you found it. Now if you got stuck

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.370
along the way, it might of been at this denominator that gave you trouble. Let's

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.525
see how we can find our lowest common denominator first. This denominator

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:17.097
factors to x plus 2 times x minus 1. And then this denominator is actually the

00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:22.888
difference of two perfect squares. So we can factor it as X plus 1 times X minus

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:26.610
1. We see the two denominators have a common factor of X minus 1, so we list

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.750
that in the middle for our factor tree method. The other factor's on the outside

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.110
and then we multiply all of them together to get our lowest common denominator.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.117
X plus 2 times X minus 1. Times x plus 1. Next we want to turn each of these

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:45.340
fractions into an equivalent fraction with the lowest common denominator. This

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.904
first denominator is missing the factor x plus 1. So we multiply the numerator

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:54.457
and denominator by it. The second fraction is missing the factor x plus 2. For

00:00:54.457 --> 00:00:59.829
this numerator we're multiplying 2 binomials together and we get x squared minus

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.412
x minus 2. For the second fraction we're[INAUDIBLE] this 3, the quantity x plus

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:11.064
2. So we have 3 times x which is 3 x and 3 times 2 which is 6. Now that we've

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:15.560
added our numerators together we have a new numerator. And we should always ask

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.458
ourselves can we factor this? If we can factor this then we'll be able to

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:24.074
simplify another factor in the numerator and denominator. But in this case, this

00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:29.676
numerator can't be factored. There are no factor pairs of 4 that sum to positive

00:01:29.676 --> 00:01:33.593
2. This is why we're finished and we can have this as our answer.
