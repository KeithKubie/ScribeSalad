00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.760
The galaxy far far away has enjoyed one of
the biggest and most complicated world of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.300
extended universe stories in history, even
if the movies themselves are the only canon

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.300
future films will follow.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.129
You might think that just seven movies would
put a limit on the wild theories fans could

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.789
create to show the Star Wars saga in a whole
new light – but you would be wrong.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.650
Here are 10 Star Wars Theories That Change
Everything.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.289
Chewbacca: The Rebel Spy

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.050
Think about it: if Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke
Skywalker hadn’t stumbled onto Han Solo

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.170
in the first movie, the pilot never would
have joined the rebellion, or become one of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.240
its top generals.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.400
What if it wasn’t a coincidence?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.830
Chewbacca is actually the first person Obi-Wan
talks to in the Tatooine cantina, and winds

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.820
up joining the rebellion along with his pilot
– the same rebellion born out of the slaughter

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.070
of the Jedi that Chewbacca witnessed firsthand
in Revenge of the Sith.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.560
If he knew Yoda, he could have known any number
of Jedi, including Anakin Skywalker.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.870
Did Obi-Wan tell him Luke’s true power and
importance, and Chewie made sure Han joined

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.870
the fight?

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.110
We’ll never know, but it’s too good to
a theory to ignore.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.380
Luke Was The Emperor’s True Apprentice

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.680
It seems pretty stupid in hindsight that Obi-Wan
hid Luke from his father by leaving him with

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.510
Anakin’s family on his home planet.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:13.670
Even if Anakin couldn’t bring himself to
track his children down, the Emperor definitely

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.240
would have – but what if the Emperor didn’t
want Luke killed?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.659
He was in no hurry to die at his apprentice’s
hands, and even tried to recruit Luke as his

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.219
new student before he died at Vader’s hands.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.579
Vader wound up scarred, missing limbs and
close to death, so the Emperor keeping him

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:34.159
close to eventually lure his more powerful
son into the open makes a lot of sense.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.159
The Ewoks Ate The Stormtroopers

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.350
When the Rebels first meet the Ewoks, it’s
only C-3PO who keeps the adorable creatures

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.390
from cooking and eating them.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.810
Keep that in mind when you get to the original
saga’s finale, and the Ewoks are celebrating

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.380
their victory, dancing, drinking, and playing
Stormtrooper helmets li9ke drums.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.979
But… they totally just took those helmets
and left the bodies in the forest… right?

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.649
We’re half convinced you can spot piles
of chewed-clean bones somewhere in the scene,

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.820
but realize that plenty of the Stormtroopers
were injured, not killed in the battle, and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.329
those Ewoks become a lot less cute.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.329
Darth Jar Jar

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.750
Sure, it’s a silly theory, but trying to
make sense out of the most hated Star Wars

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750
character is understandable.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.640
How can Jar Jar Binks be so stupid, yet so
lucky and important all at the same time?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.760
Easy: he was working with the Sith the whole
time.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.690
How else do you explain his decision to hand
power of the Senate over to the future Emperor?

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.690
Pure cluelessness?

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.080
Nope, we see a secret alliance between two
cold hearted political operatives.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.680
And his friends never saw it coming.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.260
Boba Fett Killed Luke’s Family

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.480
Every fan remembers the moment Luke returns
home to find his aunt and uncle burned down

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.410
to skeletons, their bodies literally disintegrated
off of the bones while their home sits in

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.410
flames.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.660
But it doesn’t look like anything the Stormtroopers
did before or since, leading some to think

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.220
that killing the family was hired out to a
bounty hunter who happened to be in the area

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.250
– the legendary Boba Fett.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.610
Besides making the bounty hunter’s role
in the saga a bit more meaningful, it also

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.720
turns his exchange with Vader in Empire Strikes
Back an inside joke (insert clip of Vader

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.740
with the bounty hunters, turning to Boba when
he says “NO distintegrations”).

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.040
They learned the hard way: burning Skywalkers
down to their skeletons is a great motivation

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.050
for a nearby hero.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.050
Padme Never Loved Anakin

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.640
Sure, this one might be a bit of a reach,
but you can’t blame fans for trying to explain

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.970
why Padme Amidala would ever fall in love
with the awkward, stalker-ish Anakin Skywalker.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.210
The theory basically says that Anakin slowly
used the Force to manipulate Padme into caring

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.080
for him, whether on purpose or by accident.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.480
Or, you could look at it another way: if Anakin
was created out of the Force to bring balance,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.560
the Force may have sensed his turn to the
Dark Side

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.600
ahead of time – and got to work on making
some children to fix their father’s mistakes.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.400
Han Solo is a Force User

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.320
He may not believe in The Force when he first
meets the movie’s star Jedi, but Han Solo

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.320
sure fights like someone sensitive to it.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.750
Think about it: how many times did Han seem
to escape inescapable situations, avoid death

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.180
by inches, or dodge blaster fire with style?

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.580
The Force Awakens showed Rey was just as good
a pilot as Han before she even KNEW she was

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.700
channeling the Force, so the same could be
true for Han.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.515
And considering how important he is to the
Rebel victory, The Force making sure he lived

00:04:10.515 --> 00:04:11.890
to achieve it makes sense.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.610
Rey’s a Kenobi, Not a Skywalker

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.420
From the first looks at Rey in The Force Awakens,
fans speculated that she was truly the daughter

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.189
of Luke Skywalker, and there were plenty of
hints to fuel the rumors.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:26.450
But one theory suggests Rey wasn’t left
on a backwater planet by a Skywalker, but

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.400
a Kenobi – specifically, Obi-Wan’s child.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.480
After all, it’s Obi-Wan’s voice that Rey
hears when she touches Luke’s lightsaber,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.449
and the former Jedi Master has had romances
in the Clone Wars TV series.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.060
If the theory was true, it would make the
Star Wars sage not just about the Skywalkers,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.669
but Anakin and Obi-Wan – two friends who
became like brothers, betrayed eachother,

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.530
only for their grandchildren (Kylo and Rey)
to finally restore a balance.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.979
Not to mention giving Luke Skywalker a version
of ‘the student becoming the master’ that

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.990
no fan would ever forget.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.810
The Jedi Weren’t The Heroes

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.759
We all know the story: the Jedi are betrayed
from within by the evil Sith, and the people

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.169
of the galaxy suffer as a result.

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.249
But that story has some problems.

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.810
For starters, the Jedi Code said they weren’t
supposed to attack or rule over anyone, and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.199
must respect all life, even that of their
enemies.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.050
Now look at the galaxy they lived in: attacking
everywhere they felt it right, leading an

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.279
army on distant battlefields, and even deciding
to attack and kill a democratically appointed

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.700
leader because he was the sole survivor of
their ancient enemies.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.150
They may not be the villains of the Star Wars
universe, but they’re not the heroes, either.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.039
If The Force wasn’t there to help them prevent
their end – maybe it was for a reason.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.150
The Rebels Killed Trillions

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.650
There’s one major problem in depicting the
Empire and Emperor as purely evil: mainly,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.460
that the galactic senate was an absolute mess,
with the so-called peaceful Jedi looking to

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.850
stop a coalition of planets from actually
separating legally.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.300
The theory that the Emperor was actually on
the right track gets even bigger, too, since

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.889
his use of The Force allowed him to see things
the Jedi missed – which may have included

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.559
the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong, an alien
civilization that spent thousands of years

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.749
reaching the Star Wars galaxy, and emerging
just 25 years after the Rebels won… by blowing

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:04.749
up not one, but two moon-sized superweapons.

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.069
That left the galaxy undefended, and while
they won the war in the end, it cost the lives

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.069
of over 600 TRILLION sentient beings.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.059
Was the Emperor trying to fortify the galaxy
to prevent such a slaughter?

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:15.660
We’ll never know, since Disney erased that
bit of the story for The Force Awakens…

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.660
for obvious reasons.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.791
