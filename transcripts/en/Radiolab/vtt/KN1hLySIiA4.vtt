This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.400
And in this hour on radio lab, we're talking about the relationship,

3
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.150
sometimes the uneasy relationship between the brain and the body.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.580
<v 1>Most people who have brains, and that would include,</v>

5
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:15.770
I think most of the listeners here, uh,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.040
think the relationship between brain and body is more like the relationship of a

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.070
commander to a command D, right?

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.500
The brain makes the orders and the body response,

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.560
but I think the more accurate way is to think of this as a conversation

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 1>between the brain and the body. How do you mean? Well, because any movement,</v>

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.530
even a very basic one, let's just say a wagging my tongue, I think.

13
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.090
Okay. Very simple really. But it still involves three steps. First,

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.850
the brain has to issue the command

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.810
<v 3>concentration tongue station. This is mission control, commence wagon.</v>

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.760
<v 1>Second, the command must be executed [inaudible] third.</v>

17
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.610
Now this is the crucial step. The tongue. In this case,

18
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.470
we ports back to the brain.

19
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.370
<v 3>All we have a wagging. I repeat. We have wagons.</v>

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.960
<v 1>Yeah. By completing the loop,</v>

21
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.690
<v 3>because you can control the foot. Kevin fully, she can control. This is full.</v>

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.680
Your Mirror coordinates over to Roger that Michigan.

23
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.260
<v 1>Now my, this happens, this conversation you're having right now,</v>

24
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.340
oh nine or alpha. It happens constantly all over your body.

25
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:16.130
Your brain is issuing commands. [inaudible] come and let me.

26
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:19.960
Parts of your body are receiving the command and reporting back,

27
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.870
right leg standing by and this conversation right arm heads up to something

28
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.160
really quite important. It ends up to incense of yourself.

29
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.290
It's an unconscious sense which really allows you to to move normally.

30
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.610
That's Oliver sacks again,

31
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.650
the neurologist we talked to at the start of the program,

32
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.460
you have of course a sense of smell and if touch and if taste,

33
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.550
he says this sixth sense also has a name is sometimes called proprioception.

34
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.000
Proprioception.

35
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:52.001
Proprioception is the unconscious sense by which the position of one's limits

36
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.660
the posture of one's body is automatically monitored.

37
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.780
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.700
<v 1>nope. Imagine he says what would happen if all of a sudden this sixth sense,</v>

39
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.280
this conversation that you were always having with your body,

40
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.500
suppose it went away. We all have this in a slight way.

41
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:12.041
For example,

42
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:16.840
if you go to the dentist and sometimes half of your mouth or your tongue is

43
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.750
numbed, the tongue may feel very large.

44
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.900
You may grab the Dental Mirror to reassure yourself that all is okay and this

45
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.890
doesn't, it doesn't reassure you do. You can still wag your tone.

46
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.020
Your brain is still sending messages to the top

47
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.220
<v 3>pump station, turn station. This is mission control. The tongue</v>

48
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.790
<v 1>haven't, Kung isn't sending messages back anymore.</v>

49
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.350
So you can you anything. You know that feeling? Yeah, yeah, of course. Now,

50
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:50.040
could you imagine that instead of just losing your tongue,

51
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:54.900
your tongue not responding, suppose your whole body doesn't respond.

52
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.210
What would that be like? I'm in,

53
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:02.140
we have words like deaf or we don't have a word for being ineffective.

54
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.180
Deaf and blind to one's own body

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.870
and yet there are people who have a condition that rare and that horrible.

56
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.190
No proprioception. We talked to such a person,

57
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.660
Ian Waterman and convinced him and his doctor and very good friend Jonathan Cole

58
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.550
to crowd themselves into a very little recording studio. The other,

59
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.510
the BBC, fantastic in Southampton, in England, Hello America.

60
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.890
And we asked them to talk to us. Oh, you got a sexy voice.

61
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.770
Ah, and you hear us? Can you hear me? You're other. Hi. We can, Oh God, yeah.

62
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.020
Thank you guys for coming and doing this with us. Yeah.

63
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.260
Will you just ask us some questions and we'll answer them as best we can far

64
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.940
away. All right. Well let me just start it then. Now, can you remember,

65
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.043
I'm sure you can.

66
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.460
What happened that led to this total change in your life?

67
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.870
<v 4>See, so it began with what I thought was, um, uh,</v>

68
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.320
a bout of the flu or a very heavy, heady cold.

69
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.880
And uh,

70
00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:15.620
I was at the shop probably worked and felt tired and lethargic.

71
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.330
The guy that owned the shop said, look, you know, you'd look on, well, go home,

72
00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:21.980
take it easy. I took the day off,

73
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.460
went home and I've always been pretty energetic and I hate being stuck in doors

74
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.970
and might have. And I thought, well, the fresh air will do me some good.

75
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.190
It got to the shed and pulled the motor mower out, pulled the what out with,

76
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.930
what's the, what do you call it, the mower that the lawnmower out of the shed.

77
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.570
It's going to be one of those cultural moments where you guys call it something

78
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:42.260
else. No, not quite. And pulled the uh,

79
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.100
lawnmower out of the shed and primed it up and started it and it started

80
00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:50.420
chugging away and as I engage the gear off it went and I couldn't keep up with

81
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:51.254
it.

82
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.880
It was a fairly slowly important as sort of Loma and I just did their bemused

83
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.200
thinking, how come I just can't keep up with them,

84
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.720
Ma and didn't really attend to much more than, you know,

85
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.980
I'm just tired and sluggish and lethargic and,

86
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.560
and went back to my bedroom and laid down and, and,

87
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.860
and did some seriously thing.

88
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.040
And the following morning I went to get up and out of bed and collapsed against

89
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:20.740
the radio twice. Fell, slipped, fell,

90
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.410
tumbled out of the bed in front against the radiator.

91
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.060
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

92
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.220
<v 4>It's very difficult to do to describe</v>

93
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.510
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

94
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.370
<v 4>as I lay there and I was laying flat,</v>

95
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.910
I had a rippling sensation in my tummy around the ankles,

96
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:38.490
a a tingling sensation for once we've had a chairman I,

97
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.280
I felt disembodied.

98
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.570
I remember waking up with a hand on my face and not realizing that it was mine.

99
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.540
Simple movement, simple movements. The simplest of movements.

100
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.030
Pick up a cup to eat, to eat biscuits.

101
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.810
<v 1>Those things are certainly very hard. I couldn't control anything totally.</v>

102
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:04.130
I mean from the neck down,

103
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.340
I had no control over over my limbs and for the next 12 years he went from

104
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:13.220
hospital to hospital.

105
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:16.550
Doctors couldn't help him because he never seen anything quite this drastic

106
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.730
until they finally did meet a doctor, Jonathan Cole,

107
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.960
who began to help him figure out what might be going on.

108
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.500
So let me ask Jonathon for a second. What is wrong with the n

109
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.220
<v 6>he had at the time he had his illness,</v>

110
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.840
the last class of peripheral nerve cells to do with sensation.

111
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.000
He lost touch, but also his movement and position sense had got,

112
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.260
is this unusual? I mean in your experience or independence who we talked to,

113
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:48.880
but I normally say that we know of about six in the world really who are like

114
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:49.714
this.

115
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.930
No one really in the world knew what proprioception did and what the effects of

116
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:58.780
the loss of proprioception would be until it,

117
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.300
<v 1>and when they first met, Dr. Cole said to him, he said,</v>

118
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.250
how do you manage? How do you cope with this? Unbelievably,

119
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.970
he was the first doctor to ask that question in told him that on his own over

120
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:21.851
the 12 years he had figured out how to walk again and how to grasp a cup again

121
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.930
and explained that he did this by carefully breaking down and then reassembling

122
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.780
every single move he made.

123
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.240
Started this.

124
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:32.700
<v 4>Um,</v>

125
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.700
I was laying in bed one day in hospital and I wanted to sit up and it just

126
00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:41.490
wouldn't happen. And then laying there in frustration,

127
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.290
I just thought the whole process through and I broke it down into quite simple,

128
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.180
small movements and I lay flat.

129
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.930
I checked where absolutely everything was before I started.

130
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.850
And I then started with the head and folded and tucked my chin onto my chest as

131
00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:01.140
if to start the first part of the cow that I moved my arms slightly forward and

132
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:04.710
I started to tighten some muscles in my tummy and around my back.

133
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.940
And then I started to curl myself to sit in an upright position.

134
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.910
And when I got there, I was sent down to 400 we fell out of bed.

135
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.010
<v 6>He has studied movement. You don't wait.</v>

136
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.560
No one in history has ever studied before. No ballet dotes,

137
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.040
no professor of neurology has ever had to study movement the way ear does every

138
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:24.874
day

139
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.760
<v 1>because every day, every move that Ian makes,</v>

140
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.780
he has to consciously direct it as though Ian, we're two people,

141
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:34.280
a puppeteer and a puppet.

142
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:39.281
His mind is directing and his body is obeying and the strings of Ian's puppet

143
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:44.450
instantly or his eyes are controlling all my movement with my sight at,

144
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.110
because he doesn't have this feedback information coming from his limbs back to

145
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.110
his brain pro for Septa feedback cause that's missing.

146
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.380
Unless he looks directly at the limb, he wants to move, he can't move it.

147
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.100
If I look

148
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.450
<v 4>away from from my hand, I lose all connection with it.</v>

149
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.140
Or what happens if, if it's dark or if the lights are out, we know it's,

150
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.470
he can't afford darkness. If the lights go out accidentally,

151
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.890
Gus call it a dangerous place to be posts all over.

152
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.030
He has not turned out the lights in the night, in the last decades.

153
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.460
Wow. To stay in the world in motion. He must focus,

154
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.870
always focus. He's back. He spent a long time just training with paper clips.

155
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.400
I use them now occasionally and I still don't like the little devils. Um,

156
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.360
you know, I mean we wait, when you're, when you're manipulating the paper clip,

157
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.000
what are you actually trying to figure out how to put on the way it isn't,

158
00:09:37.001 --> 00:09:41.910
but he's, uh, I lost my fell off. She could repeat that. Oh,

159
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.930
okay. We should do Jess. Is the headphones back on yet? Hang on. I'll do it.

160
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.640
That's my job by the way. Is He, is he able to put on, I mean is this,

161
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.750
you can tell me what's going on,

162
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:56.540
but is he able to grab the headphones so he can grab the headphones and put them

163
00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:00.360
on? But because I'm putting the headphones over the top of my head,

164
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:05.280
I can't see exactly where the headphones are in relation to the rest of me. Um,

165
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.700
although I would finally get this a lot quicker if Jonathan just puts them on

166
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.080
and uh, he likes to feel,

167
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.680
what I was asking was what were you doing with the paperclips?

168
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.690
All that time I was giving paper clips as a, as an exercise to, to,

169
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.070
to get my fingers to move again and to, to,

170
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.580
to threaten them together and then try and clip them. A very,

171
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.840
very frustrating therapy. But one has to admit that it is,

172
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:28.830
it is a good one.

173
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:33.831
And so an awful lot of find extras movement to get paperclips together and,

174
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.513
and apart again.

175
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.270
But the idea of breaking down every move you make into sub moves and sub sub

176
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:45.030
moves and then relearning everything. It's exhausting. Very,

177
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.620
very mentally tiring cause it takes such total concentration.

178
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.690
What if you were walking down the street and suddenly a thought like a daydream

179
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.110
potter? John Jonathan has a very good memory of that and maybe, uh,

180
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.580
that would be good to come from [inaudible] Ian and I were walking through

181
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.581
Oxford having done some groundbreaking experiments or whatever and he had

182
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:14.790
suddenly stumbled and I'd never seen him stumble ever before.

183
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.680
And he was looking at a pretty girl.

184
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.020
These thoughts had drifted from walking and from the concrete ahead of him to

185
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.310
what he'd liked to do to this girl while she, she was a about 18,

186
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.840
she had not brown hair,

187
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.700
lovely legs and miniskirt and it was a navy blue dress with white polka dots as

188
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:37.470
a family program, but walks anyway,

189
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.550
he has to think about walking the floor merely the around the erotic sort of

190
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.580
charge cost you your ability to be that sort of charged but any distraction

191
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.190
really. Um, took me away from my focus,

192
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.010
which is where is my left foot in relation to my rights for tomorrow and my

193
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.340
balance at the moment and how am I actually going through this process?

194
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.510
At what stage am I in this movement and to suddenly be distracted by that by a

195
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:05.770
wast of perfume minute pretty girl took all that concentration away.

196
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.240
It can be taken away by the song of a bird or all the sound of music drifting

197
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:14.830
from somewhere. Just on that day, it was a pretty girl

198
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.920
<v 1>today. If you saw Ian on the street,</v>

199
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:20.320
you wouldn't be able to tell that he has this handicap.

200
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:24.910
He has figured out how to live a very deliberate and in a way kind of a normal

201
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.690
life. He drives a car, he works, he drives that car.

202
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.900
<v 4>Yeah. My, my latest car, which is a very nice Mercedes. Um,</v>

203
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.210
I do drive the same speed as everybody else and all the rest. Oh, Costa, you,

204
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.500
I can react as quickly as anybody else.

205
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.870
It's an automatic car and it has hand controls.

206
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.660
It's the only favor to my disability really. But, um,

207
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:50.030
I tend to do with my drive and what I do within the way that I managed my life,

208
00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:51.650
which is I plan ahead.

209
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.590
<v 1>I'm just wondering about my, my, my last question really for free,</v>

210
00:12:56.591 --> 00:13:01.340
and I guess this is a, have you solved this problem as best you can? I mean,

211
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.400
do you feel like you're one person or do you feel,

212
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.970
uh, cut in half like a mind directing a body? Like, like maybe two people?

213
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.200
<v 7>Oh, I don't think about it in the way that you've just, just related that,</v>

214
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.630
um, I just think about, I want to get up,

215
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:23.030
I want a cup of tea and this is the process I have to apply to do that. Yeah.

216
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.620
That's what, that's what we all do.

217
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:28.860
I didn't see stories like this involve heroes.

218
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.980
They involve people who try their best under certain circumstances and then

219
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.330
tested it a way that many of us had not we could look for that

220
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.500
<v 4>you'll tell to hand and you play it as you.</v>

221
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.293
<v 1>This Chiu Chan</v>

222
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.170
<v 5>[inaudible] stop off.</v>

223
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.800
<v 1>Thanks to Ian Waterman and to neurologist Jonathan Cole.</v>

224
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.540
Dr. Cole wrote a very nice,

225
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:04.990
lovely book about Ian called pride and a daily marathon.

226
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.710
He spoke to us together from the BBC studios in Southampton.

227
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.300
<v 5>It was from those from,</v>

228
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.850
<v 1>Gosh, I really should read the book. Human man. Look up. Look at the chair,</v>

229
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:17.050
the chair. Be Fun. Lunch.

230
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.280
Cultish room doesn't get it. That's it. It's a dog.
