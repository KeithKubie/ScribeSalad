1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello fuckers. What's
cracking? Wait for an answer.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,470
Um, this episode of the podcast
brought to you by new sponsor,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,590
draftkings.com while we
were in Denver last week,

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,620
I got schooled on the wonders of
what's the best way to describe this,

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,801
this,

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,801
this new activity that a lot of you
folks are engaging in called fantasy

7
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:25,501
football.

8
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:30,501
It's basically the premise of our friend
Steve run is easy show the league and

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,320
the Genre de joure dungeons
and dragons for jocks. Yes,

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,830
dungeons and dragons for people
who are really into sports.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,020
And it's a Jamie's a fanatic and it was
sad seeing him scrambled to try to make

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:47,220
his picks. Uh, but I
know people are into it.

13
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:52,140
And a football season is just around the
corner and you can get your piece of $5

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,140
million during kickoff week@draftkings.com
America's favorite one week fantasy

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,210
football site. Now, I don't know
much about fantasy football,

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,390
but I'm going to have to learn about it
now because Jamie completely perplexed

17
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,830
me this past week.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,430
Greg Fitzsimmons is here and he wrote
a doors logo like we're in high school.

19
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,570
And he wrote about his fucking,

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,440
remember we used to do those van
Halen things with the the wings.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,930
Everybody has to do
rolling stones. Lips. Yes.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,200
Everybody said to them in their notebooks.
Anyway,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,250
draft kings for fantasy football folks.
Uh,

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,680

and doing research for your season long

25
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,430

actually win cash the first week of the

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,830
season@draftkings.com last year,

27
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:36,510
one player turned 11 bucks into 4,000
bucks in one week. I heard about that.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,800
Another player won $1 million in one day.
Just playing fantasy football.

29
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,030
How the fuck did a guy when $1 million
in a day playing fantasy football?

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,630
Is that real? They must, it must be
real. It's on the ad. That's incredible.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,540
Because he picked Shaquille
O'Neal. It's rookie year. Well,

32
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:55,730
fantasy football is exciting. Can
you do that? He's already, he's,

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,920
you have to pick people that are
not, they're playing right now. Oh,

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,890
you don't even know how it goes.
Don't you know she killed near retired.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,160
Shut your mouth. It doesn't. He
play basketball. He's retired.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,650

49
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,370

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,220
man. Oh Man. Don't buddy smoke
a little right at doors. Logo.

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,940
Settle in. Greg wrote up for
folks who are just tuning in now,

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,970
Greg wrote a doors logo on his notebook
like as if we were in high school when

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,450
we all used to do that in high school.
Everybody. I used to do the kiss logos,

54
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,790
but kiss, fan kiss,

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,640
the ss were like triangles on
top, right know. Yeah. It's like,

56
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,500
well the DAS is go like a
z sort of. Yeah. Like, Hey,

57
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,690
um, did do bands do that anymore?
Do they still have logos? Yeah,

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,450
but did they have logos? The kids like
draw on their notebooks or anything.

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,570
And I n give a nine
inch nails is not today.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,550
And I need snails from the nineties bands
of today. Like they were really stung.

61
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,551
Could do led Zepplin member has like a
million little scribbles and kids got

62
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,960
props. So we're really
good at that. Right?

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,610
Like a kid could do a solid doors
logo from scratch. Like wow. Well My,

64
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,050
uh,
one of my best friends,

65
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:10,051
we used to sit in the back row baked
in eighth grade and he would draw on a

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,470
desks, you know, shit like
the doors, logos and all that.
And I was the class clown.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,030
And now like all these years later, he's
one of the top record, uh, designers.

68
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,330
In the contrary, he works for Jimmy
Hendricks is a state for awhile.

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,111
Doing all those,

70
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:27,040
like that rereleases that they did and
he did all those album covers that my

71
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,060
uncle used to do that my uncle used
to work for Howard marks advertising,

72
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,750
which was the company that used to
produce kiss album covers and that was a

73
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,250
little kid.
I'm at ace freely.

74
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,930
He's really came to the office and he
had no makeup on, which was just insane.

75
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,440
It was like I was seeing the Easter
bunny without his fucking clothes on.

76
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,790
I was like,
what the fuck?

77
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,520
I couldn't even believe he was really
there and the fact that he didn't have

78
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,480
makeup on,
it was like,

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,470
it was almost like a life changing event
for like a 10 year old or whatever the

80
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,520
fuck I was. Cause it was just, I can't,
couldn't believe he, this was eight,

81
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:00,250
really didn't have his makeup on housing.
How's he just walking around?

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,650
And then I realized what
a brilliant move that was.

83
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,760
They were famous but nobody knew
what they looked like. Genius.

84
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,330
Oh it's the greatest movie of
all times. Yeah. Like look,

85
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:13,780
the insane clown posse has the same thing.
The insane clown posse.

86
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,510
It could be at the fucking seven 11,
right next to you buying cigarettes.

87
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,150
You would have no idea.
You don't know what they look like.

88
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,580
Is that what they look? No, that's
ace freely. That's ace freely today.

89
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,730
Or a voice over guys like they get
mad groaning and the guys that do the

90
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:28,140
Simpsons voices, they're making more
than anybody and they're got all,

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,860
they can sit in it in a restaurant without
getting annoyed. Yeah, that's so true.

92
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,540
Well, Matt stone and Trey Parker became
famous. Like they, they became famous,

93
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,510
they did their own movie and then they've
done so many interviews and they've

94
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:45,220
done like, they took acid and went to
the Oscars. Remember that? Dresses,

95
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,270
no shit.
There were women's dresses were on acid.

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,730
That's amazing. They're the greatest.
They're so important for the culture.

97
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,070
Guys like that are so important. Guys
that can make those kinds of shows there.

98
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,370
So

99
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,880
did you see, uh, the book of
Mormon? Yes. Dude loved it.

100
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,180
That opening song,
I started laughing so fucking hard.

101
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:11,181
And then I looked around the theater and
people come in and they know it's Matt

102
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,270
stone and Trey Parker. So they're like,
all right, this is going to be shocking.

103
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,830
Right. But then when they start singing,
fuck God and the mouth, ass and cons,

104
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,520
and I'm laughing and I see the people
are pulling back half the half,

105
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,000
the audience can't handle it.
That makes me laugh twice as hard and I,

106
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:30,650
and if they're like far into the whole
next scene and I'm still doubled over.

107
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,710
Oh God,
that was fucking brilliant.

108
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,260
Yeah. While you're in the dress, it's
just such a magical evening and everyone,

109
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,450
it's just everyone looked so spectacular.
You know,

110
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,470
we're just wanting to be a
part of [inaudible] magic.

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,820
[inaudible]

112
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,920
magic. Oh, that's great

113
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,390
dude.

114
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,440
When they did that fucking South Park
movie and Satan and Saddam Hussein were in

115
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:02,520
bed together and you see Satan stick and
they're allowed to shows deck because

116
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,270
it's fake. It's cause it's rubber, you
know, so they have like this rubber Dick,

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,780
but it's was the movie.
It's so ridiculous.

118
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,090
It was so ridiculous. You're like,
how are they getting away with this?

119
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,610
They push so hard to like,

120
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,310
one of the reasons why they get away
with putting all their shit in the movies

121
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,880
is they put a bunch of stuff in the movies
that are so fucked up that they have

122
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:24,870
some bargaining tools.

123
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,720
Like they'll cut out some of this other
stuff that they weren't planning on

124
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:29,850
putting in there anyway.
Yeah, like the uh,

125
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,510
have you ever seen the full sex scene
between the two puppets and team America?

126
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,010
Now they shit on each other. They
piss on each other. I mean it's crazy.

127
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:42,450
He drops a log on her chest.
It's so take that out.

128
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,290
Yeah. So the scene is insane
already. It's all right.

129
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:51,291
I remember the scenes and same was way
over the top in real life or the original

130
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,380
version. But they probably, they do,
I know they do that shit on purpose.

131
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,340
Like we used to do that.

132
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,400
Like Paul seems to just do
that on news radio on purpose.

133
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,530
Like they would say penis. Like there
was a, an episode where bill was a bill.

134
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:07,800
Mcneil was Phil Hartman's character,
how to say penis on the air.

135
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,390
And he said penis like a hundred
times, you know, and they, we,

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,190
they put in like all these extra penises
so they could trim it down. Right.

137
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,390
And that episode like didn't
air until the third season.

138
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,500
They pulled that episode. Yeah. Like
it's too controversial. All right.

139
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,910
And then they aired it like in the third,
third or fourth season.

140
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,741
Did it seem weird?

141
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:27,680
Like did you even want to like look
different like out of nowhere one week

142
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:31,000
somebody had like purple hair instead
or shorter hair or you know what I mean?

143
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,750
Do you mean cause it
was a different season?

144
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,970
No, no, no. Well, yeah, I would
definitely look different.
Like, you know, three years,

145
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:41,110
people's faces change a little, just
a slight amount. You know, it was,

146
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,490
I went to the,
um,

147
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,020
the Phil Hartman had a star of fame
put on the Hollywood walk of fame.

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,470
He had a star and I went there and there
were some people that I hadn't seen in

149
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:54,940
16, 17 years. Like a lot of the writers
and a lot of people that worked on staff.

150
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,040
It was weird.

151
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,470
It's like, wow, we're all getting
fucking old. This is strange. Yeah,

152
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,480
laughing about it.
But it is strange to see the weathering.

153
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:08,340
Like my friend Lou, who I picture
is this like boy faced young kids,

154
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:12,600
hilarious writer, Lou Morton.
He had gray hair. It's like wow,

155
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,330
I'm finally getting around now.
We just got together,

156
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,990
me and a few college friends and I hadn't
seen them in years and I looked around

157
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,790
and you start to think,
wow,

158
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,110
I must not look as good as I think because
they look fucking terrible. I never,

159
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,050
my peers, you know,
one guy is bad as shit.

160
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,360
So if you get fat enough,

161
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:34,500
there is a key to aging where if you
can put enough fat into your face,

162
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,520
it's like botox and you don't wrinkle
and you kind of have that youthful glow

163
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,470
cause you're just filled with oil.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,740
We know William Schachner
allegedly does that on purpose.

165
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,680
I can see in Schachner says
I put on five pounds a year

166
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,600
and five pounds a year,
keeps his face around.

167
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,910
And I give it I just for men and
I keep it fat. Is that a move?

168
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah. No, you're just coming up
with an excuse for TPN fat, Bro.

169
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,840
That's not true.
Dr Pepper 10 and just say that man,

170
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:06,630
because William Shatner actually
plans it so you can't claim it.

171
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,230
That is an amazing [inaudible] used
to do when I wanted to get out of

172
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,390
relationships, it's pretty
much the same thing. I just,

173
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,700
you just fatten up fat them out.
Did you ever hit,

174
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:18,120
remember that Kinison bit about
getting out of relationships now. Oh,

175
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:20,880
you're the best bet. Who's
like, you know not. He's like,

176
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:24,360
I don't ever break up with him. He goes,
I get them to break up with me. That fee,

177
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,930
that way they feel bad
that they left me when I,

178
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,820
when I needed them most it's flawless.

179
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,980
Like he did this thing where he says,
I just stay up for weeks and do coke and,

180
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,380
and then when they go, Sam, I just,

181
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,250
you're just not the guy that you
were when I met you and I'm sorry,

182
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,240
but I have to go

183
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,940
and Sheila, that's flawless. Chill.

184
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,060
I best part about it.

185
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:51,540
She feels bad because she left
you one year later at my house

186
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,630
and you got to go out and
do coke for three weeks.

187
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,800
Have you ever heard Marin till
the Kinison stories? Oh yeah.

188
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,020
When he got pissed off
he pissed on his bed.

189
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,650
Well just how crazy they were with coke.
Yeah.

190
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,890
Man was on our podcast and he said that
he heard voices in his head for almost a

191
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,010
year. Who Kinison did no
Marin. Oh, from trauma.

192
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,720
So much coke. Yeah, they did so
much coke. He was hearing voices.

193
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,590
Wow Dude. For like a year. Yeah.

194
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,100
He said that Kennison would just red
line it all day and he was just gone for

195
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,590
[inaudible]. It was like, like
what? What stops did he make in,

196
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,800
cause he was like on the sunset strip
going to like record store diner bar,

197
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:41,910
strip club. Like in one day he would make
more stops than you would in a month.

198
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,170
Yeah. Just ripped out of his mind.
Sleeping three hours a night sometimes.

199
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,650
Didn't sleep for days apparently.
Yeah, he was an animal. He was,

200
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,710
the funniest thing about him was that
he was a reverend for people who are,

201
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,130
if you,

202
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,150
if you never heard Kinison gold
go download louder than hell.

203
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,720
It was so offensive that Warner
Bros never released it as a CD.

204
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,850
I was like one of the
greatest comedy albums ever,

205
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,010
but it's only on cassette
because Warner brothers,

206
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,080
so much homophobic stuff on there.

207
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,090
So much stuff that was so
offensive to gay people, you know.

208
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,680
And uh, so that was, that was never
released. It was never released as a CD.

209
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,120
I used to have it as a cassette,

210
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,980
but people have put it up now
you can get it to like in a fine.

211
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,080
Did it through Torrance is now on
iTunes or anything like that? Um,

212
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,130
I don't think it's on Itunes, man.
It might be to see if it is no,

213
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:34,440
no louder than hell. Loud as hell. Louder
than how I think it's louder than how,

214
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:34,990
uh,

215
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,880
it's his first a CD and then some of the
material is similar to what was on his

216
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,340
first atrial special. Like there's some
crossover with some of the material,

217
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:47,140
but it's his best stuff. Those two, the
his HBO special and Louder Than Hell.

218
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,750
Those are the GPS specialists
from Montreal, right? No,

219
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,650
it was from the Roxy right up
the street from the comedy store.

220
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,700
He did it at that theater on sunset.
It's just perfect because it's on there.

221
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,470
Is it? It's on there. I'll
be, yeah, that's it man.
That right there. My opinion,

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
best comedy CD ever.
That's my number one.

223
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,760
Somebody had to say to me what was the
most influential comedy CD? That's it.

224
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
I think he was the best ever for a year
having for one year plus two years,

225
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,270
whatever it was when he was just a
maniac. Right. But you just can't,

226
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,080
you can't keep that going because it's
so awful because he was on the crest of

227
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:26,920
the wave. The wave, a wave
has depth. There's like,

228
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,610
there's a lot of failure and a lot of
frustration underneath the ocean and it

229
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:35,320
builds and till it swells and in that
fucking wave pops out and that's where he

230
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,210
was on the crest of that
wave and he wrote it.

231
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,310
And he got to shore
and just fucking crash.

232
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,850
He was a superstar.

233
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,910
All the sudden it's at an Eto for
that was pretty God damn good.

234
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,260
Similar to hunter s Thompson's metaphor
about what happened in the 70s.

235
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:55,150
You ever heard that thing?
It's done to like, it's great.
It was in, um, the movie,

236
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,280
uh, the um, the Johnny Depp
movie. Oh yeah. Um, uh,

237
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,210
fear and loathing in Las Vegas.
Where played him.

238
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,420
Johnny Depp did an awesome job of a pull
down up, see if we could find it. Um,

239
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,350
the, uh, Wav speech from fear
and loathing and Michael Steal.

240
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,550
Did I just steal that? No, no.
You've probably never heard it. Now,

241
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,140
did you ever read fear and loathing now?
Oh,

242
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,730
so Johnny Depp was at the comedy store
the other day watching duct Stan hope

243
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,450
that's their buddies. That's
another thing though, that,

244
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,550
that he's another one.

245
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,120
Hunter s Thompson was another one
of my all time favorites. Yeah.

246
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,530
He's another one that just burnt it out,
man.

247
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,980
This used to read them in Rolling Stone
magazine or you'd read or read his books.

248
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,500
The first one I read
was a fear and loathing.

249
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,383
It's not on

250
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,060
this strange memories on this
nervous night in Las Vegas.

251
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,230
Has it been five years,
six,

252
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,110
it seems like a lifetime.

253
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,160
The kind of peak never comes again.

254
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,530
See servers just go in the
middle sixties this is it, right?

255
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:06,080
There was a very special time
and place to be a part of,

256
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,140
but no explanation,

257
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,180
no mixer words or music or memories can
touch that sense of knowing that you

258
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,690
were there and alive and not
corner of time in the world,

259
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,813
whatever it meant.

260
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,430
I always madness in any direction.

261
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,630
At any hour you could
strike sparks anywhere.

262
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,410
There was a fantastic universal sense.

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,620
Whatever we were doing was
right that we were winning

264
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,010
and that I think was the handle.

265
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,230
That sense of inevitable victory
over the forces of old and evil,

266
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,520
not in any mean or military sense.
We didn't need that.

267
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,730
Our energy would simply prevail.
We had all the momentum.

268
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,440
We were riding the crest of
a high and beautiful way.

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,080
So now,
less than five years later,

270
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,040
you can go up on a steep hill
in Las Vegas and look West.

271
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,560
And with the right kind of eyes,
you can almost see the high water mark.

272
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,380
That place where the wave
finally broke and rolled back.

273
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,560
Johnny Depp's a bad motherfucker.
He has a bad mother fucker.

274
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:41,090
He's a bad motherfucker. Got To get back
this deck off. Yeah, but that was he,

275
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:41,751
that guy,

276
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,340
hunters Thompson was real similar to me
to Kennison cause he just burnt it out.

277
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,540
It was all coke was just
coke and booze and just wow.

278
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:55,070
And then he wrote a couple of great books
and then there was just nothing left.

279
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,260
And then towards the end,
I mean he was,

280
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,250
if you've ever seen a hunters
Thompson on Letterman, it's sad. Yeah,

281
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,400
because you can't,
you literally can't understand him.

282
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,490
We can't understand the words that are
coming out of his mouth. Like he's,

283
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,850
you think he just fried his brain or
it could ride it, cooked it, barbecue,

284
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,310
sauteed it, minced it up, ran it through
a fucking grind or fried it again.

285
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,750
And it wasn't just coke, he
was every hill, everything,
everything. A lot of acid,

286
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,790
everything he gives hands on who's a
mania. Yeah. There's a video or a, um,

287
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,210
an article rather where a reporter
followed him around and monitored his drug

288
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:33,920
usage for the day. It's insane.
Yeah. It's insane. I mean it's, it's,

289
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,840
I don't know if this is a typical day,

290
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,070
but this was this one day and I bet it
was a typical day cause he always talked

291
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:42,440
about it.
I guess your system just gets used to it.

292
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,810
You can see him doing this hand.
Things like where he's going.

293
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:47,220
Like Thompson used to do that.
When you write somebody,

294
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,050
a friend of ours that does all the
time and I would that, well, you know,

295
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:55,170
it's sort of like, uh, uh, it's visceral.

296
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,400
He may have some kind of
learning disorder. Drinking.
Yeah. King. He's thinking,

297
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:04,080
he's like, right. That's all it is. All
right. Here's, here's his daily routine.

298
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:08,880
3:00 PM rise thrill.

the edge off the day. 7:00 PM day,

306
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:43,680
three hours into it.
Three hours in lit.

307
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,770

310
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,980
done hills, another Heineken cocaine.
And for the rest of the ride home,

311
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,280
a snow cone,
a glass of shredded ice,

312
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,290
which is poured over four jiggers of
Chivas. Okay, so the snow cone is Chivas.

313
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,070
Okay, 9:00 PM start
snorting cocaine. Seriously,

314
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,770
10:00 PM dropped acid,

315
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,320
11:00 PM chartreuse. I don't know
what that is. Cocaine and grass.

316
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,080
1130 cocaine,
etc. Etc.

317
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,040
12 midnight hunters Thompson
is ready to write. Wow.

318
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,580
That's when he sits down to write
1205 to 6:00 AM he writes chartreuse,

319
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:36,630
cocaine, grass, Shivaas coffee, Heineken,
closed cigarettes, grapefruit done hills,

320
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:40,050
orange juice, gin, continuous
pornographic movies.

321
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,840
6:00 AM in the hot tub with champagne,
dove bars,

322
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,890
fettuccine Alfredo,
8:00 AM Halcion,

323
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,680
which is sleeping pill,
not eight 20 sleep,

324
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,690
so he would take a sleeping pill at
eight 20 in the morning after a riding it

325
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:02,670
hard wood I love is that most people,
it's about if I get this work done,

326
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,500
then I can have a drink. Nope.
Inhibits the opposite. Yeah. He got x,

327
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,790
Y. Yeah. He got wild to the core
where there was nothing left,

328
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:16,791
but just savage chemicals flowing through
the brilliant core of his mind and

329
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,280
then he just sat in front of that
typewriter and let it rip for six hours.

330
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,100
Focused it to that. Yeah. Wow.

331
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,570
I love it. Ah, that's what you
can't, you can't do that for long.

332
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,580
If it doesn't last, and in
the end it's ugly. Pull up.

333
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:33,990
Pull up a hunter Thompson
on David Letterman.

334
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,820
It's kind of like life is about finding
that line where you are pushing yourself

335
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,030
and you are finding your edge but
you're not burning yourself out.

336
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,290
This is way more than an edge. I
mean this is, it's a suicidal thing.

337
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,500
And with hunter also had it in his head
that when the time would come he would

338
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,050
take his own life. Yeah.
He just, he was like,

339
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:57,790
just this getting old shit is nice to
pressure off. Yeah. He was convinced.

340
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,180
I mean he had told everyone around
him that uh, when it gets too much,

341
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,080
I'm just going to end this.

342
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:05,860
Like I'm not gonna I'm not going to
slowly drift away when I know there's no

343
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:09,190
hope in sight. Yeah. And for him,
like they would do operations on them.

344
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,380
Like did a hip operation, like you
gotta stop drinking. He's like,

345
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:16,060
get the fuck Outta here. Boom. Hits it
that night. Like right away. What is this?

346
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,613
Oh here we go.

347
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,930
I don't know if this is the right
one cause he's on and been on a lot.

348
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,420
This is from 2012.
Oh that's perfect.

349
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,000
2012 is perfect because that's the end.

350
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,950
I don't even think he was alive in
2012 now when did he kill himself?

351
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,350
We got done with this a lot
longer than two years ago.

352
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,120
I made this, this myth uploaded
into 2000 uploaded. Uploaded,

353
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,770
uploaded. It's pretty recent though.
No, no, no, no. I mean not that reason.

354
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, fairly right. It's not, it's not
old Letterman with a full head of hair.

355
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,703
Right?
Yeah.

356
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,950
By all means.
Make yourself at home.

357
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,160
Yeah.
He died in 2005.

358
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,560
Move this away from, you know, it's
been a long time since I've seen you.

359
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,540
Help me refresh my memory. Doctor, your
doctor is what, what if, what area,

360
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:08,560
what discipline are you a doctor in
of [inaudible] that last time it was

361
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,290
divinity. Oh yeah. Put
the Ruby [inaudible]

362
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,980
and uh,

363
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:17,630
journalism. Where did you go to, to study?
Yeah. Where did you get your divinity? Uh,

364
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,320
where? Where, where the [inaudible] story.
Really? Yeah. Where did you go to Yale?

365
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,070
Where you as a seminary and ideas? I go
to the yield. It would've been spooled.

366
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,010
Where did you go, hunter? How going to
discuss the he you'd rather move on? Yeah.

367
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,840
Okay. You went to state? I went
to ball state. Not all states.

368
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,440
Sorry. The ball state. Uh,
I been all right. Yeah.

369
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,470
You're 60 years old now. Is that, is
that right? Yeah. That seems weird.

370
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:44,830
I bet you were doing,
you know,

371
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,380
ah,

372
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,460
really, uh, it had been so
long. Yeah. Does this mean
anything to you? Turn in 60?

373
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,303
Is it?

374
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,100
Oh No. That'll let that Nigga, yeah.

375
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,490
The guys will say have gone
to some dark sense of humor.

376
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,840
Do you have any real in this world?

377
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,430
This is actually way better
than the one I was thinking of.

378
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,790
The one I was thinking of now that
I remembered is actually in Conan.

379
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,160
He was on Conan. Conan went shooting
with them. Right. They went out to his,

380
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,270
uh,
woody creek.

381
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,600
He has this place in woody creek with a
lot of land and they would just set up

382
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,110
things and just fucking blown away
with guns and he had Conan out there.

383
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm blown out guns with them and I swear
he could barely understand them. Yeah.

384
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,550
It was just heck good line though.
I thought you were dead till. Yeah.

385
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,940
Shark let him, he didn't expect
that up or at evercat. Yeah, he's,

386
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,610
he was a funny dude. You say, well that's
not going to happen. I said, all right,

387
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,640
let's do it. We brought a camera
crew. Here's what happened.

388
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,040
I think they're ready over on
the firing range. Should we

389
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,160
head over that way?
Yeah.

390
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,130
And the idea is you're going to instruct
me and how to blow things to hell.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,790
Well, no, we're going to
do art. Art, what kind of

392
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,580
glue boards.

393
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
That's good.

394
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,280
Loose with the club.
Yeah.

395
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,670
Loosen us up the drinking
booze and shooting things.

396
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,940
So that was pretty good. Those his
character on doing right? Yeah.

397
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,730
They used to make fun of them on
Doonesbury. Well that's a good example.

398
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:37,910
I guess it's better as it gets
on and he gets more drunk.

399
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,340
I guess that's probably why.
Couldn't understand them.

400
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:43,760
But if you go from that
to what he sounded like,

401
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,090
how articulate he was when he was younger,
how clear it was to understand,

402
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,200
you know, like from the, uh,

403
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,530
the documentary Gonzo life and
times of hunter s Thompson.

404
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,410
There's some interviews with him when
he was in black and white and you know,

405
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,420
you got to see what he
was like as a young man.

406
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,290
Think there's some serious deterioration.
By the time he got to 60. Yeah.

407
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,210
Any perspective.
Sylvester Stallone is 67 or 68.

408
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,010
And he shredded, you know, talks great.
Still do an action movies, you know,

409
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,390
that just shows you the impact
that hunter put on his body. Yeah.

410
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
60 whatever it was there.
62

411
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,150
well and that he lived. So he
actually has a strong, you know, he,

412
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,570
he could handle that shit.

413
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:29,520
Most people would've died of liver
disease or killed themselves before.

414
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,320
Well, sixties don't tend to hold them
out. I mean, he would, he was 62,

415
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:36,420
62 when he died that
even think about this,

416
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,060
40 something years of pounding
substances in your body now.

417
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,220
Probably not exercising
ever. No, no eating,

418
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,110
eating fucking dove bars and a hot tub.
Fuck man.

419
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:52,650
Fettuccine Alfredo at eight o'clock
in the morning. He was in the animal.

420
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,460
Would you do that if you knew you could
come back and you wouldn't be addicted

421
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:04,440
and you wouldn't be dead, would you
take that lifestyle on for one month?

422
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,140
No, I wouldn't want them to
feel like that. Yeah. I see.

423
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,240
I'm not a speed guy at all.
I don't like, I like coffee.

424
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,830
It's good for conversation. Yeah. But
I have no desire to try the speeds.

425
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,000
No, I just mean more in terms of
completely being obliterated. Yeah, just

426
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,980
I, I couldn't do it. Yeah. I
couldn't do it because I would know.

427
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,490
I know too much about what it's doing to
my body. Like I could do it for a night,

428
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,200
for a night. I could go on a bender.
Do you do that? I have, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,790
I've definitely had some nights where
I got just destroyed. But again,

430
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:41,310
there's no code.
There's no coke involved and you know,

431
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,830
it was mostly Jack Daniels
or something that just

432
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,800
a few too many shots getting crazy,
smoking too much weed.

433
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,480
But the big difference between that and
what he was doing was he was doing it

434
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,700
all day. I mean, if I
would do it, it'd be like,

435
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:55,830
can you start at 10 by one
o'clock in the morning,

436
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,710
you're basically done and then you'll
just try to find somewhere to eat and

437
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,820
sober up. But this guy was
gunning it all day like that,

438
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:07,410
writing books and he went three hours
before he put solid food in his body.

439
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And just
drinking and doing coke,

440
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,210
smoking done hills.
I mean I have too much.

441
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,250
I have too much carbs in the afternoon.

442
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:22,251
I need to nap at four o'clock I think
partly like I quit drinking a long time

443
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:27,090
ago. Part of it was like, I just didn't
want to deal with the hangover energy.

444
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,750
Awful. It's one of the worst
feelings. Still waste a time.

445
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,950
You just feel like such a fucking idiot.
Like I just sacrificed several days.

446
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,060
It's almost like,

447
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,630
like say if you had a job that really
sucked and you worked for like a week,

448
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:43,200
saved up all your money and then you went
to the casino and you blew it in five

449
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,400
seconds, like you fucking
idiot all the time you wasted.

450
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,850
It seems almost similar when you're
hung over because it's like, Whoa,

451
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:52,440
what did I have fun for an hour.

452
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,180
And then the last two hours were a fog
and then I threw up and then I went to

453
00:27:57,181 --> 00:28:00,000
sleep and then I woke up and I
feel like death for two days.

454
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,580
What that can be worth it.
Well,

455
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:06,240
I can remember being young enough where
I'd hook up with a one night stand,

456
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:11,040
shit faced, get it done. Never had a
problem getting it done. Always closed.

457
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,650
So for you, go for you. And
then waking up in the morning,

458
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,130
still drunk and then
going for the morning sex.

459
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,700
I feel good about it because then after
that there was no hangover after the

460
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:25,620
morning sex. It's just like a light
buzz, but that's it. You know 21 yeah,

461
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,430
2021 you were a different thing.
You're a battery for a full battery,

462
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:32,340
just church plus your free.

463
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,620
You can't believe no one's
telling you what to do.

464
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,780
You can't believe for the
first time in your life.

465
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,940
No one is telling you when
you have to go to bed,

466
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,080
when you have to be home like you're a
man, you're a free man for the first time.

467
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,150
Those years are a buck wild. Those years
from whenever you get out of the house,

468
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,400
whenever you're paying your own bills,
whenever you have a g like you,

469
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:56,360
like I guess I'm an adult now, I
have a job and an apartment. Whoa.

470
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,230
Yeah,
and you're deciding when you go to bed.

471
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,100
He had a way you feel like an adult and
in a way you feel like a little child

472
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:06,240
because that little child gets to play
and explore the night like you know,

473
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,950
all of a sudden at four 30 in the morning,

474
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,010
you're not like now if I'm up at
four 30 in the morning, I'm like,

475
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:15,480
how the fuck do I get to bed as soon as
possible. Then you're like, what else?

476
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,500
What else can we stumble on?
Is there a door I can knock on?

477
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,120
Is there possibly a booty call I can
make right now? Yeah. Who's got coke?

478
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,810
How do you keep this thing rolling?
And then just like you,

479
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:31,230
your mortgaged your house and
then on top of the mortgage,

480
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,390
like when the coke comes into the picture,

481
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,450
it's like now you just taking out
loans from, from shylocks now.

482
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,670
Now you're going to fucking to the worst
loan sharks and be like, listen, listen,

483
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,010
listen. One Week I'll pay you
back on paying it all back.

484
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,930
That's how you feel when you do the coke.

485
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,650
The coke is the one that I docked
docked at my whole life. I love it.

486
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,240
Love it too much.
Just start talking so much.

487
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,480
You do 20 podcasts at the
same time. That's what my
friend Jimmy Law was told me.

488
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:00,420
Like when we were in high school,
they were,

489
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,380
they were all doing it at this party
and uh, Jimmy goes, don't do it.

490
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,200
You'd like it too much. And I go, okay,
that's all I need to hear. Anytime.

491
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,410
A guy who likes to do coke
tells you not to do coke.

492
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,220
And he didn't like to do coke, but uh,
he had a cousin that liked to do coke.

493
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,520
It's just I saw too many kids
but any kids that were just,

494
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,290
they would just be engrossed in it. It's
all they wanted. And I saw kids, you know,

495
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,890
we did all the drugs but coke
was too expensive. So we did it.

496
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,290
But it was kind of a luxury item.

497
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,440
We were more like a lot of my friends
were doing angel dust cause that was cheap

498
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,240
and a lot of masculine. Do you ever take
masculine? Never took it. It's kind of a,

499
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,830
it's I think it's a form of acid, right?
No masculine is a foreign pod. Oh it is?

500
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:45,760
Yeah. Yeah. It's very like colorful. You
see a lot of colors and you laugh a lot.

501
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,860
Yeah. Um, that's a, that's
shit I never got ahold of.

502
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,310
I never got to hold those all,

503
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:55,180
like when that was going around like
mask that was all going around like post

504
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:58,750
high school, like just after high school
when I was in my super healthy phase.

505
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,010
Yeah. All throughout, like from
high school to like, you know,

506
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,020
21, 22. There was very little drinking,
very little partying, very, very little.

507
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,560
The occasional joint would come
out if I had a couple of beers,

508
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:14,560
but it was so rare and that
was felt guilty after I did it.

509
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,770
That was those the healthy days I was
selling masculine for a little while.

510
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:19,300
This guy,
this Guy Andre,

511
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:24,301
the blackest blacker than your cough
and tough and he was like in and out of

512
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,290
Juvie homes.
And so he got me to sell it to my friends.

513
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,770
So I would have a bad cause like a lot
of my friends were into the grateful dead

514
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,220
and we go to a dead shell and I would
just sell like a hundred hits a masculine.

515
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,680
And so, uh, so then one day,

516
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,490
I guess I didn't even owe him money.
Like he,

517
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,440
he would give me a bag and then I pay him
after I sold it and time wasn't really

518
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:47,920
up yet.

519
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,760
But I came home one afternoon and I opened
the front door to my house and I walk

520
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:56,740
in and we lived in a pretty nice house
and my mom is sitting with Andre and the

521
00:31:56,741 --> 00:32:00,700
living room having tea and
she never met him. She just,

522
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:04,000
he just showed up looking
for me and I was like,

523
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,640
oh what the fuck does
uncomfortable that ended my,

524
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,140
my drug dealing days ended
her right there. Yeah.

525
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,180
You don't want Andrea
embedded in your life.

526
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,650
Imagine if you count a hunter was
banging your mom cause he would do that.

527
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:21,730
I know Andre and she's on mask. I
know Andre. Andre would do it. Yeah.

528
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:26,160
He lit up her drink. He had tea
with her, dropped a tablet or tea.

529
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Right now the doors are playing two
riders on the storm and you open the door

530
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:36,290
and he just fucking hammering your
arm from behind. Father. Yes son,

531
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,020
I want to kill you.

532
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,370
And to this out in a bone.
Tanto Tanto

533
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,140
Oh, and you're like, why?

534
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,860
And I walk in and he turns his head
and sees me and he gives me a look that

535
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:55,040
makes me have to fucking leave the room.
Eat mid stroke.

536
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,720
Doesn't even stop banging my mom. Wow.
Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to see this.

537
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,260
I don't want to see that shit. And
I'm on mask. Jedi mind trick too.

538
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,090
These are not the droids
you're looking for

539
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,910
Andre. Work in every angle. Think of
someone like that. Bang in your mom.

540
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,830
Oh, that's dark. Yeah, that would be
brutal. That's the door seeing his ass.

541
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,340
You know that prison ass.
You don't know what it's been through.

542
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,000
It's probably got stride and
muscle tissue all throughout a two.

543
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,170
It looks terrifying,
right?

544
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,220
Do you think about the moment force he
could generate without ass? Oh my God.

545
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,370
Yeah. Strong thighs because he's
walking around selling drugs.

546
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:35,240
He's out on the street.

547
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,590
It's not a constant motion while cardio
and now he's got the back of though size,

548
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,730
ripping and driving.

549
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:45,080
You know that drive you get from the
inside of your thighs when you're real

550
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:49,490
fucking, he's doing that
to her. Oh Lord. Oh,

551
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,240
is this Erin? No, no, no,
no. We'll edit that part out.

552
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,650
Do you know when riders on the storm,

553
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,910
he does one track singing and this
another track he's whispering. Really?

554
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,510
It's really hot and yeah,
play it. It's like, uh,

555
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,670
at the same time and pulled off of
Youtube. If we play it won't win. Oh,

556
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,950
and you never know why that's
over. Let's just do it. Okay, well,

557
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:10,610
let's see.

558
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,790
I never knew why it was so haunting
and then you hear that and it's like,

559
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,850
fuck this video doesn't post cool shit.

560
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,510
Back in the 60s when they were
coming back, we multitrack recording.

561
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:22,370
They were doing all kinds
of cool shit and you know,

562
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:27,340
the Beatles backtracking stuff. Oh, that
was Phil Spector. That is that right?

563
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,970
His wall of sound. Right. If you
don't know the Phil Spector story,

564
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:36,080
Phil Spector was known for pulling
guns on people. That was his thing.

565
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:40,460
He would always pull guns on people.
And uh, he got back to his house.

566
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:43,490
He picked up some woman,
I think at the House of Blues.

567
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:46,280
I think she was like a waitress or
something. Got Her back to his house,

568
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,340
put a gun in her mouth and pull the
trigger and blew her fucking brains out

569
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,680
and went through this big
trial because of, yeah.

570
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:58,580
And in the trial he would
wear like different wigs
every day he was bald and so

571
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,640
you wear these crazy like 1960s wigs,

572
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,590
like the most ridiculous wigs ever. Like
during his trial. Yeah, I remember that.

573
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,310
Pull up. Pull up some old photos of
Phil Spector's wig. Here's the doors.

574
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,680
Whisper track is just the track
with the whisper in the percussion.

575
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,763
Yeah,

576
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,870
he was the sexy.
Did fuck

577
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,783
okay.

578
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,733
Wow.

579
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,980
[inaudible] [inaudible]

580
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,260
that's haunting.

581
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,360
This is Phil Spector.

582
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,980
When he was in in court for
murder and he's wearing that wig.

583
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,990
That's not a Photoshop either.
That was a wig and were different ones.

584
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,810
Like some days they would be different
if you had a couple of different wigs.

585
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,770
You do find the other ones.

586
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,580
I get so confused cause that trial
happened I think around the same time as a

587
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,060
wow Ellen degeneres on trial.

588
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,780
It's Martina Navratilova
mixed with Ellen degenerate.

589
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,900
Don't ask me how the fuck I
pulled Martina Navit piece.

590
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,710
BCIT troll in the middle of
it somehow never troll over.

591
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,100
Wasn't she like one of the first
lesbians like the first thing? Yeah,

592
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,930
she came out during the aids thing and
uh, that was like the 80s, right? Yeah,

593
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:21,590
I guess not. You know,
84 85 she had balls.

594
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,780
Tough chick. No tennis balls. Yeah.
She's, she's a bad ass that she did.

595
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:30,740
This is what he really is.
Oh, that's gruesome. Yeah.

596
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,060
It looks like the guy that killed
Patrick wets his face and ghost Patrick.

597
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:40,570
Uh, no. You know, you know
that was, that was, uh,

598
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,930
the comic who died of AIDS. Black
Guy in New York. Charlie Burnett.

599
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,380
No other black guy in New
York who died of AIDS.

600
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,290
He Not Black Hispanic.
Oh.

601
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,060
Who the fuck was that?
Died of AIDS.

602
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:04,140
I remember because I started dating his
girlfriend about six months later. Oh,

603
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:08,820
that dude. Yeah. No, he died
too. Yeah. How did he die?

604
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,850
I don't know. Something with
this face. Probably what?

605
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:16,470
Phil Spector didn't die that fucker.
He's in jail. They nailed him.

606
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,610
They nailed him down.
I guess I need bank checks.

607
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,280
He would like to put guns
in their mouth and shit.

608
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,150
I could see that and he
wound up shooting her. Yeah,

609
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,290
it might've been that or it might've
been just the murder. I don't know.

610
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,820
Well if you think about if you had no
value on human life and everyone's trying

611
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:36,070
to go for the big, the biggest orgasm
you can get, whether it's doing

612
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,130
coke, grabbing your own
balls, cock ring with,

613
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:44,080
think about blowing someone's head
off as you came. That would be huge.

614
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,740
That would probably be,
if you are like a total psychopath,

615
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,840
that would probably be the the end all
be like calming and taking at the same

616
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:53,674
time,

617
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,670
putting human life into her as you take
it out of her and then imagining that

618
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:04,600
your loads actually got her pregnant and
that that kid would be born to a body

619
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,620
that just died.

620
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,420
Would it be conceived to a body that
just doing the loads get to the egg,

621
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:13,060
the loads crack open the egg
and they're like, sorry boys.

622
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,850
The factory has been shut
down. There's a, she's dead,

623
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,020
but we just got here. He just came
inside her. The eggs are here,

624
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:25,300
everything's do it, let's do it.
Her spirit goes into his dick hole.

625
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,560
It's like the opposite of an
abortion. She dies, baby lifts.

626
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,190
The baby gets conceived
like the first days of life.

627
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,930
That is the right. That's the number
one debate when it comes to abortion.

628
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,890
It's not whether or not women should
have to keep the baby and get pregnant.

629
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,590
The real debate is when
is it actually a person?

630
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,470
Cause I don't think it's a
person with two cells. You know,

631
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,760
I think if this is you see two cells
there and those two cells could grow to

632
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:52,390
become a person.

633
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,160
I feel like if be snuffed those two cells
right now there and then you're good.

634
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,840
I don't feel like you killed somebody,

635
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,880
but if it gets to be like six months and
it's inside the woman's body and could

636
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:07,810
live outside of her womb,
is that a baby? When, what?

637
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:12,520
At what year or at what month rather
Jonathan Katz, he used to say,

638
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,120
I think life begins after
the Second Cup of coffee.

639
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,730
I think it's, I think it's right out of
the gate. Right out of the box. Yeah.

640
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,000
Inception right into the box.
Like as soon as that thing turn,

641
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,540
as soon as that thing combines the
ag and that's the life. That's it.

642
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,320
I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to
kill it. I'm just saying it is a lie.

643
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:39,280
Don't kid yourself like don't
say don't fucking soft sell it.

644
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,860
If you're going to get an abortion,
you got an abortion.

645
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:45,670
If you took the morning after pill,
you have boarded a life,

646
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,250
you have the right to do
it and I support that.

647
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,520
But don't pretend it wasn't a
high stakes what you just did.

648
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,170
That's so important to say and so taboo.

649
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,410
Like what you're doing right now is
so like you that can be demonized.

650
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:05,920
You can be thought of as insensitive.
People can get angry and yell at you.

651
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,610
They've,

652
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,350
people have concocted certain politically
acceptable phrases for certain things

653
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,140
and abortion, you know, for abortion,

654
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,250
the number one issue is always
a woman's right to choose,

655
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,000
but a women's right to choose.
Exactly. What are you doing?

656
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,931
Like what are you doing?

657
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,630
I'm down for you having the right to
do whatever you want with your body.

658
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:26,860
I don't think that anybody,

659
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,450
especially anybody that can't have
a life in their body like a man,

660
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,950
we can't even understand what that is.

661
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,430
It's too, it's too far outside
the, it's impossible for us. It's,

662
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,400
it's only like fiction.
It's only like when we,

663
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,930
when we try to pretend to understand,

664
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,500
to put ourselves in the mind
of a woman that's pregnant,

665
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,860
we're just making things up.
We have no point of reference whatsoever.

666
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:51,710
It's a whole dementia. It's a different
dimension. So I don't think it's our,

667
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,830
I don't think it's any of our business,
but as far as that,

668
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:58,670
as far as like whether or not a woman
should be able to end this life form

669
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,331
inside of her body,

670
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:03,440
but why do we have this desire to
pretend that it's something other than a

671
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,960
person? Like I got in this
argument with this dude on Twitter.

672
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,390
This comics seems to be a funny guy,

673
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,890
but he kept calling me right wing and
saying that I was saying right wing

674
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,180
talking points and I said,
listen,

675
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,210
I'm 100% in support of a
woman's right to choose your,

676
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,440
you're hearing me wrong here.

677
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,300
But what I'm saying is it was
because Dawkins had compared a,

678
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,650
um, uh, a fetus inside
a body that you know,

679
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,190
that it was like, I think he had
compared it to like a baby pig.

680
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,140
I forget what the, a, the, I forget that
no more of a human than a baby pig is,

681
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,430
you know, I guess he's talking in
scientific terms how like a very,

682
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:43,310
very young fetus,
like whatever age it is,

683
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:48,200
when you decided to feed us
and he was saying that, I
was like, that's ridiculous.

684
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,850
That's such a ridiculous point.

685
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,780
And it fucks up the whole argument because
obviously that baby pig can't become

686
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:57,920
a person, but that fetus is going to be
a person. Everybody fucking knows it.

687
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,520
So stop playing this game.
This is a stupid game. Yeah.

688
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,790
And then this comic starts going at me
for like this UK guy, Frankie Boyle.

689
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,320
It seems like a nice guy.
Seems like a funny guy, you
know? But he was saying that,

690
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,210
I was saying all these right wing
talking points and I'm a, and I'm like,

691
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:14,900
I'm not right wing by any stretch
of the imagination, but what is it?

692
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,930
That's not a seed man.
It's not a seed. Okay.

693
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:21,860
Seed has to be planted to become life.
That fucker's planted. That's a sapling.

694
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,990
It's a person.
It's going to be a person.

695
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:26,750
If you keep eating food and
you don't take too much heroin,

696
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,040
that's going to be a fucking person.

697
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,450
And, and we all think about what our
lives I, the miracle of, you know,

698
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,390
not knowing how the universe works.
And you know,

699
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,660
there's theories in those paradigms and
their scientific data and we've got,

700
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,750
we're getting a broad sense of what,
what the,

701
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,330
what the actual material end of it is.

702
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,460
But the magic of the sperm and egg
becoming something like that's it.

703
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,780
No, that is when life begins.
And you know, we don't know why.

704
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:57,170
We don't know if there's a god making
it happen or if it really is like a

705
00:43:57,171 --> 00:44:01,250
million monkey's typing Shakespeare.
But it happened and it's like, well I'm,

706
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:06,251
I'm offended whenever anyone tries to
lump any discussion of any subject into

707
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:10,370
one of those categories where you can't
question it or one of those categories

708
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:14,130
where it's not open to discussion
that there is a certain acceptable uh,

709
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,240
opinion on it. Yeah. You're supposed
to have as an intelligent person,

710
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,650
as a progressive,

711
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:22,280
you're supposed to have one opinion
and if you questioned that at all,

712
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:26,330
deviate outside of that one opinion
at all. You are a piece of shit.

713
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,080
You're a bad person, you know, you, you,

714
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:32,040
you're outside of what we're
all trying push. We have an

715
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,530
agenda to push.
If you talk outside of that agenda.

716
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,610
I mean for a comic to think like that to
me is particularly offensive cause like

717
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,940
you're not, we're not being
honest about what it actually is

718
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,540
and also it's,

719
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,380
it's just putting issues into black
and white terms instead of knowing.

720
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,090
It's like, you know, I can't,

721
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,200
I can not support the war and
I can still support the troops.

722
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,310
Can I have that fucking distinction or
is it who wants one or the other nuance

723
00:44:57,311 --> 00:45:01,030
thought. Right. It's like people now
saying, I support the state of Israel.

724
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,210
I don't support the government of
Israel right now and what they're doing.

725
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,690
You can do both. You don't
have to be fucking, you know,

726
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:11,050
a Zionist or an anti Zionist and it's
the same thing with this. It's like,

727
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,950
you know,

728
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:16,950
abortion being something that is in the
hands of women exclusively is a fucking

729
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:21,850
weird situation because
ultimately the man is involved.

730
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,120
So can we at least have
an opinion about it?

731
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,510
Well, you know, even if you
have an opinion about it,

732
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:32,530
I mean I'm not calling for an opinion
that I should have any opinion as to

733
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:35,650
whether or not a woman should do it.
I removed myself from that.

734
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,820
I should have no opinion. This is what
I think. This is my, my belief. I can't,

735
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:43,600
I don't think I can stop you from doing
something to your body at a certain

736
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:47,140
point in time. When is it a moral though?
Is it a moral when it's nine months old,

737
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:48,071
it wasn't it a moral,

738
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:50,920
if you have an abortion in the day before
your kid was going to be born. That's,

739
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:51,820
that's a real question.

740
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:55,510
And to pretend that's not a real
question I think is preposterous.

741
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,810
I mean it's preposterous. It
doesn't, doesn't make any sense.

742
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,580
Like how can you not discuss this?

743
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,480
You don't want this discuss because
this is not in the framework of what you

744
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:09,160
think is like progressive liberal
thought that that'd becomes a problem.

745
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,720
No, I've been doing this bit where I
asked the women in the audience said,

746
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:15,140
do you support a woman's right to choose?
And then they almost all clap.

747
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,430
And then I say,

748
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:20,540
and how many of you have had abortions
and nobody ever fucking claps.

749
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:24,050
And I was like, you know, that's
a right, that's under attack.

750
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,450
And if you are ashamed
to say that you do it,

751
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,760
you're going to lose that fucking right.
Like I'm like,

752
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:31,850
I'm ashamed that I masturbate, but you
outlawed. I'm walking down main street,

753
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:35,360
my dick out like hell no. So, I mean,

754
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:36,860
I think that that's the thing about that,

755
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,260
about abortion as if
you shrouded in shame,

756
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:42,980
which the Republicans do and which
women are owning and absorbing,

757
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,300
they shouldn't internalize it. They
should say, no, I have, I've had abortion.

758
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,740
I don't think it's any of our business.
I don't think,

759
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,980
I think the thing about asking someone
if they've had an abortion is like,

760
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,510
you know, it's, you're,

761
00:46:55,511 --> 00:47:00,250
you're asking a very intimate question
to someone where it's probably an opinion

762
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,990
or a decision that they had to make where
maybe it wasn't a happy time. You know,

763
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:06,130
maybe it's a dark moment.

764
00:47:06,131 --> 00:47:10,600
So you're asking them to tell you
some person that they've never met,

765
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,730
that they have this dark memory,

766
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,430
that they have this thing in
their life they're not happy with.

767
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,550
Like just because everybody has an
opinion or just because you know,

768
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,990
someone has an abortion rather,

769
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,210
it doesn't mean that the way they look
at that abortion is a happy thing or

770
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:29,590
relief or something that, you know, they
would do. Again, it might be a, but it's

771
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,200
been framed as a political
issue and so they will that,

772
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,440
that personal thing that they
don't want to talk about.

773
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,470
If they never talk about it,
they're not going to be able to do that.

774
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,530
Not about talking about it.
It's about admitting it in public,

775
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:44,710
in front of a bunch of strangers at a
comedy club where everyone's drinking and

776
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,110
what percentage of the population
is asking a lot of the assholes

777
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,450
it's asking. I am very curious
in that moment. I know once,

778
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:03,010
you know, once I just wanted to
just start clapping in the middle,

779
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,610
you know, I had a great one. I was,
I, I don't remember where it was.

780
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,950
I remember what, what, how
the subject got to this,

781
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:13,951
but some woman in the audience
yelled out something about anal sex.

782
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,740
You know about either not liking
it or liking it. I don't remember,

783
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,330
but I remember something like I go,

784
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:23,620
that is a very rare that someone would
yell out, you know about anal sex.

785
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,110
You would want to keep that
like PR probably pretty private.

786
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,350
That could be potentially embarrassing.
Like, like I'll give you an example.

787
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:33,700
Like how many women here like taking it
in the ass and I thought in a couple of

788
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:36,970
actually clapped and yelled and I was
thinking any girl who would clap and yell

789
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,730
when that question comes up,
how many women like taking in the ass?

790
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,280
Like that's a girl who
really likes to say yes.

791
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,610
I mean she's completely comfortable
with it when she's like, look,

792
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:47,470
I'm the girl on that one.

793
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,520
If you look at for that one
out of a hundred that asked
for it who she is, right?

794
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,700
You know, if you don't know what you like,
how are you going to be happy in life?

795
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,010
And then you got to put
that message out there.

796
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,660
Well that assholes not filling itself.
You need to,

797
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:04,360
you need to be a hawker.
You gotta hop your own ass.

798
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,600
You got to let everybody know
you are that special person. Yes.

799
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,220
Rare person that likes guys. You're
afraid to even try it with your wife.

800
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:15,490
You know you could go 20 years and
then all of a sudden maybe on your 50th

801
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,300
anniversary you try to stick in
her ass and she's like, thank you.

802
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,620
Yeah. She was always almost bringing it
up but pulled back out of embarrassment.

803
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,430
He,
if he wanted and he would have tried it.

804
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,180
I'm not going to tell him I
want to fucking the ass. Gladys,

805
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:34,300
tell him you want it in
the ass now for 20 years.

806
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,950
I just don't think hockey would like that.

807
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:39,490
I don't think he'd respect maybe while
she goes to Harvey's fucking laptop,

808
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:42,960
but it's all bookmarks or teen in Ash,

809
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:45,190
DP it ass ass to mouth.

810
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,370
Screensavers just looks like a spider.
So fucking close up of it.

811
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,930
Dirty ass all outside soc one
of those like expanded those,

812
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,140
those but socks where someone just has a,
an exploded asshole,

813
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,650
which by the way,
never saw until I saw the internet.

814
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,910
Never knew that that was a thing.

815
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,110
Is it like a post anal sex than what
you just just swollen things stuffed in

816
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:12,910
your ass or your ass comes out like a,
like an unrolling juke clam.

817
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,760
It's horrible. No, that
was just different things.

818
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:20,380
It's unbelievable what people do.
They're buttholes these days. Yeah.

819
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,110
It's one tier.
That's the new frontier.

820
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,310
I talked to a friend of mine
who got divorced and he's a,

821
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:28,760
he's a comedian and he's got, you know,
he's got enough celebrity where he can,

822
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:33,860
and he said, Greg, they all want it the
ass now. He goes, it's fucking crazy.

823
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:38,090
He's like, I was never into ESX sex. And
now it's like, it's just what you do.

824
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,040
Wow. Yeah. Those kids today,
they're nuts. Absolutely nuts.

825
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,890
Here's you guys stuff is
nuts in there. Yes. Yeah.

826
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,560
How did he know he liked that?
I would be figured that out.

827
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:52,730
I think people just get bored.

828
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,010
They just get bored and they just do
whatever they can do. You know, they just,

829
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,890
after you do a certain amount of porn,
I mean,

830
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,590
I would imagine if you've
done porn for like 10 years,

831
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,450
just the thought of just having regular
sex, it's probably so boring to you. Yeah.

832
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,870
You know,

833
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,860
that's when they want to like put on
flippers and shit and fucking snorkels and

834
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,930
fucking in the tub and they would, they
want to just do ridiculous shit. Yeah.

835
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,390
They want to put pinwheels on their
nipples and put a bullet, you know,

836
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:23,450
one of those target signs on their ass
hole and have the guy run across them

837
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,230
because they're artists. You
know everybody, no matter
what you do for a living,

838
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:30,470
you should feel like there's a level
at which you can do it as an artist.

839
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,310
And I think there are porn stars
that really wanna like Bella Donna.

840
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:39,311
I think they really want to actually do
something that intro that creative for

841
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:44,420
them. Maybe it's possible
pregnant porn. Come on. Yeah,

842
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,550
pregnant porn and probably many things
up her ass while pregnant. Many. Yeah,

843
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,200
she,
she won best double anal one.

844
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,160
Oh

845
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,940
No, she wants single anal
twice. Oh, like I can see us.

846
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,570
Yeah. I was thinking, man,

847
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,580
that's probably one of the toughest
jobs for people to forget you from.

848
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,860
Like, say like if you were the host
of like American bandstand, you know,

849
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:17,310
and you were on TV for a long
time doing American bandstand,

850
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,730
you know you could quit and millions of
people saw you on American bandstand and

851
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,590
within a decade nobody would really
hold it against you that you were on

852
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:29,220
American Pan Stan. They, they
don't want to find you by that job.

853
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,960
But if you're a chick that's been
involved in multiple gang bangs with these

854
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:38,961
huge dicks and just fucking lube all
over you and guys making you gag and your

855
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:44,370
Mascara's running like that almost
never leaves you were a woman did almost

856
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:49,200
never leaves Tracy Lord might be the
only one that got close to escaping. Yup.

857
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,320
She got clothes.
She got in mainstream movies and,

858
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,190
and she turned out to be
pretty intelligence as she
would go on shows music too,

859
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,510
I think. Yeah, I think she
was like producing music.
Debbie Harry, I believed it.

860
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:05,250
Porn but Kim Kardashian from
the, no, from, from blondie.

861
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:10,320
Blondie. Really not positive,
but I believe she did porn
or was a or was a hooker.

862
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,340
Well, the sex tape thing is the
most amazing loophole like that.

863
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:15,061
You could just say,

864
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:18,030
I didn't know how that got out there
and then I remember they were doing that

865
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:22,920
for awhile. Oh yeah. I mean
like, especially like Kim
Kardashian and Paris Hilton.

866
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:27,090
That was like Pam Anderson because
the one, but she was already famous.

867
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,320
Oh you mean getting famous
that way? Oh yeah. Right.

868
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,930
I mean her and Tommy Lee was in Goddamn
Motley Crue. All right. You know,

869
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,950
he probably leaked it just to show her
his giant Dick. It was really hard.

870
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:42,990
It was really, they really like,
I don't care who you are as a guy.

871
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:47,400
You see that video. You feel really
bad about yourself? Not really.

872
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:50,430
I'll tell you why. Cause it's kind of
skinny. It doesn't have a lot of girth to,

873
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:51,380
okay.
It's not like a,

874
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:56,280
like there's certain dudes like Lexington
steels that his name, the porn guy,

875
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,070
he's got a dick that just doesn't
even look like it could be real.

876
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,110
Like the bar has been raised so high.

877
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:04,200
Like everybody like wants to go
with John Holmes all the time.

878
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,070
Especially guys in our age
bracket that was going to go,

879
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,660
the guy's got a dick like John Holmes.
Let me tell you something.

880
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:13,660
John Holmes barely has a big Dick
compared to some of these dudes. Yeah.

881
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,350
I mean his dick is big,
but that's like average big.

882
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,630
You think there's anything they
can do to make them bigger?

883
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,370
Is there like steroids evolution?
It's just finding big stars are evolving.

884
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:25,560
Just like the football players
are involved, right? Right. Yeah.

885
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,980
They're giant Dick dudes now in silicone
and they haven't been being blocked.

886
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,120
What? And they inject silicone. Do they
do that? Is that true? Wait a minute.

887
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,380
Do you know this for a fact?

888
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,780
A hundred percent do pull up the
letter we've already talked goes,

889
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,240
go get some links.
Injecting silicone in your deck.

890
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't think that's
a common practice son.

891
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,780
That makes you dick all lumpy and shit.

892
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,770
It's actually used a lot
more than you think. Wow.

893
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,430
How do you know how
many ducks he inspected?

894
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,740
Kids got into bed and talked about
this a lot during the spectrum,

895
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,060
so well that means it's real.
Well long as we talked about it.

896
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,430
A man been six years injecting
silicone in his penis.

897
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,940
Well, of course there's instances. I'm
just wondering if the porn stars do it.

898
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,770
Yeah. I don't think that's
what's going on, dude.

899
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:08,550
Those dudes just have giant Dicks,
but that's not what's going on.

900
00:55:08,551 --> 00:55:12,150
These guys have big decks. It's not
making your dick look like their deck.

901
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:17,040
It's just not. They have giant dicks.
If they do something to it, maybe,

902
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,920
but these dudes you want, they're limping.
They have these giant fucking dicks.

903
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,040
My English, you can find a
link you, there's tons of them.

904
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,150
I just can't really show you.

905
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,600
We'll just do an article or
something that says what they do.

906
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:31,800
I can show you by block putting your
logo ups and no one can see it except us.

907
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,950
Okay.
I like to see CSI do a fucking

908
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,470
dude.
This is a porn site,

909
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,220
guys sucking guys dicks on a porn site
that's not show proof that they're

910
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,440
shooting. Dude, if it was something
that they did all the time,

911
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:50,700
you could find a Google result of it.
Yeah. They're porn like porn stars.

912
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:55,410
Inject silicone into Dick's to make them
larger. Find that and then come to us.

913
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,300
You know, let a really big Dick. Ooh,

914
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,510
I bet he dead Dick Daughter Mary.
He used to do fucking 15 minutes.

915
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:05,540
I'd have big as Dick West.
I wait.

916
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:12,090
That's right. And he was
this, he was this guy who is,

917
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:15,720
he had to be in his sixties when he pulled
that up. Pull it up so we can read it.

918
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,651
What does it say?

919
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:21,651
Silicone Penis pumping parties
are a thing and there are no good.

920
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,340
Okay. I gotta read this on my
laptop where I can read it.

921
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:28,650
Silicone illegal penis pumping parties
are becoming increasingly popular.

922
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:32,020
Legal not to be in the copy button.
Oh,

923
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:37,030
you have to have a license for a fucking
silicone penis pumping party. Your,

924
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,450
your back. Applying for a license
for silicone penis pumping,

925
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:42,370
party pumping parties involved.

926
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:47,220
One person injecting nonsurgical
silicone into another person's body. Uh,

927
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,530
usually the silicone comes from items
found in your local hardware store like

928
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:54,630
flicks, fix a flat tire.
Oh, and they inject it. Boy,

929
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:58,150
you better really enjoy that
night. They use pumping party. Uh,

930
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:02,620
women in the past have used
pumping parties to enhance
the sizes of their butts.

931
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:07,450
But lately more and more men have been
doing it to their penises. Oh my God.

932
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,310
I've heard about women
getting, getting, you know,

933
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:13,330
they go to like Spanish Harlem and they
go to like a store front upstairs and

934
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:18,160
they inject cock and the,
and then it petrifies and
they've got these, oh my God.

935
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,890
Hard Lips. All right, Jeremy,

936
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,950
show you actual guy that has silicone
in his dick from a porn video.

937
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,430
Got a sensor it for the home people.
Okay. They're saying it doesn't work.

938
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,070
If there was a legitimate
method for penile linkedin,

939
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,240
Johnson and Johnson or Pfizer would
have bought it up and made billions and

940
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,900
billions of dollars worldwide. The fact
that they don't need that doesn't exist.

941
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,210
Like, so what they're saying though
is this is not, so that's Celine bro.

942
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:44,650
You got the wrong wrong substance.
That guy has sailing in his balls.

943
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,100
That's a common thing that they do
too. Yeah, we get, we get the video.

944
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:51,130
It's just salt water.
Um,

945
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:55,690
so let they're saying is that people are
idiots and that they get together and

946
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:56,890
they shoot salient in their dicks,

947
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,800
but these are the type of people
that they're nuts. I mean,

948
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:03,370
there's people that cut themselves and
put horns in their head and this is not

949
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:06,400
like something's porn stars do to make
their dicks bigger. What's his face?

950
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:10,000
You're saying also that doesn't work? Your
friend, uh, the porn star guy that, that,

951
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,410
that did rear tire at night that did rear
factor, uh, Steven Saint, Saint Croix,

952
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:16,120
he's the one that told,
also talked about it.

953
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,510
We've talked about it many
times on different podcasts
before. It's supposedly,

954
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:22,870
it is a thing in the industry that
people pumped their dick up with.

955
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,270
Like the shit.
I can't imagine that it would work though.

956
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,940
It doesn't make any sense that it
would make it look, I'm telling you,

957
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:32,260
if you see Lexington, steels Dick, and I'm
not saying go look for it, but you will.

958
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,810
And if you do, you're going
to go, that ain't fake.

959
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:39,100
That is not a big fake siliconed
up Weirdo Dick. Like a fake lip.

960
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:43,750
That's a dude with a giant Dick and he's
the only one of many the Johnny Holmes.

961
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,990
My point was that the Johnny Holmes
referenced that we had when we were kids,

962
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,150
that's no longer the benchmark.

963
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,490
These guys have way bigger
dicks than John Holmes.

964
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,470
John Holmes was in one of
those gang bangs. Those guys,

965
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:55,180
he would look like a guy with a big deck.
That's it.

966
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,750
They all have big dicks skies of
giant dicks. Some of these guys,

967
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:00,700
you can't believe that they
can own a dick that big,

968
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:03,160
like what do they do with it when
they're not using it? They laugh.

969
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,670
Here's all day laughing at the fucking
the goodness of the world has given them.

970
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,620
Here's an article on your tango.

971
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:11,490
It's an interview with a male porn
stars and one of the things he says,

972
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:14,260
sometimes dudes can't get it up,
which is a problem on a porn set.

973
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,103
No surprise there,

974
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,120
but apparently you could build
up tolerance to injection
erection enhancers like

975
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,740
Viagara they solution inject your Dick.
Yes.

976
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:26,570
With a needle with more in intense liquid
medication that works incidentally and

977
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,240
leaves your underside of your cock
filled with needle holes. Yeah,

978
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,870
but you're talking about the wrong
stuff. Yeah. This is around forever.

979
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,500
They've been doing that forever. I think
it's the, there's, in the old days,

980
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:39,230
they used to do it, I believe with
testosterone, like someone said,

981
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,000
they inject testosterone right in the
base there. Dick and their dick would go

982
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,523
so crazy,

983
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,540
act in the penis and just
start doing pushups on its own.

984
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:57,000
You don't even have to move.
Oh my come and jacked and Dick,

985
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,010
I would use Pillsbury,
a Dell and mine doesn't,

986
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,540
and check off and have
a croissant come out.

987
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,520
Are you cooking it in kind of
fucking how hot does you, Dick,

988
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,260
do you know? That's a thing
that people do. I was like,

989
01:00:14,261 --> 01:00:19,090
why do I have a yeast infection again,
specifically

990
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,990
does the thing that people do where they
drive for a long trips and they'll put

991
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:27,700
food on their grill or on
the engine block. Ah, oh,

992
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,090
like wrap it in aluminum foil,

993
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,350
put it on the engine block and cook it
as they're driving and then pull over and

994
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,290
and eat the food. That's
genius. Yeah, and it works.

995
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,040
Of course they like you can take a
the tilapia little slice of butter,

996
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,690
some garlic salt, put that bitch
up in, they're folded. Nice.

997
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,900
Put it on your engine block and then the
other one you roll up some asparagus.

998
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,650
Yeah, put that also in the aluminum
foil and then drive a couple of hours.

999
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,920
Pull over and have a nice dinner.
I wonder how long it would take to,

1000
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:55,880
do you need a cookbook?

1001
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,310
Somebody should come up with
a cookbook for cooking times.

1002
01:00:58,311 --> 01:01:00,290
And what part of the
engine to put it on to pay.

1003
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,870
If you have a v six cooking
time is only 12 minutes. Right?

1004
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,590
You gotta have a Prius. It's four
and a half hours. Doesn't get high.

1005
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,970
Have you ever fucking old Mustang?
He would get it off in five minutes,

1006
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,110
hit the gas once and eat those like,
like an old,

1007
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,730
like a gt three 50 those
fucking things got so hot.

1008
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,820
Those old cars got so hot.
I had this,

1009
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,090
I had this Volkswagen rabbit back when
I was going from New York to Boston

1010
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:30,230
pretty much every week. Wow. I had a
Volkswagen rabbit and it, it, it the,

1011
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:34,490
they used to have the starter right next
to the engine block and so it would get

1012
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:38,510
heated up and if I stopped like at
the Mass Pike, you know, rest area,

1013
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,990
it wouldn't start again because
it was so fucking hot to start.

1014
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:46,190
It was just like incapacitated and I
have to wait like 40 minutes to start the

1015
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:50,600
car again. So I would just leave the
car running in the rest areas. Whoa.

1016
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,350
That's up bitch.
I used to have a,

1017
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,450
one of the things I loved about having a
manual transmission as I didn't eat the

1018
01:01:56,451 --> 01:02:00,950
starter that I could uh, pop rock
ledge. That was a big thing, man.

1019
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,690
I wonder if I could do that with a new
car. Does that work on new cars too?

1020
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,960
I had is probably all
kinds of safety things,

1021
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,430
but I wonder if it works on new cars.
I should try it on.

1022
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,660
It is a huge upside of having a standard.
Oh, it was giant. I'd loved it because I,

1023
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,320
my car ran out of batteries
before I forgot the lights. Yeah.

1024
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,770
I left the lights on and all I did was
get that. But I did it backwards once.

1025
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,520
I don't know how the fuck I did it.

1027
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,140
A backwards into reverse or backwards in
the reverse. Backwards in reverse works.

1028
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,340
What it works great in first.
First is where it really works.

1029
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,770
All your car is standard
that you have now?

1030
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,390
No, no. I have a an m three
that's not a standard. Mm.

1031
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,180
But that's my commuter car now.
I'm trying to think of,

1032
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:41,360
I did do it backwards or if I rolled
down a hill backwards and then turned

1033
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:44,690
around in the intersection and pulled
it out. I did it so many fucking times.

1034
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:48,410
I don't remember. But I had this Audi
Fox. It was such a piece of shit.

1035
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:51,890
Those were pieces of such a piece of shit.
But I love that car.

1036
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:55,870
That car has a special car for me.
Special car and my memory. Yeah.

1037
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,440
Cause that was like my independence car.

1038
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:00,710
Those was the first car that I got when
I like moved out of my parents' house

1039
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:01,820
and it's the first car that I got,

1040
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:06,290
there was a small car that I could drive
around in and had cool kind of European

1041
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:09,530
thing going on. Two front wheel
drive, manual transmission.

1042
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,960
But it was such a hunk of
shit died all the time.

1043
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,180
I was always popping the
clutch on that fucker.

1044
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,840
I think it was a Volkswagen at some point
and then it switched sides cause Audi

1045
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:21,320
and Volkswagen where like
the same company. Really.

1046
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:26,070
I thought I thought cotter had a
Volkswagen Fox. Maybe his was an Audi Fox,

1047
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:30,780
but I had, I had that.
That's my baby. Oh yeah.

1048
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:34,650
That's nice man. That's,
that looks like a uh, uh,

1049
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,150
I didn't have that year

1050
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,220
and I had a copper one. It
was copper colored. I think.

1051
01:03:39,221 --> 01:03:42,190
I want to know if it was a two door
or four door, like a month show.

1052
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,640
I think it was a four door.
Is this your first car? No,

1053
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:48,970
it was my first like independent cars.
Like when I was independent,

1054
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:51,310
when I wasn't living with my
parents anymore. I had this car,

1055
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,220
I think I bought it from one of
my mom's friends or something too.

1056
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,910
I can't remember how the fuck I got it,
but it was like one of those cars where,

1057
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,250
look,

1058
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,700
let me just drag this piece of shit around
for a while because I had been really

1059
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:03,490
into cars since I've, like,
I've first got my license,

1060
01:04:03,491 --> 01:04:05,650
I was loved American muscle cars.
That's what I loved.

1061
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:10,480
I love like old Chevelles and barracudas
and challengers and those kinds of cars.

1062
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:14,560
I just loved them, man. It just, other
cars to me were just transportation.

1063
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,030
Like I got it.
Yeah.

1064
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:19,660
I know that you want to get a VW
because that was exactly what I had.

1065
01:04:19,661 --> 01:04:23,740
It was a two door. That's exactly what I
had. It was like a copper color though.

1066
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:28,090
Like a little darker. But um, but
that was the first car that I had.

1067
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:30,360
There was like, this is just going to
get me where I want to go. Like this,

1068
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,630
what freedom that is.

1069
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:35,290
When you were inside that car and you
realize like I'm in a capsule and it's

1070
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:39,190
fucking mind and it takes me where
I want to go. That's powerful. Yeah.

1071
01:04:39,191 --> 01:04:42,580
When you're young and it's the first
time you get to just go wherever you want

1072
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:44,560
and you've been taking susses and walking,

1073
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,260
I'll walk to your house
seeing an hour now it's like,

1074
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:51,340
I'll see you in two minutes and then
we'll go buy beer and sit behind a fucking

1075
01:04:51,341 --> 01:04:56,200
bleach. That same car? No. Oh wait,

1076
01:04:56,201 --> 01:05:00,370
no. That looks like a hatchback. It's not
the same car at all. See Sprint. Yeah,

1077
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:03,620
it's totally different company.
Different names. Well No,

1078
01:05:03,621 --> 01:05:04,820
I can you mind worse research?

1079
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,860
Google car fit the model and for some
reason that just got mixed in with your

1080
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:11,700
cars. Oh No. Why cars? It sucked.

1081
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:15,640
That you won't don't want in 2014. And
how did, how did you afford the car?

1082
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,310
You work for it. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't remember.

1083
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,170
Um,
cause I don't remember what year it was,

1084
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:25,171
but I thought during those days it's
probably a mix of construction work and

1085
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,530
probably delivering newspapers still then.
Yeah,

1086
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:32,290
I was delivering newspapers
even before I had the, the Audi.

1087
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:36,910
I started newspapers like right out of
high school. I did it for like four years.

1088
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:40,510
I might have even done it while in
high school for a while it was just the

1089
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:42,520
greatest gig ever.
Did you throw them out?

1090
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:47,290
The it to us and the driver's door and
it depended on where I was driving.

1091
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,280
Would you ever stop and get out because
you made a bad throat? Yes. I stopped,

1092
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:55,000
got out if I made a bad throw and there
are certain houses that they demanded

1093
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:58,040
that you put it inside their door now,
which is really annoying.

1094
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,790
Did they tip you those
people? Um, some of them were,

1095
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:05,320
some of them I didn't mind it if there
were old folks just didn't want to get up

1096
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,720
and walk all the way down the steps.
I did it for like,

1097
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:10,940
there was this old lady that was super
sweet and I always did it for her and she

1098
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:13,090
didn't ask for it. No,
she's a little too old.

1099
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:17,140
Couple of years I missed her by a couple
of won it in the ass. Never had it.

1100
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:22,300
They didn't do it in the ass in the 80s
pro was that asshole is as tight as her

1101
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:26,290
vagina relation when she was
17 she's waiting, just waiting.

1102
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,730
It's not camped.
It's definitely not kept up.

1103
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:35,731
Well definitely flavored smoked and you
know with that arthritis tastes like

1104
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:38,710
that's right. And she's not
getting a good wife coming back.

1105
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:40,970
They're either early finger,
one finger in the door.

1106
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,620
No one had anything but toilet paper
back then. And even in porn girls,

1107
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:48,230
I'd Harry asshole's back then. I remember
that. And pouring, there was just,

1108
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,100
it was a jungle. They just left it
alone. There was no trimming. No.

1109
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:55,990
And then one brave gow shaved the whole
cooter and from then on out it was no

1110
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,170
turning back. Now it's weird if you see
it. Have you even been, well I guess not,

1111
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:02,230
but have you like lately if you see it,
it's kind of like what the fuck? No,

1112
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:06,550
that's your, that's the thing. Now that's
the thing is, is retro bushes. Bushes.

1113
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:08,890
Yeah. She wasn't making a
comeback now. Huge Bushes.

1114
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:12,430
But you know a little bit of jungle.
Yeah. A little bit of jungle forestry,

1115
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,830
just a little bit of rain forest park.

1116
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,360
Just a little a triangle of green in the
town square. It's a little something.

1117
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,890
We'll swap and make it interesting when
people try to change it up every now and

1118
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:26,980
then with everything. I mean remember when
they tried to bring bell bottoms back?

1119
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,490
There was a time we're dudes, we're in
bell bottoms. Skin didn't last long.

1120
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,510
It was only a couple of months,
but people were just trying. Yeah.

1121
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,090
You know and people accused me of that
with the fanny pack. But I tell you this,

1122
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:39,940
first of all, I never stopped
wearing a fucking fanny pack ever.

1123
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,260
So you can't tell me that.

1124
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,600
I'm trying to bring it back
because it never went away.

1125
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,280
Is it that always been fuck it back.

1126
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,420
Matthew mcconaughey was at a baseball
game wearing one and he was seeing the

1127
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:50,350
virtues of the fanny pack.

1128
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:54,040
I sell out of them on higher primate.com
sell out of them every month.

1129
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,670
I hate having shit in my pockets.
I love the fan. You want one?

1130
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:02,140
I got one for Ya right here. Jamie. Get it
for him. Oh, I love it. It's leather. No,

1131
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:05,050
my kids laugh at me because I have
one bit of ripped apart. Yeah.

1132
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:07,300
See that's a decent one.
But the roots one,

1133
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:11,140
I got the routes one from dice roots is
the best fucking company. Great Company.

1134
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:16,050
Good bags. Yeah. They um,
they dice came in sweatpants

1135
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,990
go fanny pack. Oh. And
so he comes in with this,

1136
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:22,880
look at that.
This fucking fanny pack.

1137
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:27,890
It's a sweet fucking to
legit pockets in the front,

1138
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,120
high quality, everything.
Gray latch, fuck them.

1139
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,950
Excellent latching system.
And it's really high quality.

1140
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,940
The best quality fanny pack I could find.

1141
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,260
And so I had my higher primate leg logo.
If you look on one of the pockets,

1142
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,540
she though the chimp logo with
the light bulb above his head.

1143
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,150
That's the higher primate logo. So
I had it in him, Boston, whatever,

1144
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:52,450
with pressed whatever it is into the
leather leather. Oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

1145
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,310
Those are high quality men.
But if you were one of those,

1146
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:58,390
like it's so convenient when you
go to the airport. My God. Yeah.

1147
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,690
Because when you go to the airport,

1148
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:02,720
it's such a bitch to take everything out
of your fucking pockets and put it back.

1149
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:03,800
And chicks don't have to do that.

1150
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,590
If they just lay down their
purse and walked through
their side and they're good,

1151
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:10,760
you know, like, cause I like my glasses.
They're sitting on the table right now.

1152
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,310
I'll probably forget them.
That happens to me every fucking day.

1153
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,550
This way I stick them right
inside my fanny pack. Tao Pao.

1154
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:20,330
The phone slips right in there. When
it vibrates, it vibrates, right?

1155
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:24,740
All your Dick reach down,
touch it, pull it on me.

1156
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,620
You wait until it's like four or
five rings in, then you pull it out.

1157
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,740
I just put this, my point is that
this isn't like the bell bottom.

1158
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,480
This is functional as fuck.

1159
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,030
It's like the most functional way
to carry your shit around ever.

1160
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:41,030
And the reason why people don't do it is
because they're worried that they look

1161
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:45,530
bad. Is it a conversation starter?
Do you find? Yes, most certainly is.

1162
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,940
Yes. People go right on, man. I go,
yeah, that's right. Fuck everybody.

1163
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,140
Fuck Rosey Greer. And the 70s started
wearing dude carrying a purse. Teddy,

1164
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,870
that giant fucking linebacker who's going
to say shit to him? Nobody. Exactly.

1165
01:09:57,871 --> 01:10:01,370
Yeah, you don't need a backpack.
Doesn't even have to handle yet. Right,

1166
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,080
but the real deal is oh,

1167
01:10:03,081 --> 01:10:05,840
backpacks better than a purse and
you're allowed to wear a backpack.

1168
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:09,250
Like if a guy has a backpack on and
you know you run into some friends,

1169
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,720
one of them happens to be a girl.
Nobody gives you a hard time.

1170
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,450
But if you had a fucking purse
on, it'd be like, what's up bitch?

1171
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,830
What are you doing with that purse?

1172
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:19,250
Holy Shit is that shit now the fuck
is wrong with you, right? We usually,

1173
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,990
you don't have a woman anywhere near you.

1174
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:24,380
You're just walking around with this and
if you are a guy and you have a purse,

1175
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,490
you got to carry it like this.

1176
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:28,580
Like out to the side as if it's a head
that you just cut off with the fucking

1177
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:32,330
sword. Like it's smelly garbage.
You're bringing out to the curb.

1178
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,840
I'm carrying this because I'm going to
get some pussy at the end of this fucking

1179
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:38,650
journey. I got this in my hand
and when I bring it back to her,

1180
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,950
I'm going to fuck the life out of her
like that free second I holidays cause

1181
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,710
another second I'm inside
of her skull with my chef.

1182
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,250
And plus you could do like
some good shoulder exercises.

1183
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,650
Just do some hand offs as you walk with
the person because a lot of chicks that

1184
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:55,190
fucking heavy persons,
you know you've got a lot of shit done.

1185
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:59,180
The bigger the pitch that the bigger
the purse, the crazier the woman also.

1186
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:02,090
That's so true, right? Yeah.

1187
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,970
But those chicks that have
like little tiny like clutches,

1188
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,390
those are those the chicks that could just
fucking, they'll come over your house.

1189
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,350
Fuck you in the art. Take care. I've
got to hit the airport. That's it.

1190
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,100
Those chicks travel light.
They a handy wipe in there

1191
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,010
for the undercarriage.
Otherwise it's just a boarding pass.

1192
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:21,450
Give it a little fucking one of
those, the sanitary things. Go to the,

1193
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,340
you know those uh, wipes. Chiro
wipes for eating roots. Yeah.

1194
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:30,160
Pigs you get it would read
you the little white.

1195
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,250
It looks the same. Yeah.
Fuck aids. Let it go.

1196
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:39,330
Let it go and get on that plane.
World travelers,

1197
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:41,430
some people do travel like that.
Dot.

1198
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:45,270
Merera buys all his underwear and socks
everywhere he goes. That's true out. Yeah.

1199
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,380
Throws them out. That sounds like a an
effort though to find a place that sells.

1200
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,410
Not really anywhere and it just pulls
in somewhere. When he gets there,

1201
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,980
get some socks. What is he renting a
car and I don't know. I got the Gig.

1202
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,360
I don't know. I mean a Betty does
in some places for sure. You know,

1203
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,870
but I always red card. You rent a car
when you go places. Rarely. Rarely.

1204
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:07,860
I go to the hotel and I just hold up
your trap press for few days. I know.

1205
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:10,650
You keep telling me I gotta break
some on the right way. We do it, man.

1206
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:14,340
We do it so different now with
Uber, you don't need a, that's true.

1207
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,920
But then you got some
crazy dude driving around.

1208
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:21,560
It's probably barely been
fucking profiled. The barely
check that guy out. Yeah,

1209
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:26,540
right. You know, all of a sudden you run
out of gas. Robert Downey Jr with a purse.

1210
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:31,770
It's probably, it's probably his
wife's purse. Yeah. He's Robert Downey.

1211
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:34,730
Motherfucking junior and he's got $1
billion. She doesn't give a fuck. Yeah,

1212
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:38,190
but that, but the purse hanging around
the arm seems like a pain in the ass.

1213
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:41,100
That seems like you're stuck with your
arm like that though. It's so good.

1214
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:45,230
Exercise. Good for the arm muscles. Right.
Put a Kettlebell on the other one on it.

1215
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:49,920
First Kettlebell in it. I have a bowling
ball, um, case that I carry with me.

1216
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,720
When I go on the road,
I bring a kettle bell on it.

1217
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,020
I throw like a to really throw 50
pound Kettlebell in that bitch.

1218
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,010
Check it shot out. Yeah. I'm
seriously on a roller and everything.

1219
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,240
So you can do kettle bells when
you get to the hotel. Otherwise,

1220
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:06,230
what are you gonna get? A kettle bell.
Wow. It's hard. Hard to get a kettle bell.

1221
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,700
Have you ever tried one? The water
ones where you just pump up with water.

1222
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:10,320
It doesn't,
not strong enough for this one.

1223
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:14,350
You get a feed that that needs to be fed.
This is Ken.

1224
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,210
This water's not going to need
something much larger than water.

1225
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,340
Water is not heavy enough. You need
metal. There you go son. Look at that.

1226
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:23,490
Brian's working out. Yeah, it's
kid. He was shaking a little bit.

1227
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:28,380
It's some hotels have great gyms.
When a hotel is a great gym,

1228
01:13:28,381 --> 01:13:29,880
it's a godsend because you
don't have to go anywhere.

1229
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:32,550
It's right there in the building
when they have great 24 hour gyms.

1230
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,840
That's amazing. Oh, can you do that?
You do the midnight workout. I love it.

1231
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,330
No shift or shows. I love after
show, wait lived in session.

1232
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:42,270
You go for a while. Yeah.
You know why I do it?

1233
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,060
Cause I don't want to do it because
after shows I want to just do nothing.

1234
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:47,490
So every now and then I like to exercise
that part of me that doesn't want to do

1235
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,230
something, Huh? Yeah.

1236
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:52,590
I think it's important to do yet I would
just worked in Tampa and they had a gym

1237
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:54,210
around the corner that was like,
you know,

1238
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:58,170
triathlon or like what are the people
that drag type tire. Fucking Dji.

1239
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:02,310
They had giant tractor tires you
could push and change. You could pull.

1240
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:06,600
It was wild.
They was like no pussy machines at all.

1241
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,070
None of my machines are they.

1242
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:12,100
Isn't it funny that all that stuff used
to be called work right? That was what

1243
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,610
people used to do. You had to pick up
chains. If you worked in a fucking ship,

1244
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:19,750
climb a ladder. Yeah. If you worked in a
factory that made tires yet a flip tires,

1245
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,510
it'll move them mean now everybody's like,
you know,

1246
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,630
I'm getting a crossfit workout in them
hitting the tire with a sledgehammer.

1247
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:30,230
Why don't you do some honest work that
that all you're wasting all that sledge

1248
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:34,140
hammer movement. You could be breaking
rocks in the pen, right? This crates,

1249
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:37,420
you stack crates over in the corner
and then you restack them in the other

1250
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:40,840
corner. You remember? That was what we
always saw in in penitentiary moves.

1251
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:44,320
Dudes would break rocks. I remember
that. Yup. Was that, is that real?

1252
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,480
That still they still do
that? They break rocks. Yeah.

1253
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:51,070
I would think the last thing you would
want as a bunch of inmates with insane

1254
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,630
cardio that had been
breaking rocks all day. Yeah.

1255
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,190
Cause if you have a fucking sledgehammer
and you're swinging that bitch all day

1256
01:14:57,191 --> 01:15:01,260
break and rocks, my God, are you going to
get in insane shape? You're backing it.

1257
01:15:01,261 --> 01:15:04,810
And if you punch somebody, George Foreman
used to do that. He used to chop wood.

1258
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,870
That was like one of his exercises.
My neighbor does that every night.

1259
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:11,980
It's sucks truck knowing he just sits
there and shops would all night long and

1260
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:15,250
it's, and it's loud but he has this
humongous thing that you just like,

1261
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,330
it doesn't split because it's just a
humongous like so he does it just for

1262
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:22,480
finding out, Huh? Yeah. My uh,

1263
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:27,130
my doctor digs holes in
his yard. I go, I go,

1264
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:29,100
what do you do for exercise?
Cause he doesn't, he doesn't, he,

1265
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:32,910
he's a black belt in martial arts to
some kind of martial art. But I'm a,

1266
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,250
I go did you that
anymore? He was like, Dad,

1267
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:37,060
it's too much strain on my body
because he's in his sixties I go,

1268
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:39,400
so what do you do for workouts?
Because I dig holes in my yard.

1269
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:43,510
I go out in the yard and I just do rope.
I just do yard work. Start digging holes.

1270
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,130
Yeah. I go, do you want to dig these
holes? Is there a purpose for him?

1271
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:50,110
He goes sometimes and sometimes it's
just to dig a hole, you know? No,

1272
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:54,970
he's a nice guy, but he said that
that's like a great way of uh,

1273
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:58,870
it's a great like that's a manual labor
that's like really robust for the body

1274
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,820
because you're digging into that dirt,
you're forcing it in with your legs,

1275
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:06,370
taken it up, you're hoisting it up and
then boom, and then it is like, he goes,

1276
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:10,030
if you look at the motion of like
digging a hole, he's like all of that.

1277
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:12,660
It's like an excellent workout.
Yeah. It's like you're forcing your,

1278
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,060
using your legs, using your arms,
using your shoulders and your back.

1279
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:18,700
You're digging, you're bending
down, you're picking it up.

1280
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,820
It's all these muscles are engaged.
So when it's an activity,

1281
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:26,200
then you will push yourself further. Then
if you were just lifting a dead weight,

1282
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,020
there's no creativity. There's no
beginning, middle and end to it.

1283
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:32,380
But when you're shoveling or even if
you're busting up stones, there's like,

1284
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,210
I'm going to bust this fucking stone up.

1285
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,930
But I would think busting up stones
would fuck your face up and your body up.

1286
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,720
You could hit with shrapnel and shit.
You'd probably get cut here.

1287
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,100
I would have your answer to
death by the end of the day.

1288
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:46,060
You'd have to have some shit in your ears
and you know that you know the handles

1289
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:48,580
getting splinters on it. They're
not giving you good, good hammers.

1290
01:16:48,581 --> 01:16:51,340
They'll probably give you gloves or
anything they give you. Maybe, maybe,

1291
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,310
but I got news for you. Even with
gloves, you're going to get blisters.

1292
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,100
You swinging a hammer all day,
a sledge hammer,

1293
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,260
breaking rocks and you're doing
it five days a week or whatever.

1294
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:02,760
They make those guys work.
See, they need to combine, uh,

1295
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,290
the gym with actual industry.

1296
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:10,040
Like what if you really did need rocks
broken up, bring them to Gold's gym,

1297
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,970
dump 'em out back. Have people
come out and cross train by slant,

1298
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:18,650
by hitting the rocks, hookup all
the cardio machines to a generator.

1299
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:19,940
So you're getting the
electricity out of it.

1300
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:24,260
Turn the gym into a working
energy and production machines.

1301
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:25,850
Do you know how much cardio you'd have

1302
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,000
do to generate any energy?

1303
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:33,090
Like is that right energy to like power
a phone while you're jogging would be

1304
01:17:33,461 --> 01:17:36,700
very difficult. You couldn't even get,
keep the lights going in the gym. Yeah,

1305
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:40,540
I mean May, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1306
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:45,370
With the music plan, the TV's on and all
the fluorescents on good fucking luck.

1307
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,650
Solar.
You could do it with solar,

1308
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,180
but the amount of force that you would
have to do like on an elliptical machine

1309
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:55,330
just to keep your iPhone running. I
don't know if you could do it. Wow.

1310
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:00,460
I really think that your iPhone would
require at least as much as you were doing

1311
01:18:00,461 --> 01:18:02,710
if you were like really
fucking hoofing it,

1312
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,540
unless they made a super efficient
system. But I don't know, man.

1313
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:10,900
I don't know. I just, I would
think that if that was the case,

1314
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,430
there would be all sorts of mechanical
work arounds for electricity.

1315
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:16,380
You know,

1316
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:18,340
think that that would be something that
someone would have thought of a long

1317
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:18,671
time ago.

1318
01:18:18,671 --> 01:18:23,671
If you could imagine if you could get
your day's worth of electricity all by

1319
01:18:24,161 --> 01:18:27,820
doing a 20 minute session on your lip
tickle machine every day. So every day,

1320
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,330
not only did you force yourself to get
a good exercise in to start your day,

1321
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,430
but when you bank it like that,

1322
01:18:33,431 --> 01:18:36,850
it stores electricity and it powers
your entire house for the day.

1323
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:37,900
Air Conditioning,

1324
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,180
that would be bad ass.

1325
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:42,900
And eventually we get to the point where
we all have like where they get ion

1326
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,620
small enough where everyone's got a
battery pack, you've got a fanny pack,

1327
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,800
it's got a battery in it and you've got
to work out in the morning to charge

1328
01:18:49,801 --> 01:18:53,100
that mother fucker. And then when you go
to work, your computer plugs in there.

1329
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:56,340
It's just got a giant plug
and then you fill it yourself.

1330
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,290
If you don't have enough
juice at the end of the day,

1331
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,120
you don't fucking work on your computer.

1332
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah. Well you would, you would need
that energy. It's like in a way,

1333
01:19:06,001 --> 01:19:08,950
that's kind of what people used to have
to do when they were chopping wood. Yeah.

1334
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,550
It's like you had to go out
and chop that fucking wood up,

1335
01:19:11,551 --> 01:19:12,990
otherwise you didn't have wood to burn.

1336
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,720
Like there's a show that I watched
some times. Um, friends. Dot.

1337
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:21,510
I don't watch curious George Frazier.
That's my favorite. No, it's not.

1338
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,870
Um, I know it's Frazier thing.
Never got it. Never understood it.

1339
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,560
I'd watch it for five minutes ago.
Okay.

1340
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,320
Yeah.
It's classic Classic Sitcom formula.

1341
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,010
Get one character who is exactly
the same as the other character,

1342
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,110
and then just watch the conflict arise

1343
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:40,680
and that it's,
well,

1344
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,150
it's Frazier's one of the weird sitcoms
where people don't talk about it. Yeah.

1345
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:48,010
Like that was a big Goddamn said.
Come for a long years or some shit.

1346
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,810
Nobody talks about, here's another one.
Right. I don't want a ton of enemies too.

1347
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,970
Here's another one. Ready for this John
Larroquette show. How long was that?

1348
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:59,440
I don't remember exactly
exactly a long time. Right.

1349
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:02,920
You don't hear about it? Lenny Clarke
was on it. Lenny Clarke was on the set.

1350
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:07,950
I'm right down the s like like one sound
stage over when I was on news radio,

1351
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,800
it was a news radio was on one side.

1352
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,920
Joey Lawrence was a next to us and Joey
Lawrence would sit in his car and he

1353
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:19,470
would open his doors up of his
car. It's some crazy car, you know,

1354
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:24,471
he's super rich and he would crank his
sound system with his songs plan and he

1355
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:28,550
would sit there.
Yes and like fucking rock out to his size.

1356
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:30,660
Be fucking kid was like 18 right.

1357
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:33,960
The kid was 18 and you had a Ferrari
or something ridiculous. Big Mercedes.

1358
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,790
I mean he had a ton of cars.

1359
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:41,030
I mean he was unbelievably wealthy and
he would play his music and Dave Foley

1360
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,030
took great amusement in this day.
Fully loved it.

1361
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,850
He was like the Lawrence boys out
there playing his music again.

1362
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:53,340
He would come in and he goes, he
seems to quite like us, his own songs,

1363
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:59,820
same wave to him and he, there he is

1364
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,520
nothing.
My Love camp fix.

1365
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,480
Here's this Easter before Bieber,

1366
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:15,170
all his clothes are way too big
is beautiful. Look at that hair,

1367
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:19,130
man. I didn't have hair
like that when I had hair.

1368
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,200
All my hair, like I hadn't lost a piece
of hair. I didn't have hair like that,

1369
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,790
but he was a, he would play this in
his, in his thing right next to it.

1370
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:32,780
So right next to him
was Greg Geraldo direct.

1371
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,970
Greg Geraldo show was,
uh,

1372
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:37,940
was or am I be fucking
up the timeline here.

1373
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,160
I think Geraldo might've
been first season.

1374
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:44,030
Joey Lawrence might've been second season,
but Geraldo show was on there as well.

1375
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,740
And then right over here was the John
Larroquette show with Lenny Clarke and

1376
01:21:48,741 --> 01:21:53,330
we're all on the same fee. We can watch
them rehearse so we could watch like,

1377
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:57,170
and I would watch the rehearsals
and lyric. It was such a Dick.

1378
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,520
He would yell at all the other actors
and fucking see that, oh my God,

1379
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:04,280
he was a dick.
I used to watch him yell at Lenny.

1380
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,560
And Lenny is a big fucking guy and Lenny
is a guy who's been in a lot of fights.

1381
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,240
He's done his share of below and he
will punch you in your fucking face.

1382
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:18,190
But he didn't because he was on the show
with this guy and he's like pictogram

1383
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,680
an episode. I tell him, John
fucking relaxed. You're on TV.

1384
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,630
Why are you so fucking
stressed? You know? Yeah.

1385
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,970
But I would watch him yell at the cast
or throw his fucking script and get all

1386
01:22:28,971 --> 01:22:31,670
pissed off. And you know
that. And that happens on set.

1387
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:35,770
It just as people get all fucking tents
that work together all the time and it's

1388
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,440
so much stress involved and sometimes
people blow off at each other. Yeah,

1389
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:39,801
well,

1390
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:43,670
and you're getting paid so much money
that you start to internalize that what

1391
01:22:43,671 --> 01:22:45,620
you're doing is actually that important.

1392
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,540
Like the money really shouldn't be
that high for what you're doing.

1393
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:54,440
And so you start to feel like you really
should be giving more and it should be

1394
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:57,560
better. And it's still a sitcom.
It's not supposed to be any better.

1395
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:02,400
Well it's also, it was the John Leora cat
show. So it's his show had his name on,

1396
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:06,070
he was on what it was at night before
that. This is after or it, right. Yup.

1397
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,620
Yup.
How many seasons did that go Brian?

1398
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:13,060
I would say only three cause
I barely remember it would
say only three Google it.

1399
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:17,110
But then my more, what
is it, indication decade.

1400
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:18,640
I bet it went to syndication.

1401
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:22,120
I would guarantee you did at least four
and Nightcore he had the kind of Gig

1402
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:26,560
where he just showed up, nailed a couple
scenes and went home. Yeah. For 10 years.

1403
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:31,600
Yeah. Um, but it's one of those shows that
was on TV when, when news radio was on,

1404
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:35,740
it was like a big show and no
one talks about, it's weird.
Right? How many seasons?

1405
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:41,020
Four went from 93 to 96.
Yep. So four seasons.

1406
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:45,010
Yeah. Probably do a hundred episodes.
Yup. I think that's what they did.

1407
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:49,090
And then they got out, banged out 25 a
year. Well I think isn't the magic number.

1408
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:50,530
100,
that's when they can syndicate.

1409
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,520
That's why news radio never really got
to a hundred those like our joke is that

1410
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:58,750
we never, we never quite made it. You
didn't get to a hundred oh we got some 98.

1411
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,410
Oh that's hilarious. Yeah, but
it's syndicated anyway. Right.

1412
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,150
So like they didn't need
a hundred syndicated,

1413
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:06,790
but it was an inside joke
with us that like Yep,

1414
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,850
that's us fucking never quite made it.

1415
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:14,710
Dallas short became famous
after it was off the air.

1416
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:19,330
That's when it really became famous. I
mean it, it became famous when Phil died,

1417
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,900
you know, but before Phil died, uh,

1418
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,320
it wasn't like a hit show cause
we moved around nine times.

1419
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,130
That's a real number.
Your time slot nine times over five years.

1420
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,890
And this is pre internet.
That's right. I remember that.

1421
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:37,120
You know when you all over the place
where it was and any bad ones like Friday

1422
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:39,880
night we got terrible ones.
I don't remember where it was.

1423
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,300
I remember it was there was Monday for
awhile and there was Tuesday and I think

1424
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:45,220
Sunday,
but we never got Thursday.

1425
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:48,640
Thursday was like the big night we were
on Thursday once we were like number two

1426
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:51,070
and I was like friends and then
us and we were like, oh my God,

1427
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:53,320
this could happen every week. But
it never happened again. Yeah,

1428
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:59,550
it's with the spot, the sign,
the sign, um, or the um,

1429
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,830
time slot that you're in is so
important. Time slots, everything.

1430
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:07,990
And like there was a lot of shows that
would be like friends Seinfeld and that

1431
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:09,610
show would be in the middle,
you know?

1432
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:12,350
And they would call it the shit
sandwich spot. That's what Paul said,

1433
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,040
just to call up because it's
like these amazing shows.

1434
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:17,560
And then in between these amazing
shows would be like sex in the city.

1435
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:22,360
Different roles. Jonathan Silverman.
Yeah. That show the single side guy.

1436
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:26,140
And those shows would be unwatchable
but they would be sandwiched in between

1437
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:29,890
genius shows and so everybody would watch
them. So everybody wanted those slots.

1438
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:33,400
Well I think they launched third rock in
that spot too, didn't they? I don't know.

1439
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:36,190
I don't remember. I think they might
have launched it there and then take,

1440
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,950
cause that's their goal is that's the,
that's where,

1441
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:40,300
that's where they plant the seed.

1442
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,300
They let it grow and then they
transplanted hopefully to a Tuesday or a

1443
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:44,280
Wednesday.
Right.

1444
01:25:44,281 --> 01:25:47,500
That becomes an anchor for other shows
and they can do that now way better

1445
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:51,610
because people can alert people to, at
the time slots changed. But back then,

1446
01:25:51,611 --> 01:25:55,120
no one knew what the fuck was going on.
And once you had TV guide, you know,

1447
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:59,350
you didn't know when the time slot
was, so we'd moved slots. Also,

1448
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:01,810
you're taking advantage of the delete in,
you know,

1449
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:04,880
they're just going to Thursday night
must see TV people put it on at eight

1450
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:06,920
o'clock and they turned
it off at 10 o'clock yeah.

1451
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,520
And it was a tradition for some strange
reason, like a Thursday night tradition,

1452
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,520
mostly because there was
great shows like Seinfeld,

1453
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:16,530
I think cheers was the Thursday
night show. Yes, originally. Right.

1454
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,270
So it's always been traditionally
their spot. There's a great book,

1455
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,610
Warren Littlefield Road
called top of the rock.

1456
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,020
That's the history of Thursday night.
Must See TV. He talks about just,

1457
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:30,680
I mean you realize how
random things happen.

1458
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:34,280
Like the casting of friends could
have gone eight different ways.

1459
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:36,770
Literally you have is
people test for a show.

1460
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,920
So you've got three or four actors
going in for role in one day.

1461
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:43,460
And the fact that they picked Jennifer
Aniston, the fact that they picked,

1462
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:47,510
you know, they nailed that cast. It was
exact. I mean I was never into the show.

1463
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:52,130
I never got it. But it is
apparently a very perfect balanced,

1464
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:55,920
you know, ensemble cast. Yo, they
nailed it. They nailed the casting.

1465
01:26:56,990 --> 01:27:01,550
But the book tells you about how many
ways things could have blown over

1466
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:04,640
contracts, what the reality
is. If they did it differently,

1467
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,780
it probably still would have worked.

1468
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,360
They would have found some
other talented people.

1469
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:10,140
Maybe not a matter of those are the
only gyms they could have. Fine.

1470
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,440
There's so many God damn talented
people that never get the chance.

1471
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,980
That's the craziest thing about
acting is that you don't have like,

1472
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:19,430
there's no recourse. Like if they
don't choose you, tough shit.

1473
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,120
There's nothing else. It's like
a comic. You're undeniable.

1474
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,270
You go up at the Improv and destroy than
someone who's got a sitcom deal goes on

1475
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:29,990
after that and sucks their own dick.
There's nothing anybody could say.

1476
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:33,680
It's like you can't deny that Greg for was
this funny. You just saw it. It's over.

1477
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:38,450
He proved it. But if you're an
actor, good luck. Good fucking luck.

1478
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:40,490
That's why they're so facetious.
That's twice.

1479
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:45,110
There's so like there's so much
fakeness in the way they behave.

1480
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:49,670
That's why there's so much
anxiety in the actor community.

1481
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:53,850
Like their entire Gig is dependent
upon someone else's approval. Yeah.

1482
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,520
When you meet Sitcom actress,

1483
01:27:55,521 --> 01:28:00,440
there's so positive and they so try to
make a connection with you and be your

1484
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,410
friend and you always walk away
going, wow, that's a really good guy.

1485
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,970
And then you realize that mother
Fucker, he's working, he's working.

1486
01:28:06,971 --> 01:28:08,780
If they have to work it,
if they don't work,

1487
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,590
if there's any hint whatsoever
that you might be difficult,

1488
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,720
they will move on to step two.

1489
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:19,610
Who's the other guy brewing I'm in and
the other guy comes in, he give it to him,

1490
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:24,140
you know it happens and cast. And then
once you make it, then they trust you.

1491
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,420
I mean, you look at the
people. Exactly. You know,

1492
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:29,840
you look at Kelsey grammar
or Julia Louise Dreyfus.

1493
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:32,960
Like some people they just go
put them back in the camp fail.

1494
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:36,020
It's just the writing's
bad. Yeah. Yeah. This I,

1495
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:40,610
you know Ray Romano was the original guy
on my gig. Right, and news radio. Yeah.

1496
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,670
They fired him during
the taping of the pilot.

1497
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:48,830
So like this guy just doesn't
connect with America. Yeah. Leaves,

1498
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,790
it goes off to do a giant
way more successful Sitcom.

1499
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:55,550
Everybody loves Raymond in the title.

1500
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:58,070
Not only are you wrong in firing him,

1501
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:02,610
but in the title it says everybody
loves Raymond. Like you don't,

1502
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:06,750
you didn't think that people liked him.
No. You're so wrong. He was so good.

1503
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,740
He literally walked away from the job.
How often does that happen? Where they go,

1504
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,940
we're only going to do 10 and I think
they talked him into 11 and then they

1505
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:19,470
walked away like still with really
strong ratings. You mean seasons?

1506
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,850
I think they did 10 and then they bought
another one. Wow. He did 11 seasons.

1507
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,630
I think so.
Check it out Brian.

1508
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,900
How much money is involved and own our
own show and being on 11th and a show

1509
01:29:30,901 --> 01:29:32,100
that by the way,
still in the air,

1510
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,670
like that's Andrea Frasier or these
other shows that you flip through the

1511
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:39,250
channels. You'll find everybody that
was Raymond on all the time. It's still,

1512
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:42,260
I don't know. Does he own it to see you
have some ownership? Yes. Hold on sharp.

1513
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:45,770
Yeah, without a doubt you can't have it.
I don't know about that Raymond show.

1514
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,890
And he was like,

1515
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:50,490
I remember I had a development deal the
same year he did when it was the Raymond

1516
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:54,150
deal and his was minuscule.
I remember almost thinking like,

1517
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,630
oh that's so fucking weird. That guy.
So funny. And like I know it was like a,

1518
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,050
it was like a September development deals,
like the end of the season.

1519
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,900
And he kind of crawled in and he,
he'd been doing Letterman,

1520
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:08,670
so it was a deal with worldwide pants
and then they put them together with Phil

1521
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,830
Rosenthal and it struggled to show strike.
No,

1522
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:14,250
I don't think he had enough juice to get
ownership eventually. I'm sure he did.

1523
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,660
Yeah. Eventually. I'm sure
they renegotiated it. Yeah,
I know he's insanely wealthy.

1524
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:23,040
Nine seasons, nines, nine seasons.
Well, when I was, uh, you know,

1525
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:26,370
I'm good friends with Kevin James
and when I was on news radio,

1526
01:30:26,371 --> 01:30:28,290
it was right when like rain,

1527
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:30,930
I didn't have any tension because it was
actually a guy in between us that got

1528
01:30:30,931 --> 01:30:34,800
hired to do his gig and then that
guy got fired and then I got it.

1529
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:39,810
So it wasn't like I was taken
over race spot, but uh, and Brian,

1530
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,440
I'd always been friends and so we were
eating at Jerry's Deli and it was right

1531
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:47,670
when he got it. I never seen a guy more
obsessed with getting things right.

1532
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:50,790
Like we're all sitting there eating
dinner or lunch or whatever the fuck where

1533
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,560
eating and ray would be like, um,
what if a guy comes in and he's like,

1534
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:56,970
he's going through all of his bits,

1535
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,860
like going through the thing like
he was [inaudible] no, no, no.

1536
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:02,450
The bits like that, we're going
to happen on a sitcom. Oh,

1537
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,780
like he was going through the beats. Like,
is it better or do you know? He's like,

1538
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,410
had all these ideas and he was
just throwing them out like they,

1539
01:31:08,411 --> 01:31:09,900
they couldn't stay in his head.

1540
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,640
He was so obsessed with getting it right
that it was like all day, every day.

1541
01:31:14,641 --> 01:31:15,780
It was on his mind.
You know,

1542
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:20,320
I was working catch a rising star in
Princeton with uh, Tom, uh, Captain Viano,

1543
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,480
Tom Paris. He changed his name to who
was like his wing man basically. Bianco,

1544
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:27,330
right. Count to Bianco. Yeah.
Isn't that how you say it? Yeah,

1545
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:30,270
he's like a photographer and he
was a writer on Ray. But anyway,

1546
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:33,270
he came down and ray was,

1547
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:37,620
Tom was opening for me and ray was taking
the train from New York to Princeton

1548
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,900
to keep working on the pilot
with Tom. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1549
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:47,490
He works hard. Ben. He works well. He's
obsessive. Yeah. He funny, funny, funny.

1550
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:50,490
I just played golf at this club that
he belongs to and I told me like,

1551
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:54,790
ray Ya little obsessive out
here. Yeah. With Golf. Yeah.

1552
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:58,230
Well Kevin to him and Kevin, everybody
knows she maniacs with golf. Really?

1553
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:02,470
Kevin Plays Golf. Good. Yeah, I just
saw it last night. His brother, he,

1554
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:06,370
he hurt his shoulder playing golf.
Didn't Gary did carry Valentine. Yeah,

1555
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:09,700
just going crazy. He hit a shot out
of the rough was thick, rough. Any,

1556
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,760
I guess the club got caught and he
ripped his fucking shoulder heart.

1557
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:15,340
That can happen, Huh? Yeah.
I would imagine, you know,

1558
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,160
if you hit something really hard and
all a sudden it stops. Right? Right.

1559
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:23,020
Shoulder is a tough one. Man Shoulder
has a, it's a weird joint. Unlike a knee,

1560
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,800
like a knee,
they can fix pretty good because knees,

1561
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,320
it's fairly simple cause it only
hinges, you know, it goes up and down,

1562
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:33,850
but shoulder has all this articulation
and movement and you'd have to apply

1563
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:38,320
pressure in 360 degrees in any given time.
You're pushing up back forward.

1564
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,050
I had shoulder surgery a
couple of years ago. Did you?

1565
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:43,780
Well all the ligaments had worn
out and you know, we're, we're,

1566
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:45,230
the clavicle comes together with it.

1567
01:32:45,231 --> 01:32:48,220
There's three bones that
come together right here.

1568
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:53,740
And so they went in and they, they sawed,
they went in two spots arthroscopically.

1569
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:58,300
They saw down each of the three bones a
little bit and it creates space and then

1570
01:32:58,301 --> 01:33:02,050
it causes, um, uh, tissue,
what do you call scar tissue,

1571
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,100
which acts like a ligament. And
now my arm fucking 100%. Why?

1572
01:33:06,101 --> 01:33:10,990
I couldn't even lift it. And it was just,
I wore it out just from, did you tear it?

1573
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,520
No. It was the life life of throwing
objects and being a, being a boy,

1574
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:19,850
throwing things into big one man's
shoulder surgery for football players that

1575
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:23,760
are quarterbacks and also for baseball
players. That's super common, man. Yeah.

1576
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:27,400
There's something about throwing that's
just a lot of stress on the body. Yeah.

1577
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:31,120
The good thing about boxing and uh,
those kinds of workouts as,

1578
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:33,880
especially if you hit a bag,
you're hitting something.

1579
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,060
So even though there's like
resistance at the end of it,

1580
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:41,470
you're hitting something. So it's
not like the, the snap of like,

1581
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:45,580
like missing things, right? The rowing
thing, when you try to grow things,

1582
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:49,390
this is like experience sending and
you're starting behind yourself. Boxing.

1583
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,450
Your hands are in front of you.
So you're,

1584
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,450
you've got your bio bodyweight behind
everything you're dealing. Yeah.

1585
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:56,590
And when you hit something
like the workout,

1586
01:33:56,591 --> 01:33:59,500
like if anybody wants a great workout,
get a God damn bag.

1587
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,070
Get a heavy bag of you've got a garage
or a basement or something where we can

1588
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:06,820
hang it or, or someplace that has
a bag that could work out it. Man.

1589
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:10,030
It just fucking set your phone down
and time yourself for three minutes.

1590
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:14,230
Go Hammer that fucker. Even if you have
shit technique, just keep hitting it.

1591
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,890
Hit that fucker.
Three minutes.

1592
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:20,530
You'll be amazed at how exhausted you
are and then how good you feel after you

1593
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:24,010
feel so bad. I know. And it also,
you can do it if you're married,

1594
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:28,350
just hit your wife.
No Bray Craig,

1595
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:32,110
you've, I mean you need to
marry a heavy girl. You don't,

1596
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:35,800
if you use like a buck 10 she's
one punch your workouts. So yeah,

1597
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:39,250
you want like a one 50 with a good chin,
good stout chin.

1598
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,650
Make some strong babies
and some anger issues.

1599
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:46,651
So she pushes back this weekend I got
to drive a dodge challenger Hellcat.

1600
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,420
That is going to be your next car. Really
told me that you wanted to get, yeah.

1601
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,050
Going to want to get a challenger.
Yeah.

1602
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,650
You're lucky you didn't get the old
challenges cause they're kinda shit boxes

1603
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,070
but nailed it now.

1604
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:02,360
Oh my God. Oh my God. Big as
the engine car. Oh nothing.

1605
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:03,920
Just 707 horsepower.

1606
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:08,720
Is that the biggest reduction and the
most powerful muscle car ever built?

1607
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:13,190
Whoa. Exactly. Women will
never understand this. Greg,

1608
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,200
I knew that you were
going to be here today,

1609
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,140
so I was happy while I was driving it
that I'm going to get to talk to Greg

1610
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:21,750
about this. What did it feel like?
This is what this is driving it.

1611
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:25,910
Do you get cut and cut to way
towards the end of this video?

1612
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:28,700
That was the beginning of it cuts away
towards the end when he's driving it

1613
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:31,420
because for the first like 20 minutes
they just talk. It's pretty cool.

1614
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:34,500
Did you punch it coming out of a turn?
Yeah.

1615
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,850
Are the wheels do we beat the
shit out of this thing? Sorry,

1616
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,730
dodge SRT only in good ways. We
just stomped on the gas a lot. Okay.

1617
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,550
It was just a fun man

1618
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,153
dots.

1619
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,630
Well it's automatic that one is,
but they sell on a stick to,

1620
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,473
you can buy an a stick.

1621
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,090
You want to stick that visibility looks
better to my prom with the challenge and

1622
01:35:54,091 --> 01:35:55,150
was always the visibility.

1623
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:59,350
It's kind of funky out of the
passenger side when you looking back,

1624
01:35:59,351 --> 01:36:03,670
that right corner is a little funky
but whatever. Let's just start at,

1625
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,991
it's not that much.

1626
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:08,140
It's like for $60,000 and I'm
telling you which is a lot of money,

1627
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:12,640
but for that car for 707 horsepower and
the biggest production engine out there

1628
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:16,270
and you're getting it for less than, it's
so comfortable. That's what's fucked up.

1629
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:17,140
Like these cars,

1630
01:36:17,141 --> 01:36:20,140
like they figured out how to make the
suspensions and the seats and everything

1631
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:24,400
where it's, it's like a Cadillac. I
swear to God, Dude, you'll be blown away.

1632
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,950
I didn't even put it like
there's modes you can put it in.

1633
01:36:26,951 --> 01:36:29,170
You can put it in like track mode.
I didn't put it on track,

1634
01:36:29,171 --> 01:36:31,300
but look how awesome that Dan is.
Awesome.

1635
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:35,710
Play that sound so you could hear it
when he's doing that because it sounds so

1636
01:36:35,711 --> 01:36:37,420
fucking good

1637
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:42,330
for dodge. This is how cats, that
code name of the engine, right?

1638
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,740
This is not even doing it justice
because he's inside of it with the camera

1639
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:48,770
because we liked the name so much about
it and it was so fitting for the car.

1640
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,850
Right? Right. Little bounce
on the back end. Dude.

1641
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:57,620
It's so smooth. Drive it. It's
so comfortable because it's huge.

1642
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:02,570
It's 4,000 pounds. It's not like
a little car. It's a Mustang.

1643
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,160
This is designed to ruin the earth.
Okay.

1644
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:10,520
You're supposed to take part and ruining
the earth with a smile on your face and

1645
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:15,320
a fucking glass of Chivas Regal and your
hand smoking that Dunhill stomping on

1646
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:20,130
the gas and you can see the tsunami
behind you as you out run it. Ah,

1647
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,130
knowing you caused it.

1648
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,550
Whoa.

1649
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,950
Who's that dude?
That's what it sounds like.

1650
01:37:28,951 --> 01:37:33,951
[inaudible]

1651
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:35,890
Jesus Christ.

1652
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,890
Dude, listen to these things
for you. Crack them to the roof.

1653
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:42,990
That's just the wind.

1654
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:47,570
That's because they put a camera
on the outside. Go crowd. Yeah,

1655
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:52,370
the wind noises off on those things.
But the sound that it actually makes,

1656
01:37:52,371 --> 01:37:56,220
there's one video where it says a
Hellcat challenger where it's just

1657
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:00,410
exhaust. It's so it's, it literally
raises your testosterone. Yeah.

1658
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,030
I had this guy in Gad Saad, he's a, uh,

1659
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,720
what is his easily some super intelligent,

1660
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,440
sophisticated phd type character.
I forget what his degree is in,

1661
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:14,390
but he was talking about, that's
me on it. Sexy as fuck. Fun.

1662
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:19,350
Sexy as fuck. Wow. That has been
photoshopped on the underground,

1663
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,530
on mixed martial arts.com
to the point of no return.

1664
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:27,210
Every possible. I can't imagine what
they would do to it. Every foot out,

1665
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,710
every possible gay scenario.
That is beautiful.

1666
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:34,200
It's a beautiful car.
How it looks good.

1667
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:40,410
My point is find that a challenger sound,

1668
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:43,920
the sound actually
raises your testosterone,

1669
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:47,510
like literally raises your
testosterone brother in law.

1670
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:52,410
He bought two kind of junked up dot
Shah 73 dodge challengers. And he just,

1671
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:53,190
he's a,

1672
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:57,250
he's a motor head and he put them
together and made this beautiful folks are

1673
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,660
[inaudible]

1674
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:07,560
is that growl? Like I'm like,
I'm lying. Sounds so good dude.

1675
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:11,600
[inaudible]

1676
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:16,170
that's an American car that you
can buy and I'm telling you the,

1677
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:19,650
the car when you're driving it,
you're like, this is so nice.

1678
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,000
But the inside of it is like comfortable.
It's, it's got like all I'll can Tara,

1679
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:28,440
which is like that artificial
suede everywhere. It feels
good. The dash is great.

1680
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:30,810
It's a fucking incredible car.
It's so,

1681
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:35,040
I'm so happy that they finally started
making like real American muscle cars

1682
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:38,280
again. Cause for the lungs tried
for a while and they were just like,

1683
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:41,370
you guys are fucking missing it.
Yeah. And then like five years ago,

1684
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:45,630
they just went back to the original plans.
That's all we wanted.

1685
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:49,020
Big engine, lots of power, lots
of snacks in the body shape.

1686
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,560
They went back to the original.
Ah, that's the only one.

1687
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:56,640
There's one with Eddie Bravo behind me.
These smacking me in the head.

1688
01:39:56,670 --> 01:40:00,750
It's hilarious. So
funny. Uh, that's great.

1689
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:05,460
I love those things. Fucking photoshops
or some back in the day, man,

1690
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:08,220
people would get really upset if other
people made fun of him like that.

1691
01:40:08,221 --> 01:40:12,750
But I don't, I don't get that. I think
it's funny, like people get mad, like,

1692
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,450
do they hate you? They're mad at you.
Like, no, they're not mad at you.

1693
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,890
They're making fun. Like, you
can't be made fun of. Does
it change you as a person?

1694
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:23,970
Like you don't think that's funny. Kimbo
slice banging me over the side of a car.

1695
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:28,560
That's hilarious. Yeah. I just had
a, you know, French Stewart? No,

1696
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:31,710
he was from third rock from the sun.
He was the kid. He squinted. Oh,

1697
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:35,730
I saw that show. Anyway, he
was, he was heavily parodied.

1698
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,990
He was telling me about like when he was
at his top likes SNL was parroting of

1699
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:44,830
Jimmy Fallon, like, uh, south of ours.
John Lithgow show, right? Yeah, yeah,

1700
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:47,010
yeah.
Exception kid and uh,

1701
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:52,020
and south park udo regularly redeem them
for being a horrible actor and all that.

1702
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,070
And he's like, he's like, honestly,

1703
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,970
I fucking loved it. He goes, it really
made me feel like I had made it.

1704
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:02,730
That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. I'm
American Dad and nailed me once.

1705
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:04,890
No Shit. And I was on fear factor. Yeah.

1706
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:07,770
I pulled up like drinking a beer
in a car and I was looking for

1707
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:09,123
prison.

1708
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:13,770
I pulled up in a car drinking and then,
uh,

1709
01:41:13,771 --> 01:41:18,510
I met Seth Macfarlane and I did
his other show. I did, um, um,

1710
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:22,710
Cleveland show? No, the uh, the, the, the,
the, the American debt. No, the other one,

1711
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,960
family guy, family guy.
I did family guy. I did,

1712
01:41:24,961 --> 01:41:28,230
I played me on family guy like did my
own voice. I'm sure that we got once,

1713
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:32,790
but it funny. He's a nice guy, man.
Seth Mcfarlane's are very friendly,

1714
01:41:32,791 --> 01:41:37,410
like Smiley Guy, you know, it was
cool as fuck Judd Apatow. Yeah,

1715
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:39,420
jot appetite was at the
Improv of the night.

1716
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,240
He's just hanging out with us
like everybody else. Right.

1717
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:45,810
It was me and him and
Dalea and um, and, and, um,

1718
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,640
Jeffrey's Jim Jefferies were
hanging out over by the,

1719
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:51,240
the hallway by where the bathroom is
because there's no fucking green room.

1720
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,910
And the Hollywood Improv,
which is the most ridiculous thing ever.

1721
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,280
Like Leah was like,
like there's no green room.

1722
01:41:56,281 --> 01:41:58,650
Like nobody thinks about the fact
that no green room. I was like, yeah,

1723
01:41:58,651 --> 01:42:01,200
if we were in Pittsburgh, we'd
be like, fuck this place. Yeah.

1724
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:02,820
But because it's in town,

1725
01:42:02,821 --> 01:42:05,490
we'll just accept the fact that there's
nowhere to stand in between shows.

1726
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,800
But Jen hepatologist hanging
out with everybody else.

1727
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:08,291
Yeah.

1728
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:12,460
He came on my podcast one time and then
I went on about six months ago and I

1729
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:16,600
talked about how I thought girls was a
really bad shell and I didn't realize

1730
01:42:16,601 --> 01:42:18,310
that he created it. Oh. And then,

1731
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,740
and the truth is that only
seen like five minutes.

1732
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,720
But I just saw like all I saw is
hipsters and I was like, I fucking,

1733
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:28,750
I hate hipsters.
And so I just immediately judged the show.

1734
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:30,250
I've talked shit about it.

1735
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:35,330
So then somebody of course tweets
out to me and Judd, hey Jed,

1736
01:42:35,331 --> 01:42:38,590
how do you feel like Greg Fitzsimmons
saying your show is Eddie said war that

1737
01:42:38,650 --> 01:42:41,350
overstated would,
I said like said it's our Shit Ya.

1738
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:46,000
And so then Judd replied to him, that's
a lie. Greg Fitzsimmons is a, you know,

1739
01:42:46,001 --> 01:42:49,450
a funny guy and he gets it and he's
a friend and he would never say that.

1740
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:52,900
So then I emailed him
like, dude, I'm so sorry.

1741
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:56,200
I honestly haven't even seen the
shell had even though you created it.

1742
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:01,210
And he gave me like a giant free pass.
And so I went off and I watched it.

1743
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,550
And honestly not,
not shitting you.

1744
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:06,160
I watched the first season and
it's actually a really good show.

1745
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:09,700
So you don't like upstairs
I jumped the gun. I can add

1746
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:13,050
stress either, but they're great fodder
there. Great fodder. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

1747
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:16,490
if you were going to do a sitcom and
you didn't have a hipster head today,

1748
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,080
you're not thinking straight.
Right?

1749
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,830
Hipster would be like one of the
perfect people to fuck with. Yeah.

1750
01:43:21,831 --> 01:43:25,670
It's like the Yuppies of the eighties
even better because they take themselves

1751
01:43:25,671 --> 01:43:29,930
way seriously and part of their shtick
about being a hipster is you're too cool

1752
01:43:29,931 --> 01:43:33,650
for everything. Yeah. Yeah. You're cool
too. Cool. I'm over it. I'm so over this.

1753
01:43:33,651 --> 01:43:34,500
I'm so over that.

1754
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:37,650
Not Allowed to get excited about
everything and you have to keep moving on

1755
01:43:37,651 --> 01:43:39,360
because if it's not in here,
hipster,

1756
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:42,710
the ultimate hipster who is so crazy,
Nicu Sif,

1757
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,870
when he was on the podcast
showed no hipster whatsoever.

1758
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:48,390
He's a normal cool dude
who happens to be a comic.

1759
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:52,070
You need to follow his Twitter because
he has like things. He shows you how to

1760
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,700
wash your jeans and like and like
with like toothbrushes and shit.

1761
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,380
That doesn't make him a hipster.
How's that make him a hitman?

1762
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:03,350
Sharon bought these jeans where you
don't ever wash them. What? Yeah.

1763
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:06,920
I think those are names through
genes. Genes. We don't ever watch. No.

1764
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:09,660
I swear to God jeans a dirty
bitch. Nope. This a certain type.

1765
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:13,100
They're made of a material that's
supposed to like mold to your body so you

1766
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:17,930
never wash it. Fuck Outta here. That's
ridiculous. It's just someone's fiction.

1767
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,680
He talks about in his podcast. Yeah, but
they the person who created those genes,

1768
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:26,150
that's their fiction. Yes. No, it's
close. You fucking dirty bitch.

1769
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,860
If you get funky and close,

1770
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:31,010
what are the clothes magically have a
little cleaning robots that run around

1771
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:34,360
inside your Dick. Clean out where
you're farting into your fucking pants.

1772
01:44:34,361 --> 01:44:37,610
Levis though. Levi jeans. Oh No, no, no.

1773
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,760
See they're saying not to wash your jeans.
That's what I'm saying.

1774
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:42,530
You don't have to wash it.
That's what they're saying.

1775
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:44,000
That you wear it like a jacket.
No,

1776
01:44:44,001 --> 01:44:46,480
you don't wash your jacket there so you
don't have to wash your jeans. Yeah,

1777
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:50,270
I sweat. Okay. I sweat all the time.
You're not doing carriage. Get Old.

1778
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:54,540
Steamy my legs, everything. My I,
my body cools itself. Well, yeah,

1779
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:57,830
I get shit done and my jeans
get wet and I'm not wearing wet,

1780
01:44:57,831 --> 01:45:01,750
smelly ammonia stinking genes because my,

1781
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:06,410
my sweats gone through them and then
it's dried out and it's got this faint

1782
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,830
whiff of funk. Fuck that.
Once I find a pair of pants,

1783
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:11,900
they're going on a lot of trends over,

1784
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,320
especially five yogurt
in the morning leave.

1785
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:17,870
I says that you should just freeze
your genes instead of washing.

1786
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:20,930
Oh to kill bacteria. They're
disgusting. They're disgusting.

1787
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:23,510
They not understand that we
have washing machines now.

1788
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:26,630
We're not living in the year fucking
1910 when you had to do that shit with a

1789
01:45:26,631 --> 01:45:30,480
rock and a fucking a flat board.
Remember those washboards? Yeah.

1790
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:35,180
Freezer. Yeah. Honey. Why is this?
Turkey tastes like someone's ball.

1791
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,100
I do admit I don't wash my jeans
as much as regular clothes though.

1792
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:44,390
I would say I'd say like maybe I'll
wear them like 10 times. That's a lot,

1793
01:45:44,391 --> 01:45:46,280
but I'm comfortable with
wearing them for a weekend.

1794
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:50,090
I'll wear the same jeans two days in a
row. No problem. Like if I go on the road,

1795
01:45:50,091 --> 01:45:52,400
if I don't feel like packing a lot of
shit, I'll throw in one pair of jeans.

1796
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:56,210
I'll throw on a backup pair just in
case the shit hits the fan because my

1797
01:45:56,211 --> 01:45:59,030
fucking bridge troll body
doesn't fit normal jeans.

1798
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:02,620
I have to get specific genes
relate me. Yeah. I can't wear like,

1799
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:07,200
like Levi's five on ones don't.
It's too big. You're your leg.

1800
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,790
They won't, that won't go over
past my knees above the knee.

1801
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:13,160
And then it hits the troll part of me.
Yeah.

1802
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,950
He tried to sweat pants or the stretchy
jeans that, but that looks too sexy. Let,

1803
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:19,160
I'm trying too hard. Yeah,
because you've got to think.

1804
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:21,340
My ass sticks out a lot in the thighs,

1805
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:24,830
so my dick will be much more smushed
in there. I'd be looking to give up,

1806
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:26,500
trying to get everybody
to at my deck on a set.

1807
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,650
I want to see that on the hood of a
charger. But you do, I got into today I'm,

1808
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:32,180
I'm back to the original jeans.

1809
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:37,181
The fucking lightweight
faded does that lady's jeans.

1810
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:40,010
I went back to button. These
are Lucky's. Lucky's fit me.

1811
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:43,120
Lucky's for whatever reason,
lucky jeans, they make them now.

1812
01:46:43,121 --> 01:46:46,690
There are more with Louis. Yeah. Lucky's
or Lou. Yeah. More a flight. So Lou,

1813
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:50,040
fuck you don't know.
As long as we

1814
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,160
all know, we looked good and once
that's a terrible fucking Photoshop.

1815
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:56,340
Some people's Photoshop skills
are just awful. They're awful.

1816
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:58,410
Everything's out of perspective is
three different people in there.

1817
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:02,700
They use parts from
got to learn how to manipulate images.

1818
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:06,270
Kids that challenging needs to
be your car, Craig for Semans.

1819
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,670
We're not getting any younger.
Yeah, I did. Back to that.

1820
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:10,710
If you're not going to
get that and get a Camaro,

1821
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:15,100
they have the new Zl one z 28 there's
two new cars they have standard.

1822
01:47:15,101 --> 01:47:17,490
Do you get them to the manual just
like that? That comes with a manual,

1823
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,100
but they sound fucking fantastic and
there was a particular sleep and t,

1824
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,240
that's another good one. That's the one
she going to get one. I'm getting at.

1825
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:29,330
Although newspapers at $45,000 and it's
fucking 420 horsepower trading that

1826
01:47:30,601 --> 01:47:34,950
Prius or the ones that if you got a,
they don't have the 2015 is out yet,

1827
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:39,330
but if you've got a 2014 the
2014 it's a fucking great car.

1828
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,351
It's a great car.

1829
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:42,690
It's loud as shit and you could
probably get a really good deal at them.

1830
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:46,260
They have 400 plus horsepower. They
have that coyote engine. It's a,

1831
01:47:46,261 --> 01:47:50,310
it's a fucking fire for here.
Is that just gt baseline one a gt?

1832
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:54,450
It's not expensive as far as like
what you get bang for your buck.

1833
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:59,040
You can't do any better than a Mustang
gt. It's a Goddamn fast car. The old cars,

1834
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:04,041
like in the 1970s like when a challenger
came out like the 1970 challenger 1970

1835
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:08,670
71 those cars were ridiculous.
It was 440 horsepower.

1836
01:48:08,671 --> 01:48:12,450
No one seen anything like that
with death defying fucking brakes.

1837
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:15,960
The brakes were retarded.
They were awful drum brakes in the rear.

1838
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,340
You stomped on the gas, the whole car
went sideways. No traction control,

1839
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,193
no nothing.

1840
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:24,780
Just a regular base Mustang
gt will bury that car,

1841
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:29,760
burry it and be able to corner and have
antilock brakes be able to corner and

1842
01:48:29,761 --> 01:48:33,570
then they have the other one like
the Laguna Saker Mustang Dude.

1843
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:37,260
It's a great fucking car.
The Lucid Laguna Seca Mustang.

1844
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,180
It's like the month they
had a three o two boss,

1845
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:43,410
which is a really good version of the
Mustang as well. It's like for twentyish,

1846
01:48:43,411 --> 01:48:46,680
somewhere around horsepower
and it's a great handling car.

1847
01:48:46,681 --> 01:48:49,260
Then they took it to the next level
with this Laguna Seca Mustang.

1848
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,090
It was like 40 grand,
40 grand,

1849
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:55,440
and it beats an m three around a fucking
race track. It's incredible. I mean it's,

1850
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,420
yeah,
it's chintzy inside a little bit.

1851
01:48:57,421 --> 01:49:01,440
This is like plastic shit here and
plastic shit there. But seats feel good.

1852
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,580
Sounds great. Massive balls,
you know, as far as like a car,

1853
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,280
they'll be honest with that. Like,
what are you driving that car for?

1854
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,260
You driving that car for the fun of it.

1855
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:13,950
Like that's the fun to hear the rumble
and the engine to feel the acceleration

1856
01:49:13,951 --> 01:49:16,740
when you stomp on the gas or shift
your gears, have a good time.

1857
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,930
What do you give a fuck what
it looks like? You know,

1858
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:21,750
that's not what this car is about now.
Not about the valet parking.

1859
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:22,710
I'm about the uh,

1860
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:25,680
the four oh five at two in the morning
when it's why I'm come back to the ice

1861
01:49:25,681 --> 01:49:28,480
house and it's fucking late going
up Laurel Canyon on the way.

1862
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:32,280
The improv coming over down to Melrose on

1863
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:35,820
pulling up to a red
light and Beverly hills.

1864
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:39,610
And there's some young age and blame the
next car and you eyeball them and with

1865
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:41,300
that was you have to be,
see,

1866
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,680
why can't it be a black guy? Let's go
weird. Pull up that Laguna Seca Mustang

1867
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,430
that I don't think there Megan is anymore.
It's a,

1868
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:54,220
you're probably still find some of them
that are on lots that they haven't sold

1869
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:57,220
yet because what about the,
oh, that's ridiculous. Car.

1870
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:00,460
I had one of those gt 500 convertible.

1871
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:05,110
The problem with the convertible doors
or feels like you could die. Yeah.

1872
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:10,030
Any moment. There's nothing above your
hand. Look at that car. Oh, the car is,

1873
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:14,590
I believe somewhere around 420 horsepower
and unbelievably fast around Natural

1874
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:17,560
Laguna. Yeah, it's like 40 grand and
those wheels is standard with it. Yeah.

1875
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:22,540
That's what it looks like. Yeah. It's a
fun and Gar man. He could be a man again.

1876
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:26,680
You could be a man again, Gregory. I
remember what it was like. I had hair,

1877
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:29,500
but it's fun. You don't need the
hair. No, it's not coming back.

1878
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:31,930
You don't need the hair shaved.
The rest of it be a light bulb.

1879
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:35,700
But be a light bulb and a
fucking fun con and joy. Yeah.

1880
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:38,560
Maybe you can take to wearing crazy
sunglasses like Elton John did.

1881
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:41,980
Or maybe I wear the wigs like
a Phil Spector, Phil Spector.

1882
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,240
Imagine if we started doing that.

1883
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:50,050
You and I just started wearing wigs and
all of our shows and never addressing,

1884
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,170
never address it. No, no jokes
about it. And people ask questions.

1885
01:50:53,171 --> 01:50:56,110
You Act like what you're
saying is everywhere you go,

1886
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:58,870
it's like everyday it's different.
Not only that,

1887
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:03,570
sometimes we wear bald caps with hair on
the side of the size of the class. Yeah.

1888
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:10,750
Mohawks. One day. Sometimes it's
an Afro. Yeah. Never bring it up.

1889
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:14,710
Trade and trade them out with each other.
Sometimes it's like Farrah Fawcett,

1890
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:19,160
like Farrah Fawcett in the 70s you got
like little curls and shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1891
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:24,220
Mullets mullets all kinds of weeks.
Just never work for guys.

1892
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,020
I used to date a chick
who had a shaved head.

1893
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:28,090
She shaved her head so long time ago.

1894
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:30,910
It was like early nineties she
shaved her head and wore wigs.

1895
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:34,870
She's from another country. She's a
singer. She was just very eccentric. Yeah.

1896
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:35,950
But she,
uh,

1897
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:39,460
she would fucking rock a different wig
and like sometimes she would like show up

1898
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:42,640
at the comedy store and I wouldn't even
know it was her, you know, I was like, oh,

1899
01:51:42,641 --> 01:51:45,400
hey,
this is when I had first moved to La.

1900
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:48,310
So I didn't really know how
wacky people got. Hmm. You know,

1901
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:52,000
I hadn't been around that many wacky
folks. This chick was, uh, you know,

1902
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:57,040
someone who came to Hollywood with the
sincere purpose of becoming even wackier,

1903
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,800
you know, famous. Yeah.
It didn't work out,

1904
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:03,750
but just talented check but crazy.
Yeah. She wore wigs. There's though,

1905
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:04,743
yeah,

1906
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:10,543
Eddie Bravo

1907
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:11,640
spanking me.

1908
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:15,180
I can't tell him he's hitting me in the
head or that you would like Bruce Willis.

1909
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,460
I think he's getting both the
ass in the head. Crack, crack,

1910
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:22,880
crack the u g that's the underground.
Um,

1911
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:24,920
when people wore wigs,
I mean cars,

1912
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:28,200
when you think about like the
divorce belt comics, you know,

1913
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:31,590
like Freddy Roman and these guys,
they slapped that little glue,

1914
01:52:31,591 --> 01:52:34,530
slap that shit on,
head to the Gig through on the Tuxedo,

1915
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,280
put on a nice edge piece. And then during
the day, nothing. They're working out.

1916
01:52:38,281 --> 01:52:41,580
Bald headed then work out
now? No, at the fryer.

1917
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:44,130
Some of these guys worked out because
they had heart attacks and they, yeah,

1918
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:45,590
they had like a,
they had a stair master.

1919
01:52:45,591 --> 01:52:47,240
I think you've had an
ashtray on the side of it,

1920
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:50,600
but you're talking about like
late in their life. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1921
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:53,540
Well I'm talking about like when
they were like touring the Catskills,

1922
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:56,360
there was no working out,
but then were wigs were wigs,

1923
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:59,320
lem glow around the top
runner run the pay line.

1924
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,110
Then how did you want a pain in the ass?
That would be,

1925
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:05,270
could you see the photos of Mickey Rourke
with a wig now? Oh my God. So hilarious.

1926
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:06,540
Like you were Rourke.

1927
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:10,100
Where's a hairpiece now and it's the
most ridiculous hairpiece of all time.

1928
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:13,250
And he was wearing in New York and
they got these photos of him. It's,

1929
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:17,690
it's so crazy. It's almost like easily is
he being silly? Like, cause he trolling.

1930
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:20,390
But then you see him when he was
on like the Jimmy Kimmel show,

1931
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:25,490
he had the hairpiece like quaffed and it
looked pretty good. But it's, it's crazy.

1932
01:53:25,491 --> 01:53:28,340
He's like, he's like 60 something years
old. Just like shave your fucking head.

1933
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:31,560
It would be funny like to do a one
hour special. This look at his head.

1934
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:36,500
Oh dear God, dear God. And this
is like a shower cap. Yeah.

1935
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:38,360
And this is not even the worst photo.

1936
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,540
There's this even worse
photos of it dreaded.

1937
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:43,460
It doesn't make any cause
it's coming out of nowhere.

1938
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:46,130
It's a wig and it doesn't match
the hair that's underneath.

1939
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:48,590
Well it's always the
side here by their ears.

1940
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:52,820
When you see like little like land
flimsy side here by their ear.

1941
01:53:52,821 --> 01:53:56,720
But then the top is this fucking lush
Maine. It doesn't make any sense.

1942
01:53:56,721 --> 01:53:58,280
Like think for my next one hour special,

1943
01:53:58,281 --> 01:54:02,990
I'm going to shave my head and get a
silly wig and just wear it. Why not?

1944
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,010
Why not? How about um, like a big red one,

1945
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:10,190
like a big carrot top style. What
does that, is that a different wig?

1946
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,490
That's a different one.
Who's got to keep having fun?

1947
01:54:13,491 --> 01:54:17,390
Look at the guy on the right hand corner.
He's jealous. Smells like dead wig.

1948
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:21,860
The WIG is beautiful. Mickey. Let me
tell you, making God is my witness.

1949
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:24,890
That wig looks so real.
That is so realistic.

1950
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:27,940
No one knows if they tell you
they know that fucking assholes.

1951
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:31,550
Did you good at Irvy in the Bronx?
Where did you get that piece? My piece.

1952
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:34,420
I looked like there's a skunk
asleep on my head. But this,

1953
01:54:34,421 --> 01:54:37,790
there's other ones of the gray one.
That's the Brown one. He's got a gray one.

1954
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:41,060
The gray, the gray ones. The most
ridiculous cause it's like, wait a minute.

1955
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:44,870
What's going on here? How did you get
all that gray hair? Look at it. There's,

1956
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:48,440
that's a good one. Oh, it's so crazy.

1957
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:51,620
Plus he to work on his face. Right?
It's far ahead. Got Pumped up.

1958
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:55,070
Maybe it looks better now than it
looked in the past. Quite honestly.

1959
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:59,330
He used to have chin or cheek
implants. Yeah, and when the fighter,

1960
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:02,060
you really saw it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1961
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:04,760
His face was kind of funds
that the movie with a,

1962
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:08,690
when he was a professional wrestler,
like past his prime. Oh, the wrestler,

1963
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:13,130
the wrestler. The fighter was the
market mark, right? Yeah. But that, uh,

1964
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:16,730
he actually, his face looks at
least like a normal older guy. Now,

1965
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:20,300
there was one point in time where you
had these crazy cheek implants put in his

1966
01:55:20,301 --> 01:55:24,230
face. His whole face was just puffy.
It looked like he got stung by bees.

1967
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:27,320
So see if you can find those pictures.
Mickey Rourke cheek implants.

1968
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:31,460
How many people watch this as
they're listening to the podcast?

1969
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:34,970
Less weight. Less like, it's
90% of them just listen.

1970
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,030
But a lot of times folks have like,
we'll say something like this,

1971
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:39,860
they'll write it down, let
go, and then they'll like,

1972
01:55:39,861 --> 01:55:42,980
text me or tweet me or something
later. Like, what the fuck?

1973
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:46,320
I just saw Mickey Royce hair takes
a lot. Dick, now I can sleep.

1974
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,730
But the like I hear you guys talking
about and I had a look but he um,

1975
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,190
it's like,
uh,

1976
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:55,770
that's something that happens to a
lot of those people that are like,

1977
01:55:56,070 --> 01:56:00,320
they're sort of like separated
from rational thinking.

1978
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:02,780
They get this body dysmorphia
thing going on, you know,

1979
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:08,550
there's been pictures of them like there
is like that's post a face stretching,

1980
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:12,750
but there's ones like the one
that you just crossed over Brian,

1981
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,930
the one with the red shirt. Little lower
than that. That's yeah, right there.

1982
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:20,340
That looks like he's got the
cheek implants in place. Cat.

1983
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:22,380
Good look any west.
Who when he was young even remember that?

1984
01:56:22,381 --> 01:56:24,330
What was the pope of
Greenwich Village Diner.

1985
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:28,860
That's like nine and a half weeks
ago. Yeah. Oh Man. Yeah. You can't,

1986
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:32,460
but like that thing that happens when
you pull your face back like that,

1987
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,390
you can't do that. Like that's
not better. It's not better.

1988
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:40,860
That's knows you did it. You looked
like a burn victim. You look weird,

1989
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:41,880
you're shiny,

1990
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:45,780
your face all stretched out and it
shows that you care way too much.

1991
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:49,380
Like it's not getting better. It's
just getting different. It's screen.

1992
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:52,530
It's like you're screaming. I can't
handle that. I'm getting older.

1993
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:56,370
I'm panicking like there's some shit
that you could do that actually does make

1994
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:57,061
you look better.

1995
01:56:57,061 --> 01:57:00,860
Like I guess if you have a ridiculous
knows and you get that bitch trimmed down,

1996
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:04,500
you're happy with a good for you,
but that's a slippery slope man.

1997
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:07,620
You don't see big noses like
he used to. Very rare. Nope.

1998
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:12,250
Nobody keeps a managed [inaudible] gals.
A lot of 17th birthday presence.

1999
01:57:14,050 --> 01:57:16,290
She, I was in high school.
Girl did it turned,

2000
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:19,500
changed her fucking look so radically,

2001
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,950
but she kind of over did it. I'm
like, she had a, she had this, she,

2002
01:57:23,951 --> 01:57:28,230
the poor girl was a beautiful girl with
a crazy knows and she got a crazy knows,

2003
01:57:28,231 --> 01:57:30,160
trimmed down and she looked beautiful,

2004
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:34,950
but the nose had liked that ski slope
thing going on and that little smashed

2005
01:57:34,951 --> 01:57:37,530
front, there's a little bit of
a flat part in the middle of it.

2006
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:38,370
They went too hard,

2007
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:42,330
like they needed to just leave
on just like a millimeter more,

2008
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:47,520
be a little bit big, a little bit
just yeah, it matched her face better,

2009
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,160
but it was like obvious
that something's going on.

2010
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:51,240
Like if you're looking at her face,

2011
01:57:51,241 --> 01:57:53,890
you couldn't help but notice that
something went on with her nose. Yeah.

2012
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:58,110
And then a lot of times those days those
things collapse like they don't and

2013
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:00,270
they have to build them back up.
And when they do that,

2014
01:58:00,271 --> 01:58:01,740
then you can run into complications.

2015
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,550
Sometimes they have to use a piece of
your cartilage from your ribs to recreate

2016
01:58:05,551 --> 01:58:07,560
the cartilage inside your nose.
God,

2017
01:58:07,561 --> 01:58:10,350
I wonder how many no's Jab
that you could find out.

2018
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:13,410
There's gotta be a number of nose jobs
that are performed every year and you

2019
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:16,870
could figure out what percentage of the
population that's Bruce Jenner before he

2020
01:58:16,871 --> 01:58:21,420
became a woman though he's different
now. He grew up in my town, Bruce Jenner.

2021
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:25,260
Terry got long nails
now and long manicure.

2022
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:28,020
There was some talk about him being
preop that he might go for it.

2023
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:32,730
It looks like he's going for it. If I had
to get, I mean, I don't like to gossip.

2024
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:33,630
Yes,
I do.

2025
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:37,950
I don't like to gossip too much about
someone that looks like they're troubled,

2026
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:41,590
but he looks like he's troubled. It
doesn't look like he's going for a look.

2027
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,510
It looks like something's going on,

2028
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:46,150
like what's going on and he's
living with the Kardashians.

2029
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:50,140
That's obviously terrible for
you. Yeah, that's gotta be toxic.

2030
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:54,880
I'd rather live in Chernobyl than live
in that house and tried to keep my sanity

2031
01:58:54,881 --> 01:58:58,660
with cameras on. So you can't
even be bitchy to them. Yeah.

2032
01:58:58,661 --> 01:59:01,420
I think if I lived in Chernobyl,

2033
01:59:01,421 --> 01:59:03,820
I could wear some sort of
suit that would protect me.

2034
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:07,280
That's not a suit that protects you
from dopes. Like if sharing the house,

2035
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,193
those dummies,

2036
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:11,290
your skin would look better too if
you lived in Chernobyl in his does,

2037
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:15,220
but not only that, the strategy of
just constantly seeking attention,

2038
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:20,020
like there's like, okay, that's
weird. Wow, that's weird.

2039
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,560
That's Photoshop. Nope, no, no.

2040
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:27,760
That's not just a guy who's kind of
out of shape who's older. No, that's,

2041
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:28,623
that's weird.

2042
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:32,170
And there's another one recently with
it shows his nails like it shows like he

2043
01:59:32,171 --> 01:59:36,370
has long nails all sudden no matter how.
No matter what you started with,

2044
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:40,540
once you've gotten the third facial
surgery, it all ends at Michael Jackson.

2045
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:44,230
It can. He looks like Michael
Jackson in that picture. Well,

2046
01:59:44,231 --> 01:59:47,950
body dysmorphia is real shit man.
You know it's real shit.

2047
01:59:47,951 --> 01:59:51,040
Like there's his nails that long though.
Minds about that long.

2048
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:55,650
So they're not please, unless
you're a pain. I've seen
the longer than that. Yeah.

2049
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:01,210
Either way. The guy looks like he's
troubled. There is a guy, you know,

2050
02:00:01,211 --> 02:00:04,450
you think about famous people
that are kind of enigma is like,

2051
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:08,470
he didn't do anything except the
76 Olympics. He won the decathlon.

2052
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:13,630
He is a, you know, before the Kardashians,
people in America knew Bruce Jenner.

2053
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:17,410
The only thing you did was a Wheaties
box and the decathlon. That's crazy.

2054
02:00:17,411 --> 02:00:21,220
That was fucking 40 years
ago. It is crazy. Yeah.

2055
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:24,010
That's real when you put it
that way. Yeah, you're right.

2056
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:26,230
And then you've got people
that like John Larroquette,

2057
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:30,220
he could walk into a fucking mall and
nobody would know who the dude was. True.

2058
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:34,750
But the only reason why he still like
the only reason why he's still famous is

2059
02:00:34,751 --> 02:00:37,390
because of the Kardashians, but
it's fact. But prior to that,

2060
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:40,930
he was in the national consciousness.
People who knew who Bruce Jenner was,

2061
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:44,980
he as a, maybe as a
subject, maybe as a name,

2062
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,850
but not as someone you recognize. Yeah.
I don't think you would recognize him.

2063
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:52,780
I think his resurgence is entirely
based on living with all these attention

2064
02:00:52,781 --> 02:00:54,590
whores. Yep. That's what it's all about.

2065
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:58,480
the 70s had those kinds of stars
that yet evil Knievel who, you know,

2066
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,990
there had never been a stunt man
before. That's true. He was the first,

2067
02:01:01,991 --> 02:01:06,520
he was like, you know what, Bob Marley is
to reggae? Like he's the only reggae guy.

2068
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:10,150
Anybody ever gave a fuck about
or ever will Jimmy cliff. Yeah.

2069
02:01:10,151 --> 02:01:14,350
He was in the band though. That's
true. But basically, you know,

2070
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:16,480
you've got jackass and all
those guys, so that, that's,

2071
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:20,710
that's the first time there's been
stunted people since. Right. Um,

2072
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:23,500
and then you had, um, you know,

2073
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:28,670
certain comics that were famous from the
70s that were just weird. Like, uh, uh,

2074
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:33,430
what's the name? Tip Toe through the tiny,
Tim was famous as shit. Still famous.

2075
02:01:33,431 --> 02:01:36,700
People still know who tiny Tim is.
True. But that was Letterman, right?

2076
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:40,090
Was it think so. Yeah. I think
on the Letterman show, I think

2077
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,730
they got married on the Letterman show.
Didn't I like in Vegas, him and uh,

2078
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:48,140
whatever her name was.
Miss Miss something. Whoa.

2079
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,620
Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Interesting man.

2080
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:56,990
It's weird how fame you can't predict
who's going to last with fame.

2081
02:01:57,380 --> 02:02:01,250
Um, you know, like of
the Charlie's angels,

2082
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:03,170
you didn't know Farah was going to,

2083
02:02:03,171 --> 02:02:04,910
I guess he kind of knew Pharaoh
was going to be the one,

2084
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:08,570
but you thought the other ones would
be pretty big to Jaclyn Smith. I mean,

2085
02:02:08,571 --> 02:02:11,540
all she did was hair shampoo
commercials for the rest of her life.

2086
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:13,640
She was honest.
Fuck hot as fuck my,

2087
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,110
my kid is watching Charlie's angels reruns
right now. I've watched one yesterday.

2088
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:23,120
Try pulling yourself away. Oh, I could
stare at those chicks all fucking day.

2089
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,320
It's also weird that you're [inaudible].

2090
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:28,940
It's Kinda like when you watch a show like
that, it's not just that, oh you know,

2091
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:33,130
Jaclyn smiths pretty, but it's also
like this is a time capsule. This is,

2092
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:37,610
they've captured this stuff that went
on in the 1970s and you watch it again.

2093
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:40,100
All right. That's weird man.
That's a weird, and their outfits,

2094
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:43,770
I mean talked about the bootleg jeans,
they were aware and the seven,

2095
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:48,560
eight encapsulated seventies
fashion. Yeah, no shit man. You know,

2096
02:02:48,590 --> 02:02:53,590
like a denim denim vests in the feathered
hair and they probably fall in a big

2097
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:59,420
part. We're one of the reasons
why I became so popular.
Right. Why the fashion did,

2098
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:02,150
yeah. I'm sure on those shows, I'm sure.

2099
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,990
Like I guarantee you the dukes of hazard
probably influenced a lot of idiots to

2100
02:03:05,991 --> 02:03:09,770
wear cowboy boots. Daisy Dukes,
definitely daisy daisy. Yeah.

2101
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:15,210
Launched that dude. She might've been
the hottest chick ever on TV. Yeah. Yeah.

2102
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:20,150
See Right. Who Chrissy from? From
fucking three's company. Daisy Duke. No.

2103
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:24,380
How dare you take Chrissy cause
you're broken. You're incisor broaden.

2104
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:28,310
You have to go to a doctor to keep telling
you. Go to a doctor, Chris, he's hot,

2105
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:30,110
but she's not as hot as daisy dukes.

2106
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,850
You know it was pretty
hot even though she's,

2107
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:36,170
but she's older so you can't compare it
to go from an old pick of Catherine Bach.

2108
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:39,860
Fuck, I know what you're going to do,
but I'm the chick from modern family,

2109
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,780
the old Latino woman or
dude, I'll take it. Yeah,

2110
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:49,040
she's only 40 I mean, but she looks like
she's 30 and her tits still look like,

2111
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:52,730
I don't know. You can't fake it. They
have there just some of that cleavage.

2112
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,640
You can push it up, but she doesn't
push it up where it's straining.

2113
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:59,240
It's a little bit of bounce,
a little bit about little jiggle,

2114
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:03,110
but yet there's the, there's Pie.
Their pie shaped perfectly round.

2115
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:07,190
She's stupid hot hand and that
accent puts it right over the top.

2116
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:11,810
She's stupid hot and there's this element
of knowing that this is not going to

2117
02:04:11,811 --> 02:04:15,650
last like what you are as you're looking
at a flower that's been cut and you're

2118
02:04:15,651 --> 02:04:19,010
putting it in the vase and it's just
like something even extra beautiful about

2119
02:04:19,011 --> 02:04:20,840
the fact that it's not even
attached to the root anymore.

2120
02:04:20,841 --> 02:04:23,480
You've got a day to look at it like this.
This is it.

2121
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:26,450
Tomorrow's going to be wilted the day
after that you're gonna want to throw it

2122
02:04:26,451 --> 02:04:30,500
out. But right now he's the hunter
Thomas of hot. Yeah. Yeah. Thompson.

2123
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:36,170
What did I say? Thomas? Jesus Christ.
Okay. You know both of them are hot.

2124
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:40,770
Yeah, but daisy Dukes, dirtier curse.

2125
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:43,920
He's bending over like fuck me in the
ass hole. I'll tell you what, like,

2126
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:47,130
who's done a better job of keeping
it together? Well, both of them,

2127
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:51,900
both of them failed. Oh,
she did the exercise videos.

2128
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:54,890
She can type for a little
tight for a little bit.

2129
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:58,410
Still doing that shampoo commercials.
That's not Jaclyn Smith though.

2130
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:02,080
That's daisy Duke. That's Catholic. Um,

2131
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:06,960
nobody worked at Ferris Nipples
were permanently erect on that show.

2132
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:10,960
You're probably, I used them up before
every scene. I bet they did. Right?

2133
02:05:10,961 --> 02:05:12,720
They take,
these guys would get like pumped up.

2134
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:16,170
Guys would do like pushups and stop before
scenes to pump up their muscles. Yeah,

2135
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:20,000
I guarantee you they did
that. They went for it. Yeah.

2136
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:23,370
That was everything and that was what
you were selling. If you're selling it,

2137
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:26,070
you're selling cars where you leave
them dirty or what'd you Polish them?

2138
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:28,890
He got a polish the car. You got to
polish the car. You're selling cars,

2139
02:05:28,891 --> 02:05:31,590
you're selling tickets. What are you
doing? Get that ice cube out, honey. Yeah,

2140
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:36,330
I'm on the headlights now. We sell the
story. Nobody's watching it for the story.

2141
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:40,920
That's a, when she died, man, that was
one of those things where it's like, wow,

2142
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:43,770
wow,
Farrah faucets dead.

2143
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:48,380
That was just hard to wrap my head around
because when I was a kid, she was aunt.

2144
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:51,390
It was it. Everybody had a Farrah
Fawcett poster on their wall.

2145
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:55,950
Every girl did and it was that one poster
of her like smiling and she had the

2146
02:05:55,951 --> 02:05:57,480
feathered hair and everything like that.

2147
02:05:57,481 --> 02:05:59,730
Like she influenced a whole
generation of where that here,

2148
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:05,300
it's gotta be the quintessential
poster in American of all time.

2149
02:06:05,341 --> 02:06:08,790
Probably most famous posters ever.
Yeah. Yeah. That's it right there.

2150
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:12,180
Look at her on rail and the nipple.
You can't see that's not high def.

2151
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:15,900
So you can't see the nipple,
but the nipple is very proudly display it.

2152
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:16,940
And this semester,
yeah,

2153
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:20,850
many of the photos of the nipple
rock and she was so pretty. Yeah.

2154
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:24,660
She was like one of the first
television bombshell types, right?

2155
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:29,640
Uh, yeah. I mean my favorite was,
you know what, I take it back.

2156
02:06:29,641 --> 02:06:32,820
My favorite was wonder woman. Old
Wonder woman. Oh, Linda Carter.

2157
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:39,390
Lynda Carter's. Tough to look
at now. Yeah. Not that she
looks at Lynda Carter was,

2158
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:44,180
there you go. There it is. Oh
Shit. Look at that. Nibble.

2159
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,750
Yeah. Linda Carter. I mean
she doesn't look terrible,
but she's an older woman now.

2160
02:06:48,751 --> 02:06:51,630
It's just when you remember how beautiful
she was when she was wonder woman,

2161
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:56,490
I wish they would die.
I don't want to say it ruins it.

2162
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,230
You know what's fucked though, man? Like,

2163
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:03,060
it's weird when you go back and watch
like Batman or any of those old school

2164
02:07:03,120 --> 02:07:06,740
like superheroes. No one
worked out. No one worked out.

2165
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:10,620
A lot of belly. You look at Catherine
Bach there. She didn't work out.

2166
02:07:10,850 --> 02:07:12,930
Look at her legs.
Felt like all mushy and shit.

2167
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:17,190
Everybody was all mushy and sloppy.
They were good for a couple of decades.

2168
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,970
John Wayne,
whoa.

2169
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:22,470
Beer belly and shit
with little skinny arms

2170
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:29,550
to get the badge for the gap. Look at
the legs, the size of her thighs. Dude,

2171
02:07:29,551 --> 02:07:33,570
her fucking body. That is, she was an
athlete. She was in an Olympic athlete,

2172
02:07:33,571 --> 02:07:36,280
I believe. Oh my God, she's hot.

2173
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:40,380
Let's all agree. She's the hottest
she is. Yeah, I think she is not.

2174
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:43,960
It was the hottest. Oh, wait a minute.

2175
02:07:43,961 --> 02:07:48,580
We're forgetting a major contender.
Who? Barbara Eden. I dream of Jeannie.

2176
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:54,070
She wins. She wins. She wins. Yeah.
She wins one and she's subservient.

2177
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:57,430
She'll we want it was
beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.

2178
02:07:57,431 --> 02:08:01,660
There's a comic on long island that fucked
her. Yeah. Yeah. Late in life though,

2179
02:08:01,661 --> 02:08:04,360
right? They didn't lie, but he can
say he did it. She was still hot.

2180
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:06,970
It doesn't matter how old she
was, but she would like, you know,

2181
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:11,370
fucking find a guy, pick them out and
going, come on, let's do this. Yeah.

2182
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:13,990
Well she knew she could, you know,
she was got damn Barbara Eden.

2183
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:18,430
I know somebody who had said late in life,
I should say. Allegedly. Yeah. Well this,

2184
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,010
I know somebody who allegedly had no,
I know that we definitely had sex.

2185
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:24,730
I'll very late in life.
Real a hospital bed. Like

2186
02:08:26,350 --> 02:08:30,640
actually I'll say winter
woman. I don't think I like,
that's a horrible pose. Yeah,

2187
02:08:30,650 --> 02:08:35,020
that's fun. It's fun. Another one because
wonder woman, you can find a bad one too,

2188
02:08:35,021 --> 02:08:38,890
I'm sure. But you found a good one.
Uh, you know, also turned me on,

2189
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:42,970
but she wasn't like a few years
before she died. Whoa. Uh,

2190
02:08:43,030 --> 02:08:46,690
who was not bombshell
hot but stole my heart.

2191
02:08:46,691 --> 02:08:50,950
Was Valerie Bertinelli one day
to talk to you anymore? Yeah.

2192
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:53,160
You become a different person
to me. You know, Shit. No,

2193
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:57,400
I don't trust your judge
like that. I mean, cause you
did a moment ago. Now Mike,

2194
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:02,150
Greg's drunk. All right,
look at that fella.

2195
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:05,900
She married Eddie van Halen. How bad could
you be there? I knew about a backside.

2196
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:10,540
It's like ill, no wonder
woman even work out, man.

2197
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:11,600
They didn't work out back then.

2198
02:09:11,601 --> 02:09:13,900
There's gotta be a better
picture of her wonder woman.

2199
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:16,120
I'm sure it had a little bit of, I
don't mind. A little bit of body fat.

2200
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:20,470
I think it's hot. Yeah. I like women
to have like a little softness to them.

2201
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:24,280
I love Kim Kardashian.
I mean I don't like her person or soul,

2202
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:27,340
but I love that body.
Her body is fantastic.

2203
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:31,690
Within the harass is fat or
real or as real fat, whatever.

2204
02:09:31,691 --> 02:09:34,570
It is ridiculous.
Like if you don't get excited about that,

2205
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:39,100
your Dick stop working right now. You're,
you're a, you're a closeted homosexual.

2206
02:09:39,101 --> 02:09:41,980
If that's not working for
you. Dick's just sad. Yeah.

2207
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:45,010
Dick doesn't want full pleasure,
Dixon. No, I'm just wanting to,

2208
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:46,660
skinny girl cuts me with her hips.

2209
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:51,610
Like a guy who buys a Prius when
he wants a Mustang, a Mustang,

2210
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:54,850
or get this challenger. Now,
if I'm going to do what?

2211
02:09:54,851 --> 02:09:58,450
It's going to be the Mustang because
I had a fetish for mustangs as a kid.

2212
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:02,260
I still do. I think I need the fact
that it's the 40th anniversary.

2213
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:04,510
It's Kinda 50th anniversary.
It's pretty cool. Well,

2214
02:10:04,511 --> 02:10:07,240
the new one's going to have independent
rear suspension was going to make a big

2215
02:10:07,241 --> 02:10:11,290
difference in the way it handles the
2015 yeah, there'll be out pretty soon.

2216
02:10:11,291 --> 02:10:14,080
I think they're out in the fall, which
is, you know, basically right here. God,

2217
02:10:14,081 --> 02:10:18,460
she was so hot. Whoa. Oh, she
was so hot as ridiculous. Yeah.

2218
02:10:18,461 --> 02:10:20,350
Linda Carter might've been
the hottest woman of all time.

2219
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:24,940
She might when she might win. Yeah.
Oh, bitch was hot. Oh, wait a minute.

2220
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:29,020
What's that look is that
she went from modern family.

2221
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:34,020
Oh God. She wins. She
wins. She wins. Everybody

2222
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,853
wins.

2223
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:42,050
There's women that are listening to this
right now. Look, fuck you. Yeah. Well,

2224
02:10:42,051 --> 02:10:44,720
let's talk about,
we talked about Jim Morrison being hot.

2225
02:10:44,721 --> 02:10:48,350
We talked about Joey Lawrence
being hot. Yeah, he was beautiful.

2226
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:52,010
We did a lot for the ladies
on that. Especially since
we don't feel it. You know,

2227
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:56,210
we assume that he's hot, you know, I mean,
I see how you would be attracted to him.

2228
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:58,550
No, no, I totally felt your
energy when he came on.

2229
02:10:58,551 --> 02:11:00,700
So I understood that he was hot zone.

2230
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:05,710
The star Doon Doon Doon Doon
what about Janet Jackson?

2231
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:10,350
Early nineties? No, I playboy cover of
black and white. It's never into that. Oh,

2232
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:15,080
I always found it to be so like
needy. A racial, I need a race.

2233
02:11:15,081 --> 02:11:16,550
Pick a race. Well, I just,

2234
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:21,230
I just want someone who's like a pop
superstars when they're forcing them down

2235
02:11:21,231 --> 02:11:24,380
your throat. They never seem sexy
to me. It always seemed like, oh,

2236
02:11:24,381 --> 02:11:28,730
here's this crazy person.
Right? What's her name? Um,

2237
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:34,220
uh, Miley Cyrus. It's like, oh, they
want you to think she's hot now,

2238
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,791
but you know,

2239
02:11:34,791 --> 02:11:39,680
was pretty spears was a child star and
they forced her out and she was fucking

2240
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:42,980
hot.
But she was hot in a way that like,

2241
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:47,660
like if I saw a bunch of peacocks and
there was a female peacock that was an

2242
02:11:47,661 --> 02:11:51,650
exceptional specimen, I was like, wow,
that's a beautiful peacock is like that.

2243
02:11:51,651 --> 02:11:55,670
It's like to me hot. I mean
I, yes, physically. Yeah.

2244
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:59,970
Undeniable shape and all that very
beautiful button, right? No animals.

2245
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:03,270
Things pulling me towards
that. Everything's pushing
me away from that. Yeah.

2246
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:06,140
That she's danced madness.
It's craziness.

2247
02:12:06,141 --> 02:12:10,940
Like that has to be part of the picture.
It has to be who's the person?

2248
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:14,510
Like can you interact with the person?
It can't just be the way they look.

2249
02:12:14,540 --> 02:12:18,140
The way they look is great. I mean
it's important. It's something,

2250
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:19,070
it gives you a charge,

2251
02:12:19,071 --> 02:12:23,560
but if you know that their personality is
all out of whack, like you're like, Ugh,

2252
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:25,580
it's just to note, I want,
I'm a little out of whack.

2253
02:12:25,581 --> 02:12:27,140
The thing that attracted me as a,

2254
02:12:27,141 --> 02:12:31,460
as an insecure guy when I
was single was a woman I got,

2255
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:36,110
I saw the end,
I saw the dead dad left or you know,

2256
02:12:36,111 --> 02:12:38,780
she's got, she's got like
a unit brow. You find.

2257
02:12:38,781 --> 02:12:41,150
I would find that one thing
and I'd be like, I got a shot.

2258
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:44,810
That would make me so much more attracted.
If a girl was perfect,

2259
02:12:44,811 --> 02:12:48,380
I felt nothing and it wasn't even that.
I didn't think I could get her.

2260
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:50,270
It just made me feel like too much work.

2261
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:53,070
Well also like somebody who's a
little fucked up, they're gonna,

2262
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,800
you're gonna fucking connect with them.

2263
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:58,370
There's going to be up charge between
cause you both need something bad to

2264
02:12:58,371 --> 02:13:01,850
complete yourself. That's a good point.
Yeah. I definitely felt that way.

2265
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:05,090
Like girls had Rick really good
relationships with their family. Like, oh,

2266
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:09,170
I know girls. Like uh, you know, they want
you to go hang out with their parents.

2267
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:13,520
Right. And like, Oh yeah. Not really.
No. Especially if you couldn't relate.

2268
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:17,680
I want a girl who needs help finding her
father that Nicki Minaj is new video.

2269
02:13:17,681 --> 02:13:18,441
Do you see that one?

2270
02:13:18,441 --> 02:13:21,690
That fucking Jamie keeps going on and
on about it won't stop talking about it.

2271
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:23,660
It's so much.
But yeah,

2272
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:27,200
and it's like there's parts where she's
fingering herself in a video and a good

2273
02:13:27,201 --> 02:13:32,170
kid. I love that my kids see this shit,
which is low. Her ass is ridiculous. Yeah,

2274
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:36,600
they're all ass. Everybody's got asked. If
you look at, if you look at Miley Cyrus,

2275
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:37,960
his Twitter avatar that she's,

2276
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:43,710
she put her own version of her album
cover on it and it looks like she has a

2277
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:45,360
great ass too.
Well that's an illusion.

2278
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,880
They're Photoshop the shit out
of that girl weighs 18 pounds.

2279
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:51,660
Just a little stick figure. Yeah,
she's a very boy. Like with her body.

2280
02:13:51,661 --> 02:13:54,540
Like when that thing came out in the
video music awards and she danced around

2281
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:55,620
and rubbed up against that guy.

2282
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,220
You could see like she's very
like [inaudible] or skinny.

2283
02:13:59,221 --> 02:14:03,690
She's like skinny girl Nikki mouth.
She's athletic. It's not supple. Yes.

2284
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:06,060
That girl,
just a fuck house.

2285
02:14:09,150 --> 02:14:10,920
You'll look at her and you're like,
whoa.

2286
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:18,270
I mean that's just fucking,
just come. That's just,

2287
02:14:18,271 --> 02:14:21,870
cause he's backed up like a camel. All
the loads of his shot and in the world.

2288
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:26,640
Yeah.
Calm.

2289
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:31,620
She's all sex cocked with com. Yeah.
Like some girls like they have to,

2290
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:35,430
you know, they have to do something to
look sexy. When a girl is built like that,

2291
02:14:35,431 --> 02:14:38,610
it's like Jesus. And then on top of
that she's doing all the sexy shit.

2292
02:14:38,611 --> 02:14:41,880
Sticking her ass up in the Jennifer
Lopez was like that in her prime.

2293
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:46,160
Isn't it amazing though when we're talking
about like John Wayne and Batman and

2294
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:49,950
all that shit. The difference
between how the women are portrayed,

2295
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:54,750
the difference between how singers
are portrayed, the the music videos,

2296
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:55,440
the photographs,

2297
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:59,820
all that stuff and then go back and
think about like Carly Simon. Yeah.

2298
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:03,210
There was none.
The Carole king and Janis Joplin.

2299
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:05,820
I mean Janice shopping wasn't the
most attractive woman in the world,

2300
02:15:05,821 --> 02:15:08,460
but she was funny man. She
liked, didn't like women.

2301
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:10,740
Like there was an interview
with Janis Joplin. Is that her?

2302
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:15,390
Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus's
version of this. Listen, listen man,

2303
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:19,320
that's fish a shout. That's not her
ass. Yeah, that shit ain't real.

2304
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:24,340
That is real. No, Nicki Minaj
is real, but that's not real.

2305
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:28,680
That's obviously same ass.
Yeah, it's exactly the same.
That said Photoshop. Yeah,

2306
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:33,090
look, exactly. See the crease on the
top of the thigh is exactly the same.

2307
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:36,720
The top left thigh. Don't ever go to that
other one again. This is like a cartoon.

2308
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:40,380
You show me a cartoon.
What were we talking about?
We're talking about her ass.

2309
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:42,360
About how for some women they almost,

2310
02:15:42,361 --> 02:15:47,160
it's like they've extracted the blueprint
in the DNA of men of what makes us

2311
02:15:47,161 --> 02:15:50,630
orgasm and they have just
projected it on a body. No,

2312
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:54,620
what I was saying was that you never saw
this from artists in like the seventh.

2313
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:57,810
Right. You never saw this from women
that were like super attractive.

2314
02:15:57,811 --> 02:16:02,150
Like you know, like Linda
Ronstadt, you know, beautiful,
beautiful woman. You know,

2315
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:06,500
when she was young and in her prime,
you'll never saw her in underwear. Nikki,

2316
02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:11,370
uh, um, Fleetwood Mac. Oh,
Stevie nicks. She was big.

2317
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:15,080
She was always like, she was like the
chick from heart got hired. His big,

2318
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:16,680
didn't she get big?
I think she got big,

2319
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:20,340
but not when they were in there playing
when she was young and Jelic but she was

2320
02:16:20,341 --> 02:16:23,550
wearing flowing shit.
She was never showing her body.

2321
02:16:23,590 --> 02:16:27,210
Was a woman from heart big in the
beginning or did she get she and Wilson?

2322
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:30,760
She started small and then she got bigger.
There's Anne and Nancy Wilson.

2323
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:34,450
One of them married, uh,
uh, the famous director.

2324
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:37,300
The guy who did a dazed and confused.

2325
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:41,610
Who's that? I don't remember that.
That's the, the the blond one. Who's

2326
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:43,090
the blonde one?
Yeah.

2327
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:48,690
Yeah, but she, uh, Ann Wilson could
sing or fucking hell. Yeah. Right.

2328
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:52,510
Carnie Wilson was a different one. Those
Wilson Phillips does different animal.

2329
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,680
Totally different animals. She got big
tits. She looked like a carny. Yeah.

2330
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:56,890
There was like Carney had like,

2331
02:16:56,891 --> 02:16:59,920
her sister was like super skinny and
she was like really big and it was like

2332
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:02,830
baffling.
Didn't she do like a talk show for awhile?

2333
02:17:03,410 --> 02:17:06,170
Well, I think she was, wasn't she? The
daughter of the Mamas and the Papas?

2334
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:09,080
Yes. Can't be a good time. No.

2335
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:12,510
Can't be a good guy growing up in
that fucking crazy household now.

2336
02:17:12,570 --> 02:17:16,980
But I'm that fucking Ann
Wilson from heart. Yeah.

2337
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:21,460
What a voice. She lost all that weight.
Good for her. That's what happened. Right.

2338
02:17:21,461 --> 02:17:23,920
She lost all the weight and then she
did a talk show or something like that.

2339
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:28,720
Does that Nancy or an does the
big one? That Carney. Okay.

2340
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:33,760
Yeah. Good for her. Did she have to get
like stomach thing? Yeah, I think so.

2341
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,630
That's a, it's a weird
thing man. You know. Um,

2342
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:40,950
I was talking to a friend who had
that done. She had it done like, uh,

2343
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:44,020
20 years ago and she was saying that,
um,

2344
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:47,740
it's not just that like that does
make you lose weight. She goes,

2345
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:49,750
but to keep it off,
like you got to go to counseling,

2346
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,680
like whatever it is that made you overeat
like that, you've got to address that.

2347
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:55,060
You got to get on top of that.

2348
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:57,320
No, I know a guy who's been
drinking hard his whole life,

2349
02:17:57,321 --> 02:18:01,010
he just went to get a shot to stop
drinking. It's like, you know,

2350
02:18:01,011 --> 02:18:03,740
that may make you averse to alcohol.

2351
02:18:03,890 --> 02:18:05,660
Your body is going to
go find something else.

2352
02:18:05,661 --> 02:18:09,530
You've got to deal with why you're
drinking. Oh, shot to stop drinking. Yeah.

2353
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:11,340
I didn't even know the hand that,
what does it do and I didn't,

2354
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:14,960
all I know is he said he was going
to his appointment to get it famous.

2355
02:18:14,961 --> 02:18:17,210
A famous guy, she's like, peppermints not,

2356
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:20,980
I should start saying these famous
names should start or shouldn't.

2357
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:23,810
You should start saying eh,
unless they be you.

2358
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:28,280
Would you want anybody saying that your
story in this case? No, probably right.

2359
02:18:28,610 --> 02:18:32,510
I'm the opposite of a name dropper.
That's a sad thing man. It's a same thing.

2360
02:18:32,511 --> 02:18:35,750
That fucking monster that eats at your
soul that you can't let go the killing

2361
02:18:35,751 --> 02:18:37,910
you and the longer you do it,

2362
02:18:37,911 --> 02:18:41,600
the harder it gets because the more
you think that it's really part of you,

2363
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:46,040
you know and quitting something. I can
tell you firsthand. It's the most freeing,

2364
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:49,730
empowering thing in the world because you
think this thing that was sapping your

2365
02:18:49,731 --> 02:18:52,100
energy that you believe was
built in your foundation,

2366
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:56,750
you get freed of it and you all a sudden
like you take a giant chunk of low self

2367
02:18:56,751 --> 02:18:58,340
esteem and just lop it off.

2368
02:18:58,570 --> 02:18:58,811
Yeah.

2369
02:18:58,811 --> 02:19:03,400
I've met a month a bunch of dudes that
used to be junkies and now or like super

2370
02:19:03,401 --> 02:19:07,870
hyper athletes, like a lot of, a lot of
competitive guys like in the UFC. Even,

2371
02:19:07,871 --> 02:19:11,890
there's a few guys in the UFC that were
junkies and then they became like Matt

2372
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:11,891
Brown,

2373
02:19:11,891 --> 02:19:14,860
one of the top welterweight contender
is part of his whole story is he died.

2374
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:18,460
He had an overdose and fucking
died and came back from it. Yeah.

2375
02:19:18,470 --> 02:19:22,340
Does she five dumb and now he's a monster.
Destroys people.

2376
02:19:22,370 --> 02:19:23,930
He's like one of the
top guys in the world.

2377
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:28,550
Alice Cooper's like a pro golfer
now is he? He plays that good. Yeah.

2378
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,800
Wow.
He doesn't live in Arizona.

2379
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,030
Arizona plays at the Biltmore Hotel
in Phoenix. There's a famous course,

2380
02:19:35,031 --> 02:19:38,390
their replays. That's hilarious. What
does he do with his time? Just plays golf.

2381
02:19:38,391 --> 02:19:42,330
I did a benefit there
with, uh, with uh, um, uh,

2382
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:43,740
Gary Valentine and uh,

2383
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:47,420
he came out and he played
school's out for summer and 18.

2384
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:51,260
All his hits songs with the full makeup
on the whole thing in this fucking for a

2385
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:56,320
fridge charity for like 200 people
did it full on and gave 100%.

2386
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:01,970
Wow. And then hung out and talk to people
afterwards and then played in the golf

2387
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:05,150
tournament all weekend. Took
his makeup though. Yeah,

2388
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:10,220
he's a, he's like a conservative.
Yes. Isn't that interesting?

2389
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:12,920
I don't think he could live in that
part of the world if you weren't.

2390
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:15,860
You can't Scottsdale like
that. Phoenix, Scottsdale.

2391
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:21,020
That's hardcore cocaine and conservatism.
Sheriff Joe. Yeah, that's Gerald piles.

2392
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:21,621
Yeah.

2393
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:26,621
That's like fear of Mexicans and then
cocaine all mixed up together and

2394
02:20:27,210 --> 02:20:28,043
sunscreen.

2395
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:31,250
So you get the cocaine from the Mexican
and then you get afraid of him and then

2396
02:20:31,251 --> 02:20:35,300
you get sunscreen just fucking seeping
those chemicals into your skin and some

2397
02:20:35,301 --> 02:20:40,301
sort of a weird way they need to take
a Xanax lay by the pool Wackos fucking

2398
02:20:41,001 --> 02:20:44,060
balls around the grass.
That should not be there by the way.

2399
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:49,010
Especially in a place that has a
massive drought. Right, right. Massive.

2400
02:20:49,011 --> 02:20:50,090
No fucking water.

2401
02:20:50,091 --> 02:20:53,330
And you're talking about a three square
mile piece of real estate and it just,

2402
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:57,950
so that, so that a hundred chief all
can entertain themselves for four hours.

2403
02:20:58,330 --> 02:20:58,490
Yeah.

2404
02:20:58,490 --> 02:21:03,490
When people go like why does it golf
course cross $250 million a year run if it

2405
02:21:03,771 --> 02:21:05,540
does. Yeah. I mean not that much,

2406
02:21:05,541 --> 02:21:07,700
but like if you get a membership
and a prime country club,

2407
02:21:07,701 --> 02:21:12,380
like you have to pay like
$100,000 $200,000 for some
of those places they don't

2408
02:21:12,381 --> 02:21:14,930
want in any riff Raff, they want to
make sure that you get some money.

2409
02:21:14,990 --> 02:21:16,700
And what they do is it's a right,

2410
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:20,510
the reason they can afford it is because
they call it undeveloped parkland.

2411
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:24,530
And so the environmental standards call
for them in every city and so they're

2412
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:29,450
able to get a full write off because
they call it basically like wild land.

2413
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:30,280
He,

2414
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:35,280
while they're seeming fertilizer and
chemicals into the ground water every day,

2415
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,940
I can't believe that's all they
call it. Undeveloped Parkland, man.

2416
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:44,120
It's just white people paradise.
That's all it is. Yeah.

2417
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:47,630
And when they buy these big memberships,
they, yeah, there's like a bond and yeah,

2418
02:21:47,660 --> 02:21:48,560
there's like half a million.

2419
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:52,250
Donald Trump's got courses where I
bet you it's like $1 million a minute,

2420
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:53,084
some bond,

2421
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:58,090
but you're splitting ownership of the
club with the other maybe 200 members.

2422
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,870
So maybe it's not a million,
half a million,

2423
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:04,310
but then you can sell that bond when you
leave and it could be worth more money.

2424
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:05,121
That's hilarious.

2425
02:22:05,121 --> 02:22:07,880
But it keeps the club from ever
being sold because think about it.

2426
02:22:07,881 --> 02:22:10,520
Riviera country club in fucking Brentwood.

2427
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:14,990
Do you know how much money you would
make in condos if you put condos on that

2428
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:19,400
land and instead you got a hundred
white guys playing golf there one day.

2429
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:23,540
Do the math on that. Yeah, no shit. Right.

2430
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:26,160
This is one place that
I was in the history

2431
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,760
channel office was talking to them about
a show and I was looking out the window

2432
02:22:29,761 --> 02:22:34,170
at this country clubs. It must be Beverly
hills. Beverly Hills Country Club. Yeah.

2433
02:22:34,171 --> 02:22:35,490
I don't know. There's a, there's a,

2434
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,680
there's like two on the
west side that are prima.

2435
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,840
It's the most ridiculous thing ever.

2436
02:22:39,841 --> 02:22:44,640
Cause you're looking at hundreds of
acres in the prime of Beverly Hills.

2437
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:47,610
When you looking out this window and
you're like, how much is that worth?

2438
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:51,630
Like that spot right out
there might be worth billions.

2439
02:22:51,870 --> 02:22:56,520
It might be worth a couple billion
dollars. Think about it. One Green is,

2440
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:59,100
you know, 5,000 square feet.
That's enough to put a house.

2441
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:04,280
You know what the land on the land with
a tear down a house in Beverly Hills is

2442
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:09,570
one point $5 million.
Times that by a green,

2443
02:23:09,571 --> 02:23:13,350
there's baby, that amount of
space for 20 of those on a whole,

2444
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:16,950
that's 20 million a hall a
whole times 18 holes. Oh my God.

2445
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:21,630
That's like a half a billion dollars.
Oh my God. And it's right there.

2446
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:25,430
It's right there. And it's using up
insane amounts of water. There was a,

2447
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:29,220
I think it was a vice article.
What? I don't know who put it up,

2448
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:33,090
but it was about like, if we really
are taking this drought seriously,

2449
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:37,020
we need to band golf courses. Like
everyone's saying, don't wash your car.

2450
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:39,000
Fuck you.
How about golf courses?

2451
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:43,050
Like let's look at what a golf courses
like what you're talking about is insane.

2452
02:23:43,051 --> 02:23:47,910
You're using up more. There
was some fucking statistic
like the, I'll pull it up.

2453
02:23:48,180 --> 02:23:51,960
Um, uh, band golf calls of
course, as I better come. So the,

2454
02:23:51,961 --> 02:23:56,961
there's some statistic about what the
amount of just in California alone,

2455
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:01,890
California and Florida are like the number
one spots for golf courses in Arizona,

2456
02:24:01,891 --> 02:24:06,150
Arizona right there too. But um, it's,

2457
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:10,730
it's an incredible, China has
a golf course van. I saw a,

2458
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:14,790
an article about how many of those courses
because they overexpanded when guy,

2459
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:16,010
when tiger woods came along,

2460
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:20,820
golf got so big they were building
courses everywhere and then when he got

2461
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:23,730
caught with the waffle house waitress,
it all went away.

2462
02:24:23,731 --> 02:24:27,900
And there are hundreds of courses around
the country and they just showed photos,

2463
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:28,980
weeds,

2464
02:24:29,430 --> 02:24:34,020
chest high weeds growing all over the
entire course to just abandoned. Wow.

2465
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:34,651
This is the,

2466
02:24:34,651 --> 02:24:39,370
it is a vice article and it said instead
of killing lawns we should be banning

2467
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:42,890
golf. Cause it's telling people
not to water their lawn. Yeah.

2468
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:44,100
This is what they're saying.
This is,

2469
02:24:44,101 --> 02:24:47,250
this is the statistics cause
it's pretty fucking crazy.

2470
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:52,520
The average golf course uses
312,000 gallons of water.

2471
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:56,910
How often? A day doesn't say
hold on family for, okay.

2472
02:24:56,910 --> 02:25:01,470
The average American family of four use.
Oh per day. Ready for this? Yeah, per day.

2473
02:25:01,650 --> 02:25:05,880
The average American family of four
uses 400 gallons of water a day.

2474
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:11,030
The average golf course uses 300
to 312,000 gallons of water a day.

2475
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:13,531
Okay.

2476
02:25:13,531 --> 02:25:18,531
So each golf course uses as much water
as 780 families of four in palm springs

2477
02:25:20,131 --> 02:25:23,040
immediately adjacent to a
place called the palm desert.

2478
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:26,530
That NPR reported that each of the cities,

2479
02:25:26,531 --> 02:25:31,120
57 courses uses about a
million gallons a day,

2480
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:33,730
a million gallons a day.

2481
02:25:33,731 --> 02:25:37,170
Can you go back to the numbers of
people that are actually using it? Yeah,

2482
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,370
it's insane. It's, it's my newt.

2483
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:44,580
So it's the same amount of
water as 2,500 families of,

2484
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:50,200
for every one in palm springs
because palm springs is not a spring.

2485
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:51,303
It's fucking desert.

2486
02:25:51,310 --> 02:25:54,160
It's got to get the water from
California or from the Colorado River.

2487
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:58,720
We steal it from them. And that's the
reason why that whole salt and sea exists.

2488
02:25:59,130 --> 02:26:04,000
You know, the Salton Sea, which is this
gigantic inland sea that is in, um,

2489
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:08,920
the, the areas near the palm desert. Why
is it a c? Well, that's what's crazy.

2490
02:26:08,921 --> 02:26:12,990
It was a c because they flooded the area
with the Colorado River back in like

2491
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,090
the 50s or some shit like
that a long time ago.

2492
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:19,330
And there's a bunch of great documentaries
on the salt and sea because it's

2493
02:26:19,331 --> 02:26:20,590
totally polluted now.

2494
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:25,800
It's polluted with farm runoff and it
became like super salty and people still

2495
02:26:25,931 --> 02:26:29,770
pull fish out of it and eat it.
And people still live there.

2496
02:26:29,771 --> 02:26:33,460
But it was at one point in time they
used to call it the inland Riviera,

2497
02:26:34,180 --> 02:26:38,110
like it was beautiful.
Like pull up the salt and sea,

2498
02:26:38,111 --> 02:26:41,920
the inland Riviera, like
some videos, Nevada. No, no,

2499
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:46,820
it's California dude. It's, it's a
huge inland sea. It's enormous. Wow.

2500
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:49,980
And if you saw it, you'd be
like, what the fuck is this?

2501
02:26:50,260 --> 02:26:51,790
All that farm country up there.

2502
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:56,530
So it's all just draining all coming down
to palm springs and it's so fucked up

2503
02:26:56,710 --> 02:27:00,880
that there's beaches on the
salt and sea that are all bones.

2504
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:05,080
It's not sand, it's fish bones
where they have these die offs.

2505
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:08,680
These fish die offs of like a
million fish will die off. I mean,

2506
02:27:08,681 --> 02:27:11,500
this is what it looks like now, but
look at it. This is the salt and say,

2507
02:27:11,501 --> 02:27:16,410
this is an inland lake. They created
that huge, let it play a little bit

2508
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,450
like this or this.

2509
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:23,070
I liked the music.
It's called the Salton Sea.

2510
02:27:24,150 --> 02:27:28,470
It's the largest body of
water in California and
it's not even supposed to be

2511
02:27:28,471 --> 02:27:32,070
there
at the turn of the last century.

2512
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:34,530
And engineering's grew
up of epic proportions,

2513
02:27:34,531 --> 02:27:36,870
diverted the Colorado River
into one of the lowest,

2514
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:39,150
hottest planned basins in United States.

2515
02:27:40,350 --> 02:27:43,950
It took two years to stem the tide,
and when the flooding finally stopped,

2516
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:47,040
350 square miles of desert lay underwater,

2517
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:51,930
everyone assumed that giant inland sea
that had created by accident would just

2518
02:27:51,931 --> 02:27:53,790
dry up.
But when it didn't,

2519
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:58,410
real estate developers tried to turn an
ecological disaster into an opportunity.

2520
02:27:58,860 --> 02:28:03,860
[inaudible] new.

2521
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:07,390
I'm glad for the crowd with
millions and big cities. Uh,

2522
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:10,500
palm springs with water areas.
Guys back then,

2523
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:15,450
he's in a boat and he's got a suit and
tie on and Riviera beside the booze.

2524
02:28:15,451 --> 02:28:19,030
All of them to say as the place for
you to take charge of your future,

2525
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:24,530
you can come as you are. They call it
the fish. Enjoy life at the Riviera

2526
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:29,190
[inaudible]

2527
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:31,590
for a while,
it really did seem like a miracle.

2528
02:28:32,310 --> 02:28:35,310
Tourists flock to a place that
had once been unforgiving desert.

2529
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:41,220
People bought homes, built
schools, restaurants, clubs,

2530
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:45,960
but then the sea turned on them.
Over the years,

2531
02:28:45,961 --> 02:28:50,961
it's water fed only by agricultural
runoff became saltier than the ocean.

2532
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:54,870
Botulism poisoning killed millions
of fish in a massive die offs.

2533
02:28:54,871 --> 02:28:58,500
During the height of 120 degrees,
summers made the air almost unbeatable.

2534
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:03,570
Wow. Began to flood
unpredictably. Tourist sled

2535
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:09,380
boomtown's turned into ghost towns.
Millions of dead fish.

2536
02:29:09,790 --> 02:29:12,810
Do you imagine the smell out of
science fiction? Unbelievable.

2537
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:14,540
In the streets.

2538
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:18,140
Every one of the named still waiting
for neighborhoods that never arrived.

2539
02:29:20,030 --> 02:29:22,040
Beaches made not of shell or sand,

2540
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:25,670
but of the polarized skeletons
of uncountable millions of fish

2541
02:29:27,820 --> 02:29:30,460
houses have tumbled
into toxic looking pits.

2542
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:33,670
It's apocalyptic.

2543
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:38,710
Where's the Riviera? I go there to catch
glimpses of what the world really is.

2544
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:41,230
Yeah. This is what our
country is going to look like.

2545
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:44,690
Greg's going dark on us.

2546
02:29:45,150 --> 02:29:47,010
Yeah.
I just read an article about it today.

2547
02:29:47,070 --> 02:29:48,710
They're predicting in
the next hundred years.

2548
02:29:48,711 --> 02:29:52,870
This is a rustic galactic drought
coming. Well, it really, yeah.

2549
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:55,860
This drought that's in California is so
bad that they're saying that can trigger

2550
02:29:56,070 --> 02:30:00,510
earthquakes and so, oh no shit. Yeah.
Drown can trigger earthquakes. Checks out,

2551
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:04,050
so sell.
If California's drought weren't scary,

2552
02:30:04,051 --> 02:30:06,870
I know now it may trigger
earthquake scientists believe.

2553
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:10,650
Well the drought is spooky. It's been
three years. Last year it rained once.

2554
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:12,203
No Shit.

2555
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:14,780
I don't remember it Randy. More than
once. I mean it might've dribbled. Yeah,

2556
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:15,320
a couple of days.

2557
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:17,630
We're supposed to have an El Nino
coming through this year and now they're

2558
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:20,030
saying it's going to be a very
light version of it and we needed,

2559
02:30:20,031 --> 02:30:23,840
we needed a full El Nino. Well, we
need like a year of rain, right?

2560
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:27,660
We need like a Seattle. Well, that
last El Nino was like that too.

2561
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:32,150
Where you hear out here and like
net, was it 92, eight? No. Oh,

2562
02:30:32,151 --> 02:30:36,810
I'm sorry. No, no, no,
no. It was like 97 and uh,

2563
02:30:36,830 --> 02:30:41,250
it fucking rained every day
for like four months. Well,

2564
02:30:41,770 --> 02:30:46,120
me is their spots like death valley.
That's like right there.

2565
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:49,890
It's on the same state.
So right there. Right.

2566
02:30:50,020 --> 02:30:53,380
What makes Death Valley Death Valley?
I don't understand it. I'm not,

2567
02:30:53,860 --> 02:30:58,840
I'm not a geo engineer.
I don't understand the weather patterns.

2568
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:01,960
I mean, it's the hottest place in the
world, right? And it's right there. Yeah.

2569
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:04,340
Why is it right there and why are
we not worried that right there,

2570
02:31:04,341 --> 02:31:08,260
it could be right here if that shit
creeps up north. Like what keeps it from,

2571
02:31:08,261 --> 02:31:11,920
is it the ocean? Like I don't understand
it. Is it, what is it that keeps, well,

2572
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:14,020
there's a lot of spots.
Like how about Ontario?

2573
02:31:14,021 --> 02:31:17,650
Could that be like fucking death
valley someday? What about Breyer?

2574
02:31:17,810 --> 02:31:20,220
That's pretty God damn far from
the ocean that turn into some

2575
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,480
horrible wasteland of that. All your
gigs. That's exactly right. Yeah.

2576
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:28,230
Ontario Improv.
What about Pasadena so far?

2577
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:32,870
Isn't it possible? Yeah. I mean, it
seems to me he said, you see Chinatown,

2578
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:35,550
that movie Chinatown
with a Mickey Rourke now,

2579
02:31:35,551 --> 02:31:37,740
the original one with Jack
Nicklaus. Jack Nicholson. Yeah.

2580
02:31:37,741 --> 02:31:39,780
I mean it's just basically
about how that's exactly it.

2581
02:31:39,781 --> 02:31:44,280
La is a dust bowl and it's one,
one river coming down.

2582
02:31:44,281 --> 02:31:46,170
If you cut it off,
it all goes away.

2583
02:31:46,230 --> 02:31:48,990
Remember that movie we're watching
except for the fact to get his nose cut.

2584
02:31:49,170 --> 02:31:50,270
I remember that. Well, it's that.

2585
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:55,110
It's the movie that most screenwriters
call the greatest script ever. Wow.

2586
02:31:55,490 --> 02:32:00,120
The houses in that movie. Your
House. Yeah. Wow. Let's skip.

2587
02:32:00,121 --> 02:32:02,520
Freaked me out when I watched it.
I was in Burbank.

2588
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:04,980
The old Burbank Burbank
was a different animal.

2589
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:07,830
You ever go to Jerry's Deli in woodland
hills and you see what the values to

2590
02:32:07,831 --> 02:32:12,360
look like back in the day? Oh, we have
all these like 1920 photos and shit. Yeah.

2591
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:16,250
Big photos of oil, farmland
and ranches. Farms, ranches.

2592
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:20,010
I W you know,
there's a real issue here and in Texas,

2593
02:32:20,070 --> 02:32:23,850
Texas is they're really worried about
it in Texas too with drought that there,

2594
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:26,400
there's been no fucking rain and they
don't know what's going to happen.

2595
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:30,420
And if it continues on this path,
we literally like there are lakes,

2596
02:32:30,450 --> 02:32:33,210
like not Lake Austin but
Lake Travis in Austin.

2597
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:35,950
That is half the size that it used to be.
Yeah.

2598
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,400
There's some photos of
California links that show,

2599
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:41,670
like see if you could find that photos
of California lakes that show how bad the

2600
02:32:41,671 --> 02:32:45,960
drought is. Just, just Google that. Cause
I'm surprised it's not worse. You know,

2601
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:49,590
we were just up in Yosemite and we went
rafting and it was plenty of fucking

2602
02:32:49,591 --> 02:32:53,450
water. Yeah, that's a good spot. You
know, if you go to the good spots, yeah,

2603
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:57,090
it'd be all right. But that's why
I'm going to go to Canada. Um,

2604
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:01,380
actually September 9th through
11th at the, um, Alberta

2605
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:06,900
plugging my dates with the bull. Where
is it? Where are you going to Alberta.

2606
02:33:06,901 --> 02:33:10,350
Edmonton. Uh, what's the name of the club
up there? Your photos left and right.

2607
02:33:10,351 --> 02:33:14,910
Look at left and right, September
nine through 1130, all the water.

2608
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:19,880
This is only a three years difference if
I remember correctly. Yeah. Holy Shit.

2609
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:22,170
We used to look like,

2610
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:25,680
look it looks like now and
climactic change is supposed
to happen over thousands

2611
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:27,720
of years, not five. I
don't know about that.

2612
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,450
I don't know if that's necessarily
true because there've been some radical

2613
02:33:30,451 --> 02:33:32,970
climactic changes that have happened
throughout history that have happened

2614
02:33:32,971 --> 02:33:35,670
almost instantaneous.
Yeah. There's some, uh,

2615
02:33:35,671 --> 02:33:40,290
there was some discovery channel show
that was talking about these various land

2616
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:43,520
masses of these various um,
uh,

2617
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:49,170
contours are weird things that you could
see on the ground and that scientists

2618
02:33:49,171 --> 02:33:51,000
had,
I'm pulling this out of my memory,

2619
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:55,110
but scientists had realized that this
whole thing had to have occurred.

2620
02:33:55,250 --> 02:33:58,880
Like when the course of a small amount
of time, like over a couple of days yeah.

2621
02:33:58,980 --> 02:34:03,150
At these insane geological
features had been created.

2622
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:06,120
Whether it's through soil samples,
I think it was like soil samples.

2623
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:09,030
Like they tested the soil at the top and
the soil at the bottom was all the same

2624
02:34:09,031 --> 02:34:10,260
age.
Like the carbon dating.

2625
02:34:10,410 --> 02:34:15,360
I think like the Yucatan peninsula in
Mexico was a giant tsunami that settled on

2626
02:34:15,361 --> 02:34:18,250
top of the land and slowly just fucking

2627
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:23,250
dribble down for thousands of years
until what was left is a is you know,

2628
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:28,150
this, uh, what's now very lush
and, but it was underground for,

2629
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:30,610
for all in one fucking
day went underwater.

2630
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:33,720
Wow. That's fucking
nuts. But that happens.

2631
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:38,160
It's just we have such a limited amount
of time that we're referring to or that

2632
02:34:38,161 --> 02:34:40,710
we're referencing when we're
looking at climate change.

2633
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:44,500
We're only looking at a couple of hundred
years of accurate reporting. Yeah.

2634
02:34:44,580 --> 02:34:48,480
You get past then and it's just hearsay
and all those things that are in the

2635
02:34:48,481 --> 02:34:53,340
past that people point to like the stories
of climactic change and cataclysmic

2636
02:34:53,341 --> 02:34:54,174
disasters.

2637
02:34:54,510 --> 02:34:58,920
Those were all regional events that
happened in some place where someone wrote

2638
02:34:58,921 --> 02:34:59,340
about that.

2639
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:00,540
Matt via,

2640
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:03,590
yeah. Well there's that, but there's
also like the epic of Gilgamesh.

2641
02:35:03,591 --> 02:35:04,520
You want to go way back,

2642
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:08,870
which is the same essential story in the
a lot of ways as the Noah's Ark Story.

2643
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:11,930
Yeah. Where there's some
giant goddamn flood. You know,

2644
02:35:11,931 --> 02:35:14,300
there's some shit happens in your area,
a fucking up,

2645
02:35:14,301 --> 02:35:18,410
a big chunk of rock from space slams into
the ocean near your town and everybody

2646
02:35:18,411 --> 02:35:20,720
dies.
Everybody within a hundred miles is dead.

2647
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:23,680
And then someone writes about,
that's the thing about the Bible,

2648
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:27,460
most religions are based
on these categories. Like
the last book of the Bible,

2649
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:32,080
the book of revelations was written at
the exact same time that mount Vesuvius

2650
02:35:32,081 --> 02:35:34,540
happened. And when they talk
about fire and brimstone,

2651
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:37,900
that's what the guy was fucking
looking at as he wrote it.

2652
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,930
So we've got written in as like,
this is how the world ends.

2653
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:47,510
It's nuts. So the Bible, uh, apparently,
well, you know, they're all based on,

2654
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:50,960
it's not how the world ends is how the
world ends there. If you go to Hawaii,

2655
02:35:50,961 --> 02:35:52,900
everybody's fine.
You know what I'm saying?

2656
02:35:52,901 --> 02:35:55,700
It's like everybody reports on
how fucked it is where they are,

2657
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:57,830
but it's supposed to,
cause you're not supposed to stay.

2658
02:35:58,130 --> 02:36:01,880
Like we get totally married to the
idea of one geographic location.

2659
02:36:01,881 --> 02:36:04,160
But if anybody's paying any
attention to fucking history,

2660
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:06,830
what we know about North America's,
that 10,000 years ago,

2661
02:36:06,831 --> 02:36:11,270
half of it was under a mile high
sheet of ice. There was no Wisconsin,

2662
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:13,010
Wisconsin didn't exist.

2663
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:18,120
You had to cut through the fucking mile
of ice to get to Minneapolis. I mean you,

2664
02:36:18,121 --> 02:36:20,660
you, there's no, you couldn't
get to it. It wasn't there.

2665
02:36:20,810 --> 02:36:24,290
So like this idea that that could be a
place where I got my family farms always

2666
02:36:24,291 --> 02:36:27,440
been here. We've been here since we
were kids and we're just not moving.

2667
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:29,150
Climate change be gone.

2668
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:29,690
No.

2669
02:36:29,690 --> 02:36:32,980
You're talking about like when we were
a nomadic civilization and just move to

2670
02:36:32,981 --> 02:36:33,630
where the weather.
Yeah.

2671
02:36:33,630 --> 02:36:36,210
Well yeah, that's what people did. I
mean, that's what people have always done.

2672
02:36:36,211 --> 02:36:38,310
And they did it because
we didn't have the,

2673
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:42,000
we have this ridiculous ego now that
we can kind of live in any climate.

2674
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:46,470
We'll fix it. I got an air conditioning.
We've go to a water coming in.

2675
02:36:46,620 --> 02:36:48,690
Don't worry, I'm not worried
about the hot, you know,

2676
02:36:48,691 --> 02:36:53,130
like we have this idea that you could be
in a totally inhospitable place and he

2677
02:36:53,131 --> 02:36:56,160
could fix it with technology.
And we're right for the most part.

2678
02:36:56,460 --> 02:37:00,720
But if that technology fails, I
had a guy on yesterday, Mike Baker,

2679
02:37:00,721 --> 02:37:01,920
who's the guy from the CIA,

2680
02:37:01,921 --> 02:37:04,620
he was the head of director
of operations for the CIA.

2681
02:37:04,890 --> 02:37:06,480
Now we are host a show
on the travel channel.

2682
02:37:06,481 --> 02:37:09,930
He was talking about how easy it is to
break the fucking power grid and that

2683
02:37:09,931 --> 02:37:12,300
that's what people should be worried
about. There's not that much power.

2684
02:37:12,510 --> 02:37:15,590
I mean there's not the, not, not that
much difficulty shutting down a grid.

2685
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:18,560
And there's only like a couple of
grids that control the entire country.

2686
02:37:18,561 --> 02:37:21,550
And if one of those goes down, it takes
a long fucking time to come back up.

2687
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:22,850
And before,
you know,

2688
02:37:22,851 --> 02:37:25,850
just in the last couple of years have
power grids go down and people are out for

2689
02:37:25,851 --> 02:37:30,851
days and it could be longer if
something bad happens to a power grid.

2690
02:37:30,861 --> 02:37:33,350
They give water supply power grid.

2691
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:37,490
Power Grid is the big one because power
good keeps people from being able to

2692
02:37:37,491 --> 02:37:40,170
live in a place that's hot or
cold. Yeah. Like once it goes down,

2693
02:37:40,171 --> 02:37:44,180
like then you're off on your
own. Like do you really want, oh,

2694
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:47,090
that's what I wanted to bring up.
There's something that I put up.

2695
02:37:47,091 --> 02:37:52,010
Josh McDermitt from the walking dead
pulled this up and he tweeted it to me and

2696
02:37:52,011 --> 02:37:53,720
it's on my Twitter.
I retweeted it.

2697
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:59,360
The craziest fucking story about
a guy who lived in Maine. Okay.

2698
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:01,580
And when he was 20 years old,

2699
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:04,580
he disappeared and he went
into live into the woods.

2700
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:09,440
Never spoke a word to anyone,
never, never interacted with people.

2701
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:13,280
Said Hi once to a guy that
he found jogging that's all,

2702
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:16,250
or hiking and lived off the land.
Stole from people.

2703
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:20,800
They called them the hermit
of uh, whatever the fuck he
was. Did you find it? Yeah.

2704
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:23,840
Let me just pull that shit up.
So it's like in a small town in Maine,

2705
02:38:23,841 --> 02:38:25,880
he lived in the woods behind it.
Exactly.

2706
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:30,020
He lived in the woods and stole from
people for 20 years, 20 plus years.

2707
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:35,510
It's a Co Raisie steal
food, batteries, food,

2708
02:38:35,511 --> 02:38:38,840
clothes, everything he had, he had
stolen and people from this town,

2709
02:38:38,841 --> 02:38:41,390
he had been a mystery because no
one knew if he was real or not.

2710
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:45,540
So he had been a guy like the
Steal People's candy. Like the,

2711
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:48,110
there was a guy who remembered
that when he was 10 years old,

2712
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:52,430
someone stole all of his Halloween candy
and he couldn't believe it and people

2713
02:38:52,431 --> 02:38:53,270
would think you're crazy.

2714
02:38:53,390 --> 02:38:56,870
Like he would steal your propane tanks
and he would return like you would

2715
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:00,410
replace them with an empty tank and
people would be like, what the fuck?

2716
02:39:00,411 --> 02:39:02,780
I had a full propane tank.
He would steal your grill.

2717
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:07,580
He had like a grill out there and he
lived in a tent and he lived in a tent for

2718
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:11,540
27 years and I mean fucking winters.

2719
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:15,530
He's 47 years old and he
hasn't talked to anybody.

2720
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:18,620
And this is the only interaction
that he's ever had with people.

2721
02:39:18,621 --> 02:39:23,600
He's never been sick a day in his
life. You think he'll do time? Oh yeah,

2722
02:39:23,601 --> 02:39:27,710
he'll do, but it's all
misdemeanor charges. Yeah,
but it's a thousand of them.

2723
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:30,710
They got to prove them all.
He's got all the stuff.

2724
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:35,750
It's all he has. I mean,
he's going to do time. Yeah.

2725
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:39,790
It's how much you going to do the
guy a break. He's mentally ill. Kim,

2726
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:42,880
lock them up and you want them out
there fucking robbing your house.

2727
02:39:42,881 --> 02:39:45,470
And I love stealing your candid foot.
It's like you,

2728
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:48,800
there's a rumor that there's a guy
that lives in the woods. I mean,

2729
02:39:48,801 --> 02:39:50,930
how great is that to
be a kid in that town?

2730
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:53,210
What's incredible that
it turned out to be real.

2731
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:57,440
That's all these people thought this
for so long and everyone was like, no,

2732
02:39:57,441 --> 02:39:58,274
that's nuts.

2733
02:39:58,580 --> 02:40:02,780
Every town should have one guy who hides
and steal shit from you just to keep

2734
02:40:02,781 --> 02:40:05,030
you honest. Make sure you're
locking your gate it. Yeah,

2735
02:40:05,031 --> 02:40:08,270
but this is ridiculous because
this guy had tools he had in tools.

2736
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:09,490
You would get into people's houses,

2737
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:12,680
their alarms would go off and he knew
like how to get out of there just in time.

2738
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:15,330
And so when the alarm would go off,
he would fucking bail.

2739
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:19,320
I could see that as being not the
AA story in a, in a feature film,

2740
02:40:19,321 --> 02:40:21,640
but like the beast story.
Yeah. Yeah. You're like,

2741
02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:25,140
this is the guy that
has to come out of his,

2742
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:27,840
he has to come out of his
shell to try to save humanity.

2743
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:31,170
You find something that governments do
in the woods. No one's believe that guy.

2744
02:40:31,171 --> 02:40:35,070
He's crazy. Yeah. You know he stole my
kids' Halloween Candy. Right. Meanwhile,

2745
02:40:35,071 --> 02:40:36,690
he's out there and he's like,
I'm telling you,

2746
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:38,460
they're pawning something really badly.

2747
02:40:38,461 --> 02:40:41,650
I haven't talked to people in 20 jamming
you. Yeah. Have you ever been to camp?

2748
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:45,720
Ever been doing, he never
got, never got the local,

2749
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:49,950
the kid hits a baseball over the fence
and stumbles into them and they strike a

2750
02:40:49,951 --> 02:40:53,070
relationship. Yeah. That
only he understands the man.

2751
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:55,650
This guy got busted by a game warden.

2752
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:59,280
There was a game warden
who knew he was doing this,

2753
02:40:59,490 --> 02:41:03,120
and so they set up this silent alarm.
The alarm went off,

2754
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:06,870
and then this game warden showed up
with a flashlight and a gun and po po

2755
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,850
blinded him with the flashlight and
pointed the gun on him and said,

2756
02:41:08,851 --> 02:41:12,690
get on the ground, and then they
caught him. This guy was like,

2757
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:15,180
for all these years,
he was a myth.

2758
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:19,770
I just can't imagine getting
through those winters in Maine.

2759
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:25,680
Unbelievable. It doesn't get any colder
than that. It's about wet cold. Yeah.

2760
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:29,250
It's about as miserable as you can
get on without being in Alaska,

2761
02:41:29,251 --> 02:41:32,490
I guess like northern Alaska
because it's on the ocean.

2762
02:41:32,491 --> 02:41:34,620
It's on the Northern Atlantic.

2763
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:39,270
I bet he stole something like
maybe a dog house or he made some,

2764
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:43,860
no, no, no, no. He lived in a tent. Wow.
He stole the tent, but he lived in a tent.

2765
02:41:43,861 --> 02:41:45,990
He stole everything he had,
except as glasses.

2766
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:50,730
He had the same glasses that he wore
in high school. It's incredible.

2767
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:53,310
I mean, the guy was like, he
had a high school yearbook.

2768
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:56,700
He's wearing these glasses and then he's
like, you know what? I don't like people.

2769
02:41:56,730 --> 02:42:00,870
Fuck this. He never saw the
internet. He's never gotten an email.

2770
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:05,520
He's never watched a television show.
He hasn't seen anything in 27 years.

2771
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:10,170
What do you do? Read books. I read books.
How he stole books and read them. Yeah.

2772
02:42:10,171 --> 02:42:14,520
I love books. Like Tom Clancy books. Stole
People's books. Had a stack of books.

2773
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:18,480
Yeah, no, he broke his glasses.
It's hard to steal glasses.

2774
02:42:19,030 --> 02:42:22,890
I'd be like that twilight zone episode.
Yeah, that's what Burgess Meredith. Yeah.

2775
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:24,900
Crazy story though,
man.

2776
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:28,530
Because you only hear about stuff
like that and you're just like,

2777
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:32,220
that's bullshit. There's no guys live in
27 fucking years in the woods in Maine.

2778
02:42:32,221 --> 02:42:35,700
But yes, there was. Yes, there
was and we got to find out why.

2779
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:39,810
There's a reason why he left and
went in the woods. Mental illness,

2780
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:43,830
I would imagine. Did you read into
the wild? Yes. It's kind of like that.

2781
02:42:43,831 --> 02:42:47,130
There was like a something that drove and
it wasn't like an event that made that

2782
02:42:47,131 --> 02:42:49,280
guy, he wasn't traumatized, you know?

2783
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:51,480
I think his parents had
divorced and he took it hard,

2784
02:42:51,481 --> 02:42:56,000
but basically he just had a spirit
that needed to be away from man. He,

2785
02:42:56,001 --> 02:42:59,190
he couldn't handle man, but he
didn't like it when he was out there.

2786
02:42:59,370 --> 02:43:03,810
That's the thing, um, that
they, they, they talked about
a little bit in the movie,

2787
02:43:03,830 --> 02:43:04,020
you know,

2788
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:06,690
it was like all this beauty doesn't
mean anything if there's no one share it

2789
02:43:06,691 --> 02:43:10,260
with, I think there was a quote, but
what, what I didn't like about the movies,

2790
02:43:10,261 --> 02:43:14,830
the movie altered book in the book,
the reality of how the guy died,

2791
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:18,560
the reality of how he died is he got
injured and they starved to death. Yeah.

2792
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:22,120
And in the book there was one
version of it and then the movie,

2793
02:43:22,121 --> 02:43:26,410
they tried to make it that he ate some
poisonous plant that he fucked up and ate

2794
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:27,090
the wrong plant.

2795
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:29,830
Though I remember in the book they
did mention that as a possibility.

2796
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:31,930
They didn't say,
ultimately that's what it was.

2797
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:35,020
I think they were pretty sure
that he starved to death.
Yeah. Yeah. There was no,

2798
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:38,400
it's not easy to get food,
man. It's not easy. It's,

2799
02:43:38,401 --> 02:43:41,650
it's the idea of living
off the land is ridiculous.

2800
02:43:41,651 --> 02:43:45,370
So I think he had planned on getting out
before winter set in and he missed the

2801
02:43:45,371 --> 02:43:47,590
window.
And so he got stuck out there.

2802
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:50,830
Well he was only a few miles from
people too. Oh no shit. Yeah.

2803
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:55,420
I mean look that area, like you're in
Alaska. Alaska is incredibly remote,

2804
02:43:55,421 --> 02:43:58,990
but I don't believe he was more
than like five or 10 miles away from

2805
02:43:58,991 --> 02:44:02,320
civilization. I think the PR,
you know, poor fucking guy.

2806
02:44:02,321 --> 02:44:04,030
There's people that could have
helped them that we're right there.

2807
02:44:04,031 --> 02:44:07,180
I wonder if this is a tourist spot
where the bus was that he was living in.

2808
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:10,330
There's nothing like it had a van or
a bus or something like a school bus.

2809
02:44:10,331 --> 02:44:13,300
Then he find it out there or something
and move into it or something was broken

2810
02:44:13,301 --> 02:44:16,810
down bus. But that was
sad, man, because look,

2811
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:19,240
you can do it like survivor man's done it,

2812
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:22,180
but you gotta be fucking prepared if you,

2813
02:44:22,181 --> 02:44:25,180
if you want to live in the
woods by yourself, man,

2814
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:30,220
you better have plenty of food.
You had better have plenty of ammo.

2815
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:34,420
If you're going to hunt, you better
have some way of stockpiling plants.

2816
02:44:34,421 --> 02:44:35,320
If you're not going to hunt,

2817
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:38,050
you got to figure out how you're going
to and you've got to have a serious

2818
02:44:38,051 --> 02:44:41,050
understanding of nature. You know what
stuff you can eat, what you can't,

2819
02:44:41,051 --> 02:44:44,770
how to build a fire, how to
like, how to predict the weather.

2820
02:44:44,771 --> 02:44:49,660
To some degree it's probably really hard
to do but you shouldn't be at least be

2821
02:44:49,661 --> 02:44:50,710
able to survive.

2822
02:44:50,711 --> 02:44:55,240
Like there's a bunch of those shows
that are about people living in Alaska.

2823
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:56,650
There's a bunch of those shows now,

2824
02:44:56,651 --> 02:45:00,370
but one of the crazy ones is life
below zero and a light bulb zero.

2825
02:45:00,371 --> 02:45:04,510
There's a couple of these guys that have
cabins and they live out and all they

2826
02:45:04,511 --> 02:45:09,370
do all day is go out and get food,
whether it's fishing or hunting.

2827
02:45:09,371 --> 02:45:11,740
They shoot Caribou and they hang them.
And this one guy,

2828
02:45:12,100 --> 02:45:17,100
his name is Glenn and he has like this
little shack that he's prepared up there

2829
02:45:17,770 --> 02:45:22,700
in, in Alaska and he lives in this little
shack and it's by a lake and he has a

2830
02:45:22,701 --> 02:45:26,740
drill holes in the leg to pull his water
out or take snow and he melted down.

2831
02:45:26,830 --> 02:45:30,460
That's the only way he gets from the no
electricity just to fire, just to fire.

2832
02:45:30,550 --> 02:45:32,950
And he makes all of his fire.
Um,

2833
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:37,000
he doesn't use matches because he
feels like you could lose your matches.

2834
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:41,290
So he has this thing like an old school
Indian thing, he bites down on it,

2835
02:45:41,291 --> 02:45:45,490
he holds it in a stick and the stick
is attached to these two ropes, like a,

2836
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:47,740
like a, um, or a rope rather than a bow.

2837
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:50,440
Like almost like one of those
things you would play fiddle with.

2838
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:53,530
And he goes like this with eight bytes
it down. So he holds it in place,

2839
02:45:53,531 --> 02:45:57,940
just goes [inaudible] and then he
goes back and forth in the friction,

2840
02:45:57,941 --> 02:46:00,970
creates sparks and then he
uses that to start up Tinder.

2841
02:46:00,971 --> 02:46:04,300
That's the only way he makes fire and
this guy's out there just shooting things

2842
02:46:04,301 --> 02:46:08,080
and eating them.
But the crazy thing is like he's happy,

2843
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:09,380
like he enjoys it.

2844
02:46:09,380 --> 02:46:12,680
He lives as a hermit for like four or
five months out of the year and he does

2845
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:16,790
that. And then occasionally
he has a family apparently
like his divorced from his

2846
02:46:16,791 --> 02:46:17,151
wife,

2847
02:46:17,151 --> 02:46:21,470
but he has kids so he goes into town
and he does it during the winter months.

2848
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:23,900
Yeah, he does it through the
winter. Yeah. It's crazy.

2849
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:25,640
I don't know how much
of it is for the show.

2850
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:27,990
That's a real issue when you
watch these goddamn shows. Yeah.

2851
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:30,830
You don't know how much of this
they're doing. Like they said, hey,

2852
02:46:30,831 --> 02:46:33,860
would you be willing to live out
there through the winter? Like yeah,

2853
02:46:33,861 --> 02:46:35,600
maybe you only does it
during the summer normally,

2854
02:46:35,601 --> 02:46:36,800
but he did it in the winter on TV.

2855
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:39,260
But what's weird is like when I,
when we stayed in Yosemite,

2856
02:46:39,261 --> 02:46:43,940
we had to put all our food in these bare
safes that were like reinforced steel

2857
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:46,910
because any food at all,
they're going to come find it.

2858
02:46:46,911 --> 02:46:50,270
But what do you do when you've got an
elk hanging outside of your cabinet?

2859
02:46:50,270 --> 02:46:53,660
I was constantly fighting off grizzlies.
This guys constantly, he shoots,

2860
02:46:53,661 --> 02:46:55,610
grizzlies is constantly fighting them off.

2861
02:46:55,611 --> 02:46:57,440
They find out about
his stash and you know,

2862
02:46:57,441 --> 02:47:00,650
he has to like when he shoots an animal
needs to be very careful approaching it

2863
02:47:00,651 --> 02:47:03,980
because of a bear gets to the end before
he does like a lot of times you shoot

2864
02:47:03,981 --> 02:47:07,160
an animal in the animal
will run off to die. Like,

2865
02:47:07,161 --> 02:47:09,740
cause they have a lung or they
have their full of air, you know,

2866
02:47:09,741 --> 02:47:12,770
their lungs are a bullet will go
through one long, the animal runs,

2867
02:47:13,010 --> 02:47:15,650
it might take 10 15 minutes for it
to die if you don't hit it perfectly.

2868
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:19,640
So he has to track the animal, but by
the time he gets it in the animals down,

2869
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:21,320
he has to decide if he shoots the animal,

2870
02:47:21,321 --> 02:47:25,310
like say like if it gets dark at seven
and he shoots the animal at six and he's

2871
02:47:25,311 --> 02:47:27,890
tracking it. If he goes
too far, he's gotta go,

2872
02:47:27,891 --> 02:47:31,140
I gotta get home before it gets dark
because he doesn't have flashlights. Yeah,

2873
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:34,280
he's not using any of that shit. Okay.
I got to leave this animal there.

2874
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:35,810
So then he has to go out first light.

2875
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:38,360
So he goes out in the morning to find
the animal and sometimes something's

2876
02:47:38,361 --> 02:47:40,130
founded already like nocturnal animals.

2877
02:47:40,430 --> 02:47:43,850
So he might get to his carcass of all
of his meat. This is what he needs.

2878
02:47:43,851 --> 02:47:44,601
He shot this animal,

2879
02:47:44,601 --> 02:47:48,530
but there's a wolf on it or this bears
on it or something along those lines.

2880
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:50,840
Serious Shit.
What that,

2881
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:54,050
that excitement about being
out there like that for,

2882
02:47:54,051 --> 02:47:57,380
this guy's like this giant charge.
That's what he loves to do.

2883
02:47:57,381 --> 02:48:01,040
He doesn't want to deal with taxes.
He doesn't want to deal with jobs.

2884
02:48:01,041 --> 02:48:02,420
He doesn't want to deal with bosses.

2885
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:05,960
He's just got this little shack that he
built himself and he could sell skins.

2886
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:08,900
So like he can, um, he can
get like, you can trap,

2887
02:48:08,901 --> 02:48:11,420
you can trap animals
like links and you know,

2888
02:48:11,421 --> 02:48:14,730
all these different animals and sell
their skins and make money. So he,

2889
02:48:14,731 --> 02:48:16,010
that's where he gets his money from.

2890
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:19,280
Then from that money he'll buy like
bullets and guns and things along those

2891
02:48:19,281 --> 02:48:21,680
lines. And everything else.
He's just living off the land.

2892
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:25,060
So he lives off the land like for
months and months at a time with no one,

2893
02:48:25,070 --> 02:48:25,850
no contact,

2894
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:28,270
doesn't speak to another
human being for four months.

2895
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:31,930
Well he's doing it now because
he's talking to cameraman
obviously and producers

2896
02:48:31,931 --> 02:48:32,820
I'm sure.
And we ended up,

2897
02:48:32,830 --> 02:48:35,560
I'm sure there's people there that are
kind of directing weird for him because

2898
02:48:35,561 --> 02:48:37,660
he clearly he doesn't
want to be around people.

2899
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:40,720
And when you've got a camera
crew around you around the clock,

2900
02:48:41,050 --> 02:48:42,370
you got no space at all.

2901
02:48:42,640 --> 02:48:43,331
Yeah,
I don't know.

2902
02:48:43,331 --> 02:48:46,120
I mean maybe it's only during the day
and then they have specific times with a

2903
02:48:46,121 --> 02:48:46,481
film,

2904
02:48:46,481 --> 02:48:50,110
like they need to get some
nighttime content or need
to get some content of him.

2905
02:48:50,320 --> 02:48:52,090
Like they've got a different ones.

2906
02:48:52,270 --> 02:48:57,130
There's a couple of different guys
and one guy's a, um, he's a, uh,

2907
02:48:57,430 --> 02:49:01,030
a hunting guide.
His name is Eric and he's a hunting guide.

2908
02:49:01,031 --> 02:49:03,340
So he takes people hunting and
then when he's not doing that,

2909
02:49:03,341 --> 02:49:06,970
then he has his own spot. But he has
a generator and he has an actual,

2910
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:11,890
and he's a bit, he has like,
he drives around in four by
fours, those little work,

2911
02:49:11,970 --> 02:49:14,280
you know those little things,
those Polaris things. Yes.

2912
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:18,750
That's how he and snowmobiles actually
snowmobiles is really the way he does it.

2913
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:20,520
And that's how he gets around.

2914
02:49:20,521 --> 02:49:23,430
He uses a snowmobile to travel through
the woods and check his trap lines and

2915
02:49:23,431 --> 02:49:28,140
stuff. So he's like step up from this
guy like a little, he has a generator,

2916
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:32,910
has power, little bit more
technological, but you know,

2917
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:36,520
you go all the way back to that guy and
he's not even using matches. You know,

2918
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:39,150
these fucking guys there, they're
loving it. That's what's crazy.

2919
02:49:39,151 --> 02:49:43,770
It's like the challenge and the thrill
of life changes because there are tuned

2920
02:49:43,771 --> 02:49:47,160
in and that's what they always talk about.
Like when you're out here,

2921
02:49:47,161 --> 02:49:51,270
it's so exciting because you're tuned
into nature. You know, like he was,

2922
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:52,650
he was their hunting,

2923
02:49:52,651 --> 02:49:55,960
all these different animals and some of
them they're hunting for furs and some

2924
02:49:55,961 --> 02:49:59,640
of which I don't like. You know, when I,
when I see people hunting shit for furs,

2925
02:49:59,641 --> 02:50:03,090
I'm always like, man, that's Kinda fucked
up. But when I watch these guys do it,

2926
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,620
I don't,
it doesn't bother me.

2927
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:07,890
It doesn't bother me that they're shooting
these animals only for their first

2928
02:50:07,891 --> 02:50:10,830
cause. Like this guy doesn't have
any other way to get money. Yeah.

2929
02:50:10,970 --> 02:50:15,300
I mean this is what he's chosen
to do and there's a reason why.

2930
02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:17,550
I mean they would try to keep the
populations of a lot of these animals and

2931
02:50:17,551 --> 02:50:19,410
check and so they need
people like this to do that.

2932
02:50:19,411 --> 02:50:24,411
But it's just such a weird way of life
to watch and I always watch it go.

2933
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,433
Could I do that?

2934
02:50:26,480 --> 02:50:28,040
That's why these shows are so popular.

2935
02:50:28,041 --> 02:50:31,940
He's Alaska shows are huge and they
keep making a million. But you know,

2936
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:36,320
I could say on the, on the slightest
scale of this, when I go camping,

2937
02:50:36,650 --> 02:50:40,340
I feel so good.
I come back refreshed.

2938
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:45,200
I feel like I'm connecting with my family.
Like I never do news, no cell phones,

2939
02:50:45,201 --> 02:50:49,160
we're talking, we're doing projects
like lighting a fire, cooking some food,

2940
02:50:49,161 --> 02:50:52,500
putting the tents up. Going
for a hike and you think, yeah,

2941
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:56,360
I always bring a book or some games, I
never get to that shit. Your Day is full.

2942
02:50:56,450 --> 02:51:01,370
Yeah, it's a, it's a relaxing but
invigorating way to spend your time.

2943
02:51:01,371 --> 02:51:04,820
It's weird. Yeah. But I
think people need trees.

2944
02:51:05,060 --> 02:51:07,130
I think like being around that stuff,

2945
02:51:07,131 --> 02:51:10,970
like walking on dirt and being around
trees, we don't need it obviously,

2946
02:51:10,971 --> 02:51:14,120
but I think there's a certain energy
that you get from that environment that's

2947
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:16,280
refreshing. It feels good. Yeah.

2948
02:51:16,410 --> 02:51:20,430
To me in every religion talks about, it's
all the answers are in nature. You know,

2949
02:51:20,431 --> 02:51:24,210
you read Whitman and Thoreau,
it's all about go to Walden pond,

2950
02:51:24,211 --> 02:51:27,870
just get off the grid and that's the
only way you can live. And it's like,

2951
02:51:27,900 --> 02:51:31,680
even if it means taking a hike every
other day, just get out in nature.

2952
02:51:31,681 --> 02:51:34,740
All the answers are there.
You, you ponder the cycles,

2953
02:51:34,741 --> 02:51:37,200
you see a flower dying
and you think about, oh,

2954
02:51:37,201 --> 02:51:39,270
there's some horse shit
that's gonna make this grow.

2955
02:51:39,271 --> 02:51:41,550
And you see a bird feeding something.

2956
02:51:41,551 --> 02:51:45,000
Like you just see how life
really works on a base level.

2957
02:51:45,001 --> 02:51:46,710
And I think he kind of gets you in sync.

2958
02:51:46,910 --> 02:51:51,200
Yeah. I think what we're doing by
creating cities is awesome. I mean,

2959
02:51:51,201 --> 02:51:54,860
we're stockpiling food.
It makes it easy to get around your car.

2960
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:59,450
It's nice to be able to visit your
friends. You just drive across town. Hey,

2961
02:51:59,451 --> 02:52:02,780
what's up everybody? And everybody
fucking let's green. Light means go.

2962
02:52:02,781 --> 02:52:06,040
Red Light means stop. No, it's
all good. Got a nice system,

2963
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:09,430
but I think we're missing
out on a lot of Shit, man.

2964
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:13,330
I think we're missing out on a lot of the
feeling that you get from just being a

2965
02:52:13,331 --> 02:52:17,490
person. I think that's one of the
reasons why we're so detached from our,

2966
02:52:17,740 --> 02:52:22,740
the the actions that we are doing as
far as like polluting as far as like

2967
02:52:23,470 --> 02:52:25,090
dumping plastic into the ocean,

2968
02:52:25,091 --> 02:52:30,091
we're so detached from it
because in cities we're only
seeing this human created

2969
02:52:30,821 --> 02:52:35,820
stuff. But when you see like a beer, can
you see a beer can in a parking lot? Say,

2970
02:52:35,821 --> 02:52:37,990
if you're walking through a parking lot,
see a smashed Budweiser can,

2971
02:52:37,991 --> 02:52:41,590
it doesn't really freak you out. But when
you see a Budweiser can in the woods,

2972
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:44,860
it's a real bummer man. Yeah,
it's a real bummer. You know,

2973
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:49,210
I've seen people throw cigarettes out
like on a parking lot and it's gross,

2974
02:52:49,570 --> 02:52:51,310
but it seems normal.
But I see,

2975
02:52:51,311 --> 02:52:54,550
I saw a dude wants throw a cigarette out
in the woods and I go pick that up, man.

2976
02:52:54,820 --> 02:52:56,950
The fuck are you doing?
We're out here in the woods.

2977
02:52:56,980 --> 02:53:00,070
It's beautiful out here and you just let
your cigarette threw it on the ground.

2978
02:53:00,071 --> 02:53:02,320
Stepped on it. Fuck you.
That's what the ocean is.

2979
02:53:02,321 --> 02:53:06,610
It's forever been a dumping
ground. I mean, just, just,
I mean, so to hear about the,

2980
02:53:06,611 --> 02:53:10,810
uh, the, the, uh, trash continent
that disappeared, disappeared,

2981
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:13,000
disappeared.
What do you mean disappeared?

2982
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:16,600
Somebody just told me yesterday that the
thing that's been floating out in the

2983
02:53:16,601 --> 02:53:20,350
ocean that's the size of
Australia is no longer there.

2984
02:53:20,380 --> 02:53:23,200
I don't think it's that big. It's pretty
big. I think it's like Texas size,

2985
02:53:23,201 --> 02:53:27,540
but it's uh, the Pacific Garbage Patch
is what the Christ appeared. Really? Yup.

2986
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:31,210
Wow. I didn't hear that. And you
know, when you think about like, uh,

2987
02:53:31,211 --> 02:53:35,590
it's just too easy to dump
shit into the, uh, 99% missing.

2988
02:53:36,310 --> 02:53:39,940
Oh my God.
99% missing.

2989
02:53:39,970 --> 02:53:43,770
It's reached the food
chain. Ugh. God, yeah.

2990
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:47,350
Ocean patches mysteriously disappearing.
What the fuck?

2991
02:53:48,510 --> 02:53:51,790
Those guy who had on who's a c Stutter,
he's a good,

2992
02:53:51,791 --> 02:53:53,750
this idea of I'll run out of time,
but he,

2993
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:57,650
they were talking about this a 19 year
old kid and figured out a way to pull

2994
02:53:57,700 --> 02:53:58,840
plastic out of the ocean,

2995
02:53:58,841 --> 02:54:02,700
use some sort of large machine and he's
done on a small scale base skateboards

2996
02:54:02,710 --> 02:54:06,430
out of it. Uh, no, we talked about that.
I think the last time you were here,

2997
02:54:06,470 --> 02:54:08,680
some guy down in Mexico, right? Right. No,

2998
02:54:08,710 --> 02:54:12,190
this was a guy who figured out how to
clean up the Pacific garbage patch and

2999
02:54:12,191 --> 02:54:15,340
reuse that plastic. Oh yeah. Yeah.
That was small scale. They've uh,

3000
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:19,600
they've shown it like, um, what's that
called? Proof of concept on a small scale.

3001
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:22,540
So it's now it's a matter of
implementing it on a large scale.

3002
02:54:22,541 --> 02:54:26,370
But if it's all fucking sinking
into the ocean, that's not good.

3003
02:54:26,371 --> 02:54:30,220
It's like that Gulf oil spell like
where to go. Not Good. He's gone.

3004
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:33,820
But the reality is of that
the ocean is so fucking big.

3005
02:54:33,950 --> 02:54:38,200
If you do cap it, eventually everything
will recover. It's obviously not good.

3006
02:54:38,201 --> 02:54:42,880
But the reality is oil leaks from the
ground far for the ocean floor also.

3007
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:44,080
I mean it does it all the time.

3008
02:54:44,081 --> 02:54:48,160
Like throughout the California coast you
could find natural oil that has leaked

3009
02:54:48,161 --> 02:54:50,890
out of the bottom of the ocean,
like the ocean floor.

3010
02:54:50,891 --> 02:54:53,470
The same way we can go in
and get it with a pipe,

3011
02:54:53,770 --> 02:54:55,810
it can actually come
through in some spots. Yeah.

3012
02:54:56,170 --> 02:55:00,760
So the ocean is not worried about that
amount of, it's fucked up and grows.

3013
02:55:00,761 --> 02:55:04,310
And for the people that live in
that area, disgusting, awful, evil,

3014
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:09,200
all the above. But the whole ocean, it's
like Kimberly and Doris was, is when the,

3015
02:55:09,201 --> 02:55:12,530
uh, when the Soviet Union went
down, they got a, all these,

3016
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:17,450
all these classified documents came out
about the nuclear program for like 40

3017
02:55:17,451 --> 02:55:17,901
years.

3018
02:55:17,901 --> 02:55:22,070
They were taking raw nuclear waste and
just dropping it in the Sea of Japan.

3019
02:55:22,071 --> 02:55:26,810
Just take it out, throw it overboard.
Motherfuck and we're eating Sushi.

3020
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:29,920
Well that's how the Somali
pirate started, you know? Yeah.

3021
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:32,840
The Somali pirates before they
call themselves Somali pirates,

3022
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:35,600
they call themselves the
volunteer coast guard of Somalia.

3023
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:37,730
And the reason why they
started doing this,

3024
02:55:37,731 --> 02:55:42,200
they start going out and
capturing European boats
that were dumping toxic waste

3025
02:55:42,201 --> 02:55:46,070
off the coast, killing off all their
fish. I'll hold them for ransom.

3026
02:55:46,340 --> 02:55:47,530
And then they realize,
you know,

3027
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:52,130
we get a lot more than this then we do
do in fishing. Yeah. So fuck fishing.

3028
02:55:52,131 --> 02:55:53,420
Let's just become kidnappers.

3029
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:56,030
So they became kidnappers and
started making millions of dollars.

3030
02:55:56,031 --> 02:55:59,960
Give a man a fish. He'll eat for a day,
but take a bunch of people hostage.

3031
02:55:59,961 --> 02:56:01,760
That's a fucking months worth of money.

3032
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:03,830
