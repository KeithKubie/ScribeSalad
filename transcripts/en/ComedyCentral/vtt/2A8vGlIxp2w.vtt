It's okay. Sh, sh, sh.
Just need to get some diapers.

Sshh.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.942

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.280
My, they look very PC.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.649
Oh no, no!
They're not very PC at all.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.518
Aw, look at the PC babies!

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.386
They actually aren't PC.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.690
No? Did you hear Monica
Lewinksy's becoming republican?

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.225

Oh god!

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.965
(shushes)
No, no, no, no.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.567
-Is everything alright?
-Oh look!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.070
-More PC babies!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.072
I told you we need
to shop separately.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.306
(shushes)

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.574
Excuse me,

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.342
where's the oriental food aisle?

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.245
(babies cry)
Shh, quiet! There's PC babies!
