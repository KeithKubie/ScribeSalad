00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.040
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.330
kind of introduce
you to the idea of,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.650
one, how carbon-14
comes about, and how

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.470
it gets into all living things.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.884
And then either later in this
video or in future videos

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.300
we'll talk about
how it's actually

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.750
used to date things, how we
use it actually figure out

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.660
that that bone is
12,000 years old,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.800
or that person died 18,000
years ago, whatever it might be.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.040
So let me draw the Earth.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.459
So let me just draw the
surface of the Earth like that.

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.750
It's just a little section
of the surface of the Earth.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.200
And then we have the
atmosphere of the Earth.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.490
I'll draw that in yellow.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.630
So then you have the Earth's
atmosphere right over here.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.710
Let me write that
down, atmosphere.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.740
And 78%, the most abundant
element in our atmosphere

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.630
is nitrogen.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.670
It is 78% nitrogen.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.270
And I'll write nitrogen.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.430
Its symbol is just N.
And it has seven protons,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670
and it also has seven neutrons.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.050
So it has an atomic
mass of roughly 14.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.650
Then this is the most
typical isotope of nitrogen.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.180
And we talk about
the word isotope

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.470
in the chemistry playlist.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.420
An isotope, the protons
define what element it is.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.860
But this number up here
can change depending

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890
on the number of
neutrons you have.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220
So the different versions
of a given element,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.760
those are each called isotopes.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.630
I just view in my head as
versions of an element.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.130
So anyway, we have
our atmosphere,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.580
and then coming from
our sun, we have

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.451
what's commonly
called cosmic rays,

00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:32.700
but they're actually not rays.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.820
They're cosmic particles.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.930
You can view them as just
single protons, which

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.400
is the same thing as
a hydrogen nucleus.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.897
They can also be
alpha particles,

00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:42.730
which is the same thing
as a helium nucleus.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.742
And there's even
a few electrons.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:46.450
And they're going to
come in, and they're

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.283
going to bump into
things in our atmosphere,

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:50.650
and they're actually
going to form neutrons.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.230
So they're actually
going to form neutrons.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.170
And we'll show a neutron
with a lowercase n, and a 1

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350
for its mass number.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.450
And we don't write
anything, because it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.100
has no protons down here.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.130
Like we had for nitrogen,
we had seven protons.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.379
So it's not really an element.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.229
It is a subatomic particle.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.050
But you have these
neutrons form.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.220
And every now and
then-- and let's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.720
just be clear-- this isn't
like a typical reaction.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.680
But every now and then
one of those neutrons

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.510
will bump into one
of the nitrogen-14's

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.020
in just the right way
so that it bumps off

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.710
one of the protons
in the nitrogen

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.200
and essentially replaces
that proton with itself.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
So let me make it clear.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.510
So it bumps off
one of the protons.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.970
So instead of seven protons
we now have six protons.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.030
But this number 14
doesn't go down to 13

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.650
because it replaces
it with itself.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.970
So this still stays at 14.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.860
And now since it
only has six protons,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.940
this is no longer
nitrogen, by definition.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.680
This is now carbon.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.446
And that proton that was bumped
off just kind of gets emitted.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:06.320
So then let me just do
that in another color.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.250
So plus.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.450
And a proton that's
just flying around,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.790
you could call that hydrogen 1.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.501
And it can gain an
electron some ways.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.000
If it doesn't gain
an electron, it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.290
just a hydrogen ion, a
positive ion, either way,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.020
or a hydrogen nucleus.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.660
But this process--
and once again, it's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.980
not a typical process,
but it happens every now

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.760
and then-- this is
how carbon-14 forms.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.820
So this right here is carbon-14.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.590
You can essentially
view it as a nitrogen-14

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.580
where one of the protons
is replaced with a neutron.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.306
And what's interesting
about this is this

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.180
is constantly being
formed in our atmosphere,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.397
not in huge quantities, but
in reasonable quantities.

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:44.480
So let me write this down.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.070
Constant formation.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.050
And let me be very clear.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.330
Let's look at the
periodic table over here.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.280
So carbon by definition
has six protons,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.830
but the typical isotope, the
most common isotope of carbon

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830
is carbon-12.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.000
So carbon-12 is the most common.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.050
So most of the carbon in
your body is carbon-12.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.570
But what's interesting
is that a small fraction

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.030
of carbon-14 forms,
and then this carbon-14

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.430
can then also combine with
oxygen to form carbon dioxide.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.490
And then that
carbon dioxide gets

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.620
absorbed into the rest of the
atmosphere, into our oceans.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.716
It can be fixed by plants.

00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:39.340
When people talk
about carbon fixation,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.970
they're really talking about
using mainly light energy

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.020
from the sun to
take gaseous carbon

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.810
and turn it into actual
kind of organic tissue.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.150
And so this carbon-14, it's
constantly being formed.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.580
It makes its way into oceans--
it's already in the air,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.160
but it completely mixes
through the whole atmosphere--

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.400
and the air.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.660
And then it makes
its way into plants.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.170
And plants are
really just made out

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.910
of that fixed carbon,
that carbon that

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.070
was taken in gaseous
form and put into,

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.860
I guess you could say,
into kind of a solid form,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.010
put it into a living form.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.830
That's what wood pretty much is.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.770
It gets put into
plants, and then it

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.850
gets put into the things
that eat the plants.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.620
So that could be us.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.230
Now why is this
even interesting?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.600
I've just explained a mechanism
where some of our body,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.690
even though carbon-12 is the
most common isotope, some

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.600
of our body, while we're
living, gets made up

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.780
of this carbon-14 thing.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.950
Well, the interesting
thing is the only time

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.650
you can take in this carbon-14
is while you're alive,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.470
while you're eating new things.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.000
Because as soon
as you die and you

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.700
get buried under
the ground, there's

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.520
no way for the carbon-14 to
become part of your tissue

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.690
anymore because you're
not eating anything

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.860
with new carbon-14.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.560
And what's interesting
here is once you die,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.790
you're not going to
get any new carbon-14.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.940
And that carbon-14 that you
did have at you're death

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:18.970
is going to decay
via beta decay--

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.460
and we learned about this--
back into nitrogen-14.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.080
So kind of this
process reverses.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.920
So it'll decay back into
nitrogen-14, and in beta decay

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.220
you emit an electron and
an electron anti-neutrino.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.030
I won't go into the
details of that.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.310
But essentially what
you have happening here

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.250
is you have one of the neutrons
is turning into a proton

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.630
and emitting this
stuff in the process.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.944
Now why is this interesting?

00:06:48.944 --> 00:06:50.360
So I just said
while you're living

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.940
you have kind of
straight-up carbon-14.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.445
And carbon-14 is constantly
doing this decay thing.

00:06:57.445 --> 00:06:58.820
But what's
interesting is as soon

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.800
as you die and you're
not ingesting anymore

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.640
plants, or breathing from the
atmosphere if you are a plant,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.890
or fixing from the atmosphere.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.223
And this even applies to plants.

00:07:07.223 --> 00:07:10.260
Once a plant dies, it's no
longer taking in carbon dioxide

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.010
from the atmosphere and
turning it into new tissue.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.480
The carbon-14 in that
tissue gets frozen.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.700
And this carbon-14 does this
decay at a specific rate.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.430
And then you can use that
rate to actually determine how

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.740
long ago that
thing must've died.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.200
So the rate at
which this happens,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.910
so the rate of carbon-14 decay,
is essentially half disappears,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:49.110
half gone, in
roughly 5,730 years.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.130
And this is actually
called a half life.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.580
And we talk about
in other videos.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.684
This is called a half life.

00:07:54.684 --> 00:07:55.850
And I want to be clear here.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.474
You don't know which
half of it's gone.

00:07:57.474 --> 00:07:58.670
It's a probabilistic thing.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.046
You can't just say all the
carbon-14's on the left are

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:03.170
going to decay and all the
carbon-14's on the right

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.630
aren't going to decay
in that 5,730 years.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.480
What it's essentially saying
is any given carbon-14 atom

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.020
has a 50% chance of
decaying into nitrogen-14

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.270
in 5,730 years.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.650
So over the course of 5,730
years, roughly half of them

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.700
will have decayed.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.740
Now why is that interesting?

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.350
Well, if you know that
all living things have

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:33.650
a certain proportion of
carbon-14 in their tissue,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.770
as kind of part of
what makes them up,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.100
and then if you were to
find some bone-- let's

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.640
just say find some
bone right here

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.580
that you dig it up on some
type of archaeology dig.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:54.680
And you say, hey, that bone has
one half the carbon-14 of all

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.010
the living things that
you see right now.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.280
It would be a pretty
reasonable estimate

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.310
to say, well, that thing
must be 5,730 years old.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.970
Even better, maybe you
dig a little deeper,

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.650
and you find another bone.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.252
Maybe a couple of
feet even deeper.

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.460
And you say, wow, you know
this thing right over here

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.850
has 1/4 the carbon-14
that I would

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.230
expect to find in
something living.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.540
So how old is this?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.532
Well, if it only has
1/4 the carbon-14

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.240
it must have gone
through two half lives.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.100
After one half life, it would
have had 1/2 the carbon.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.230
And then after another
half life, half of that

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.890
also turns into a nitrogen-14.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.950
And so this would
involve two half lives,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.430
which is the same thing
as 2 times 5,730 years.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.810
Or you would say that
this thing is what?

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:02.340
You'd say this thing is 11,460
years old, give or take.
