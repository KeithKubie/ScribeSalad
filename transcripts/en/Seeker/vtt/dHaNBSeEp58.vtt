Hey everyone, Trace here for a DNews short.

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:11.570
For the first time ever, scientists have captured
the “sonic boom” - for light.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.330
Normally sonic booms are created when an object
moves faster than the speed of sound.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.599
But you shouldn’t be able to create a ‘sonic
boom’ for light when nothing can travel

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.960
faster than light.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.530
Unless, of course, you are a bit more specific.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.170
Nothing can move faster than the speed of
light - in a vacuum.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.789
You can, however, slow down the speed of a
beam of light by shining it through a medium

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.349
like water or glass.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.620
By leveraging this quality, you can make some
light travel faster than other light!

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
Scientists accomplished just that in this
experiment by sandwiching a tunnel filled

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.370
with dry ice fog between two plates made of
a mixture of silicone rubber and aluminum

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.420
oxide powder.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.399
Then, they pulsed a green laser through the
tunnel.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.170
Now, light moves slower through the plate
material than it does in the tunnel.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.950
So, as light scatters into the plates, it
can’t keep up with the light in the dry

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.219
ice fog.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.079
When this happens a cone-shaped wavefront
of light forms behind the laser pulse, just

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.219
like a sonic boom shockwave created by a supersonic
aircraft.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.219
In this case, the beam is the airplane.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.409
While this wasn’t the first time a photonic
boom had been created - it was the first time

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.179
one had been captured in real time.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.219
That’s thanks to a new superfast camera
that can capture images at 100 billion frames

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.299
per second.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.999
They call it the Streak Camera and it’s
so fast that researchers ultimately hope to

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.200
use it to image more than just laser pulses.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.499
Eventually, they want to apply it to biomedical
imaging and watch neurons fire in the brain.

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:32.499
Woah.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.009
When a camera can keep up with light and neurons
- you know it’s gotta be good.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.299
So wait, if we can make light slower, does
that mean Einstein was wrong about the speed

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.619
of light in his theorems?

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.779
Julian looks into it.

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:44.779
Here.

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.579
What would you do with a camera that can take
100 BILLION FRAMES PER SECOND.
