I hope everyone enjoyed the visit to the Computer History Museum. Maybe one day,

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:07.088
there'll be something in the museum built by a CS101 student. If you're ever in

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.322
the area, it's a really cool place to visit, and you can also drop by our

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:13.818
offices in Palo Alto, only a short distance from there. What we're going to do

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.289
next is learn about the present of computing. We're going to visit SLAC National

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.853
Accelerator Laboratory, and see how they're using computing to advance science

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.504
today.
