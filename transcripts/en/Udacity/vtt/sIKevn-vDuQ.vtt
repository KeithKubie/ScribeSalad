00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.090
So you've been thinking of slope as
vertical change over horizontal change

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.880
and that's exactly what slope is.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.590
And we've been using the words rise and
run.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.890
And the way we've been finding
the slope, is by looking at a line, and

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.158
finding two points.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.710
Let's say in this case 0,0 and,
I don't know, 2,4.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.090
And then we've been finding the rise and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.030
the run by actually counting, 1, 2,
3, 4 is my rise, and 1, 2 is my run.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.069
So this would have a slope of 4 over 2,

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.110
which I guess is 2, and
that's fine, that works.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.270
But what if we don't have
the image of the line itself?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.446
How can I get the slope then?

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:43.275
Well, what we want to do is come up
with a mathematical method of taking two

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.421
points like 2,4 and 0,0.

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.145
And somehow getting the slope from them,
and luckily exactly this method exists.

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:53.260
Now we typically use the letter
m to stand for slope,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.110
and please don't ask me why I have
no idea what m has to do with slope.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.417
But the equation we have two points
looks something like this y2 minus y1

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:03.240
over x2 minus x1.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.990
And these little 2s and 1s are called
subscripts, and what do they mean?

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.718
Well, these 2s mean we're referring
to our second point, and the 1s,

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:14.472
mean we're referring to the first point.

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:18.168
So this would be the y coordinate of the
first point, the x coordinate the first

00:01:18.168 --> 00:01:21.197
point, x coordinate the second,
and y coordinate the second.

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:24.273
And I'm going to show you how I would
use this equation with these points.

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:27.801
So here, our first point was this one
here, 0,0 though in truth it doesn't

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.160
matter which we call first and
which we call second.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.155
And your second point
was this one here 2,4.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:36.656
And since I said x1 was the x
coordinate of the first point,

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:38.277
it corresponds to that 0.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:42.305
Ad y1 is the y coordinate
of the first point,

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:47.610
corresponds to that 0,
x2 is this 2, and y2 is this 4.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.720
And so to use this equation to calculate
the slope, I would say m equals

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.910
y2 which is 4, minus y1 which is 0,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.170
over x2 which is 2,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.520
minus x1, which is 0.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.530
Which is just 4 over 2, or 2,
and this makes a lot of sense.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.762
The numerator over here y2 minus y1,
well that's just the change here,

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.048
the vertical change.

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:20.700
And x2 minus x1,
that's this horizontal change.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.480
So why don't you practice now?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.280
What's the slope of a line that
goes to the points 3,2 and, 5,5.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.640
Enter your answer here, numerator and
denominator in these boxes.
