that are awesome WebSockets you may not

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
that are awesome WebSockets you may not
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.620
that are awesome WebSockets you may not
really think about this but I love this

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
really think about this but I love this
 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.720
really think about this but I love this
for live reload like insanely a lot and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
for live reload like insanely a lot and
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.680
for live reload like insanely a lot and
then there's more but I'm not going to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690
then there's more but I'm not going to
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.300
then there's more but I'm not going to
talk about them so for me when it comes

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310
talk about them so for me when it comes
 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.720
talk about them so for me when it comes
to the developing mobile web apps using

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730
to the developing mobile web apps using
 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.150
to the developing mobile web apps using
the webview it kind of comes down to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
the webview it kind of comes down to
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.650
the webview it kind of comes down to
three different things as the workflow

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660
three different things as the workflow
 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.690
three different things as the workflow
which for me is really different between

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700
which for me is really different between
 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.830
which for me is really different between
native and web apps like I yeah I'm

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
native and web apps like I yeah I'm
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.020
native and web apps like I yeah I'm
going to go into in a minute native

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
going to go into in a minute native
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.280

reasons why you're using the webview in

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700
reasons why you're using the webview in
 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.949
reasons why you're using the webview in
an app is because you want access to

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959
an app is because you want access to
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.380
an app is because you want access to
something more and then you've got

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390
something more and then you've got
 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.390
something more and then you've got
obviously the design I don't know if any

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400
obviously the design I don't know if any
 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.620

of you guys had some of the really early
Android devices but if you saw the

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970
Android devices but if you saw the
 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.520
Android devices but if you saw the
design of some of those apps they were

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
design of some of those apps they were
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.640
design of some of those apps they were
kind of cringy and I think one of the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650
kind of cringy and I think one of the
 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.710
kind of cringy and I think one of the
major things that most of the mobile

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720
major things that most of the mobile
 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.150
major things that most of the mobile
platforms have done is they've done

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
platforms have done is they've done

things together I didn't want to have to

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530
things together I didn't want to have to
 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.350
things together I didn't want to have to
sit there and have different workflows I

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360
sit there and have different workflows I
 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.939
sit there and have different workflows I
didn't want to compile and wait for this

we can actually get a nice flow going so

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099
we can actually get a nice flow going so
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:18.749
we can actually get a nice flow going so
if I show you what we've got to do so

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759
if I show you what we've got to do so
 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.890
if I show you what we've got to do so
I'm get away from this

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.620
 
No stop it there we go

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630
No stop it there we go
 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.820
No stop it there we go
so this is a standard build file so

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830
so this is a standard build file so
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.980
so this is a standard build file so
we've got things like just the Android

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990
we've got things like just the Android
 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.720
we've got things like just the Android
tasks which the Android team have put

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730
tasks which the Android team have put
 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.700

together in it it basically that is your

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710
together in it it basically that is your
 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.040
together in it it basically that is your
Android build step now you might notice

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050
Android build step now you might notice
 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.990
Android build step now you might notice
down here we have this notion of product

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000
down here we have this notion of product
 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.950
down here we have this notion of product
flavors now the way you can think of

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960
flavors now the way you can think of
 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.570
flavors now the way you can think of
product flavors the canonical example is

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580
product flavors the canonical example is
 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.400
product flavors the canonical example is
someone has a free and a paid app free

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410
someone has a free and a paid app free

here well you need to see the actual

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280
here well you need to see the actual
 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.090

thing so here we've got two applications

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100
thing so here we've got two applications
 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.980
thing so here we've got two applications
one on the Left which is just a static

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990
one on the Left which is just a static
 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.180
one on the Left which is just a static
build and then we've got nother one on

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190
build and then we've got nother one on
 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.650
build and then we've got nother one on
the right which is my live server and

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660
the right which is my live server and
 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.700
the right which is my live server and
all things willing and the network

all things willing and the network
 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.900
all things willing and the network
playing nice this will work yeah there

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910
playing nice this will work yeah there
 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.340
playing nice this will work yeah there
we go

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350
we go
 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:39.040
we go
so all I have to do it's just hit save

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050
so all I have to do it's just hit save
 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.370
so all I have to do it's just hit save
and that will go and update itself on

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380
and that will go and update itself on
 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:54.470
and that will go and update itself on
the other side

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480
 
 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.680
 
there we go now the really nice thing

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:57.690
there we go now the really nice thing
 

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.230
there we go now the really nice thing
with this is it's surprisingly simple

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240
with this is it's surprisingly simple
 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.940
with this is it's surprisingly simple
just to get set up you don't have to do

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:01.950
just to get set up you don't have to do
 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.880
just to get set up you don't have to do
anything you you are essentially

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:03.890
anything you you are essentially
 

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.900
anything you you are essentially
defining this product flavor and then

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910
defining this product flavor and then
 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.040
defining this product flavor and then
you're switching out a URL there's

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.050
you're switching out a URL there's
 

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.110
you're switching out a URL there's
nothing else beyond that and the nice

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120
nothing else beyond that and the nice
 

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.020
nothing else beyond that and the nice
thing with the static build is that when

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.030
thing with the static build is that when
 

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.630
thing with the static build is that when
I come to say I want you to build me a

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:14.640
I come to say I want you to build me a
 

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.110
I come to say I want you to build me a
brand new project down the bottom

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120
brand new project down the bottom
 

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.210
brand new project down the bottom
there's just the small couple of tasks

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220
there's just the small couple of tasks
 

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.960
there's just the small couple of tasks
and basically what we've got here is

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:22.970
and basically what we've got here is
 

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.970
and basically what we've got here is
this little beautiful piece of code here

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:25.980
this little beautiful piece of code here
 

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.160
this little beautiful piece of code here
is basically when Android studio goes

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.170
is basically when Android studio goes
 

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.690
is basically when Android studio goes
I'm gonna build your Android app now is

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:29.700
I'm gonna build your Android app now is
 

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.010
I'm gonna build your Android app now is
there anything you want me to do before

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020
there anything you want me to do before
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.200
there anything you want me to do before
I do that it will say well actually I

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.210
I do that it will say well actually I
 

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.969
I do that it will say well actually I
want you to copy my web application and

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979
want you to copy my web application and
 

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:37.400
want you to copy my web application and
then before it does that what you can

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.410
then before it does that what you can
 

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.050
then before it does that what you can
actually say is well before you copy my

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060
actually say is well before you copy my
 

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.540
actually say is well before you copy my
web application could you actually you

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:41.550
web application could you actually you
 

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.820
web application could you actually you
know maybe build it and run it with

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:43.830
know maybe build it and run it with
 

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.990
know maybe build it and run it with
grunt and essentially that's what these

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000
grunt and essentially that's what these
 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.410
grunt and essentially that's what these
two steps here are doing and the really

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420
two steps here are doing and the really
 

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.690
two steps here are doing and the really
simple little task that just say grunt

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700
simple little task that just say grunt
 

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.390
simple little task that just say grunt
build it goes and performs that task and

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:56.400
build it goes and performs that task and
 

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.490
build it goes and performs that task and
afterwards it will copy over and give

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500
afterwards it will copy over and give
 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.360
afterwards it will copy over and give
you a brand new build of your

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.370
you a brand new build of your
 

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.830
you a brand new build of your
application so for me this was an

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:03.840
application so for me this was an
 

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.200
application so for me this was an
insanely useful workflow because I've

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.210
insanely useful workflow because I've
 

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.400
insanely useful workflow because I've
seen a number of called over

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.410
seen a number of called over
 

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.200
seen a number of called over
applications and the workflow with the

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.210
applications and the workflow with the
 

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.370
applications and the workflow with the
command line interface where you kind of

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380
command line interface where you kind of
 

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.830
command line interface where you kind of
just say called over build or run

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:12.840
just say called over build or run
 

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.660
just say called over build or run
Android and it does an entire

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:14.670
Android and it does an entire
 

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:20.540
Android and it does an entire
compilation step so then once you start

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:20.550
compilation step so then once you start
 

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.580
compilation step so then once you start
combining this with dev tools which I'm

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:25.590
combining this with dev tools which I'm
 

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:41.830
combining this with dev tools which I'm
going to need to plug my phone in before

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:41.840
 
 

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.360
 
so the minute I plug in my device you

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.370
so the minute I plug in my device you
 

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.490
so the minute I plug in my device you
notice that in chrome inspect we start

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500
notice that in chrome inspect we start
 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.400
notice that in chrome inspect we start
seeing my device turn up with these two

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.410
seeing my device turn up with these two
 

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.620
seeing my device turn up with these two
blocks now basically what this

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:54.630
blocks now basically what this
 

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.300
blocks now basically what this
application is doing is displaying

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.310
application is doing is displaying
 

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.740
application is doing is displaying
webview side by side because the

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.750
webview side by side because the
 

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.480
webview side by side because the
performance is better for horizontal

00:09:59.480 --> 00:09:59.490
performance is better for horizontal
 

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.610
performance is better for horizontal
scrolling well what's really nice is as

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620
scrolling well what's really nice is as
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.170
scrolling well what's really nice is as
I start scrolling my device left and

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180
I start scrolling my device left and
 

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.940
I start scrolling my device left and
right you'll notice that the blocks very

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:07.950
right you'll notice that the blocks very
 

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.160
right you'll notice that the blocks very
helpfully start moving backwards and

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.170
helpfully start moving backwards and
 

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.330
helpfully start moving backwards and
forwards as well so nice thing with this

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.340
forwards as well so nice thing with this
 

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.490
forwards as well so nice thing with this
is now not only you getting exactly the

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500
is now not only you getting exactly the
 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.840
is now not only you getting exactly the
same experience that you get on desktop

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:19.850
same experience that you get on desktop
 

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.820
same experience that you get on desktop
but you are getting the full feature so

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:22.830
but you are getting the full feature so
 

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.770
but you are getting the full feature so
there's the obvious example that I could

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:24.780
there's the obvious example that I could
 

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.100
there's the obvious example that I could
do where I can sit there and edit slides

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.110
do where I can sit there and edit slides
 

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.960
do where I can sit there and edit slides
but the main thing that I think is

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:29.970
but the main thing that I think is
 

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.230
but the main thing that I think is
slightly more impressive if I go in here

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
slightly more impressive if I go in here
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.290
slightly more impressive if I go in here
and start saying FPS meter and you can

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300
and start saying FPS meter and you can
 

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.500
and start saying FPS meter and you can
start seeing there that we're getting a

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:39.510
start seeing there that we're getting a
 

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.850
start seeing there that we're getting a
similar sort of thing that we're used to

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860
similar sort of thing that we're used to
 

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.430
similar sort of thing that we're used to
across varying browsers well for chrome

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440
across varying browsers well for chrome
 

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.760
across varying browsers well for chrome
dev tools should I say which is insanely

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:46.770
dev tools should I say which is insanely
 

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.940
dev tools should I say which is insanely
powerful but what's even more impressive

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:49.950
powerful but what's even more impressive
 

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.520
powerful but what's even more impressive
is as I start going through when I start

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.530
is as I start going through when I start
 

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.790
is as I start going through when I start
wanting to combine different features

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800
wanting to combine different features
 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.690
wanting to combine different features
you'll realize that dev tools has

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700
you'll realize that dev tools has
 

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.120
you'll realize that dev tools has
actually started coming much more much

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.130
actually started coming much more much
 

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:05.270
actually started coming much more much
much more useful this whole build step

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.280
much more useful this whole build step
 

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.220
much more useful this whole build step
process it still works with the old

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.230
process it still works with the old
 

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.540
process it still works with the old
webview there's no difference the main

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.550
webview there's no difference the main
 

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.950
webview there's no difference the main
thing is you can't get live reload

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:09.960
thing is you can't get live reload
 

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.580
thing is you can't get live reload
because of the lack of WebSockets so the

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:13.590
because of the lack of WebSockets so the
 

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.750
because of the lack of WebSockets so the
way that I can get around that is by

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760
way that I can get around that is by
 

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.120
way that I can get around that is by
basically saying I'm going to add a

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.130
basically saying I'm going to add a
 

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.100
basically saying I'm going to add a
refresh button exactly the same that I

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.110
refresh button exactly the same that I
 

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.340
refresh button exactly the same that I
would do with basically swapping out the

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:22.350
would do with basically swapping out the
 

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:29.450
would do with basically swapping out the
URLs so yeah there is no dev tool

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:29.460
URLs so yeah there is no dev tool
 

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.520
URLs so yeah there is no dev tool
support unfortunately the old webview is

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:31.530
support unfortunately the old webview is
 

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.130
support unfortunately the old webview is
still going to exist is still not going

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140
still going to exist is still not going
 

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.740
still going to exist is still not going
to have dev tools how many of you have

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:36.750
to have dev tools how many of you have
 

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.280
to have dev tools how many of you have
heard of Winery out of interest

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.290
heard of Winery out of interest
 

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.780
heard of Winery out of interest
surprisingly large number of hands I

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:41.790
surprisingly large number of hands I
 

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.350
surprisingly large number of hands I
feel sorry for you all it is a very very

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360
feel sorry for you all it is a very very
 

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.970
feel sorry for you all it is a very very
simple way of basically debugging in

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980
simple way of basically debugging in
 

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.170
simple way of basically debugging in
browsers that don't have remote

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180
browsers that don't have remote
 

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.120
browsers that don't have remote
debugging you can get it

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.130
debugging you can get it
 

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.470
debugging you can get it
p.m. and just add in a script it's not

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480
p.m. and just add in a script it's not
 

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.449
p.m. and just add in a script it's not
ideal but it does give you like at least

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459
ideal but it does give you like at least
 

00:11:56.459 --> 00:11:59.059
ideal but it does give you like at least
something and then there's J s hi bugger

00:11:59.059 --> 00:11:59.069
something and then there's J s hi bugger
 

00:11:59.069 --> 00:12:00.949
something and then there's J s hi bugger
now if you're using Cordova application

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959
now if you're using Cordova application
 

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:02.930
now if you're using Cordova application
this is basically you can just have a

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940
this is basically you can just have a
 

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.600
this is basically you can just have a
plugin that will give you access to dev

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:05.610
plugin that will give you access to dev
 

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.610
plugin that will give you access to dev
tools and basically what it does is it

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620
tools and basically what it does is it
 

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.790
tools and basically what it does is it
rigs up the older webview in Android and

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800
rigs up the older webview in Android and
 

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.470
rigs up the older webview in Android and
basically makes it appear in chrome

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480
basically makes it appear in chrome
 

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.090
basically makes it appear in chrome
inspect and works with the chrome dev

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100
inspect and works with the chrome dev
 

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.230
inspect and works with the chrome dev
tools so you start getting a wider

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240
tools so you start getting a wider
 

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.480
tools so you start getting a wider
support of features that winery doesn't

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:17.490
support of features that winery doesn't
 

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:23.660
support of features that winery doesn't
have so we have our live reload which is

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:23.670
have so we have our live reload which is
 

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.259
have so we have our live reload which is
awesome so the next step is going to be

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:27.269
awesome so the next step is going to be
 

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:30.259
awesome so the next step is going to be
well how do I start adding features into

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:30.269
well how do I start adding features into
 

00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:38.389
well how do I start adding features into
my web application not useful so there's

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399
my web application not useful so there's
 

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.769
my web application not useful so there's
two main methods when it comes to using

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779
two main methods when it comes to using
 

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:41.900
two main methods when it comes to using
the webview and integrating native

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:41.910
the webview and integrating native
 

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.689
the webview and integrating native
features if you want to inject

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:44.699
features if you want to inject
 

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:46.370
features if you want to inject
JavaScript into the webview there's this

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380
JavaScript into the webview there's this
 

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.509
JavaScript into the webview there's this
method evaluate JavaScript and that's

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519
method evaluate JavaScript and that's
 

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.009
method evaluate JavaScript and that's
just basically the same as what you'd do

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019
just basically the same as what you'd do
 

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:53.480
just basically the same as what you'd do
if you were in a normal browser and you

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.490
if you were in a normal browser and you
 

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.970
if you were in a normal browser and you
put JavaScript colon inject whatever you

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980
put JavaScript colon inject whatever you
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.290
put JavaScript colon inject whatever you
will to get stuff out of the webview so

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300
will to get stuff out of the webview so
 

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.759
will to get stuff out of the webview so
from JavaScript to call out into native

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:01.769
from JavaScript to call out into native
 

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:03.949
from JavaScript to call out into native
code you have this method add JavaScript

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959
code you have this method add JavaScript
 

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:12.740
code you have this method add JavaScript
interface now the way this works is you

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:12.750
interface now the way this works is you
 

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.569
interface now the way this works is you
have something similar to this method

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579
have something similar to this method
 

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:20.929
have something similar to this method
here and basically a JavaScript

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:20.939
here and basically a JavaScript
 

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:23.449
here and basically a JavaScript
interface takes two methods this

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459
interface takes two methods this
 

00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:24.829
interface takes two methods this
notification bind object which is

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839
notification bind object which is
 

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:26.569
notification bind object which is
something that I've written and it's a

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579
something that I've written and it's a
 

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:28.699
something that I've written and it's a
really bare-bones JavaScript object and

00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:28.709
really bare-bones JavaScript object and
 

00:13:28.709 --> 00:13:31.100
really bare-bones JavaScript object and
I'll show you it in a minute and this

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.110
I'll show you it in a minute and this
 

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.980
I'll show you it in a minute and this
name notification interface and it's

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990
name notification interface and it's
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.499
name notification interface and it's
this name that you will use from

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:36.509
this name that you will use from
 

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:41.090
this name that you will use from
JavaScript to access it so if I go into

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100
JavaScript to access it so if I go into
 

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:50.580
JavaScript to access it so if I go into
dev tools of my device I can

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:50.590
 
 

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.950
 
let's darken stop it so if I go window

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:55.960
let's darken stop it so if I go window
 

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.700
let's darken stop it so if I go window
dot Notification interface this is where

00:13:59.700 --> 00:13:59.710
dot Notification interface this is where
 

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.860
dot Notification interface this is where
it's been injected into the webview

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:01.870
it's been injected into the webview
 

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.600
it's been injected into the webview
itself and this is how the JavaScript

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:03.610
itself and this is how the JavaScript
 

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.990
itself and this is how the JavaScript
would access it so it's just a plain old

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000
would access it so it's just a plain old
 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.769
would access it so it's just a plain old
object and you don't get any more

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:07.779
object and you don't get any more
 

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.730
object and you don't get any more
information than that now if I go into

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:11.740
information than that now if I go into
 

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.100
information than that now if I go into
the notification bind object you notice

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.110
the notification bind object you notice
 

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.000
the notification bind object you notice
there's no extending no inheritance but

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.010
there's no extending no inheritance but
 

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.310
there's no extending no inheritance but
the important part is this method here

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320
the important part is this method here
 

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.890
the important part is this method here
show notification and the annotation

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:22.900
show notification and the annotation
 

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.250
show notification and the annotation
just above it at JavaScript interface

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260
just above it at JavaScript interface
 

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.530
just above it at JavaScript interface
now the reason for that annotation is

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:28.540
now the reason for that annotation is
 

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.750
now the reason for that annotation is
basically to say I want JavaScript to be

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:30.760
basically to say I want JavaScript to be
 

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.050
basically to say I want JavaScript to be
able to call this method it came in for

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.060
able to call this method it came in for
 

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.590
able to call this method it came in for
jellybean mr2 before that if you

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600
jellybean mr2 before that if you
 

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.420
jellybean mr2 before that if you
essentially have to be a bit mindful

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.430
essentially have to be a bit mindful
 

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.890
essentially have to be a bit mindful
because before that technically

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:40.900
because before that technically
 

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.570
because before that technically
JavaScript could call random methods I'm

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:42.580
JavaScript could call random methods I'm
 

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.230
JavaScript could call random methods I'm
not intending it to so this method show

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240
not intending it to so this method show
 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.930
not intending it to so this method show
notification takes a string and a

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:48.940
notification takes a string and a
 

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.820
notification takes a string and a
message and the main idea behind this is

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:52.830
message and the main idea behind this is
 

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:59.280
message and the main idea behind this is
if I get rid of my beautiful FPS meter

00:14:59.280 --> 00:14:59.290
if I get rid of my beautiful FPS meter
 

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.110
if I get rid of my beautiful FPS meter
so the idea with this is that when I

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120
so the idea with this is that when I
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.940
so the idea with this is that when I
hear this show notification button which

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:05.950
hear this show notification button which
 

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.550
hear this show notification button which
you can just about see you'll notice

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560
you can just about see you'll notice
 

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.050
you can just about see you'll notice
there's a little chrome icon that's just

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:10.060
there's a little chrome icon that's just
 

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.690
there's a little chrome icon that's just
appeared up on the top it just says

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:12.700
appeared up on the top it just says
 

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.020
appeared up on the top it just says
chrome dev summit you're awesome

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.030
chrome dev summit you're awesome
 

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.150
chrome dev summit you're awesome
so the really nice thing with what we've

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160
so the really nice thing with what we've
 

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.070
so the really nice thing with what we've
got in dev tools is I don't actually

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.080
got in dev tools is I don't actually
 

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.250
got in dev tools is I don't actually
have to have the JavaScript be executing

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:23.260
have to have the JavaScript be executing
 

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.570
have to have the JavaScript be executing
these native methods I can do it

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:24.580
these native methods I can do it
 

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:38.160
these native methods I can do it
directly from here

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.170
 
 

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.750
 
and there is the new notification now

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:42.760
and there is the new notification now
 

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.740
and there is the new notification now
that's a really nice way of working

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:44.750
that's a really nice way of working
 

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.510
that's a really nice way of working
because if you've got essentially one

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:46.520
because if you've got essentially one
 

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.550
because if you've got essentially one
part of your team building the native

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560
part of your team building the native
 

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.720
part of your team building the native
component and you're focusing on the

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:49.730
component and you're focusing on the
 

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.550
component and you're focusing on the
website and they kind of turn around

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560
website and they kind of turn around
 

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.690
website and they kind of turn around
they go hey I've just done this this is

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:52.700
they go hey I've just done this this is
 

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.210
they go hey I've just done this this is
cool can you check this out you don't

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.220
cool can you check this out you don't
 

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.250
cool can you check this out you don't
need to be worrying about whether you've

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:57.260
need to be worrying about whether you've
 

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.600
need to be worrying about whether you've
got script to run this you can basically

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:58.610
got script to run this you can basically
 

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.740
got script to run this you can basically
just sit there and do it there and then

00:15:59.740 --> 00:15:59.750
just sit there and do it there and then
 

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.090
just sit there and do it there and then
from dev tools the only thing you need

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:01.100
from dev tools the only thing you need
 

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:16.690
from dev tools the only thing you need
is the webview running in terms of the

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:16.700
is the webview running in terms of the
 

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.830
is the webview running in terms of the
old webview I keep on clicking this in

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:20.840
old webview I keep on clicking this in
 

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.230
old webview I keep on clicking this in
terms of the old webview there is no

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240
terms of the old webview there is no
 

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.260
terms of the old webview there is no
evaluate JavaScript method so you have

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:26.270
evaluate JavaScript method so you have
 

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.540
evaluate JavaScript method so you have
to use load URL JavaScript : the main

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:28.550
to use load URL JavaScript : the main
 

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.800
to use load URL JavaScript : the main
reason you'd want to use evaluate

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:29.810
reason you'd want to use evaluate
 

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.330
reason you'd want to use evaluate
JavaScript rather than the old method in

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:31.340
JavaScript rather than the old method in
 

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.710
JavaScript rather than the old method in
the new webview is actually faster

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720
the new webview is actually faster
 

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.680
the new webview is actually faster
because basically the webview is is

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:35.690
because basically the webview is is
 

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.480
because basically the webview is is
expecting JavaScript it's gonna pass it

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:37.490
expecting JavaScript it's gonna pass it
 

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.000
expecting JavaScript it's gonna pass it
slightly differently kind of think of it

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.010
slightly differently kind of think of it
 

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.790
slightly differently kind of think of it
as a fast path and the other one is

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800
as a fast path and the other one is
 

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.660

obviously the minute you start using

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:43.670
obviously the minute you start using
 

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.750
obviously the minute you start using
native features it needs to be pointed

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:46.760
native features it needs to be pointed
 

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.860
native features it needs to be pointed
out the fact that you're gonna be

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:47.870
out the fact that you're gonna be
 

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.880
out the fact that you're gonna be
running on different versions of Android

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:48.890
running on different versions of Android
 

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.240
running on different versions of Android
stuff comes and goes so you just need to

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.250
stuff comes and goes so you just need to
 

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.740
stuff comes and goes so you just need to
be aware of that like Android studio is

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:53.750
be aware of that like Android studio is
 

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.360
be aware of that like Android studio is
very good at just pointing these kind of

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.370
very good at just pointing these kind of
 

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.420
very good at just pointing these kind of
things out as well as that there's also

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:58.430
things out as well as that there's also
 

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.160
things out as well as that there's also
a webview samples that I've just put a

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.170
a webview samples that I've just put a
 

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.230
a webview samples that I've just put a
link down at the bottom for and that has

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240
link down at the bottom for and that has
 

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.880
link down at the bottom for and that has
examples of doing all of this as well as

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:03.890
examples of doing all of this as well as
 

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.280
examples of doing all of this as well as
shimming out the loading of JavaScript

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:06.290
shimming out the loading of JavaScript
 

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:15.400
shimming out the loading of JavaScript
etc so we have a workflow where we've

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.410
etc so we have a workflow where we've
 

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.730
etc so we have a workflow where we've
got live reload working and we have

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:18.740
got live reload working and we have
 

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.439
got live reload working and we have
access to native features and we have

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:20.449
access to native features and we have
 

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:22.210
access to native features and we have
access to dev tools so now we've got a

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.220
access to dev tools so now we've got a
 

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.100
access to dev tools so now we've got a
nice environment where I can sit and

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.110
nice environment where I can sit and
 

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.980
nice environment where I can sit and

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:26.990
code in my text editor I can then debug
 

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.410
code in my text editor I can then debug
it with dev tools and it's quite a nice

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:29.420
it with dev tools and it's quite a nice
 

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.970
it with dev tools and it's quite a nice
flow we've got similar to what we'd have

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:30.980
flow we've got similar to what we'd have
 

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.600
flow we've got similar to what we'd have
on desktop so the next step is what

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:34.610
on desktop so the next step is what
 

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.860
on desktop so the next step is what
should we be concerned about when it

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:35.870
should we be concerned about when it
 

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.150
should we be concerned about when it

for me the biggest risk with Web Apps is

for me the biggest risk with Web Apps is
 

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.330
for me the biggest risk with Web Apps is
generally that they fall into that

uncanny valley approach of well I'm
going to imitate the native platform

going to imitate the native platform
 

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.789

can't use the native components and do

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:32.990
want to get rid of the orange outline as
 

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:38.790
want to get rid of the orange outline as
well we just need to set outline to zero

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:38.800
 
 

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:47.180
 
go on update

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.190
 
 

00:20:47.190 --> 00:21:04.900
 
so I know why

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:04.910
 
 

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:10.480
 
right this time of library logo so it's

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:10.490
right this time of library logo so it's
 

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.610
right this time of library logo so it's
just two simple things but now you can

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:12.620
just two simple things but now you can
 

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.010
just two simple things but now you can
see that the state just it just does

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.020
see that the state just it just does
 

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.130
see that the state just it just does
nothing which is exactly what we want

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:17.140
nothing which is exactly what we want
 

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:22.930
nothing which is exactly what we want
from that you just need to do don't know

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:22.940
from that you just need to do don't know
 

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.410
from that you just need to do don't know
state one active so the key here is just

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:26.420
state one active so the key here is just
 

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.810
state one active so the key here is just
the active state set background color

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:28.820
the active state set background color
 

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:41.080
the active state set background color
I'm gonna go for blue so come on now of

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.090
I'm gonna go for blue so come on now of
 

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:46.430
I'm gonna go for blue so come on now of
course

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440
 
 

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.860
 
yep so grunt should be taking care of us

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:48.870
yep so grunt should be taking care of us
 

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.270
yep so grunt should be taking care of us
ass there we go so we've got state now

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280
ass there we go so we've got state now
 

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.070
ass there we go so we've got state now
who things are done who can say what's

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080
who things are done who can say what's
 

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.130
who things are done who can say what's
missing anyone so the trick here is if I

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140
missing anyone so the trick here is if I
 

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.570
missing anyone so the trick here is if I
go and touch this button and hold it

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580
go and touch this button and hold it
 

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.040
go and touch this button and hold it
I get that beautiful little nugget now I

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.050
I get that beautiful little nugget now I
 

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.170
I get that beautiful little nugget now I
won't say you should blanket disabled

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:15.180
won't say you should blanket disabled
 

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.760
won't say you should blanket disabled
users select because there's a number of

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:16.770
users select because there's a number of
 

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.870
users select because there's a number of
cases like if that was a phone number

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880
cases like if that was a phone number
 

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.320
cases like if that was a phone number
copy and paste is kind of cool it's a

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:21.330
copy and paste is kind of cool it's a
 

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.510
copy and paste is kind of cool it's a
text button that I really wouldn't want

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520
text button that I really wouldn't want
 

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.760
text button that I really wouldn't want
that to be there so the simple fix for

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:28.770
that to be there so the simple fix for
 

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:33.200
that to be there so the simple fix for
that is users select none so when that

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.210
that is users select none so when that
 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:45.020
that is users select none so when that
updates there we go nothing now I don't

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.030
updates there we go nothing now I don't
 

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.760
updates there we go nothing now I don't
know about you guys but that kind of

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:46.770
know about you guys but that kind of
 

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.590
know about you guys but that kind of
makes me a bit sad the fact that I have

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600
makes me a bit sad the fact that I have
 

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.920
makes me a bit sad the fact that I have
to disable one prefix thing one outline

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:51.930
to disable one prefix thing one outline
 

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.560
to disable one prefix thing one outline
and then implement something completely

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.570
and then implement something completely
 

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.990
and then implement something completely
different and then also handle the fact

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000
different and then also handle the fact
 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.550
different and then also handle the fact
that I don't want the user to copy and

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:58.560
that I don't want the user to copy and
 

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.580
that I don't want the user to copy and
paste it to basically match a native

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:01.590

button at the same time it kind of

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200
button at the same time it kind of
 

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.810
button at the same time it kind of
sounds a bit laborious to pay this

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820
sounds a bit laborious to pay this
 

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.020
sounds a bit laborious to pay this
amount of minut details or something but

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.030
amount of minut details or something but
 

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.020

you do it once you're there you're good

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.030
you do it once you're there you're good
 

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.160
you do it once you're there you're good
and you only do it for the components

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:16.170
and you only do it for the components
 

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.150
and you only do it for the components
that you have in your web app and

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:17.160
that you have in your web app and
 

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.430
that you have in your web app and
ultimately I want frameworks to start

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440
ultimately I want frameworks to start
 

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.960
ultimately I want frameworks to start
just basically implementing exactly this

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:20.970
just basically implementing exactly this
 

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.090
just basically implementing exactly this
kind of same thing because it's it's

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100
kind of same thing because it's it's
 

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.100
kind of same thing because it's it's
essentially really really small little

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:25.110
essentially really really small little
 

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.570
essentially really really small little
nuggets of things that I see a number of

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580
nuggets of things that I see a number of
 

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.810
nuggets of things that I see a number of
developers do and it's quite a simple

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820
developers do and it's quite a simple
 

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:35.270
developers do and it's quite a simple
fix and the other thing that I kind of

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280
fix and the other thing that I kind of
 

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.950
fix and the other thing that I kind of
wanted to talk about was to kind of

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960
wanted to talk about was to kind of
 

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.990
wanted to talk about was to kind of
reinforce this notion of not trying to

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000
reinforce this notion of not trying to
 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.330
reinforce this notion of not trying to
imitate native like we've all seen web

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340
imitate native like we've all seen web
 

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.490
imitate native like we've all seen web
trends like it's kind of one of the

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500
trends like it's kind of one of the
 

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.230
trends like it's kind of one of the
great things about the web in general if

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240
great things about the web in general if
 

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.580
great things about the web in general if
someone comes up with this beautiful

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:46.590
someone comes up with this beautiful
 

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.690
someone comes up with this beautiful
design and then we start seeing other

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700
design and then we start seeing other
 

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.340
design and then we start seeing other
designers be inspired by it and

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.350
designers be inspired by it and
 

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.400
designers be inspired by it and
producing similar kind of things and for

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:52.410
producing similar kind of things and for
 

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.370
producing similar kind of things and for
me native apps don't move in terms of

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:55.380
me native apps don't move in terms of
 

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.920
me native apps don't move in terms of
trends as fast as the web so why try and

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:57.930
trends as fast as the web so why try and
 

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.050
trends as fast as the web so why try and
imitate native why not just keep this

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:00.060
imitate native why not just keep this
 

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.240
imitate native why not just keep this
going but actually bring it to native

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:02.250
going but actually bring it to native
 

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.690
going but actually bring it to native
platforms for me this is what I want to

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700
platforms for me this is what I want to
 

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.460
platforms for me this is what I want to
see Web Apps do take the things that

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:07.470
see Web Apps do take the things that
 

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.930
see Web Apps do take the things that
work and make sense and then bring them

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940
work and make sense and then bring them
 

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.360
work and make sense and then bring them
into mobile apps and show native apps

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.370
into mobile apps and show native apps
 

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.190
into mobile apps and show native apps
the kind of things that the web is great

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200
the kind of things that the web is great
 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:23.630
the kind of things that the web is great
at so that's kind of what I wanted to

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640
at so that's kind of what I wanted to
 

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.310
at so that's kind of what I wanted to
talk about was this notion of having a

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320
talk about was this notion of having a
 

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.770
talk about was this notion of having a
nice build process where you can have

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780
nice build process where you can have
 

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.690
nice build process where you can have
live reload you don't have to sit in

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700
live reload you don't have to sit in
 

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.370
live reload you don't have to sit in
Android studio and constantly keep on

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380
Android studio and constantly keep on
 

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.170
Android studio and constantly keep on
compiling you can have native features

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:35.180
compiling you can have native features
 

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.520
compiling you can have native features
using the inject JavaScript as well as a

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:39.530
using the inject JavaScript as well as a
 

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:44.090
using the inject JavaScript as well as a
JavaScript interface and then we've kind

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100
JavaScript interface and then we've kind
 

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.520
JavaScript interface and then we've kind
of covered design and for me it's one of

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:46.530
of covered design and for me it's one of
 

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.230
of covered design and for me it's one of
those things that from those three

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240
those things that from those three
 

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.880
those things that from those three
things it should be simple enough to

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:49.890
things it should be simple enough to
 

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.530
things it should be simple enough to
actually get going something that didn't

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:51.540
actually get going something that didn't
 

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.210

there's two things that I want you to

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200
there's two things that I want you to
 

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.070
there's two things that I want you to
really remember the first one is this

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080
really remember the first one is this
 

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.370

anything lower than 19 you basically put
 

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.250
anything lower than 19 you basically put
the webview into a compatibility mode so

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260
the webview into a compatibility mode so
 

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.070

important one way or the other it's
 

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.330
important one way or the other it's
still the predominant version like

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340
still the predominant version like
 

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.039

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580
Android devices so unfortunately you
 

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.159
Android devices so unfortunately you
still have to kind of support it unless

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:46.169
still have to kind of support it unless
 

00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:47.720

which I wouldn't blame you if you did

00:26:49.659 --> 00:26:49.669
which I wouldn't blame you if you did

which I wouldn't blame you if you did
and I think at the moment updates are

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:53.370
and I think at the moment updates are
 

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.799
and I think at the moment updates are
still tied to Android releases with the

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:54.809
still tied to Android releases with the
 

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:58.220
still tied to Android releases with the
new webview and generally everyone in

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:58.230

the team wants this to move to auto
 

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.260
the team wants this to move to auto
updating we kind of see it as kind of

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:03.270
updating we kind of see it as kind of
 

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.970
updating we kind of see it as kind of
the one thing that we really want to

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980
the one thing that we really want to
 

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.159
the one thing that we really want to
change we just need to figure out how

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:07.169
change we just need to figure out how
 

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:09.110
change we just need to figure out how
we're going to do it because basically

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120
we're going to do it because basically
 

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.460
we're going to do it because basically
the webview is part of the android

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:10.470
the webview is part of the android
 

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.080
the webview is part of the android
framework and nothing at the moment

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.090
framework and nothing at the moment
 

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.169
framework and nothing at the moment
changes itself so we're trying to figure

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179
changes itself so we're trying to figure
 

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:19.220
changes itself so we're trying to figure
out how we can do it and the other thing

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:19.230
out how we can do it and the other thing
 

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.440
out how we can do it and the other thing
is the chrome apps team are actually

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.450
is the chrome apps team are actually
 

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.330
is the chrome apps team are actually
bringing in a lot of the chrome apps

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340
bringing in a lot of the chrome apps
 

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.850
bringing in a lot of the chrome apps
api's to called over as plugins so it'll

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860
api's to called over as plugins so it'll
 

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.620
api's to called over as plugins so it'll
be interesting to see what happens with

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:30.630
be interesting to see what happens with
 

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.539
be interesting to see what happens with
the usage of that if you've got a chrome

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:32.549
the usage of that if you've got a chrome
 

00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:34.520
the usage of that if you've got a chrome
app already that you're relying on

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:34.530
app already that you're relying on
 

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.779
