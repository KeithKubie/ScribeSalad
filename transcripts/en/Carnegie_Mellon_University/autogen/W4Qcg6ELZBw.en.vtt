a piece of furniture that would attach
to the human body and so that could

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
to the human body and so that could
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.080
to the human body and so that could
extend out and he could walk

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

in that way and bring it to something

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
in that way and bring it to something
