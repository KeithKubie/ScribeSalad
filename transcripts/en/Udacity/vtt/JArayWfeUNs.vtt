00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.290
So now that we have seen that
the increasing block size can result in

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.820
reduction in the miss rate.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.490
Let's see if we understood
what's going on.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.260
So when we increase the block size,
and the locality is good.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.820
So the miss rate goes down,
the question for

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.100
you is which types of
the misses are reduced?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.750
The compulsory misses, the capacity
misses, or the conflict misses?
