we got to see like the different
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.710
we got to see like the different
chemical reactions and like what

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720
chemical reactions and like what
 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.240
chemical reactions and like what
temperatures at work like the reactions

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
temperatures at work like the reactions
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.380
