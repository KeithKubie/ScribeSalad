00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is the second choice. The evaluator needs to try decrypting each of these.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It knows one of the a values and one of the b values, but it doesn't know which one it knows.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The ones that aren't correct--well, it's going to have the wrong key.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's going to decrypt some message and it won't start with this pad.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That needs to have enough bits--so the chances it would start with this pad

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
if it is not the right key would be vanishingly small.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the one where it does have the right keys will decrypt to the pad and the correct output value.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And that's the value--that's the output for that gate.
