00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:02.860
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, everyone,
for coming.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.090
It's my pleasure to introduce DT
Max today to talk about, in

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.080
my opinion, one of the best
writers of the generation,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.645
David Foster Wallace, who as
you presumably know is the

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.850
author of "Infinite Jest," "The
Broom of the System,"

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.715
"Oblivion," "A Supposedly
Wonderful Thing I'll Never Do

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.430
Again," a handful of other
somewhat seminal works of the

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.110
late 20th century.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.950
It would be a bit of a Herculean
task to document his

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.250
life in such an enthusiastic
and exhaustively researched

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.170
fashion, but I think, as Dave
Eggers, put it, we should feel

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.520
grateful that this story was
told by someone as talented

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.680
and as responsible as D.
T. Max, which I agree.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.540
So, ladies and gentlemen,
DT Max.

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:50.860
DT MAX: Thanks very much, Chris,
and thanks to Google

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.080
for bringing me here, actually
just from Stanford, where I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.620
have a fellowship this week.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.735
Can everybody hear OK?

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:02.180
We're all good on that front?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.069
So I don't know how much you
all know about David Foster

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.330
Wallace, but I'm going to work
on the basis that you at least

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.470
know something if you're here,
because there's lots of other

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.360
places that you could also
be at this hour.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.650
And I'm aware that we have
exactly one hour--

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.560
is that right--

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.710
and that you all will begin to
sort of bleed away at five of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.260
for your next place
you have to be.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.600
So, Wallace, author of Infinite
Jest as Chris said--

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.210
brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant novelist.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.040
I'm going to read you a short
section from the book, and I'm

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.350
going to do that just so you
get sort of a sense of my

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.150
approach to biography, which
is maybe a little bit

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.170
different than what
you might expect.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.320
And this section I'm going to
read to you is from when David

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.880
is 29 years old and he's not yet
the world famous author of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.540
Infinite Jest.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.980
He's, in fact, the kind of
beaten up, tired, and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.190
exhausted kind of failed
graduate student in Cambridge,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.850
Massachusetts.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.490
What happens is that David, he
grows up in the Midwest in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.040
Champaign Urbana.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.290
His father is a professor of
philosophy, his mother is a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.680
really, really, really over
qualified teacher at Parkland

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.090
Community College.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.250
She's an English teacher.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.010
English is a foreign language,
I think, primarily.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.960
But she is certainly as big a
talent as David's father was,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.290
just in a smaller stage.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.480
And David is pretty easily and
pretty quickly noticed in

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.630
Urbana as one of the
smarter kids

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.655
around, but not the smartest.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.940
He does not graduate at
the top of his class.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.310
In fact, he grows smarter
and smarter,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.480
and he goes to college.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.400
He goes to Amherst where
his father went.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.230
And David begins to have both
enormous academic success and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.190
enormous emotional problems
sort of at the same time.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.680
I suppose most of you probably
know that David committed

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.770
suicide in 2008.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.220
He had a lifelong depression,
which was treated successfully

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.750
for part of his life.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.560
And at the very end of his
life, because he wasn't

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.690
writing well anymore, he decided
to go off of the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.990
antidepressant that he'd been on
for about 20 years, and was

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.720
never able to kind
of restabilize.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.460
Treating depression is, in a lot
of ways, I think, more an

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.380
art than a science.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.670
But that's all later.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.950
Right now, David has published
an early work, which Chris

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.540
says is the only book of
Wallace's he has not read

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.480
called "Broom of the System."
That's David's first novel,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.180
which I absolutely adore, so
we'll have to quarrel over

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.820
that afterward with
the cameras off.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.840
Then he writes a book called
"Girl with Curious Hair,"

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.170
which is absolutely fascinating,
almost academic

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.390
approach to postmodernist
fiction, an

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.590
attempt understand why--

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.760
well, what postmodernist
fiction is is

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.010
the fiction of Pynchon.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.100
You guys have this extreme
reading thing going on?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.350
A lot of your extreme reading
type people--

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.310
and Pynchon and your Richard
Powers and John Barth and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.340
Donald Barthelme.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.250
Anyway, David has an enormous
success with that first book

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.380
when he's still in
graduate school.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.205
And the second book does
nothing at all.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.540
It basically completely
disappears.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.160
It throws David into a crisis,
because the only thing that

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.350
worries David Foster Wallace
more than success is failure.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.740
And so David winds up--

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.300
really, partially for self
medication and partially, I

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.110
think, because he's so
disappointed in what's going

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.900
on with his writing--
becoming both an

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.830
alcoholic and a pot addict.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.340
He's only been a pot addict
since high school, really, and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.460
it's essentially a form of self
medication, I would say.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.240
But he winds up unable
to write anymore.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.470
He's written the second book
and the second book is

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.300
brilliant, but it also
sort of closes--

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.640
it's hard to explain--

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.920
all the possible doors
in fiction for him.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.230
David feels he's written the
last thing he needs to write.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.580
So at the age of 29,
unfortunately, he's a writer

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.300
who no longer has anything
he wants to write.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.340
It's a very uncomfortable
position.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.630
And he decides to
change careers.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.640
And being the smartest guy in
any room, he decides he's

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.610
going to become a philosophy
professor, but

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.760
he's going to Harvard.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.520
Even though he's been out of
school for like seven or eight

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.940
years, or at least out of
undergraduate life, he's going

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.520
to go and be a philosophy
professor.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.410
And he goes to Harvard.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.120
And Harvard philosophy classes
are like boot camp.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.490
I mean, graduate school there is
as difficult as med school.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.760
And David is no longer a guy
with the focus, and this is a

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.550
guy who is both an addict
and a writer-- two lousy

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.802
preparations for graduate
school, if you ask me.

00:05:28.802 --> 00:05:30.350
I don't know which
one is worse.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.510
And so poor David lasts
all of three weeks.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.010
And being a very smart guy--

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.830
all this book comes out of
originally a "New Yorker"

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.030
piece I wrote shortly after
David's death in 2008.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.130
And at that time, I had thought
that David had--

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.440
basically, he goes to the
Harvard Health Services and

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.795
announces that he's thinking
of committing suicide.

00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:51.130
I mean, he had tried to commit
suicide earlier.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.780
It was a very credible threat.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.600
And at that point, it activates
a series of

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.490
protocols and David is whisked
away from Harvard to McLean

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.820
Psychiatric Hospital, which is a
Harvard associated facility.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.760
And I kid you not, if David
had to go to a psychiatric

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.180
facility, it had
to be Harvard.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.970
He would accept nothing
but the best.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.140
And so he goes in and of course,
of three days from

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.070
being a Harvard philosophy
student-- a failed Harvard

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.680
philosophy student, really--

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.350
to a resident of McLean,
where he dries out.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.180
And after about a month at
McLean, he's fully expecting

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.590
to go back and be a Harvard
philosophy student, because

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.730
it's all Harvard, right?

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.330
It's like, why not?

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.840
But it turns out they're not
going to let him go back--

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.200
that if he's serious about
kicking his addiction, he's

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.460
got to go to a halfway house.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.270
And a halfway house is basically
a facility--

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.760
they're strange facilities.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.450
They're usually paid
for by the state,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.330
sometimes by insurance.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.940
But the main goal there is to
achieve a mindset where when

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.530
you go back out in the world,
you're no longer an addict.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.340
So David winds up at a halfway
house called Granada House,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.370
and that's what I'm going
to read you from.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.050
And since there seems to be no
flat surface here, I"m going

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.000
to put this over here.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
That won't work.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.350
All right.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.070
So here we are--

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.460
David's 28, he's a failed
author, he doesn't know what

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.590
to write anymore, and he
goes to a very, very

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.960
rough halfway house.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.690
Anyone who has read "Infinite
Jest" will recognize

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.290
immediately the halfway house
is fictionalized.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.030
It really takes up almost
half of "Infinite Jest."

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.970
Let me check the time.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.350
All right-- we're good.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.850
Grenada House was on the grounds
of the Brighton Marine

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.770
Hospital, near the Massachusetts
Turnpike.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.710
Wallace found it funny that
a Marine hospital would be

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.170
nowhere near water.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.520
The compound consisted
of seven buildings--

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.950
seven moons orbiting a dead
planet, as he would later

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.820
describe it in "Infinite Jest",
all leased to various

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.370
substance abuse groups.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.330
Wallace met Deb Larson,
the director, at his

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.540
new temporary home.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.010
Tall and blonde, she
walked with a limp.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.200
Drunk, she had fallen in her
kitchen, hitting her head,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.180
causing a partial paralysis.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.910
Even then, she hadn't
stopped drinking.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.430
Wallace respected and liked
her immediately.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.530
She was pretty and smart, and
gave him a link to an old life

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.130
that was still his present.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.980
You could almost see Harvard
from the top

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.620
floor of the building.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:02.753
And it's true.

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:03.600
I've been to where--

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.420
the halfway house has moved, but
if you go to the halfway

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.550
house, it is really just across
the Charles River from

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.610
everything that David
held dear.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.560
And you sense how bizarre it
would be for him to have sort

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.870
of gone from one to the
other in a month.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.290
Recovery facilities tried to
control the stress levels of

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.040
their participants, and one
activity that they generally

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.700
prohibited was school.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.940
Wallace had no choice but to
call the philosophy department

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.180
at Harvard and ask for
a leave of absence.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.380
He was too humiliated to go
back and get the vegetable

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.870
juicer, a gift from his mother,
that he had left

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.870
behind in the department
office.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.419
Now he was expected to
find low level work.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.000
Wallace, whose only experience
was essentially teaching and

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.480
writing, cast around and was
able, probably thanks to the

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.870
presence of the head of Amherst
College Security on

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.630
his resume, to get hired as a
guard at Lotus Development, a

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.730
large software company.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.000
Anyone remember Lotus?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.620
Lotus people?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.860
OK.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.140
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.070
Granada House rules stipulated
a 40 hour work week, so

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.580
Wallace got up at 4:30 in the
morning to take the Green Line

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.110
and worked until 2:00 PM,
walking a vast disk packaging

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.990
plant in Lechmere, clocking in
his whereabouts every 10

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.220
minutes and twirling his baton,
or so he later said.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.110
Actually I don't think David
ever did this, but it's in the

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.710
letters he wrote.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.380
What I think he actually did,
because there are other

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.110
letters that he wrote,
which I was given--

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.070
I think what he actually is sat
in a chair and watched a

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.730
video monitor, just like every
other security guard that

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.770
you've ever seen.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.570
But for David, it was all about
sort of fictionalizing

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.220
the experience, as
you'll find out.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.760
And for him, it was far more
kind of appealing that he

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.040
would be a character out of,
really, a Keystone Cops movie,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.010
twirling his baton and punching
in the clock, but I

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.540
don't think he did it.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.920
He would tear pages out of his
notebook and send letters to

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.140
his friends, maintaining contact
with a small group of

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.150
editors and writers who
were vital to him.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.860
The Lotus experience, he
recalled in a later interview,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.410
reminded him of every
bad '60s novel

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.415
about meaningless authority.

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:52.830
You guys are reading
"Catch-22,"

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.620
right, in this group?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.490
So there's your--

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.340
not a bad situation.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.890
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.460
But at the time, he bore
it exceptionally well.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.880
Give me a little time to get
used to no recreational

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.510
materials, and wearing a
polyester uniform, and living

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.970
with four tattooed ex-cons, and
I'll be right as rain, he

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.840
wrote a friend with ironic
brio shortly after.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.750
But in his heart,
he was stunned.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.020
I am, he wrote one of his
Amherst professors, OK, though

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.425
very humiliated and confused.

00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:24.220
He was sharing a barracks-like
room with four men, one of

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.505
whom, he wrote, Rich C., had had
a stroke while on cocaine

00:10:26.505 --> 00:10:28.390
and had a withered right side.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.260
Mr. Howard, he

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.540
Told his editor at WW Norton,
the book publisher, everyone

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.670
here has a tattoo or a criminal
record or both.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.110
To his professor, he reported,
most of the guys in the house

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.990
are inmates on release.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.230
And while they're basically
decent folk, it's just not a

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.120
crowd I'm much at home with.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.240
Heavy metal music, black
t-shirts and Harleys, vivid

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.350
tattoos, discussion of hard
versus soft time, parole

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.350
boards, gunshot wounds, and
Walpole, Massachusetts

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.700
toughest prison.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.980
One of my examples of the fact
that David was always a

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.940
writer, even in this moment
when he's just absolutely

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.020
destitute is these letters that
he wrote from the halfway

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.750
house are amazing.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.820
And I love the fact that in
writing this letter, he

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.010
bothers to put in the word
"vivid" for vivid tattoos.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.540
Now that's a writer,
no matter what.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.340
If the tattoo looked a certain
way, he had to tell

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.610
everybody about it.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.000
Wallace continued at his
security job for more than two

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.180
months, and then unable
to bear getting up

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.980
so early, he quit.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.030
He went to work as a front desk
attendant at the Mount

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.100
Auburn Club, a health club
at nearby Watertown.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.440
His job was to check
members in.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.850
He called himself a glorified
towel boy.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.560
But one day, Michael Ryan,
a poet who had received a

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.580
Whiting Award alongside
him two years

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.240
before, came in to exercise.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.390
Wallace dove below the
reception desk and

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.420
quit the same day.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.510
His friends were accustomed
to his exaggerations and

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.250
inventions over the years that
came with his clownish,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.900
hyperbolic personality.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.420
But when they visited him at the
halfway house, they found

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.700
that what he had said
was actually true.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.830
He had stepped through
the looking-glass.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.990
His friend, Debra Spark, a
fiction writer, remembers

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.800
sitting in on a group therapy
session with Wallace one day,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.250
being amazed to hear someone
recount killing someone else

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.620
while drunk.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.360
All the same, Wallace
found his place.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.250
Order, no matter how foreign the
context, was always easier

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.500
for him than the unstructured
world that lay outside.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.210
He met with a counselor, and
nearly every evening, he drove

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.050
to a different part of the city
with other halfway house

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.430
members for substance
abuse meetings.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.250
His sponsor was named Jimmy,
a motorhead from the South

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.170
Shores, Wallace called
him in a letter.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.260
And Wallace read "The Big Book,"
the founding text of

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.250
Alcoholics Anonymous, and
enjoyed making fun of its

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.000
cheesy 1930s ad man vocabulary
to his friends.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.470
Tosspot.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.040
Dave Sheen heels.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.730
Boiled as an owl.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.670
He laughed at them, but he also
knew he needed them, or

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.120
he would die, Mark
Costello, his

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.870
college roommate, remembers.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.480
And if Wallace found himself in
unfamiliar territory, the

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.670
residents didn't know what
to make of him either.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.830
One remembers wondering,
this guy could

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.480
probably go to Betty Ford.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.760
Why is he here with
us welfare babies?

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.700
No one really cared for
his cleverness.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.250
He was, to them, a type they'd
seen before, someone who, as

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.942
Wallace would later write in
"Infinite Jest," tries to

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:08.190
erect denial-type fortifications
with some kind

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.260
of intellectualish
showing off.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.740
Wallace was back in high school,
trying to figure out

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.170
his place in the pack.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.190
It's a rough crowd, he wrote his
old Arizona sponsor, and

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.390
sometimes I'm scared or
feel superior or both.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.630
Yet a piece of him
was beginning to

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.290
adjust to the new situation.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.310
He remembered his last failed
attempt to get sober and how

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.110
he was no longer writing, and
asked himself what was it he

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.570
had to lose?

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.510
He came to understand that the
key this time was modesty.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.600
He knew it was imperative to
abandon the sense of himself

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.070
as the smartest person in the
room, a person too smart to be

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.390
like one of the people in the
room because he was one of the

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.650
people in the room.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.430
I try hard to listen and do what
they say, he wrote Rich

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.450
C. I'm trying to do it easy
this time, not get an A+.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.825
I just don't have enough gas
right now to do anything fast

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:56.870
or well, and I'm trying
to accept this.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.530
Not that things came easily.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.410
The simple aphorisms of
the program seemed

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.860
ridiculous to him.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.250
And if he objected to them,
someone inevitably answered

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.190
him with another, telling him,
for example, to do what was in

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.990
front of him to do, or to take
it one day at a time, driving

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.390
him even crazier.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.650
He was astonished to find people
talking about a higher

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.550
power without any evidence
beyond their wish that there

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.650
should be one.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.030
They got down on their
knees and said the

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.200
thankfulness prayer.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.230
Wallace tried once at Granada
House, he had told his friend

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.980
Mark Costello, but it
felt hypocritical.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.770
All the same, he liked to
quote one of the veteran

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.630
recovery members, the group
known in "Infinite Jest" as

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.370
the Crocodiles, who used to say,
it's not about whether or

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.740
not you believe, asshole, it's
about getting down on your

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.240
knees and asking.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.820
There were many times when he
was sure he would start

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.310
drinking again.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.750
I'm scared, he wrote his
old Arizona sponsor.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.150
I still don't know what's
going to happen.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.340
He asked his friend for some
words of encouragement, and

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.855
just when he thought he would
give up, a letter arrived in

00:14:52.855 --> 00:14:55.280
which his former sponsor
recounted the last time he'd

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.830
been detox.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.860
They gave me Librium,
he wrote.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.420
And I threw them over my left
shoulder for luck, and I've

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.200
had good luck ever since.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.000
The image, Wallace wrote his
sponsor years later in thanks,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.900
was just the good MFA-caliber
trope I needed.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.565
Stunned as he was, Wallace
understood from the beginning

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:16.160
that his fall from grace was
also a literary opportunity.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.810
He had been hypothesizing
beforehand about a nation

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.710
enthralled to its appetites, and
here he was living among

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.970
its casualties.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.010
So in the midst of his misery,
he was alive to the new

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.920
information that
he was getting.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.230
The communal house, he would
later write in "Infinite

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.570
Jest," reeks of passing time.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.990
It is the humidity of early

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.440
sobriety, hanging and palpable.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.920
Wallace was known for sitting
quietly, listening as

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.320
residents talked for hours about
their lives and their

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.300
addictions.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.400
Later, residents would often
be surprised to find that

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.260
though he had heard their
stories, they had not

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.510
actually heard his.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.430
This was the sort of access to
interior lives that a novelist

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.470
could not get elsewhere.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.260
And I always think of, there's
a story about Vladimir

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.240
Nabokov-- is he in the
extreme curriculum?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.910
Vladimir Nabokov.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.200
Anyway, he wrote the book
"Lolita," which is about,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.930
really, an 11-year-old
girl, the famous

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.430
nymphette of the title.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.230
And he had no idea how an
11-year-old girl spoke.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:11.460
He just had no idea.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.910
You'd be amazed how hard it
is, as a journalist or a

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.040
novelist, to actually catch
uninflected speech. 'Cause you

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.280
know when you enter the
room, you change the

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.830
conversation, right?

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.040
So Nabokov used to get on
the school bus in the

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.070
town where he lived--

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.930
I think it was Ithaca-- and he
would hide behind the backseat

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.000
with a notepad and scribble down
all the little things the

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.300
11-year-olds said.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.870
These days, that could
get you arrested.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.835
But it was a more
innocent time.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.280
Wallace was finding, as he later
told an interviewer,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.310
that nobody is as gregarious as
somebody who has recently

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.010
stopped using drugs.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.190
Wallace's notebooks were a
familiar sight in the communal

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.240
rooms and recovery meetings,
trapping little inspirations

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.850
before they could get away.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.900
Within a few months of arriving,
he had already

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.780
drafted a scene centered on
one of the most intriguing

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.630
residents at Granada
House, Big Craig.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.430
Big Craig--

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.700
Don Gately in the novel--

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.140
was one of the Granada House
supervisors, and sometimes the

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.710
house cook.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.060
If anyone has read the book,
there's a beautiful moment

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.300
where this massive guy is sort
of ladling out these

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.109
overcooked noodles,
I think it is.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.819
And he's really proud
of his cooking.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.359
That's the beautiful
touch of it.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.230
He really, he really thinks
he's archived

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.460
something in the kitchen.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.910
Craig was in his mid-20s,
sober and just huge, as

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.920
Wallace would later write in
"Infinite Jest," looking less

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.680
built than poured, with the
smooth immovability of an

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.590
Easter Island statue.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.140
And that is, by the way, all
exactly how Big Craig looked.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.480
I had assumed that that was--

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.130
one of the tricky things about
David Foster Wallace is that

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.750
the non-fiction is often
embellished.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.530
The fiction's often
actually reported.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.500
And in this case, you know, Big
Craig sent me a picture,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.100
of all things, of him and David
and a couple of other

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.780
residents of the halfway house
on a fishing cruise.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.150
Which I had no idea that you
could be in a halfway house

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.410
and charter a boat and
go fishing, but

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.470
apparently you can.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.070
And Big Craig looked so much
like Don Gately in the novel.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.655
Remember, there's a description
of Don Gately in

00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:08.440
the novel as having a Prince
Valiant haircut?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.400
What is a Prince Valiant
haircut?

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:09.900
But it's true.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.150
Don Gately has like a few--

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.590
he has these few little strands
of hair going down,

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.090
and he looks exactly like
Prince Valiant.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.540
And he looks--

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.520
it's hard to explain how a
person could look more poured

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.580
than built, but he had sort
of a lack of sharp angles.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.060
And so he had this massive head
and then these tremendous

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.700
shoulders coming down,
and huge torso.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.870
Best part of all, he was wearing
a Harvard College

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.600
sweatshirt, which he'd clearly
swapped with David for

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.720
something far tougher,
like a Walpole--

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.570
he'd been in prison.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.430
I mean, obviously, David
wanted to be tough.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.730
And Don Gately, the Don Gately
character, was thrilled to be

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.885
in the presence of this
character who had wandered

00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:54.400
from Harvard across the river.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.190
Craig had grown up on the North
Shore and been a burglar

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.570
and Demerol addict.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.030
Friends closed elevator doors
on his head for fun when he

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.730
was a teenager, a detail Wallace
would of course put

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.390
into "Infinite Jest" too.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.620
But he turned out not only to
come from a different world,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.200
but also to be quite sensitive,
and it did not take

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.110
Wallace long to see the
possibilities and the love

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.940
with an interior life.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.700
There was a sort of Dostoevskian
gloss to him, the

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.930
redeemed criminal, and
Dostoevsky was

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.670
on Wallace's mind.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.500
He wrote to his Amherst
professor shortly after

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.850
arriving that going from Harvard
to here is like "House

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.870
of the Dead," with my weeks in
drug treatment composing the

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.400
staged execution
and last-minute

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.380
reprieve from same.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.840
The reprieve, he hoped, would
spur the same creative surge

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.080
as it had in the Russian.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.070
Thank you.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.756
So that's the reading.

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:47.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.790
And now we throw it
open to questions.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.130
And if there are no real
questions, Chris has promised

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.202
to throw in a couple of potted
questions, to kind

00:19:54.202 --> 00:19:57.650
of break the ice.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.650
And there's a microphone for
all who do have questions.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.572
And I'm going to get
my iced tea again.

00:20:02.572 --> 00:20:05.240
Because there are no flat
surfaces at this lectern.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.770
Oh, there is one, but that
would ruin the visual.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.172
OK.

00:20:09.172 --> 00:20:09.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.580
Thanks for coming.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.610
DT MAX: Yeah, sure.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.080
AUDIENCE: I was interested in
Wallace's relationship to fame

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.220
and being in the spotlight.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.790
There are a number of passages
in the book where he

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.910
alternately seems completely
comfortable and like he

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.980
controls the room, and then a
puddle of sweat who wants to

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.830
avoid all attention.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.530
So did you see in your research
that he changed in

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.670
that way over the course
of his life?

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.370
It was hard for me--

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.920
Well, when you refer to the
passages where he's

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.130
comfortable, is that from a
book, or from something--

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.210
Like one of the first readings
he did, I think, you say that

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.970
he was extremely comfortable
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.490
He read forth, and they said
he owned the room.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.140
It was the literary event where
he's premiering, I guess

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.120
it was "Broom," or "Girl."

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.220
It was "Broom," yeah.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.930
AUDIENCE: And then he's hiding
in the back the whole time,

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.350
and there are rumors
going on about him.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.000
DT MAX: Yeah, before
he sort of--

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.960
yeah, this was in, I think,
1987, David's first public

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.860
reading in New York for "Broom
of the System," and he

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.560
apparently it was just this
incredible reading, where he

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.010
just totally mesmerized
everybody.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.080
But beforehand, at the
restaurant, where he went with

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.740
his editor and the other
writers, he was excusing

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.841
himself every five minutes to
go vomit in the bathroom.

00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:21.480
You know, I think that--

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.870
he was shy, but he
was also somebody

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.180
desperate for public love.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.012
And when you're shy and
desperate for public love, you

00:21:28.012 --> 00:21:32.210
get into a very difficult
situation, where you both

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.600
really want to read in public,
but you also are sort of

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.480
dreading the experience.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.700
And I think one of the things
about David is that he

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.760
really-- you know, everyone
says, oh, he

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.080
didn't want to be famous.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.190
David wanted to be famous.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.630
I mean, David desperately
wanted readers.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.450
He wanted fame.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.550
There's an early letter-- one of
the really fun things about

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.670
writing the biography was that
people gave me lots and lots

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.440
of his correspondence.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.976
One of the weird things about
correspondence is you don't

00:21:57.976 --> 00:22:03.170
think about it unless you're a
writer or a public figure, but

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.760
the letters that you send out,
those are the ones the

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.670
biographer wants.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.930
And those are in other
people's hands.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.770
So you don't have to save
your correspondence.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.590
In fact, David saved
almost nothing.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.510
But all these people saved
David's letters, so David's

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.340
voice, for me, was captured
in all these moments.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.430
I mean, I'm a writer
who's very, very

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.240
interested in voice.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.850
You can hear all the letters,
even in the little section

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.935
that I read to you.

00:22:26.935 --> 00:22:30.490
You know, there's an early
letter where he just gotten

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.790
"Broom of the System" accepted
for publication, and he was a

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.060
whopping 24 years
old, I think.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.570
And he writes one of his friends
from Amherst and asks

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.440
his friend to insert a mention
in the Amherst Alumni Bulletin

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.310
without letting the Amherst
Alumni Bulletin editor know

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.550
that he was behind it.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.850
I mean, David really,
really craved fame.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.070
And then when he got fame, he
found it was very, very

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.710
uncomfortable.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.080
He just never really understood
what his value was,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.130
and I think for him, things got
very confusing when people

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.610
would come up to him
and say, oh, you're

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:04.610
David Foster Wallace.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.710
He would always say, no,
I'm David Wallace.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.460
That's my writing name.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.090
Not DT Max, Daniel Max.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.340
Like this distinction.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.960
And the only that bothered him
more than being noticed, of

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.370
course, was not being noticed.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.060
So for instance, with "Girl With
Curious Hair," that was a

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.390
book that sold, I think, 2,200
copies in hardcover, which is

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.410
really almost not being
published at all in American.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.160
I mean, you could imagine, you
could put 2,200 copies in a

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.820
closet, practically.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.030
And that devastated him.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.060
And yet when "Infinite Jest"
is published and it's this

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.710
enormous hit, like this
phenomenon, and in some ways

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.310
realizes all of David's
dreams, it

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.460
also becomes his nightmare.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.140
And later on, he's unable to
write, in part because he

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.810
feels like he's being haunted
by the specter of this novel

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.930
that was such a success, and
everybody will expect another

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.070
brilliant, brilliant
novel from him.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.750
The whole sort of dichotomy is
summarized very well in--

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.990
he was interviewed by a very,
very good interviewer named

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.836
Larry McCaffery, I
think in 1991.

00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:04.640
And McCaffery asked
him about fame.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.970
And David says something, he
said, I'm an exhibitionist who

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.580
wants to hide but
fails at hiding.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.450
Therefore, somehow, I succeed.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.090
So that was his own very meta,
very David Foster Wallace.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.870
And then the best part is when
he got the transcript of the

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.670
interview to approve,
that sort of

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.075
interview, he cut that line.

00:24:24.075 --> 00:24:26.440
So he hid again.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.340
Were you surprised by anything
you learned over the course of

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.190
doing research for the book?

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.220
I was surprised by so much.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.420
There's two stages
to the book.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.600
The book begins as a "New
Yorker" article.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.790
I'm a staff writer at the "New
Yorker," and so I was asked by

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:44.170
the editor of the magazine
shortly after David's death,

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.390
did I want to write
about David?

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.730
And I can't tell you--

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.310
I'd read Wallace's writing and
always loved "Broom of the

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.570
System." Sorry Chris, I did.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.170
It was my favorite book.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.750
It's a free country.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.877
And I was horrified in the early
research on the book to

00:25:00.877 --> 00:25:03.620
discover a letter from David
to Jonathan Franzen, the

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.510
novelist, where he says to
Franzen that-- this is like in

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:12.180
1991, four years after "Broom
of the System." He says that

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.900
he finds nothing to
like in the book.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.020
It could've been written
by a smart 14-year-old.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.160
And I was horrified.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.220
He didn't even say a very
smart 14-year-old.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.410
So I had invested all this love
in this thing that he

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.960
looked on as sort
of juvenilia.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.310
But I knew nothing
about David.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.720
I didn't know about
his depression.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.570
I didn't know about his
addiction history.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.760
I didn't know about
his struggles--

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.730
struggles with women is really
the wrong phrase, but his

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.720
difficulty with women.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.890
I didn't know about his--

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.390
I didn't know that he was vastly
overdue on the last

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.450
novel, which would be "The Pale
King," the book that was

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.700
finally published.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.295
And on a deeper level, I didn't
really know how deeply

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:53.730
he suffered.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.370
I didn't know that ever since
he'd been in high school, he'd

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.400
experienced either anxiety
or depression.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.860
And on the flip-side, I also
didn't know how funny he was.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.090
I mean, one of the reasons I
continued into the book after

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.690
the New Yorker piece--
because you can stop.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.470
You've had your flirtation,
and you can go on and do

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.950
something else.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.370
It's one of the nice things
about a magazine article, even

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.220
a long one.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.960
And I remember thinking
a couple of things.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.120
The article came out about six
months after David's death.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.180
And one thing was I kept wishing
I could still read

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.250
David Foster Wallace.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.910
Like, why did I have to go
and read other people?

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.930
I was really hooked
by the voice.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.690
I'd always liked David's
writing-- even

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.150
loved some of it.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.520
But it really began to inhabit
me in a way that may be

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.730
familiar to some of you.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.340
Like it really became the voice
in my head, which is the

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.060
miracle of David, is it's
the voice in your head.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.800
If it works for you, he's
not just a writer.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.440
He becomes the voice in your
head, almost like he

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.220
appropriates your brain.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.230
And you see everything the way
David would have seen it.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.060
I mean, I walk around now, and
I can look at this room, and

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.900
I'm having David-type
thoughts.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.790
Or I get on an airplane, and
David has a wonderful

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.290
description of the
people who--

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.690
I can't remember it offhand,
but the people who pretend

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.850
they're in no hurry, so they let
everyone else rush off the

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.560
airplane, and then they gather
up their bags and sort of

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.600
pretend to saunter off,
and how what a

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.240
thin facade that is.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.540
They're actually having
more fun than

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.400
anyone else on an airplane.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.690
Or David--

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.800
I was on the airplane flying
out west, and there was a

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.890
Gwyneth Paltrow movie.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.710
And I used to like
Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.920
And David says in some letter
that I have, it's actually not

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.500
in the book, but he describes
her as looking like the ghost

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.020
of a horse.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.070
And now I can't get
it out of my head.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.410
Like even this perfectly good
actress, like, OK, there's the

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.300
ghost of a horse.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.990
Or he has a wonderful
phrase about babies.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.150
This is, I think, a conversation
he had with his

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:49.780
friend Mark Costello, where he
says, babies are famous to

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.110
themselves.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.160
And I think that's such a
perfect way to capture the way

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.670
that babies have their own kind
of little ego-sphere.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.110
Nothing can make a baby--

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.020
if a baby's happy, a baby's
happy despite anything going

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.920
on around him or her.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.350
And I just think he was this
incredible observer.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.690
So I didn't want to
read anyone else.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.870
I didn't really want
to talk to--

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.480
I didn't want to do
anything else.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.100
And then secondly, it was
clear that David had--

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.070
and I think his death
accelerated this, but I don't

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.030
think it originated it.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.870
He had begun to kind of capture
just an amazing number

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.350
of readers, not just
as a writer--

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.750
because, I mean, to be honest,
an 1,100-page book is always

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.650
going to have limitations
on its readership.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.320
Like it's difficult, and I don't
think it's as difficult

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.510
as people think it is.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.620
You guys have had it,
already, right?

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.720
It was part of the--

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.450
so yeah.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.960
It's a book where it's hard
to orient yourself, but it

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.560
doesn't actually present the
obstacles, say, "Finnegan's

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.430
Wake" presents.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.690
I mean, he wanted readers.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.030
David always wanted readers.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.380
The great battle for David was
between making it too easy,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.250
which would make it part of our
addictive culture, and too

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.670
difficult, which means
you wouldn't--

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.430
he had to calibrate the
medicine perfectly.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.540
But after his death, he was
incredible how people were

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.310
just online talking about
missing David Foster Wallace

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.310
in the world, in a way that
I don't think I'd really

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.034
entirely understood
when he was alive.

00:29:09.034 --> 00:29:11.250
You know, if you go online,
you can see people with

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.230
tattoos that say, this is water,
which is the name of

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.360
the wonderful sort of
commencement address he gave

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.180
in 2005 at Kenyon College.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.520
Some people have the date they
started "Infinite Jest" and

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.760
the date they finished "Infinite
Jest" on their arms.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.270
I mean, this is not a normal
response to a writer.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.180
It's really a response to a kind
of a person who clearly

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.210
is reaching people in a
whole, bigger and more

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.690
thorough-going way.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.360
So I never wanted to write a
biography, what I would call

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.170
an aesthete's biography, a
biography about how beautiful

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.020
someone else wrote.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.560
Because the contradiction in
that is sort of obvious.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.310
The disconnect is like going to
an art gallery and saying,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.290
oh, that painting's
so beautiful.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.810
I mean, what can you do when
faced with beauty, except

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.420
acknowledge beauty?

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.230
But with David, there was a
whole question about, like,

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.000
who is this moral being?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.350
This seer, in a sense, who's
grown up around us?

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.765
There's this cliche of, like,
Saint Dave, the idea that

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:11.420
there's this person who really
understood us in our

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.680
generation or generations, in
our modern life, in our

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.140
media-saturated life, in our
computer-saturated life.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.420
There's a wonderful line from
David that's in his notebooks.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.760
He says, would that we
scrutinize our technology with

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.890
the same care we give
to our people.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:32.040
And I thought that was really
an interesting observation.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.780
So I just wanted
to keep going.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.070
It just had to be what I did.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.790
And you know, it was in some
sense a voyage for me of

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.610
exploration, a voyage of love.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.060
I mean, I loved David
when I began.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.033
There's a lot of things in the
book that probably David would

00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:48.450
not have been thrilled
to have in the book.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.220
But I mean, I emerged
more in love.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.900
I don't think that a seer, or
whatever you want to call

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.300
David today, has to
be a person--

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.970
I mean, I think the model
is Thomas Merton.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.970
I don't know how many of you
ever read Thomas Merton, but

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.990
there's an absolutely
extraordinarily sort of

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.650
chaotic life that leads
to some sort of

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:08.950
clarity at the end.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.520
But what makes David
more special for

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520
me than Thomas Merton--

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.500
Thomas Merton had a very secular
life and then he

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.620
became a Catholic.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.040
I think he became a monk,
right, I believe?

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.640
But David found, to my
mind, a harder route.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.543
He became a kind of secular, or
tried to become-- because

00:31:24.543 --> 00:31:26.700
it was always about trying with
David-- tried to become a

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.760
kind of secular saint.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.040
And so when he died, everyone
was like, well, the world

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.200
feels emptier without him.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.870
I don't understand how to live
in this world without him.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.830
And that was really
meaningful to me.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.260
That really clinched my need to
write about him and sort of

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.510
think about him.

00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:47.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
question about "The Pale King"

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.800
and kind of how the themes fit
in with his battle with

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.340
depression.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.520
A lot of the novel is concerned
with finding meaning

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.350
in the mundane and the really
boring and everyday.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.080
I mean, even with that
one character,

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.110
she's like a nirvana--

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.105
DT MAX: Yeah, Drinian.

00:32:00.105 --> 00:32:01.010
He levitates.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.820
He's so--

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.780
AUDIENCE: Levitating while he's
doing his tax auditing.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.670
And then the fact that he
committed suicide in the midst

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.790
of writing that, does that
represent to you a failure to

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.360
find that meaning?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.660
DT MAX: Well, I mean, it's
a great question.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.340
For me--

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.400
OK, so the story is "The Pale
King." and "The Pale King"--

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.940
I don't know how many of you
have read it, it was published

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.340
after David's death-- is really
about trying to find

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:28.340
some sort of larger, almost
Buddhist comfort or space in

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.250
the midst of our totally,
totally noisy,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.400
totally crowded landscape.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.340
And for David, the metaphor
was obvious.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.080
It was also about
being a writer.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.330
Like what does a writer do but
try and push away all the

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:45.780
ancillary noises to find your
own sweet spot as a writer?

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.620
And so it's a kind of a treble
failure, in the sense that he

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.140
didn't finish the book, he went
off of an antidepressant

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.590
in order to try to finish
the book. 'Cause some

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.660
antidepressants--

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.850
I think, actually, most-- make
the people who take them feel

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.100
in some ways a little bit
distant, like a little bit of

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.400
a kind of divider between
themselves and the world.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.800
And David felt that, and he felt
it was interfering with

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.940
his writing.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.780
You know, I wouldn't use
the word failure.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.540
I think what David's death and
the non-completion of "The

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.090
Pale King" show us is just
how damn hard it is.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.420
I mean, first of all, he took
the kind of project that

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.005
nobody should take on without
a physician's certificate.

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:33.770
I mean, writing and literature
and novels and fiction are, on

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.110
one level, a form of
entertainment.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.540
Or at least they have to
interest you, right?

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.150
So if you write a novel about
boredom, there's a

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.480
contradiction right
in there, right?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.960
Built in there is the
contradiction that if I'm

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.690
really going to capture
boredom for you or

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.270
mindfulness, it's going to be so
quiet that you're not going

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:49.820
to want to read the book.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:55.690
I mean, you're going to put it
on your chest every night, and

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.340
you know, call it

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.240
"Infinite Rest." [LAUGHTER]

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.440
DT MAX: I mean, it would be a
book you would never finish.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.650
So anyway, that's part of this
battle that he fights.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.080
One of the curious things
about the book--

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.719
I was just recently
in the archives.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:12.199
David's papers are in Austin
at the University of Texas.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.185
If anybody goes there and has
any interest in David, they

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:16.190
have a very good
access system.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.389
You don't have to be a
bona fide scholar,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.199
whatever that is.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.830
And I really recommend going and
looking at the drafts of

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.280
"Infinite Jest." It's really
stunning to see it.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.000
But in early versions of the
book, Drinian is actually an

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.350
actor in porn movies.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.920
And so the book somehow goes on
this long journey from him

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.889
being a symbol of the profane
to some sort of

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:41.580
symbol of the sacred.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.139
I mean, it's less contradictory
than you think,

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.250
because Drinian's always
somehow otherworldly.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.520
I mean, he's part of this
technology, which I think is

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.540
invented where--

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.870
David was deeply interested in
porn, which is, I think, a

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.270
fancy way of saying that
he also kind of

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.290
liked to watch porn.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:01.590
But he was as guilt-obsessed
as any Midwestern young boy

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.760
could possibly be with this.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.090
And so in the set-up for the
book, or the original version,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.590
Drinian is somebody you can,
using some sort of computer

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.980
technology, put yourself
in his place.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.680
So it's you in the porn movie.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.190
And so it's Drinian's very
non-corporeality, if that's a

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.760
word, it's his lack of bodily
embodiment, that makes him

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.670
perfect for the movie.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.140
And so in that sense, it's not
so different from the Drinian

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.080
in "The Pale King" whose
interest in people is so

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.910
intense and so encompassing that
it literally floats up in

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.300
the air as he's talking.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.930
So I see quarter of.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.630
And you guys are running
on a tight timetable.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.290
Do we do one more quickie,
if there is one?

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.680
Do you want to throw
a potted one in?

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.810
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask if you found

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.180
anything that informed--

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.280
we were talking about
female characters--

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.360
if through your research, you
found anything that would shed

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.640
light on how his female
characters were portrayed.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.820
DT MAX: Well, the original sort
of rap on David was he

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.600
couldn't write women.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.150
And in fact, earlier--

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.830
not now-- he was primarily kind
of a young man's writer,

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.340
sort of in the--

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.750
I don't know quite who else.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.470
Perhaps Pynchon also
has that bias.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.430
But for whatever reason, I think
because David is now

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.040
known in a certain way as much
for the life he tried to live

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.080
as for exactly what he wrote,
interest in him has sort of

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:29.070
blossomed way out of the sort
of our original kind of male

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:36.290
graduate student demographic.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.400
But David, I don't think--

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.860
David didn't understand women, I
think, is probably sort of a

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.520
fair statement.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.045
But I also think it's a fair
statement that David really

00:36:45.045 --> 00:36:45.860
didn't understand men.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.710
I mean, he wasn't a guy who
drew traditional developed

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.220
characters.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.120
I mean, Don Gately in "Infinite
Jest," or Hal--

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.860
one reason I think we read
David with more and more

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.720
intensity now than we did even
15 years ago is because

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.530
David's idea of what people look
like is a little bit the

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.130
way they come across
on a computer.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.180
That's a little bit hard for
me to break out in the 25

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:07.730
seconds left.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.900
But basically, the rounded
character of Victorian

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.960
19th-century life, that's
literally not how

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.150
David saw the world.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.720
David insisted his books were
realism for a world that was

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.980
no longer real.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.880
And if you read "Infinite Jest,"
you can see that in a

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.880
way, it is our life.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.650
But it's also not our life.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.810
It's different than 19th-century
fiction.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.890
It's different than
Charles Dickens.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.090
It's different than
George Eliot.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.830
It's different than
Thomas Hardy.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:36.910
But it's also recognizably in
their tradition as well.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.920
I mean, David never saw himself
as experimental.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.790
He did not see himself
as being like

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:44.420
Pynchon or John Barth.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.750
He saw himself as a realist.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:48.395
He saw himself in a different
tradition.

00:37:48.395 --> 00:37:51.730
So I mean, the short answer is,
that's how he saw women.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.860
That was women to him.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.455
The longer answer is like, did
David have a woman problem, a

00:37:58.455 --> 00:37:59.920
women problem, however
you say it?

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.400
Well, I mean, the women who knew
him thought the opposite.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.090
I mean, he was famous for--

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.150
he was Drinian-like.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.890
He had this ability to focus.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.960
And I can't tell you how many
times I would be with a woman

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.130
who had dated David or whatever,
and she would be

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.410
sitting there, and part of
biography is not so glamorous.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.370
When you go to different towns
where people knew the person,

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.000
you go in and you look at the
house they lived in, you talk

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.230
to the people who are willing
to talk to you.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:30.190
And they'd be like, you know,
David was like a drug to me.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.070
And he was.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:40.230
And some people, many, many
people insist that was also, I

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.120
think, in some ways part
of what limited--

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.380
he didn't see anybody.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.570
You don't go to David for
what you get out of--

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.240
I don't know.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.890
I don't want to throw some
novelist under the bus here.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.100
But you get the idea.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.690
Like you don't go for a
fully-rounded, modulated

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.050
figure of somebody who gradually
evolves into a late

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:04.500
epiphany in the novel, becomes
a slightly different person.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.200
Alice Munro?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.910
I don't know.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.610
She's a wonderful writer,
so I don't mean to

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.800
be putting her down.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.480
That's not David.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.130
Like David, in some ways he's
binary, and in some ways, he's

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:18.770
utterly, utterly modern,
almost futuristic.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.280
That's how we saw all of us.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.800
And so I don't really think
it's a gender thing.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.760
I think if there's a cliche to
be invoked, it's that if you

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.480
go to fiction for what has been
the historical role of

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.530
fiction, you probably emerge
slightly disappointed.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.140
I'm not saying terribly
disappointed, because David's

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.870
a beautiful writer,
no matter what.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.740
But if you go to try to
understand, as it were, the

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.050
news, the news of who we are
and what's going on--

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.610
I mean, in this building, among
other places, there's no

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:48.600
better place to go than
David Foster Wallace.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.470
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the kind
of veneration of Saint

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.110
Dave, which I know his something
that Franzen pretty

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.210
publicly called in that "New
Yorker" piece about going to

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.190
grieve and bird-watch.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.280
How conscious do think
David was?

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.650
Did you find any references
about how he wanted to be

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.670
perceived in terms
of his legacy?

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.830
Well, I mean, I don't think the
whole Saint Dave thing was

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.940
something he was really
deliberately working on.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.360
But it's such a complicated
question.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.590
I mean, David wanted
to be read.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.940
He wanted to be regarded
as a writer.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.475
I don't think he all that much
really was desperate to be

00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:22.710
regarded as some sort of
sage for our time.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.910
I think the idea would have
made him, as he would have

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.060
said, run for the bathroom.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.890
That said, he was a
contradictory guy, like many,

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.510
many writers.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.990
Writers are small
public figures.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.225
I think he was probably aware
of the potential.

00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:40.480
I mean, he only had to see the
fact that the generation of

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.840
writers whom he admired, who
were passing, like John

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.840
Updike, they had no such
public presence.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.570
I think a lot of it also
happened after his

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.250
death, to be honest.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:55.270
I think David's suicide really
changed the freedom we give

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.590
ourselves to interpret him.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.570
Because to some extent, he just
wasn't there to push back

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.990
against it anymore.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.360
I mean, I can easily imagine
that David, had he lived and

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.640
had this whole Saint Dave
thing expanded, he could

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.060
easily have written some sort of
essay about not wanting to

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.250
be a saint with lots of meta
levels and lots of humor.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.000
And only after you finish it
would you realize that was

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.610
what it was about.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.330
And all the time, he'd
be wondering, did he

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.550
want to be a saint?

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.920
I'll end with one anecdote,
a really small anecdote.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.960
When David was writing the
speech that would be the

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.400
Kenyon College address,
which is

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.670
really about being mindful--

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:27.310
it's an extraordinary
commencement speech, unlike

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.450
anything you've heard at your
colleges or I've heard at my

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.950
college, about the
need to really be

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.170
mindful in your life.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.740
Not just to achieve,
but to actually be

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.000
aware, to be present.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.770
So he's writing this speech,
and it's really in a lot of

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.420
ways derived from the sort of
things he learned in his

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:42.890
12-step program.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.840
And they were all the basic
cliches that he was fighting

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.430
so hard against at Granada
House, like do what's in front

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:53.220
of you to do, and you know, a
kind heart will never drink.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.880
I don't remember all
the exact phrases.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.230
But anyway, stuff that would
drive him crazy.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.140
Really crazy .

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.320
So he's writing the speech, and
it really is in a sense,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.350
one wonderful cliche strung
along after another.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.570
But when you read it, you'll
see the power of it.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.900
But he and his wife Karen, at
the time, while he was writing

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.830
the speech, he suggested that
maybe she should do a sort of

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.890
soft-shoe routine behind
him while he read it.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.330
So he'd be saying, the important
thing is and to

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.500
decide what to pay attention
to, and if

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.190
not, you'll be hosed.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.150
And there would be Karen, doo,
do-doo, and making fun of the

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.830
whole thing.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.590
At the same time as he thought
it was the most important

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.900
thing he'd ever written, I'm
sure he also thought it was

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.040
like a huge joke and that any
5-year-old had figured these

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.020
things out years ago.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.710
It's one thing that's
interesting about him, is that

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.220
this brilliant guy went on this
vast circuit, and in the

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.520
end, comes back to understand
the sort of truisms that

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.400
you're really taught when you're
five or six, or in your

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.360
first Bible class.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.240
But it's the struggle,
and it's the process.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.420
And it's the need that he had to
make it clear for himself,

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:01.260
personally, that's so powerful
in his story.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.230
That's why people want
to associate with--

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.800
we all go on some
version of this.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.080
I think almost all of us go
on some version of the

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.750
journey he went on.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:10.770
His was more intense.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.320
It was more beautifully
verbalized.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.040
And it had more peaks and
valleys, with the dreadful

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.130
valley at the end.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.890
But I think we all recognize
this battle to make sense out

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.350
of the modern world
for ourselves.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.510
I don't mean in some sort of
political way, but in an

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.760
absolutely personal way.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:28.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for coming.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:29.290
DT MAX: Thank you.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.190
Thanks for having me.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.910
