00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.610
MALE SPEAKER: So
I actually think

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to start first with a
question about Racepoint, which

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.180
you started in 2002.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.470
And actually, I'll start
with another question.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.400
Why did you decide
to write books?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.395
And who are you writing for?

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:28.020
LARRY WEBER: The
first book that nobody

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.420
read, I wanted to write
about all the new technology

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.640
leaders I had been working with,
like Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.360
I had met Sergey and Larry,
but it was a little later.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800
It was like 2002 in Aspen.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.900
But I was amazed
that these guys were

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.620
different than the corporate
leaders I had worked with,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.690
and so I was just
observing the way they

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.770
were building companies.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.530
And it was called
"The Provocateurs."

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.820
How a new generation of leaders
are building communities, not

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.010
just companies.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.180
So it was that sort of angle,
and it was the late '90s.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.130
And I just wanted to capture
all these people that I had met

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.770
and do that.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.000
And then, I started realizing--
and this relates to Racepoint.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460
By the way, I
couldn't use my name.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.640
My lawyer didn't tell me I
had sold my name to IPG too.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330
So that's why it's called
Racepoint Global, which

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.750
is after one of the oldest
lighthouses in America

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.495
off Provincetown.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.130
But anyway, the
other books started

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.770
to seep in because I realized
technology obviously was going

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.690
to change marketing forever.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.920
And it was the last category
that didn't even have an ERP

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.990
system, or enterprise system.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.620
And then, I was also an early
stupid investor in Friendster,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.380
and I knew that the
impact of social media

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.810
was going to be huge.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.240
So I wanted to
write to marketers.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.180
There wasn't CMO titles then.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.040
But I wanted to write to
marketers and CEOs-- so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.030
C-levels-- about the
coming vast changes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.820
in reaching your customers.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.870
And I thought social media
was the first huge computing

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.230
wave after HTML that was
going to have huge impact.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.210
And so I wrote a
book that became

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.970
my biggest bestseller in 2006
called "Marketing to the Social

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.500
Web."

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.264
And it wasn't because
it was a great book.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.430
I think it was because it
was the first book written

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.526
on that topic.

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:23.900
And then I also
learned something

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.470
about publishing, which
is that if you write

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500
a more instructive
book and it's pretty

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.697
decent about a new
topic, all of a sudden

00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:33.530
it's in the curriculum
of a bunch of schools

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.310
because we were trying to figure
out why the book would sell

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.340
so much in August and January.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.310
And then we realized
it was everywhere

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.060
from Birmingham at the
University of Alabama

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.750
to Columbia.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.090
And then, my favorite
book, the third book

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.860
I wrote in 2009, which had
a telling chapter in it,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.090
which is one of the best books
I've ever written that nobody

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.430
read called "Sticks and Stones
about Digital Reputation"

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.920
in 2009.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.720
And I had a chapter that
Harvard Business Review loved

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.350
called the YouTube Juggernaut.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.000
And this was seven,
eight years ago.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.650
I was thinking about
after I met Chad Hurley.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.210
And even though he
was just having fun,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.610
I saw a future where most
data and most content

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.730
was going to be
presented visually.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.290
And that there would probably
more of a category of data

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.520
called visual information
versus just videography.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.006
And I was playing
around with that idea,

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:33.630
so I thought that
would be a cool thing

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.760
to write about so I did that.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.440
And this is a long answer
to a simple question.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.650
I also figured out how to
write a book within six

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.920
to nine months.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.590
You know, how to research
it, write it, have a helper.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.670
I had two MBA
students do research,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.810
then I had a ghost
writer who I'd finally

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.310
have given her credit so I'm
not a complete sexist ass.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.930
Who would say, Larry,
you wrote that last week.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.840
That's not another
chapter kind of thing.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.300
And then, I drifted to a
bigger topic, which did OK,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.850
the book before this one.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.880
This is a bestseller
now, but that one

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.690
was called "Everywhere,"
and it was my view

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.100
that social media was not
just impacting marketing.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.130
It was impacting
the way we did HR.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.110
It was impacting the
way we did finance.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.040
It was impacting the
way we did sales.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.210
So in "Everywhere," I was
trying to take a different,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.030
and I think that
was a little early.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.860
And this one seems
just about right,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.850
and this one has its roots.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.550
It's called "The
Digital Marketer-- 10

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.352
New Skills you Need to Know
to Stay Customer Centric."

00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:40.310
It's about what I think
is today and the future

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.310
of marketing, which is
what "Racepoint" represents

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.480
is my idea of building the
Frankenstein of an agency.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.110
And we can talk about that
Frankenstein in a good way.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.800
You know, the perfection
kind of thing.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.900
But this one was here because
of my publisher, Wiley,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.690
of the last four books.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.540
Random House was the first
one, but my publisher

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.660
said what's your next
marketing book, Larry?

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.310
And I said, well, let me see
what's out there right now.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.560
So I went on Amazon and
I googled things too.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.640
And I realized that what
is being written even today

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.490
is there's the
experts on search.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.260
There's the experts on
marketing automation software.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.180
There's the experts on content
creation and content strategy.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.350
You name it, a slice.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.140
But nobody I thought had written
a book like David Ogilvy's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.250
"Ogilvy on Advertising" where
he sat back in 1965 and went,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.900
OK, let's look at the entire
New Yorker map of marketing

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.590
and advertising and all that.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.030
And it was a
brilliant landscape.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.900
And so what this
book attempts to be

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.710
is let's look at the
entire digital landscape

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.350
of storm software to
search to visual to content

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.930
to a lot of software.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.790
And then write about
that so that then you

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.470
can dig down instead
of drilling down first,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.380
get sort of a thing.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.980
So that's why I write.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.800
And also, the last
reason I write

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.900
is it's really good
at getting business.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.390
Because when my competitors
are giving business cards,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.490
I'm handing out books.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.960
MALE SPEAKER: So I'll ask one
or two quick follow-ups on that.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.825
So in some regards,
you didn't even

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:21.450
anticipate who you were writing
for, like the college students,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.789
for instance.

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.080
LARRY WEBER: I just got
interested in different topics.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.740
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.040
As it relates to it's
a good way to build

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.860
business or different types
of access and exposure,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.140
specifically as it relates
to the college students,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.810
how do you see colleges treating
this type of career path

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.980
differently, or do you?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.690
Places where maybe
they've invited

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.610
you to talk after buying
lots of your books?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.640
LARRY WEBER: Yeah, a lot of the
marketing, like San Jose State,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.460
BU, and I think they're
finally getting it.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.130
They're teaching a little
more around search,

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.450
around content strategies.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.990
But I think the professors
are still caught up

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.220
in the operational world that
has the head of advertising

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.240
or the head of direct
marketing or the head of PR,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.240
and they haven't completely
adopted the earned,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.810
paid and owned media concept
of putting things together.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.940
I think they're trying.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.210
I think Columbia is really
trying hard, especially

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.420
in the journalism school.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.120
To change the way we
view the way content

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.990
is produced and presented.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.480
But one place that
they're missing

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.860
is this integration of
software, and I have not

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.950
seen that around
when I've talked.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.100
And the kids get
afraid a little bit,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.540
and I can't believe this
because most of these kids

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.080
are English majors that are
interested in the marketing.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.660
Or history majors.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.880
And I said, you've got to
understand basic coding.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.151
You just have to.

00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:53.984
You're just going to
have to force yourself.

00:07:53.984 --> 00:07:56.432
It's like eating
spinach when you're 10

00:07:56.432 --> 00:07:58.890
because you're going to have
to understand how to integrate

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.500
the best software tools
you have available to reach

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.190
your customers
directly, consistently,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.830
and in an engaging way.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.630
And I think we're
sort of at that period

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.480
that it's really hard
to bring that together.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.800
But it's going to happen.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.110
And the other thing I learned
about that, not from schools,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.730
but was going to spend time--
I was on the board of a company

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.270
we sold to Marketo.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.050
And so I went and spent
time with that CEO and CMO,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.970
and then I spent time
with the Eloqua guys,

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.559
and then my friends at
HubSpot, Brian and Dharmesh.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.730
They hate when I say
this, but we really

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.220
studied those products.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.650
They're really very simple
and they're not very complex.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.880
I don't mean they
need to be complex,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.430
but I think they make mistakes.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.080
They aren't integrated
properly necessarily

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.510
with Salesforce or other
advanced CRM systems,

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.430
these kinds of things.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.060
So we're in this
world right now where

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.050
I really think it's like year
one of the new marketing, which

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.750
is going to, again, be
around data software,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.660
but still creativity and
content and visualization.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.740
And some schools are
starting to get that,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.093
but again, it's a different
type of career path.

00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:19.980
And I think what
the kids are looking

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.160
for are companies like
Google to help teach them

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.170
some of those things.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.610
That they might get the
basics at these universities

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:33.150
around the basics of purchase
theory and pricing and things

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.850
that marketing and
sales should understand.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.120
But that I want to go to
Amazon or Google or Facebook

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.350
because they can teach me more
about the future of things,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.810
which, by the way, is not always
innovative, as I was telling

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.390
Sheryl Sandberg.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.979
She thought native advertising
two years ago was just so cool.

00:09:51.979 --> 00:09:54.520
I said, you know, Sheryl, we've
been doing that for 30 years.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.030
We called it advertorials,
and we labeled it an ad.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:05.590
So there's a lot of inventing
of things that's going on,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:10.390
but what is changing is the
objectives of marketing.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.770
I think it should be more
about engagement time

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:19.250
and less about the purchase
and more about the engagement.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.660
You know, the shareability,
those kinds of things.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.500
So, anyway.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.735
MALE SPEAKER: So just as
a quick poll question--

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:28.010
LARRY WEBER: I could go on.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.190
MALE SPEAKER: What's that?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.650
LARRY WEBER: I just said
I could go on and on.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.030
MALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.180
That's why you're here.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.014
LARRY WEBER: Oh, OK.

00:10:33.014 --> 00:10:34.596
MALE SPEAKER: That's
why I didn't have

00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:36.040
to write too many questions.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.890
How many had a major that was
something like a liberal arts

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.460
major in this room?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.830
And how many had
a business major?

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.080
LARRY WEBER: Computer science?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.121
MALE SPEAKER: And how many
had a computer science

00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.310
oriented major?

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.224
So weighted towards the--

00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:53.890
LARRY WEBER: Well,
it's good that you're

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.670
all in the same room.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:03.400
When I started 35 years
ago, IT was just beginning.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.480
I mean, we look so different in
marketing versus the IT guys.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.920
And then I remember
over the years

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.890
in Boston, all of a sudden there
were all these-- by the way,

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.980
there were only two C titles
when I started in business.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.270
There was the CEO and the CFO.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.710
And then all of a
sudden, this Fortune 500

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.470
company I was working
with had a COO,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.050
and I was intrigued to see what
their responsibilities were.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.750
I read the responsibilities, and
they seem like the same stuff

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.690
the CEO and the CFO
was supposed to do.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.322
And anyway, I moved
here in early 1982,

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.280
and that's when I got
into technology marketing

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.740
because I mistakenly went
to a party-- or actually,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.460
fortunately went
to a party and met

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.450
a barefoot guy named Mitch Kapor
who was starting a software

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.390
company called Lotus.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.830
And we hit it off and introduced
most of their products.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.260
But anyway, there were all these
titles back then called MIS.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.640
I mean, some of the older people
must remember MIS-- managers

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.750
of information services.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.520
And companies hired
so many of those

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.880
that they had another
C title-- CTOs.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.380
And then all those people
started buying all the software

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.800
and the CTOs didn't
understand the software,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.910
so they have a CIO.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.230
And then we went through
this period in the '90s

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.120
where everybody was making
so much money that we decided

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.790
to have titles like
chief talent officer

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.390
and chief knowledge officer
and chief strategic officer.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:32.250
And then in the 2000s, which
I think is fascinating,

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.790
is the fastest growing title in
corporate America, especially

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.650
a CMO.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.000
And I think it's easy to
deduce then that every time we

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.970
have a really fucked up
category of business,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.910
we just put a C title on it
to try to straighten it out.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.240
And now it's so funny.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.110
My clients right now range from
IBM, General Electric, Kaiser

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.310
Permanente, John Deere,
the Page Family Foundation,

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.000
emerging companies.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.380
And I'm starting to see
CMO titles get thrown out

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.170
and we're having
the chief customer

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.630
office and the chief
engagement officer

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.510
and chief experience officer.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:16.959
So we're definitely in
another C title Renaissance.

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:18.500
MALE SPEAKER: In no
particular order,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.940
you mentioned the Page
Family Foundation.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.220
That's Larry Page.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.940
And I don't know if
you guys even know.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.510
LARRY WEBER: Larry and Lucy.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.969
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
Larry and Lucy.

00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:28.926
You guys might not even
know that kind of stuff

00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:30.920
that family foundation
is involved with.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.610
And it might just be
interesting for you to know.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.990
Do you want to describe
what you're doing with them

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.340
and what their programs are?

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.140
LARRY WEBER: There's
two things I learned.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.644
I should have known this
about Google in the beginning

00:13:38.644 --> 00:13:40.060
because we had
also done some work

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.560
for 23andMe, and from the
other guy's former wife.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:52.530
But just by nature
of Google, the CDC

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.610
was very interested in
searches in specific areas

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.360
about if all of a
sudden all of San Diego

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.200
goes off the charts
looking for flu symptoms,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.860
then there's a connection
between you guys

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.570
and the CDC that
says, oh, my god,

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.170
you guys better check out the
health officials in San Diego

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:22.570
because the searches for
flu are just off the charts.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:27.640
And so our San Francisco office
was approached by the Page

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.990
Family Foundation
because for some reason

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.660
Lucy and Larry had made a point
that we're worried about all

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.320
these diseases that might
affect one or two people,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.470
yet like 40,000 people die
of complications of the flu

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.040
every year.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.440
And it's avoidable if you get
your kid to have a flu shot,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.730
but it turns out
that a lot of parents

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.990
don't trust the flu shot
and all this kind of stuff.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.870
So they said let's try a sort
of experiment just in one city

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.250
urban area, and
they picked Oakland.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.730
And so our creative team
came up with an idea

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.200
called "Shoe the Flu."

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.900
And it's a whole
educative through video.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.580
We use traditional media, like
billboards in downtown Oakland,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.390
television, that
kind of stuff, to try

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:21.537
to really ramp up the rate of
getting your kids vaccinated.

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:22.370
And it really works.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.920
So we're in the planning stages
now of going sort of urban area

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.200
by urban area to
start to do that.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.200
But they do a lot
more than that.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.160
That's just one sort of example,
but it's also a great marketing

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.720
example because it's a
combination of search.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.640
It's a usage of software,
of old-fashioned creative,

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.230
of video content, of education,
educational materials,

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.280
and those kinds of things.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.420
MALE SPEAKER: I think
before I knew-- in fact,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.900
I'm sure before I knew that,
A, the Page Foundation was

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.900
involved with that.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.800
And B, you guys were
involved with that.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.270
I had identified that
as a campaign that

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.400
used in several presentations
in as part of the feel,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.790
think, do continuum
because it really

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.040
does a good job of addressing.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.590
One of the models we use
for talking about consumer

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:19.050
experiences-- feel, think,
do, and loyalty or bond.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.400
I thought then
and still think it

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.160
does a wonderful
job in the think

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.310
and do area because you enable
the parent to do research

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.230
and get comfortable with
the flu shot concept.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.740
And then actually take it
to getting the shot itself.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.550
So it actually then
directs them to a place

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.020
where they can get the shot.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.100
So I use it in many
presentations as something

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.890
that fulfills the
think and do component.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:50.170
Can we talk about Frankenstein
and what your hypothesis

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.160
or epiphany was to build a
different type of agency,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.600
different type of company.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.141
LARRY WEBER: One of
the problems I've

00:16:56.141 --> 00:17:01.120
had being around this
long is the three

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.970
strands I was in back
in the early '80s

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.720
introducing software companies.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.690
And then I was lucky
enough in 1992, 1993,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.810
it was probably a very
seminal time for at least me

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.827
when we were invited.

00:17:13.827 --> 00:17:15.660
Well, let me tell you
a story, and then I'll

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.560
get to Frankenstein.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.720
We still do work
for the labs at MIT.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.270
So we still represent
the Media Lab.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.490
I have for 25 years both
at the previous company

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.420
and this company.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.765
And for about 15 years,
we represented the lab

00:17:28.765 --> 00:17:30.310
for computer science,
which arguably

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.120
is the one that
has really produced

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.600
the things that have changed.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.650
I mean, ethernet, spreadsheet,
RSA security really

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.990
have changed a lot of things
and made Kendall Square so hot,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.490
I think.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.870
I was called up by the guy
that had started that, Michael

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.710
Dertouzos, who was a big
consultant to Bill Gates,

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.400
and was one of the founders
of Davos, the World Economic

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.450
Forum.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.390
And he called because
he was mad that Nicholas

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.387
Negroponte-- who's a
wonderful man, a bit acerbic.

00:18:05.387 --> 00:18:06.970
MALE SPEAKER: Tell
everyone who he is.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.553
LARRY WEBER: He
founded the Media Lab,

00:18:08.553 --> 00:18:11.860
and also One Laptop per
Child, which is very popular,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.660
started from 2007.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.390
It's still around in 2014.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.020
He should get the Nobel
Prize, by the way,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.640
not for the Media
Lab, but for bringing

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.920
the cost of computing
down in one fell swoop.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.090
I mean, in 2007
when we introduced

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:33.360
the XO, which we named the
little green laptop, people

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.680
yelling at Nicholas
from Dell to HP to IBM

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.160
was still in the
business, Lenovo.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.180
Because what forced their
hand was, hey, guys,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.900
you can't get $2,000
for a laptop anymore.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.330
MALE SPEAKER: He was delivering
laptops to kids in Africa

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.940
for less than $100
apiece, right?

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.523
LARRY WEBER: We
didn't get below $100.

00:18:54.523 --> 00:18:57.340
We got to about $148
or something like that.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.200
And obviously now,
eventually, you

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.810
should be able it free just like
there'll be free smartphones.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.310
Which definitely will
happen in your lifetime.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.090
The devices will mostly be free.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.610
That's why Apple's
becoming a fashion company,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.510
and to me, now, the technology
company as much anymore.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.500
Even though their software is
what got them here, you know?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.326
But to finish that story,
Michael had come over

00:19:24.326 --> 00:19:25.450
and he brought a videotape.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.210
Who brings a videotape to
a meeting anymore, right?

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.340
And he brought a little
British man with him

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.740
that had just joined
his organization.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.480
Right here, he's still here
at that Ray Stata building,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.770
the weird Frank Gehry
building that still leaks.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.700
But anyway, his name
was Tim Berners-Lee.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.650
And so Tim sat
there very quietly.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.540
He had brought his
experiment or his research

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.520
called HTML to the lab
for computer science

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.620
and he, by the way, called
it the World Wide Web.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.190
He asked if that was
catchy, but anyway.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.490
But Michael puts in
this video and it

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.825
was him on-- are you familiar
with the "Today Show" on NBC?

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.690
I ask because my 25-year-old
and 22-year-old daughters

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.270
have no idea what
the "Today Show" is.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.492
Anyway, so it was
on the occasion.

00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:23.200
He had written a big
bestseller, Michael,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.160
with a guy who still teaches
here at 89 years old,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.630
Nobel Prize winner for
economics in 1997, Robert Solow.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.950
And they wrote a book together
called "Made in America"

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.820
in 1981, and that's why he
was on the "Today Show."

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.010
And it was of 12 years earlier.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.220
A guy named Bryant
Gumbel was the main host.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.830
He's on television
a little bit still,

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.630
and his brother's sports.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.580
But he starting
to interview him.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.160
And the book, by the
way, it was a time,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.060
the older people will remember,
when our economy really sucked

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.890
and the Germans and the Japanese
were really eating our lunch.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.240
And the main reason was
they had new factories

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.690
and we didn't, but nobody
talked about that at the time.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.150
But this book,
"Made in America,"

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.580
argued that you should all
just chill because America

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.705
has one thing that no
other country has-- Germany

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:16.990
and Japan, and they weren't
really looking at China

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.710
at the time because it was still
sort of disorganized there.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.560
But it was this thing
called software,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.870
and that we had the ability
to use creativity and computer

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.700
technology to actually
create so many things that

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.130
would lead to economic
prosperity for decades

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.590
and decades to come.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.880
And so he's talking about
this on this TV show,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.560
and the IBM PC had
just been launched too.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.020
And those old enough to
remember was the first time

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.240
there were ads on television.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.540
They used a Charlie Chaplin look
alike who was stacking boxes

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.530
and was actually a very popular
advertisement at the time.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:22:01.810
And what happened was Bryant
Gumbel looks over and says,

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.480
now, this PC kind of thing.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.590
This is just a fad, right?

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.690
This is all going to go away.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.530
And Professor Dertouzos leans
over the interview table

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.100
and goes not only is it
not going to go away,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.830
but within 20 years,
everyone will have

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.989
one of these on their desk.

00:22:15.989 --> 00:22:17.780
And they will be buying
and selling things,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.280
and they'll be
sharing information,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.870
and we'll be learning
from these machine.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.172
And he was describing
what has happened.

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:28.380
And Bryant Gumbel says we
have to cut to a commercial

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.630
because this is crazy.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.250
So I only bring that up
because then the background

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.390
of understanding and launching
HTML and the World Wide Web

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.710
consortium.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.040
Understanding marketing and
telling technology stories

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.420
for software companies
and technology companies.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.680
And then understanding
the media were all

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.360
starting to come together.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.130
And then I was stupid enough to
sell a company growing at 50%

00:22:54.130 --> 00:23:00.920
a year in 1996-97 97 to mad men,
and they really were "Mad Me."

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.230
I mean, at 5 o'clock they
started with the Martinis right

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.300
in the office.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.970
And I won't go into
the other stuff.

00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:12.625
MALE SPEAKER: What's
your next book?

00:23:15.152 --> 00:23:16.610
LARRY WEBER: My
wife said to retire

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.000
before I write the
book of working

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.900
with everybody from Steve
Jobs to Muammar Gaddafi,

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.730
so what an odd career.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.380
Well, first of all,
I sold too early.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.030
But that's OK.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.400
I got to spend seven
years on Madison Avenue

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.930
and help them buy their
first digital agency.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.110
They didn't even
know what that was.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.530
One was called RGA, that
has flourished quite well.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.270
I'm sure you guys worked with.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.420
And I built Weber
Shandwick, then

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.140
I bought 31 companies
around the world.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.040
But what I was learning
was what I've always

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.040
tried to see is what the
vision of the perfect marketing

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.070
service company would be because
the agency world was going

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.940
to change was my determination.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.470
It can't depend on television
commercials forever.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:18.650
Now, again, I thought television
was going to die much earlier.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.620
And have you
noticed, by the way,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.050
my ADD medicine's
not kicking in,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.170
but have you
noticed that there's

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.135
more live events on television
than there's ever been?

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:30.010
And you know why that is, right?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.930
It's much harder to get rid of
a commercial on live events.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.160
And so all the
big TV companies--

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.720
I mean, the NBCs,
the CBSes-- they're

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.902
all looking for more
that they can present.

00:24:41.902 --> 00:24:44.360
So that's why they're trying
to get European soccer to have

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.100
a following and
more reality shows

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.120
so that you can't
delete that commercial.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.390
But back to Frankenstein--
so I learned all the way

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.250
through all of this.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.650
Through technology,
having the largest office

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.970
in Palo Alto of any
PR firm for years,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.870
watching the failures of
startup companies and that.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.680
And by the time my earn-out was
over, I stayed two more years

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.110
and I said, you know what?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.490
There's got to be a
different model for this.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.620
And I made the mistake of
saying, all right, what

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.220
I'm going to do is
my folding company,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.540
I'm going to have what's
next in every category

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.600
and only digitized.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.530
So what's next in advertising?

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.520
What's next in direct?

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.410
What's next in
data and analytics?

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:29.787
What's next in PR?

00:25:29.787 --> 00:25:31.620
And they're all going
to have separate names

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.780
and we're all going to
be one big happy family

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.360
and we're going
to be the future.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:42.340
And I realized that
after 2008 came,

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.410
nobody wanted to buy old
stuff let alone new stuff,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.280
and that was really tough.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.780
So I went through
three years of it.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.350
It was just terrible.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.650
And finally, IBM and
General Electric and Kaiser

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.400
all about the same time
said, you know, Larry?

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.480
Your ideas are right,
but they should all

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.910
be integrated and put together.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.130
And this should be
one agency offering.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.330
It shouldn't just be.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.382
And so that's when we started
to really integrate everything.

00:26:12.382 --> 00:26:14.090
But we have to lead
with a point of view,

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.000
and that's what I
call earned media,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.930
which is a fancy name for PR.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.090
So how do you get
covered in the blogs?

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.020
How do you get
covered on TechCrunch?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.380
How do you get covered
in wallstreetjournal.com,

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.430
forbes.com, all
that kind of stuff.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.805
But we quickly move then
to a creative department,

00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:32.780
a technology department.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.550
We've developed two software
products around influence

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.550
so that we could identify the
100 most influential people

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.850
to a specific
company or a product

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.840
and what are their
social properties?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.670
So we know what
one reporter really

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.080
likes to tweet, another
one doesn't, who

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.170
their friends are on Facebook,
et cetera, kind of things.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.280
So we're really working deeply
from an influence perspective,

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.810
and then I argue that
the future of an agency

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.840
is going to be about a new
solar system model where

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.780
the sun-- if you take
this metaphor-- the sun is

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.740
the customer and all the
planets going around it

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.160
are things like marketing
automation, software, content,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.420
visualization, data
analytics, all that.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.680
And some of those are all going
to collide and become together

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.880
kinds of things.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.750
But it's going to be an
interesting time right now.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.710
There's a reason that there
wasn't a marketing ERP system

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.940
and every other
category had one.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.850
HR was PeopleSoft, finance
was SAP, database was Oracle.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.250
You can go down the line.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.750
And I think the reason
is, one, Madison Avenue

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.940
Mafia, and London and
Paris now, who are trying

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.674
to keep television alive.

00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:54.340
And how they're going to do that
is combining more with you guys

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.700
and doing as much as they
can to prop up the media

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.450
spends that they have.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.960
But my view is
that there's going

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.870
to be an alignment
of consulting,

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.990
of creative technology
of software.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.200
Deloitte, for example,
bunch of accountants

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
just bought a San
Francisco digital agency.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.080
Interesting to me that they
now could do everything

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.780
from conceptual consulting,
much like a Bain

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.390
or a BCG, all the way through
execution of a campaign,

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.160
digitally.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.140
And then we see competitors
from any given day,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:40.750
Sapient and Digitas to Ogilvy
is a big competitor of ours now,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.280
to the big PR firms, who
are actually really lagging

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.380
still because PR is
still a category that

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.350
waits for stuff to
happen and then reacts

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.500
versus being very aggressive
about making things happen,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.280
which is more the paid
side of the world.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.150
And so, it's been a
fascinating time right now.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.650
But I think that
the next five years

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.040
are going to be interesting
in this convergence,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.080
and I think
companies like Google

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.860
are right at the heart of this.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.730
As one of the sumo wrestlers
for the heart and soul

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.560
of the future of the web.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.780
And I don't know if you seen
the tech or the Venture Beat

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.220
article last week on
the era of messaging?

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.600
Has anybody seen that?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.350
I recommend looking
at that article

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.960
as it will impact your business.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.070
And I thought they
want a little too far.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.705
That messaging is going
to be so explosive

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:37.650
and that's going to be a new
advertising model and marketing

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.680
model, but it's another
play in the thing.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.980
I'm on the board of the largest
social network in Africa.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:51.930
It's called MIXT-- M-I-X-T-- and
it's a feature phone kind of.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.720
So more like a WhatsApp
for Africa kind of thing.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.760
And it's interesting to see the
different uses of messaging.

00:30:01.112 --> 00:30:03.070
I'm sure you guys are
studying this completely.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.770
But in this last book, I talk a
lot about if I was a young kid

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.390
and I was interested
in marketing,

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.730
I'd get into loyalty,
digital loyalty or couponing.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.830
I think that is still
in the dark ages,

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.300
and how that's going
to happen contextually.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.880
I'll give you an example.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.825
I was on a panel with Howard
Schultz two years ago,

00:30:21.825 --> 00:30:26.020
a year and a half
ago in Washington.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.790
And after, we were all talking
afterwards, and he said,

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.470
would you be a guinea
pig for a marketing thing

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.890
we're trying to
do with Starbucks?

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.670
And I said, OK, sure.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.700
And I didn't hear anything from
him or anybody from Starbucks.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.190
But about a month
later, I get an email

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.740
to introduce the person in
the marketing department

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.950
at Starbucks and said thanks
for agreeing to do this test

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.400
program with us.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.700
And would you fill out
this sort of survey.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.650
It was like SurveyMonkey,
only customized to Starbucks.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.110
And it asked me questions
like when you go to Starbucks,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.780
what time usually is it?

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.560
What's your favorite
thing you order?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.300
If you order food,
what food do you order?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.400
Do you buy for your
family or other people,

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.170
or is it pretty much, so
does somebody buy for you?

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.890
And so they were asking
some pretty good questions

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.679
even though it was only about
eight to nine questions.

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:20.720
And then would you give
us your cellphone number,

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.570
and I said sure.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.860
By the way, I'm from the Scott
McNealy school of privacy.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.180
I don't believe
it exists anymore.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.700
I'm OK with it, except
in the future I think--

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.310
MALE SPEAKER: You're
going to have to tell

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.600
everyone who Scott McNealy is.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.391
LARRY WEBER: Oh, he
was one of the founders

00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:38.330
of Sun Microsystems that
was bought by Oracle.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.980
And they had the software, Java
was one of their big software

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.380
platforms.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.400
Anybody uses Java anymore?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.750
But anyway, he also
said privacy is dead.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.619
Get over it.

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.910
But I do think it's going to
be an important discussion

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.860
around health data.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.407
But I don't care
if somebody knows I

00:31:57.407 --> 00:31:58.990
like pink shirts
from Brooks Brothers.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.970
I really don't.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.000
In fact, it should
work in my advantage

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.770
that somebody knows
that kind of thing.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.125
To finish the Starbucks story,
so I forgot about it again

00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:13.950
because they didn't do anything.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.090
I didn't get any
offers or anything.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.470
So I'm with my middle
daughter in London.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.520
She had some time
off-- or no, I know.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.400
She was doing one of those
junior year things in Edinburgh

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.080
and I had her come down
to London to see a show.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:34.207
And so we were waking up
at the hotel and I said,

00:32:34.207 --> 00:32:36.040
well, let's go get some
breakfast somewhere.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.060
And right when I
said that-- that was,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.455
I'm sure, coincidental-- I
get a text from Starbucks.

00:32:43.455 --> 00:32:44.080
And it's says--

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.486
MALE SPEAKER: All of
that was coincidental?

00:32:44.486 --> 00:32:46.550
LARRY WEBER: Yeah,
I say, Hi, Larry.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.840
It says, hi, Larry.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.370
Why don't you come
across the street

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.610
to 325 Kensington High Street
for your free iced espresso,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.780
and we'll give you 25 pounds
off your breakfast sandwich.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.620
And I went, Julia,
let's go over there.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.050
I think this is cool.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.745
Julia being a 21-year-old coed
at one of those fancy schools

00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:10.430
that costs too much said,
Dad, that's sort of creepy.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:15.810
They could have sent
a drone on top of you.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.100
I'm like, well, now let's
go see if this works.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.840
So we went in and
I said I think I

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.140
have a free iced
espresso and some money

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.740
off a breakfast sandwich.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.560
And she says, OK, I
haven't seen that before.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.050
But you know, so I held
it up and it goes through.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.680
And so I get it and I
thought that was pretty cool.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.580
And then I started
thinking about all that

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.372
must have had to go into that.

00:33:41.372 --> 00:33:42.830
And I started
thinking about things

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.550
like contextual marketing, and
predictive analytics, which

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.350
are going to be the
two of the biggest

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.460
areas in the next few years.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.920
And I was thinking, well,
what if they offered me

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.870
like an iced herbal tea
and I hate herbal tea?

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.430
And they would have
set the relationship

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.100
back a little with me, even
though it was a free offer.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.030
So that's what I mean
about the complexity

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.540
in the future of this
sort of digital loyalty

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.750
and points and programming.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.429
And then I was
trying to use points

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.525
to go down to see a college with
my youngest son the other day.

00:34:15.525 --> 00:34:16.900
And it was such
a pain in the ass

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.020
to try to use my
delta points still.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.860
And I'm like, who's going
to come up with-- just,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.870
it is so easy.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.820
Mr. Weber, you have
900,000 points,

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:32.130
and I still had to pay
full price for my ticket.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:37.670
And I was like, my god,
this is just insane.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.409
I should be able to just
hold up that smartphone.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:44.150
You guys organize it-- you,
Delta, or I'm going to JetBlue.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.060
You organize it.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.340
I don't want to
have numbers, cards.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.520
I don't want any of that.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.141
You also hit a loyalty
nerve with me there.

00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:56.765
MALE SPEAKER: I had exactly the
same conversation with somebody

00:34:56.765 --> 00:34:58.530
maybe in this room,
but certainly someone

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:02.150
here at Google in the last
week about United and exactly

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.230
the same conversation.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.192
It was painful That was
a painful experience.

00:35:07.192 --> 00:35:08.900
Does anyone have any
questions for Larry?

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.281
OK, good, because I have
more, but I should shut up.

00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:12.280
LARRY WEBER: Is this OK?

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.120
Is this making
sense for you guys?

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.662
OK.

00:35:15.662 --> 00:35:17.620
I can answer things about
the future of search,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.646
too, if you want.

00:35:18.646 --> 00:35:19.520
AUDIENCE: Hey, Larry.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.650
Thanks for being here.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.430
Quick question.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.067
It's more of a hypothetical
desert island scenario.

00:35:25.067 --> 00:35:27.400
If you were taken out of your
current position and said,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.760
OK, you have to start a
widget company from scratch,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.130
limited budget,
what's your hierarchy

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.840
of needs for techniques?

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.900
Because when we're
talking to clients

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.130
and they think this
omnichannel, they're

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:44.290
often having a conversation
with us as, OK, search, display.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.130
They start talking
about things and what

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.780
they think the opportunity
cost of this dollar spent

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.682
here or that.

00:35:49.682 --> 00:35:51.140
And then they start
thinking, well,

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.990
does PR give us SEO benefit?

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.720
Does this happen?

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.820
We have limited people.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.890
We have limited money.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.090
So if I put you in
a scenario where

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.460
you are supposed to build
a brand from scratch

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.550
and you don't have any of
your current resources,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.550
how do you go about
building that plan?

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.260
LARRY WEBER: Yeah,
that's easy for me.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.360
Good question.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.040
I am not a big
believer in quant,

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.750
So that makes me pitted against
a lot of people right away.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.150
Because they want quant.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.130
They want massive
reach to customers

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.360
and they want it
right away and they

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.840
want startups to scale
right away, and this.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.710
What I would argue to build
a great lasting brand today,

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.210
and I talk with Reid Hoffman
about this all the time.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.829
He thinks LinkedIn will
last for a hundred years,

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:38.370
and that's what
they're trying to do.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.450
And I think it'll be replaced
just like Monster was.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:45.890
But anyway, what I
would do is I would

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:47.970
have strategies,
marketing strategies,

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.730
around engaging customers.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.300
And I would measure the
length of engagement,

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.930
the content that's working,
the content that's not working,

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.300
and I would enlist listen
as the sales people.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.240
How do you create a brand
around some kind of passion?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.020
And I think even old companies
can reinvent that way.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.520
One of the coolest
assignments we have right now,

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.550
which took nine
months of fighting

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.830
against the heads of marketing.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.090
There's a company
called John Deere,

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.210
and I was having a
drink with its CEO

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.130
who said to me after two drinks.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.560
He said, Larry, I don't know
what my legacy's going to be.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.670
I don't want it to be that I
just sold more green tractors.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.300
And so we started
talking about this,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.050
and there's a reason
I'm bringing this up.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.370
Because it can be
done for startups too.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.710
And I said, well, let's see.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.910
Let's look at the facts
about where you live.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.410
You're a $50 billion
company and you're

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:44.130
collecting more farm data than
anybody on the planet, right?

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.570
And his assistant or
one of his sidekicks

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.480
was quoting these numbers so I
could get a picture in my head.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.760
That when I was a kid, there
were 22,000 farms in America.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.440
Today, there's 8,000 farms, but
they're are three times as big

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.090
and they're also
really complicated

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:04.840
on whether soil
content, fertilizer.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.810
I mean, you name the data that
is needed to manage a farm.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.190
And then they started talking
about their peer group,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:16.380
and that their peer group
is Caterpillar and Kubota.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.690
And then somebody
mentioned too that there's

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.280
going to be two billion more
people that have to be fed

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.960
and we can't ruin the planet.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.200
How do we have a better yield
and how do we sort of do

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.970
good and that kind of stuff.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.330
And so we went back
with a program that

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.230
said forget your peers are
Caterpillar and Kubota.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.710
Just forget it.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.720
Your peers are Google,
Amazon, and Apple, John Deere.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.680
And of course, they looked
at me like I had three heads

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.770
because they're like, no.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.800
We don't understand.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.030
We don't compete with Amazon.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.790
I said, it's not
about competition.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.609
It's how you approach the way
and the work that you're doing,

00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:57.650
and how you're going to
be innovative about this.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.860
They had so much software
that they had developed

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.770
to help manage farms and data.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.320
And so we're now working on this
huge program about how they're

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.800
not really about the tractors.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.960
Yes they are.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.480
But they're about feeding
the next $2 billion people

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.630
and they're about helping
manage farms smarter and better

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.840
and more effectively.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.510
And this led me to
a marketing theory,

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.535
even for smaller
companies, that you know

00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:24.750
what is going to happen now?

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.890
And this is a really
scary prediction.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.890
I actually think big
software companies

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.880
are going to fail long term.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.280
I think you're going to
see Oracle and SAP-- I

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.840
think these companies are
going to have a lot of trouble.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.320
And I think what's
going to happen

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.450
is you're going to see GM,
John Deere, they're hiring

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.920
more and more developers.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.460
They're customizing
more and more software.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.470
They're managing more
data and analytics,

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:53.030
and they're engaging customers
with important decision making

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.910
tools.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.460
And I think Google has got
to sit in the middle of that,

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.950
but I also think that's where
your marketing strategy has

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.780
to go.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.560
So there's a company
spinning out.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.770
You guys must know this
company spinning out

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.660
of MIT called Ditto.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.690
And they have a
really cool technology

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:13.410
around analyzing
videos and photographs.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.990
They know where you bought
that shirt by analyzing it

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.040
on Facebook or Instagram.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.390
Now don't ask me how they
can do that one, all right?

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:24.710
But same thing.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.740
How do you both start
to get that message out

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.390
to marketers and
to the customers

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.850
that they want in a more
educated way, not in

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.710
an in your face way.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.510
And how do you create engagement
and content strategies

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.200
and things like that?

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.410
And then on the earned
media site when you said PR,

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.870
I still think that
carries a lot of weight.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.490
Look at TripAdvisor alone.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.710
I was talking to the CEO.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.710
It looks like you're going to
be sued by the country of Mexico

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:57.010
because there's so many
bad reviews of the beaches

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.582
and the resorts in Mexico
that the government feels

00:41:01.582 --> 00:41:04.040
that their businesses there
have lost like $4 billion or $5

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.840
billion and they're
blaming TripAdvisor.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.380
Of course, I would
just say, well,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.300
make the beach nicer, right?

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.480
Make me a stronger drink
or something like that.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.080
But a part of what
is also wasted--

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.610
and I wish Google would
spend time on this too,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.170
or somebody would-- is
we don't have the metrics

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.750
in this new generation
of marketing

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.430
that the '60s, '70s,
'80s, or the "Mad Men"

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.310
had with CPMs and all that.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.170
They were so good at
bullshitting the client on what

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.880
was really measurable.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.980
And we don't have that.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.540
Nobody's grabbing
the baton and saying

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.030
is engagement time import?

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.685
Is a share index important?

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.410
Nobody talks about
organic search anymore.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.070
We were talking
about it at lunch.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.200
How important that is.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.620
It's not just the paid search.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.570
It's, gee, I googled
20 times today,

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.160
and I got the
information I want.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.780
Or I did make a purchase with
the small company I've never

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.120
worked with before,
and that kind of thing.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.430
So anyway, I think there's
a whole metric world that

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.590
hasn't been brought together.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.400
That's a long answer, too.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.569
But we're paying
bloggers more and more,

00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:16.860
so that's another strategy
that I think is interesting.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.020
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:21.910
LARRY WEBER: Hi.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.390
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
about the Frankenstein agency

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.470
and how everything is
going to be integrated

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.970
and talking to each other.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:32.450
Can you share how you think
mobile is going to affect that?

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.470
What's going to be the
tipping point for mobile?

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.800
And when you think companies are
going to actually start caring?

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.550
LARRY WEBER: Yeah.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.090
Well, first, I come
from the school

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.800
that there's no such
thing as mobile.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.640
So I think just
everything is mobile.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:57.140
You can take anything
anywhere, I guess.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.280
I think companies want, again,
to see that metric result.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.070
That if they're doing
loyalty programs,

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.010
like Starbucks
was testing on me,

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.220
they want to see that that's
really working from a loyalty

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:07.900
perspective.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.341
So I think there's a real
measurement thing to mobile

00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:10.840
around.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.320
I don't think it's
around banners.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.890
I don't think it's around
that kind of mobile marketing.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.510
I think it's going to be about
community building, engagement,

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.740
messaging I think is
going to be important.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.320
Couponing, loyalty, all
those kinds of stuff.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.280
And some companies
are really getting it.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.120
I mean, business to business
companies aren't as much yet.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.280
But Deere is using
mobile apps to show

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.890
how you can get better yield.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.950
So you have to show
both the information

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.390
and the data side as
well as the sales side

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:50.994
in some of these kinds
of efforts are stories.

00:43:50.994 --> 00:43:52.410
But I think obviously
everything's

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.360
going to be a smartphone driven.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.570
I'm not sure about the watch.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.860
Is that coming out this week?

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:03.200
I'm just not sure if
that's just a paradigm

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.360
trying to make an
old paradigm better.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.345
I just don't know.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:15.390
I definitely wouldn't
pay $17,000 for a watch,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:18.640
but I think the more
senior people that

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.070
come to me are they're
looking for brand engagement.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.970
How are we going
to engage audiences

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.990
for a long period of time?

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.820
So I'm less in the
transaction business

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.280
and more in the engagement
and brand engagement business.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.530
Because I think brand is
defined as the conversation

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.710
you have with your customer.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.960
The weaker the conversation,
the weaker your brand is.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.820
The stronger the conversation,
the stronger your brand.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.249
Of course there's a
quant side to everything.

00:44:43.249 --> 00:44:45.040
How are we going to
sell more orange juice?

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.780
And I think all the
analytic companies,

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.390
we may have way
too many of them,

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:55.660
but I think they're working hard
on all that kind of software

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.470
to do to deal with that.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.490
And there's more mobile
software kinds of things.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.350
But for Facebook to spend $22
billion dollars for WhatsApp,

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:09.924
I mean, that tells you they
see some vision of advertising

00:45:09.924 --> 00:45:16.336
in messaging, or else
they're just stupid.

00:45:16.336 --> 00:45:17.947
I don't know.

00:45:17.947 --> 00:45:19.030
MALE SPEAKER: Anyone else?

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.070
I have another one
if no one-- OK.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.700
Larry, you talk to,
obviously, senior executives

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.955
at a wide variety of
companies and company types.

00:45:26.955 --> 00:45:29.030
What do you hear about Google?

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:33.890
What do senior executives
say about Google

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.490
from a macro
perspective if they do,

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.840
and what do they think their
relationship with Google

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.030
should be?

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.320
LARRY WEBER: I think if they
understand Google at all,

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.605
there's very much from
a search point of view

00:45:46.605 --> 00:45:48.025
and a page search point of view.

00:45:48.025 --> 00:45:53.490
They realize there's sort
of a real basic elder

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.840
or a mythic value to Google.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.510
So obviously, you've
won the search.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.660
At least searches that
exists today, you've won that

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.470
and we need to
spend money in that.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.740
Because if I make hot,
red convertibles at Ford

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.240
and I'm in charge
of marketing that,

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.950
I better own sexy,
hot, red convertible.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.390
The best price for
that kind of thing.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.820
I think they get that.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.570
I think some of the
things they don't get

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.840
is why is Google
trying everything?

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.220
Like why, you know?

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.030
What is really this
Internet of Things?

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.799
And why do they want
a driverless car?

00:46:28.799 --> 00:46:30.590
And why are they in
looking at health care?

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:31.881
And what are the glasses about?

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.700
How is this going to impact me,
my brand, and what we're doing?

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.220
And I think to
remain an innovator,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.090
you have to do that stuff.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.800
But I think the
clarity of how you're

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.176
going to help big brands
I think can be better.

00:46:50.176 --> 00:46:54.220
I think right now, it's more
on that paid search level

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.070
and more in the era when
most people wake up and go

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:01.860
to your landing page before
anything else and something.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.470
How does that help me
at IBM, or how does it

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:09.430
help me at John Deere.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:13.720
And I think that needs to
more corporate understanding

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.637
of brand versus just
the tactical work.

00:47:17.637 --> 00:47:18.970
But I think they respect Google.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.180
I think the smarter
conversations

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:28.260
I have, like, who do you think
the two or three people that

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.860
might win this
sort of everything

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:37.070
from Internet of Things to
the next wave of computing,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.680
mobility, and all that.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.110
And I constantly say
it's the two biggest sumo

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:46.490
wrestlers in my opinion
are Amazon and Google.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:52.095
The last time I saw Bezos
being interviewed out

00:47:52.095 --> 00:47:58.240
at one of those highfalutin
Techonomy kind of things.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.950
The interviewer
said, how does it

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.680
feel to be one of the greatest
retailers of all time?

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.050
And he looked
physically disturbed.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.880
And he wears this baseball
hat now really low.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.180
And he goes, I am
not a retailer.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.590
And the interviewer went,
OK, but what are you?

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.890
He goes, I'm the biggest
sucker of data on the planet.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.680
That's what he said.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.680
And so to show more, I think,
the positioning of Google,

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.720
how you are the next
generation of data collection

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.340
and how you use that to
create better brands,

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.570
I think it is an important
juncture right now.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:42.346
By the way, I don't think
Apple's in that race

00:48:42.346 --> 00:48:43.220
or that conversation.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.820
I think Facebook
is questionable.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.240
And maybe there's a new company.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.420
There's always a new company,
but it's not Dropbox or Box.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.530
Twitter should have been
more video and visual.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.740
So there's probably
a startup that's

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.220
trying to play with
co-creation of visuals

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.680
or real-time sharing.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.860
Snapchat is interesting.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.800
It's getting into ads.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:17.410
And Instagram still is
growing quite a bit,

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.890
so it seems to be
a bit of a model.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.180
But again, I don't see the
impact that a Google has had.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.070
The couple times I've
met your founders early

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:35.390
in their careers, just
refreshing young men

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:39.800
at the time, really, just
trying to figure out how they

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.470
could move the world ahead.

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.860
And I think they really
meant that they wanted Google

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.592
to be a really good company.

00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:49.050
And I don't think people get
that sense as much that you've

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.090
gotten so big.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.375
What do you do that's good?

00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:57.300
What do you do as a good company
for the planet, for people?

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.952
MALE SPEAKER: I think that's
a good place to stop, then.

00:49:59.952 --> 00:50:00.660
Thank you, Larry.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.060
Thanks very much for joining us.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.810
LARRY WEBER: Yeah.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:03.910
Thanks.
