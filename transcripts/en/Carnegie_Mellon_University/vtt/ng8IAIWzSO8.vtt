00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.836
&gt;&gt; Lewis was elected as a fellow
of the American Academy of Arts

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:13.466
and Sciences in 2008, and the
Outstanding Achievement Award

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.906
from the University
of Minnesota,

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.776
and the Harold R. Johnson
Diversity Service Award

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:20.106
from the University of Michigan,

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.956
and has earned several
honorary doctorate degrees.

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:26.986
A native of Tidewater Virginia.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:29.266
&gt;&gt; Whoa! That's my city!

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:35.986
[ Laughter ]

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:39.136
&gt;&gt; Hello to all the
one residents

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.396
of Tidewater, Virginia.

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.596
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.526
Lewis earned his undergraduate
degree in history and psychology

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:51.686
from Concordia College in
Moore-- Moorhead Minnesota,

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:55.726
and his PhD in history from
the University of Minnesota.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.956
Just in case you are wondering,

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.766
in a few minutes
you will realize

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:07.436
that Dr. Lewis' Minnesota accent
is somewhat very different

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:09.946
from my Iowa accent,
a neighboring state.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:10.966
Dr. Lewis.

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:20.906
[ Applause ]

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.116
&gt;&gt; It's actually very nice to
travel the world and realize

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:27.036
that other people have actually
made their way from [inaudible]

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:30.976
to other parts of the
country as well, so salute.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.546
[ Laughter ]

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.496
Subra thank you for
that introduction.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.116
I was reminded that yesterday
would have been my mother's

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:42.446
birthday; she passed
away a few years ago.

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:46.266
She would have loved that
introduction, I have to say.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.846
Good morning to you all and I
think it is still good morning.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:50.826
Good morning.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:51.896
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:53.646
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.856
We gather this Sunday
morning to salute you,

00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:00.476
the Carnegie Mellon
University class of 2016

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:03.456
for staying the course,
overcoming challenges,

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.386
setting aside failures,

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:09.196
appropriately accepting
success, and graduating.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.006
This is an awesome
achievement and I'm honored

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:13.986
to share in the moment.

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:18.356
In fact I would like to thank
Subra Suresh, President of CMU

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:20.636
and pro [inaudible], as well

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:23.096
as the Carnegie Mellon
University Board of Trustees

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:26.866
for this wonderful opportunity
to receive an honorary degree

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.406
from this spectacular
institution.

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:33.356
My personal relationship
with Carnegie Mellon began

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:36.536
over three decades ago when
my good friend Joe Trotter,

00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:39.636
Dr. Joe Trotter, invited me
to speak about my research

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:41.776
on African American migrants.

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:46.266
Inevitably that opportunity
yielded the privilege of serving

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:50.066
on a CMU humanities and social
sciences college review panel,

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:52.746
chairing an external
review committee

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:55.116
for the history department,
and having the chance

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:58.626
to assist Dr. Trotter in
funding and launching CAUSE,

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.036
the Center for Africanamerican
Urban Studies and the Economy,

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:05.756
which has just recently
celebrated its 20th

00:03:05.906 --> 00:03:07.646
anniversary [cheering].

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:08.976
Yes. That's great.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:13.546
[ Applause ]

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:17.006
Now I am both humbled and
delighted to speak on behalf

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:19.876
of this year's very diverse
and distinguished class

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:23.376
of honorary degree recipients,
a group that includes,

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:25.796
as you've heard, an acclaimed
stage and screen star

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:28.376
who counts among her
accomplishments an academy

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:32.566
award, a golden globe, and
two Emmys, a television icon

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:34.116
and Emmy award winning writer

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:37.586
and actress whose influenced the
lives of millions of children,

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:42.956
a prolific innovator worth
over 1100 patents worldwide,

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.026
and one of the most
successful venture capitalists

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:46.836
in the world.

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:49.916
Graduates make a
note to yourself;

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:52.096
learn more about these folks.

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:57.536
It is also an honor to be
standing here before a group

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.506
of students that
have been vetted

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:02.196
by the vigorous academic
standards and requirements

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:04.256
of one of the world's
finest universities.

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:07.876
You have been given the Carnegie
Mellon stamp of approval,

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:11.456
and with it comes
a certain level

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:14.616
of attainment and
responsibility.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:17.496
Now many years ago,
as you've heard,

00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:20.716
I walked across a similar stage
at a small [inaudible] College

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.876
in Minnesota to accept
my diploma.

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.686
Like many of you, I was
able to join the ranks

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:29.756
of the newly educated because
someone believed in me.

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:33.806
In my case it was started
with my maternal grandmother.

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:38.866
While her dream was deferred
she strategized to ensure

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:41.056
that my dream would
not be denied.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.536
It was the early 20th century

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.626
and my grandmother had
saved money, twice,

00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.686
to attend St. Augustine College
in Raleigh North Carolina.

00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:54.656
Each time she did her father
asked her for the money

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:57.396
to save an older brother
from losing his home,

00:04:58.126 --> 00:04:59.956
and the sad truth is he lost

00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:03.976
that home during the
Great Depression.

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.416
A domestic in the
segregated south for most

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:10.386
of her working days my
grandmother reserved her dream

00:05:10.386 --> 00:05:13.416
of being educated
by passing it along.

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:17.906
When it came time for my--
for her daughter, my mother,

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:21.556
to graduate from high school
my grandmother sent her first

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:24.876
to the Norfolk Division
of Virginia State,

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:26.496
today's Norfolk State
University.

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:29.986
So my grandmother feared
the demands of living

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:33.586
at home would distract my
mother from her studies

00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:36.256
so this god fearing,
church going woman,

00:05:36.746 --> 00:05:40.946
played the daily number, or
what was referred to back then

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:43.946
as a poor person's
lottery, and she won.

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.556
[ Cheering ]

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:49.396
Even though my grandmother
could have used that money

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:52.656
to ease the burdens of
her own life she st--

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:56.186
she chose instead to send my
mother to St. Augustine College

00:05:56.746 --> 00:05:59.046
because she believed
just that fervently

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.076
in the transformative
power of education.

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:07.006
When I came along the only
question I was allowed

00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:10.796
to entertain was which
college will you attend.

00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:13.436
So I stand before you today

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:15.636
because of my grandmother's
determination

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:17.826
to pay a dream forward.

00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:21.116
My mother and I inherited
the belief

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:23.536
that the educated
have a responsibility

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.336
to pay back the faith
invested in them by working

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.176
to in some way improve
the world.

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:31.806
Let's see.

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:35.576
Let's see a show of hands
how many of you have family,

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:39.496
friends, and teachers who
backed and supported you

00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:41.386
through your higher education
experience [cheering].

00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:45.026
Thank you.

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:48.376
Please join me in recognizing
these special individuals

00:06:48.706 --> 00:06:50.976
with a ruckus round of applause.

00:06:51.516 --> 00:07:01.896
[ Applause ]

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:03.376
Their job is done.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:07.396
In fact if you listen
closely you'll hear some sighs

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:09.666
of relief coming from parents
in the audience [laughter].

00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:14.166
Now your job, like
mine when I graduated,

00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:17.636
is to never confuse the
attainment of an education

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:19.836
with what it means
to be educated.

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:23.016
Graduation marks
a moment in time

00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:26.266
when you have assembled
the necessary credits

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:27.206
to earn a degree.

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.596
But being educated--

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:33.296
being educated requires you to
deploy the discipline of mind

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:36.736
that comes with the pursuit of
knowledge for the betterment,

00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:39.906
not only of yourself
and your family,

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:42.466
but also the greater society.

00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:47.106
I graduated in the
post-Vietnam era of gas lines,

00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:49.856
student protests, and
racial desegregation.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.316
I knew what had been and what
was happening at the time

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:57.806
but I had no idea what to expect

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.606
in the years and
decades to come.

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:04.496
For example, in 1978 it
was nearly impossible

00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:08.996
to conceive a desktop
computers, much less a world

00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:10.736
so completely integrated

00:08:10.736 --> 00:08:14.766
with powerful personal computing
ability that resides in a phone.

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:16.706
Just think about that.

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:18.686
It hasn't been that long ago.

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:25.326
Back then when I imagined the
future I pictured a world akin

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:25.996
to the Jetsons.

00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:32.666
There are people in
this audience old enough

00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:33.956
to remember the Jetsons
[laughter].

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:36.716
A prime time animated series

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.406
that predated the Simpsons
by almost 30 years.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:43.236
Its world was populated
with space age families,

00:08:43.516 --> 00:08:45.696
sassy robots, and flying cars.

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:48.816
Computers delivered
both instant meals

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.246
and instantaneous
medical diagnosis,

00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:55.636
and cures for diseases were
just one individually formulated

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:56.126
pill away.

00:08:57.656 --> 00:09:02.006
Flash forward to today and
flying cars are still a matter

00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:04.606
of fantasy but we
aren't that far away

00:09:04.606 --> 00:09:07.496
from a semi-autonomous
automobile.

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:10.406
Gene mapping is almost common
place in the development

00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:12.296
of customized treatment plans.

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:15.956
Robotics is now offered
as part of the curriculum

00:09:16.046 --> 00:09:18.696
in many high schools
across the United States.

00:09:18.756 --> 00:09:22.216
And artificial intelligent
protocols such as IBM

00:09:22.616 --> 00:09:27.116
to Watson regularly beat humans
at games of knowledge and logic.

00:09:29.126 --> 00:09:33.616
It is said that at CMU you
do not imagine the future,

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:34.916
you create it.

00:09:35.906 --> 00:09:38.546
But indulge me for
a few seconds.

00:09:39.186 --> 00:09:40.206
Look ahead graduates.

00:09:40.516 --> 00:09:42.646
Look ahead to 25 years from now.

00:09:43.826 --> 00:09:44.336
What do you see?

00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:50.586
Marriage, children, sadly maybe
divorce, and success [laughter].

00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:54.536
It's true.

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:00.826
But what about on
the technology front?

00:10:01.336 --> 00:10:04.726
Will it be that the discipline
of robotics has ushered

00:10:04.726 --> 00:10:07.956
in a new age of productivity
and profitability;

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:11.676
a world where artificial
intelligence alters the makeup

00:10:11.816 --> 00:10:15.326
of a work as well as the
composition of a work force.

00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:20.546
Today a single retailer can
employ nearly 100,000 people

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:22.566
around the nation
to move product

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:25.306
from regional sites
to consumer homes.

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:27.686
There is, however, speculation

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:31.016
that robots could replace
these workers in short order;

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.906
not next year but tomorrow.

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:35.756
What happens then?

00:10:37.116 --> 00:10:39.216
Do we simply shrug
and acknowledge

00:10:39.216 --> 00:10:41.606
that progress always
comes at a price

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.616
or do we examine
the broader social

00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:47.446
and economic implications?

00:10:48.786 --> 00:10:52.596
Graduates, many of you will
certainly be the architects

00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:54.576
of the next technological
revolution,

00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:57.996
but while you are developing
devices and programs

00:10:57.996 --> 00:10:59.436
that enhance efficiency,

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:03.676
and perhaps even save lives
you must also simultaneously

00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:09.286
challenge yourselves to solve
the impact of these advances.

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:12.536
As our economy shifts away
from human based work--

00:11:12.576 --> 00:11:14.126
from a human based workforce

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:18.016
to machine driven labor
will you make accommodations

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:21.466
for the newly technologically
disenfranchise?

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:25.236
Undoubtedly CMU has prepared you

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.876
to meet the exponentially
increasing technological demands

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:31.056
of a growing global economy

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.756
in a more environmentally
conscious manner.

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:38.626
But what additional tools
and insights might you need

00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:40.606
to be both successful
contributors

00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:42.976
and successful global citizens?

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:48.076
Twenty-five years from now
will the courses that you took

00:11:48.076 --> 00:11:52.806
in history, philosophy, and
literature, your experimentation

00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:56.876
with theatre and the arts, or
your interdisciplinary courses

00:11:56.876 --> 00:12:00.926
and studies-- and study abroad
prove just as useful as the work

00:12:00.926 --> 00:12:03.786
that made you a student
of science, math,

00:12:04.146 --> 00:12:06.126
and engineering or not?

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:10.466
For those of you in the arts and
the humanities will the value

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:14.266
of your degree decrease in
a technology focused world

00:12:14.646 --> 00:12:17.746
or increase because
people with your background

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:20.846
and training are
suddenly in short supply?

00:12:22.266 --> 00:12:26.556
It is critical that all of you
envision yourselves as part

00:12:26.556 --> 00:12:31.446
of the creative society which
produces creative solutions.

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:35.886
So historically we have looked
at those coming out of the arts

00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:39.116
and the humanities to help
us transform what we know

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:40.466
and how we know it.

00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:44.486
Today engineering, math,

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:47.086
and computer science
have truly evolved

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.206
into creative disciplines.

00:12:49.126 --> 00:12:52.436
More people worldwide
are familiar with Siri

00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:57.046
than any book, play, or essay
written in the last 100 years.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:01.706
The engineers and technologists
at Apple have created something

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:05.666
that has infiltrated our
consciences like few other works

00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:08.446
of art ever have, and that's
actually important to think

00:13:08.446 --> 00:13:11.056
about and dwell on and think
through the implications.

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:14.876
Yet science, engineering, and
math alone are not enough.

00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:18.126
Case in point, 9/11.

00:13:19.226 --> 00:13:22.506
Despite the utilization of
very sophisticated machinery

00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:25.136
and highly skilled
technicians we failed

00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:28.656
to intercept the terrorists
because 9/11 had more to do

00:13:28.826 --> 00:13:33.426
with religion and ideology
than with probes, drones,

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.486
and surveillance devices.

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:39.996
Similarly, engineers
successfully built a well

00:13:39.996 --> 00:13:42.096
in a West African
village not to long ago

00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:46.486
to ensure a ready supply of
clean water, yet fail to take

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:49.046
into consideration broader
cultural implications.

00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:53.186
To their surprise the women
who haul the water continue

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:56.486
to walk all the way to the
river despite the risk.

00:13:57.306 --> 00:13:57.936
When questioned

00:13:57.936 --> 00:14:00.046
by anthropologists
the women explain

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:04.176
that no one had asked them
where to build a well.

00:14:04.346 --> 00:14:07.676
You see, the hauling of the
water had a social function

00:14:08.036 --> 00:14:09.786
as well as a utilitarian one.

00:14:10.396 --> 00:14:13.626
The women used the time
to socialize and get away

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:17.526
from their children and
the men folk [laughter].

00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:21.986
Both of these examples
serve as a powerful reminder

00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:26.106
that studying a multiplicity
perspectives has real worth

00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:28.366
when we're trying to
solve real problems.

00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:32.206
Human interaction, as we
all well know, is messy.

00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:35.416
It's not always scientifically
based

00:14:35.496 --> 00:14:38.616
or mathematically
predictable, nor is it linear.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:41.956
Sometimes you simply
cannot get from point a

00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:44.546
to point b in a straight line.

00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.906
This is to suggest that the
world is complex and the issues

00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:53.076
that we face are indeed
complex, and it requires

00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:55.666
that technologists consult
with social scientists

00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:59.366
that humanist work with
engineers and that scientists

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.506
and artists collaborate
to solve problems

00:15:01.726 --> 00:15:03.116
and try new possibilities.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:08.746
Graduates as we move forward
in life and as you move forward

00:15:08.746 --> 00:15:12.776
in life you must strive to be
in conversations across lines

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:16.756
of difference, exchange
insights and ideas in a profound

00:15:16.756 --> 00:15:21.456
and noble way with people of
different racial, academic,

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:23.166
and social economic backgrounds.

00:15:23.946 --> 00:15:25.976
Luckily today's technologies
eclipse--

00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:30.826
eclipse time and distance making
it possible for you to connect

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:34.016
in real time with people in
different geographic zones

00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:36.936
across the United States
and around the world.

00:15:38.186 --> 00:15:41.296
You will also need to recognize
the importance of being embedded

00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:43.596
in community and
actively working

00:15:43.596 --> 00:15:46.076
to improve the American
form of democracy.

00:15:46.836 --> 00:15:49.946
That's not just about
voting; it's about the ways

00:15:49.946 --> 00:15:52.536
in which we think about
the opportunity for all

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:55.876
and actually being able
to gather information

00:15:55.876 --> 00:15:59.106
across a broad spectrum of
media that will allow you

00:15:59.106 --> 00:16:01.566
to fashion your understanding
of a world.

00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:05.306
Or to put it bluntly, to be
able to tell the difference

00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:07.146
between garbage and
the real stuff.

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:12.936
Now if this election cycle
is a harbinger of things

00:16:12.936 --> 00:16:15.876
to come successfully
stored in the garbage

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:19.096
from the real stuff
will become the hallmark

00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:21.886
of an enlightened citizen.

00:16:22.626 --> 00:16:24.266
Yeah we can think about
that for a second.

00:16:25.516 --> 00:16:27.596
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:16:28.096 --> 00:16:30.406
And this would be true
whether you were in Berlin,

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:31.676
Beijing, or Birmingham.

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:36.446
You must remember to ask why,
to research independently,

00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:41.196
to pursue truth, and to affirm
your commitment to honest,

00:16:41.526 --> 00:16:43.556
integrity, and the common good.

00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:50.126
Now look to the future once
more, to your 25th reunion.

00:16:50.756 --> 00:16:52.646
This time what do you see?

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:54.696
More changes

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:58.336
in the technological
landscape, greater diversity?

00:16:59.326 --> 00:17:01.896
How about improved
connectedness?

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:06.136
Hopefully you see your future
selves as inextricably linked

00:17:06.436 --> 00:17:10.416
to the Amer-- to America and the
world, both the opportunities

00:17:10.806 --> 00:17:14.286
and the challenges because you
have [inaudible] from either.

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:16.346
Keep looking.

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:20.606
Are you a key player in
the creation of a new

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:23.336
and technologically
responsible golden age?

00:17:24.286 --> 00:17:27.586
Are you balancing your desire
to create bigger, better,

00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:31.606
faster with the need to sustain
a healthy and vibrant economy

00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:34.546
in which all members
have a stake?

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:40.016
More specifically, are you the
leader that Carnegie Mellon

00:17:40.176 --> 00:17:46.346
as prepared you to become or
are you merely participating

00:17:46.606 --> 00:17:49.166
in the creation of
cool new stuff?

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:51.546
I challenge you.

00:17:52.236 --> 00:17:54.846
I challenge you because you
are the best and the brightest,

00:17:54.846 --> 00:17:57.436
as you've heard and you will
hear no doubt many more times

00:17:57.436 --> 00:17:59.486
over the course of this
day and the next few days.

00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:03.396
So graduates of 2016 stand up.

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:17.976
[ Applause ]

00:18:18.476 --> 00:18:20.516
And I would ask that
you repeat after me.

00:18:21.876 --> 00:18:25.626
We the 2016 graduating
class of Carnegie Mellon.

00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:37.036
&gt;&gt; We the 2016 graduating
class of Carnegie Mellon.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.306
&gt;&gt; Will do the unimagined.

00:18:38.306 --> 00:18:41.276
&gt;&gt; Will do the unimagined.

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:45.286
&gt;&gt; We will discover
the undiscoverable.

00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:47.776
&gt;&gt; We will discover
the undiscoverable.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:48.896
&gt;&gt; We will change the world.

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.596
&gt;&gt; We will change the world.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:51.406
&gt;&gt; Responsibly.

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:51.946
&gt;&gt; Responsibly.

00:18:51.946 --> 00:18:54.456
&gt;&gt; Let's try that one more time.

00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:56.356
We will change the
world responsibly.

00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:58.916
&gt;&gt; We will change the
world responsibly.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:00.086
&gt;&gt; And then one more time.

00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:01.016
We will change the
world responsibly.

&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:12.746
You may sit down.

00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:16.326
If you remain faithful
to this moment

00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:19.746
in time you will have done
far more than earn a degree.

00:19:20.506 --> 00:19:23.446
You will have used your
skills, talents and intellect

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:24.926
for the benefit of all.

00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:29.166
I am confident that you
understand the significance

and I am grateful to
have had this opportunity

00:19:32.446 --> 00:19:34.066
to see you off on your journey.
