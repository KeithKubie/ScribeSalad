00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:03.497
- [Instructor] Jeremiah makes 25%

00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:05.668
of the three-point shots he attempts.

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:07.562
Far better than my percentage.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:10.046
For warm up, Jeremiah likes to shoot

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:13.829
three-point shots until
he successfully makes one.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.383
Alright, this is the telltale signs

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:17.345
of a geometric random variables.

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:18.947
How many trials do I have to take

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:21.430
until I get a success?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.263
Let M be the number of
shots it takes Jeremiah

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.070
to successfully make his
first three-point shot.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.273
Okay, so they're defining
the random variable here,

00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:33.037
the number of shots it takes,

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:34.638
the number of trials it takes

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.716
until we get a successful
three-point shot.

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:42.424
Assume that the results of
each shot are independent.

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:44.472
Alright, the probability
that he makes a given shot

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.424
is not dependent on
whether he made or missed

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.036
the previous shots.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.724
Find the probability that
Jeremiah's first successful shot

00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:55.344
occurs on his third attempt.

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:57.307
So, like always, pause this video

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.979
and see if you can have a go at it.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.719
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.759
So, we wanna find the probability.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.584
So, M is the number of shots it takes

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:09.568
until Jeremiah makes
his first successful one

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.169
and so, what they're really asking us,

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:14.145
find the probability
that M is equal to three,

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.899
that his first successful shot

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.200
occurs on his third attempt.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
So, M is equal to three.

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.425
So, that the number of
shots it takes Jeremiah

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:29.244
to make his first
successful shot is three.

00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:31.396
So, how do we do this?

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:34.949
Well, what's the probability
of that happening?

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:39.020
Well, that means he has to
miss his first two shots

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.003
and then make his third shot.

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:46.262
So, what's the probability of
him missing his first shot?

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:48.480
Well, if he has a 1/4 chance

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.294
of making his shots, he
has a 3/4 probability

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:55.005
of missing his shots,

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.931
so this will be 3/4,

00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:59.034
so he misses the first shot,

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.891
times, he has to miss the second shot

00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.141
and then he has to make his third shot,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.994
so there you have it.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.655
That's the probability.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:11.988
Miss, miss, make

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:15.166
and so, what is this going to be?

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.916
This is equal to nine over 64ths.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.472
So, there you have.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:23.266
If you wanted to have this as a decimal,

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.358
we could get a calculator out real fast,

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:27.775
so this is nine divided by 64

00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:32.687
is equal to roughly 0.14.

00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:35.297
Approximately 0.14

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:37.487
or another way to think about it

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:42.406
is a roughly 14% chance or 14% probability

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:44.906
that his first successful shot

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:48.656
occurs in his third attempt.
