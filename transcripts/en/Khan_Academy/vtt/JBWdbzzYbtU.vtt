00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.540
Let's review a little bit of
what we've learned about

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.510
reserve banking and then we'll
extend this to the notion of

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.720
an elastic money supplier, a
money supplier that can grow

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.510
or contract as people need
money-- or hopefully grows and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.580
contracts as people
need money.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.930
So let me create a a couple of
normal commercial banks.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.900
Maybe I'll call these
national banks.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.400
They have a national charter.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.610
So let's see.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.775
I have some equity and part of
that equity-- most of it is

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.170
some gold that I initially
capitalized the bank with.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.730
And then some of it
is a building.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.610
Trying to draw this as neat as
possible, but I think you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.050
understand my situation.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.180
Then I take some gold deposits
from whoever-- the farmers

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.680
after the crop has
been harvested.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470
And then offsetting that,
I have all of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.490
the farmers' deposits.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.070
I'll do that in a blue color.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.870
So that's one farmer's
deposit.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.490
That's another-- maybe there's
only two farmers.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.840
And then we learned in
fractional reserve banking

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.430
that I can leverage up this
amount of capital I have.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.380
There's a certain ratio
between the amount of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.410
capital-- in this case, gold or
reserves I have-- and the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.040
amount of demand deposits I
can have. So let's say my

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
reserve requirement in this
world is-- just because I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.480
don't want this bank to become
too tall-- let's say it's 50%.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.040
We know in reality reserve
requirements

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.450
are more like 10%.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.700
Let me write that down.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.220
So that means that my ratio
of gold to demand deposit

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.020
accounts cannot be any
less than 50%.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.200
So whatever this amount is, I
can double it in terms of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.340
demand deposit accounts and the
way I do that-- let's say

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.190
this is collectively 100 so
I could have up to 100.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.330
Let's say this right
here, this is 50.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.230
So I can have up to 200 in
demand deposit accounts.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.810
So I can essentially lend out
money and create demand

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270
deposit accounts.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.420
This is all review for
you, hopefully.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:15.530
So I could lend out 150.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.910
Those are my liabilities and
then these are my loans and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.610
my-- so that's one loan I make
out and I just create

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.610
someone's checking account.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.290
That's the loan asset and I
create a demand deposit

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.990
account for them.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.110
That's the liability.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.270
This here could be a big
loan, et cetera.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.335
And then I'm not the only
bank in this universe.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.370
My other bank in the universe.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.930
I just want to show you that
there are multiple banks.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.060
Then we said there are a couple
of issues with this.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.910
You have a 50% reserve
requirement, which is very

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.760
high, but what if there is a
situation where for whatever

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.510
reason your reserves
temporarily

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.310
drop below that 50%?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.560
How do you get that
extra gold?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.460
You don't want to go to people
and say, can I have a little

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.920
bit more gold?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.300
Then they're going to get scared
and all pull out of

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.190
your system, but if you're a
little bit below 50%, but if

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.860
the other bank is a little
bit above 50%, it'd be a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.730
convenient way if you could
borrow from that other bank--

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.430
or even better, if there was a
central depository where all

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.550
of these gold reserves were,
then you could just borrow

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.770
directly from that central
depository if there were no

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.860
other bank to borrow from.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.220
So you could kind of view it as
a lender of last resort and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.050
we'll go into more of the
technicalities of that one, in

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.940
particular talk about
our current system.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.160
With that said, we created a
reserve bank where we put

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.940
these deposits.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.340
Let's see.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.480
There's 200 of deposits
in this world.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.290
Let see me if I can just
copy and paste that.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.500
So that's one of the reserves
and then they're the same, so

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.170
then that's the other reserve.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.530
It doesn't look that neat.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.240
All the banks got together
and created this.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.060
It's a private bank, but we'll
go into more details of of how

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.900
the actual Federal
Reserve works.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.640
So those are the actual
gold reserves.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.870
Those are the assets
of that bank.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.760
Actually, I should move
it over some.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.950
OK.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:29.710
And then the liabilities for
this central reserve bank,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.760
these are the demand deposit
accounts for these nationally

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.230
chartered banks.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.360
So he took all of his gold,
put it here, and so now he

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.480
has-- to simplify it, he has a
demand deposit account, but

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.450
I'll assume that he just got
reserve notes to show that he

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.730
had access to this gold.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:03.560
So let's say that this is
100 notes outstanding.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.680
This part corresponding to 100
gold pieces-- and this is

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.990
another 100-- although notes
outstanding, it's fungible,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.880
you could mix them up because
you don't know where they came

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.400
from or whatever.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.180
That's what's different
about those relative

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.960
to a checking account.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.830
And so essentially this guy
gives his gold here and in

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.540
exchange he gets these Federal
Reserve notes, which are like

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.610
green pieces of paper.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.810
And now these are actually
his reserves.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.780
His reserves are
no longer gold.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.230
His reserves are how much
of these Federal

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.040
Reserve notes he has?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.060
And we learned in the last video
that only the Federal

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.230
Reserve-- or the reserve bank--
I haven't called it the

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.920
Federal Reserve yet, but I think
you see where this is

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.390
going-- only they can
issue these notes.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.500
And these notes are these
rectangular green pieces of

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.850
paper with faces of presidents
on them, et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.850
And let's say in the government
we live in, they

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.720
kind of sanction-- even though
this is officially a private

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.810
bank, this reserve bank, it's
set up in such a way that even

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.800
though all of the original banks
might have originally

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.210
capitalized it with some equity,
they really don't get

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.760
any of the profits of this
bank-- and I'll go into detail

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.500
on how the actual Federal
Reserve works.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.890
But let's just say any surplus
profits of this bank actually

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.500
just go back to the Federal
government.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.840
So the Federal government
doesn't-- these banks don't

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.360
make any money off of this--
and actually let's say that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.740
the board of directors of this
bank is actually appointed by

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.300
the government, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.630
So it's key to the
financial system.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.110
So the government says, these
notes, sure, it's issued by

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.650
this reserve bank, but we want
people to have a lot of faith

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.250
in this currency because this is
the currency that we use in

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.490
our world, in our nation, so
in order for people to have

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.380
unlimited faith in this
currency, we are going to make

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.650
it an obligation of the
government-- so it's

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.940
issued by the bank.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.920
Let me write that down.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.480
This used to confuse
me to no end.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:14.820
Issued by the reserve bank, but
it's an obligation of the

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.950
government.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.100
Now, what does that mean?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.740
Well, that means that if for
whatever reason-- even if this

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.760
reserve bank were to somehow not
have the gold to back it

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.100
up, it would go bankrupt, but
even in that situation, the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.740
government would still be
obligated to give you the gold

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.680
equivalent of these notes,
whatever we decide it is.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.170
Maybe it's 35 of these dollars
per ounce of gold or whatever.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.250
But that's what that means.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.900
So that gives a lot of people
confidence that these things

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.320
are, you can almost say,
as good as gold.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.300
Why does it matter that the
government-- how can you trust

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.710
the government?

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.870
Well, the government can just
tax people, whether they're

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.510
going to tax them in terms of
dollars, whether they can tax

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.110
them in terms of gold, whether
they can tax them in terms of

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.180
goods and services.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.050
So as long as you think that
that economy-- whatever the

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.230
economy is that this government
is governing over--

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.410
as long as you think that that
economy can somehow support

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.630
the gold to back this up, you
should say, this is as good as

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.380
gold-- or at least support
the goods and services.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.920
Well, that said, let's introduce
the notion of an

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.380
elastic currency.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.570
Actually before I do that, let's
go back to one thing

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.990
this government does.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.510
So we said it's an obligation
of the government, right?

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.120
Which means if all else fails,
the government is going to

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.549
give you the value behind
these notes.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.320
I'll introduce you to another
concept, which is actually

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.789
very similar to these notes--
and that is a government debt

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.670
or government borrowing.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.120
Let me draw that down here.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.580
I think I'm going to run out of
time, but I'll continue it

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.680
in the next video.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.640
So I'm the government, right?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.550
I mean, you could almost view
the government's asset as its

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.670
ability to tax people, but if
I'm the government and I issue

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:06.020
these government IOUs-- and
we'll call them treasury bonds

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:14.020
and bills-- let's call them
treasuries, generally.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.520
Treasury bills are short term
treasuries where the

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.550
government borrows for a
shorter amount of time.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.510
Bonds are longer term.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.890
I think I've gone over that in
the yield curve video, but

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.860
I'll do that in more detail.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.520
But they're just IOUs
from the government.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.790
Now, these are going to be
considered as risk free.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.610
Why are they considered
risk free?

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.700
Because they are denominated in
the same currency that the

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.590
government, that the economy
that this government governs

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.990
over, operates in.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.750
So if this government-- and I
think you can understand that

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.630
this is essentially the U.S.
government-- if it borrows

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.480
money from you-- so it
gives you an IOU.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.385
So this is me.

00:09:49.385 --> 00:09:53.330
Let's say this is me, this
is the government.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:10:05.590
If it gives me this IOU and I
give it $100, why do I know

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.880
that this IOU is risk free?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.560
Well, because unless he starts--
the government-- I'm

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.520
making him masculine-- but
unless they start issuing an

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.250
unusual number of IOUs and just
have so much interest

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.520
that they can't sustain, you
know that they can always tax

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.860
more people to get you
back your $100.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.070
So you view this thing right
here as risk free.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.310
So whenever the government goes
out there and says, hey

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.350
everyone, we have a new war we
want to fight or some new type

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.250
of scheme, new bureaucracy we
would like to create, we are

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.460
going to borrow money from you--
someone is going to give

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.150
them their currency, their
Federal Reserve notes-- and in

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.790
exchange, the government's
going to give them

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.960
these risk free IOUs.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.100
And then the government can use
these reserve notes to go

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.970
buy goods and services or
pay soldiers or pay the

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.150
bureaucrats.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.560
Now we're going to use that
idea in the next video to

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.800
learn how this Federal Reserve
bank or this reserve bank can

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.610
buy and sell these government
securities in order to change

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.840
the money supply.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.960
See you in the next video.
