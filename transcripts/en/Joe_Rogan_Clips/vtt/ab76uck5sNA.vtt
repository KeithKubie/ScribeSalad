1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
Oh,
you,
where do you like going to Russia so much?
I do.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.640
I do enjoy it up there.
Yeah,
I do.
I use a lot of time.
Let me say,

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.320
um,
well I like 'em.
I like traveling,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.660
so this is a cool thing.
I've got to travel so much.

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.130
I've got to see a lot of really cool places and uh,
uh,

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.890
Russia's one of them.
I like all the different places I've been there.

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.500
Saint Peters of course,
cause Russian.
One thing is it's like America,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.010
lots of different places.
Wherever you are.
Like,
you know,

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.150
this America to some people could seem like a different country,

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.610
different states that Jewish summer.
Yeah.
So it's like that.
So,
um,
I got to,

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.730
uh,
I go to Moscow.
Moscow's one thing,
you know,
you get to,

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.750
there's a lot of history,
a lot of Nice things to see.
Saint Petersburg,

13
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:49.620
same thing.
Um,
do you feel safe when you're over there?
Well,

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
I take everything at face value so that,
that's the way I go through life.

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.620
Because if I was to try to always read some undercurrents or read what,
uh,

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.890
people tell me I'm supposed to experience,
I'm,
I'm not,

17
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.600
I'm never gonna do anything like,
um,
a long time ago,
my troubles,
my,
um,

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.463
my,

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
I was going to go do one of butter being shown down in Alabama and my parents

20
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.160
were like,
man,
you're going to Alabama,
man,
be safe down there.

21
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.020
Don't be doing all that stuff you do.
You know,

22
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.440
it's going to be different because of,
you know,
American,
our history with racism.

23
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.130
And,
uh,
I went down there and I was,
you know,
this is [inaudible],
it's a,

24
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.810
you might have to tell the story because this is the story.
So I went down there,

25
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.810
I was,
I was at the show.
And then some,
uh,

26
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.260
cops come up and they look like the cops from,
you know,

27
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.690
in the movies from the south that you're supposed to scare you.

28
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.940
And I took a picture with them and they're like,

29
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.220
and somebody else came to take a picture and they're like,
oh,

30
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.130
look what we started going,
Oh man,
I'm going to do this on this one.

31
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.850
I'm here to do.
I mean,
hanging out with people.

32
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.170
I remember referee fights and you know,
talk to people they want to talk.

33
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.960
So I took a lot of pictures.
They were impressed.
They're saying that,
you know,

34
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.450
they've seen other people,
you know,
you know,

35
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.580
tell people know about pictures and the guy all sided,
they're like,
hey,
um,

36
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.170
we want you to come out and pull people over with this.
I'm like,
no,

37
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.830
no,
I don't want to do,
I have no interest in doing that.
You know,
I grew up in La,

38
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.290
you know what I mean?
Like they're like,
and they're getting pumped.
They're like,

39
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:13.620
imagine like you're getting pulled over by herb dean pitch.
Yeah,
yeah.

40
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:18.180
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I don't want to do it.
And uh,
then one goes out,
he goes,
well,

41
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.700
well some do some,
I mean,
want to make this,
do some tase me or something hurting.

42
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.700
So like he grabs this,
his taser gun and sticks the Taser in my hand.
She's,

43
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.740
and I'm sitting there and I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I started tasing him,
right.

44
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.560
I'm changing,
this isn't this guy.
And he's like,

45
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.490
I'm like a,
I'm,
I'm,
so then,
um,
I,
after the tasing,

46
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.520
uh,
his buddy,
one of the,
um,
agents,

47
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.010
one of the guys who's working with me comes up and tells him that he has some

48
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.890
business to talk about with me.
I go,
wait,
what'd you want to talk about?
It goes,

49
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:50.041
man,

50
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.560
I could see her so uncomfortable with what was going on that I just go with the,

51
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.650
I was like,
thanks.
So I get back to him,

52
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.670
I give back to my hotel room and I,
I stinking,
I was like,
man,

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930
you know,
I'm worried about people prejudging and being intolerant.

54
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.510
I'm prejudging of these guys because of uh,

55
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.360
some history and these guys are really cool.

56
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.350
If I ever get the opportunity to seize guys,
I'm going to be,
you know,
man.
And I,

57
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.410
and I did,
they came like right there and the phone rings,
I swear.

58
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.740
And they took me to an after party and they're like,
yeah,
they took it like,

59
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.100
it was like the place looks like roadhouse and you know what I mean?

60
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.270
Like everything you see like in a movie,
like,
like,
you know some,
you know it,

61
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.190
your wife's not going to be happy about that and,

62
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.180
and I'm going to catch you next week.
One of those types of things,
right?
Yeah.

63
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.110
Drove me to the airport with the lights on skirts.
Yeah.
I think,

64
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:40.670
I think I still have the picture of me tasing him.
I could show it to you.

65
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.520
It was like,
it was a pretty cool experience.
So after that I was like,
man,
uh,

66
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.670
whatever.
I think I know about things.
I really don't.

67
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.520
And so,
uh,
so I took things at face value.
Yeah.

68
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.200
I've had good times now Obama,
I've had good times in the south.

69
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.020
I think the world's changing too.
I really do.

70
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.250
I think there's those parts of it,
especially this country,

71
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.890
we almost everywhere you can find.
Cool.
So,
yeah.
So I mean if,
uh,

72
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.660
you know,
oh my God,
that is hilarious.
So,

73
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.210
so that should put this on your Instagram.
Can you?
Yeah.
Can they wouldn't mind.

74
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:20.410
I've talked to those guys about it.

75
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.660
Don't you think he's going to get in trouble though?
No,
he's not gonna.

76
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.400
He said he's fine.
He said it'll be all right.

77
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.500
I thought we'd would get in trouble,
so I didn't want to know.
Yeah.

78
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.990
That's why I haven't put it on.
That's why I never did it,

79
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.730
but I've actually talked to him.
So anyway,
this,

80
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.680
um,
that,
yeah,
that's a big lesson to me.
Like,

81
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.200
Hey,
don't,
don't,
don't think you know what's going on,
you know,

82
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:43.850
take things at face value.
Try to beat,
you know,
yeah.
