00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.760
Okay so here are the two steps that we need to do on the top right hand corner.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.440
Let's add them to our cord.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.430
Now we're looking at, record sounds view controller and what I'm going to do,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.370
is add AV audio recorder delegate to the class declaration.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.120
There, step one is done.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.790
For step two, I will scroll down to the record audio function.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.490
Where we are initializing audio recorder.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.350
And in here, I will say AudioRecorder.Delegate is equal to self.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.740
So this means that audio recorders new delegate is self or

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.040
our class record sounds, view controller.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.280
Now that I've finished both of these steps, I can start typing,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.910
audio recorder did finish recording and as soon as I type that.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.850
X code auto completes it for me.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.580
Now this method will be invoked, when the audio has finished recording.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.760
I will start writing code here soon.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.200
But before we continue,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.220
let me connect some of the new ideas we've seen recently.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.710
One of the classes we've been using is called AVAudioRecorder.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.490
Now, this class was written by Apple.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.400
Among other things, it has a variable defined in it called delegate.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.860
Now, the type of this variable, is not a string, not an integer.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.320
But it's something called AVAudioRecorderDelegate.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.480
What this is, is a simple list of methods.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.090
One of which is called, audioRecroderDidFinishRecording.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.850
So, in our class, which is RecodSoundsViewController.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.020
When we see a line of code like this, what we are really saying,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.780
is that we are becoming audioRecorder.delegate and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.080
at that point, we can implement all of these methods.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.730
By the way, don't take my word for any of this, you can go back to Xcode.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.820
And use the Cmd key on your keyboard, to look through AVAudioRecorder and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.650
confirm this relationship.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.870
Once you've done that, I encourage you to come back to this quiz and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.100
summarize everything you've learned about delegates in this box.
