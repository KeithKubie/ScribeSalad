00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.580
Comedian Jerry Lewis has been entertaining
audiences and movie-goers around the world

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
since he first took to the stage at the age
of five in 1931, singing “Brother, Can You

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.770
Spare a Dime?” in New York City.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.960
For a decade during the 1940s and 1950s, he
teamed up with Dean Martin forming one of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.849
the greatest comedy duos in history.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.040
Later, he starred in hit films like The Nutty
Professor and became an award-winning director.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.510
However, not everything Lewis touched turned
out well.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.899
In fact, at least one major project turned
out so badly that, despite the fact that Lewis

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.620
directed and funded the film in question,
The Day the Clown Cried, he has to date made

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.820
sure almost no one has ever seen it.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.409
Based upon a script by Joan O’Brien and
Charles Denton, The Day the Clown Cried takes

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.850
place during the early years of the Holocaust.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.031
Lewis stars as a German Clown, Helmut Doork,
who drunkenly insults Hitler and ends up in

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.260
a Nazi prison camp as a result.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.179
He boasts to the other prisoners about his
talents as a clown, but the Jewish children

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.200
imprisoned in the camp next door are the only
ones who enjoy his act.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.049
Ultimately he is given the chance to have
his case reviewed and to possibly be released

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.690
if he leads the children onto a train to Auschwitz.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.970
Unfortunately for Doork, he accidentally ends
up stuck on the transport train as well.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.720
Once in Auschwitz, he uses his comedic antics
to lead the reluctant, but trusting children

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.060
into a gas chamber…

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.280
However, once inside, he decides he can’t
bear to leave them and so stays, continuing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.040
to perform for their amusement until the end.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.410
Producer Nathan Wachsberger approached Jerry
Lewis with the script in 1971, and Lewis expressed

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.891
concern about whether a clown experiencing
the horrors of the Holocaust was the right

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:41.891
role for him.

00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.530
He was, after all, a comedian.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
In his biography, he states he suggested to
Wachsberger: “Why don’t you try getting

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Sir Laurence Olivier?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.780
I mean, he doesn’t find it too difficult
to choke to death playing Hamlet.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.160
My bag is comedy, Mr. Wachsberger, and you’re
asking me if I’m prepared to deliver kids

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.640
to the gas chamber.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640
Ho-ho.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.180
Some laugh—how do I pull it off?”

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.240
But Lewis changed his mind after reading the
script in full, which had been bouncing around

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.270
Hollywood for about ten years before Lewis
saw it.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.531
Before this, Dick Van Dyke and Milton Berle
were approached to star in the movie, but

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:16.090
funding only appeared when Lewis became attached
to the project as actor and director.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.420
Problems arose almost immediately before filming
began.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.170
The funding promised by Wachsberger was not
nearly enough to cover the cost of production.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.480
Lewis decided that his only way to keep filming
was to pay for much of the movie out of his

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.530
own pocket.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.980
On top of all that, when The Day the Clown
Cried appeared in trade magazines during early

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.500
production, it caught the attention of the
script’s original scriptwriters, Joan O’Brien

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.550
and Charles Denton.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.420
The pair originally sold Wachsberger the option
to make the movie for an initial fee of $5,000

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.800
(about $30,000 today), but they claimed the
option expired as he failed to send them an

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.360
additional $50,000 promised if the film went
into production.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.850
O’Brien went on to state that Lewis was
fully aware of the legal situation and that

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.580
the option had expired.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.900
Whether true or not, Lewis moved forward with
the movie.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.080
the-day-the-clown-criedThe filming did not
go well and the stress involved, Lewis’

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.340
addiction to Percodan, and the fact that he
went on an extreme Castaway-esk Tom Hanks

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.960
diet to lose 35 pounds in less than two months
to accurately depict the weight loss experienced

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.170
at the camps all took its toll.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.920
Despite his best efforts, other actors on
set also claimed Lewis was never able to move

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.040
the character beyond his own “Jerry Lewis”
persona.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.130
This was a major problem.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.380
As you might imagine, Helmut Doork performing
slapstick comedy didn’t exactly work in

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.410
a film depicting the atrocities of the Holocaust.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.750
That said, Lewis did state he thought the
heartwrenching ending went well,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.950
I was terrified of directing the last scene.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.270
I had been 113 days on the picture, with only
three hours of sleep a night…

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.459
I was exhausted, beaten.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.620
When I thought of doing that scene, I was
paralyzed…

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.750
I stood there in my clown’s costume, with
the cameras ready.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.550
Suddenly the children were all around me,
unasked, undirected, and they clung to my

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.460
arms and legs, they looked up at me so trustingly.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.239
I felt love pouring out of me.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.150
I thought, “This is what my whole life has
been leading to.”

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.560
I thought what the clown thought.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.410
I forgot about trying to direct.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.540
I had the cameras turn and I began to walk,
with the children clinging to me, singing,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.709
into the gas ovens.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.580
And the door closed behind us.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.650
A complicated legal battle over the rights
to the script and issues with the funding

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.459
prevented the movie from being released initially.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.849
However, Jerry Lewis ultimately reached an
agreement with the studio that allowed him

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.100
to keep possession of the film’s rough cut
while negatives remained with the studio.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.120
Lewis has claimed in interviews that only
he, his father, and his manager have seen

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.100
the entire film, but comedian and voice actor
for The Simpsons, Harry Shearer, claims to

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.760
have attended a secret screening after someone
“involved with the Telethon… liberated

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.320
[the tape] for a weekend”.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.450
Shearer described The Day the Clown Cried
in a 1992 interview with Spy magazine,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.650
With most of these kinds of things, you find
that the anticipation, or the concept, is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.220
better than the thing itself.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.440
But seeing this film was really awe-inspiring,
in that you are rarely in the presence of

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.900
a perfect object.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.920
This was a perfect object.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.581
This movie is so drastically wrong, its pathos
and its comedy are so wildly misplaced, that

00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:08.570
you could not, in your fantasy of what it
might be like, improve on what it really is.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.620
“Oh My God!”—that’s all you can say.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.030
As for Jerry Lewis’s opinion of the movie,
at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, he said:

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.490
“No one will ever see it because I’m embarrassed…

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.560
I was ashamed of the work, and I was grateful
that I had the power to contain it all, and

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.370
never let anyone see it.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.320
It was bad, bad, bad…”

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.290
However, in an interview with Entertainment
Weekly that same year, when asked if he was

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.540
proud of the film, Lewis responded, “I am.”

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.680
Whatever the truth of his feelings, the now
90 year old Lewis recently donated The Day

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.979
the Clown Cried to the Library of Congress
along with other parts of his film-making

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:41.979
archive.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.930
This particular movie came with the stipulation
that it may be shown at the Library’s theater,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:06:02.289
but screenings could only begin in June of
2024.
