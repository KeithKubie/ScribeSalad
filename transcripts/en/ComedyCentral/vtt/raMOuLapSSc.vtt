00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.503 line:0%
- Let's start in the NFL.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:07.907 line:0%
Cam Newton, making the
rounds, doing some media,

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.442
not playing football these days.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.812
He was on the Late Late Show
with James corden this week.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.547
- Never seen an episode.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:17.784
(laughs)

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:18.852
- Was that necessary?

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.487
I mean, you're not a fan, or...

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.955
- I'm not not a fan.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
Listen, Carpool Karaoke's
not gonna pull me in.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.060
And, is the accent funny?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.328
I don't think so.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.363
Clearly faking it.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.965 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't know much about
him, to be honest.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.601
I don't watch it,
I don't follow it.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.370
I wouldn't say I'm against
him, but would I ever go on

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.671
that show?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.206
Wouldn't waste my time.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.708
- Wow.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.512
Well Cam Newton disagrees,
and he surprised the audience

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:50.483
by telling them that he's
given up sex for March.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:51.818
- Not just sex.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.319
- Not just sex.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.088
And this is the way he said it,
too, which was very strange.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.556
He said, "I hope this
is an adult crowd.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.091
"Looks like it is.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.126
"No climax."

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.661
So there's no climax.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.863
That's the thing, that
was the way he said it.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
So then I interpreted
that, it's not just sex,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
but, you know, no
gratifying yourself.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.238
- Listen, I don't often talk
about my religious beliefs

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
on the air, but
sex makes you weak,

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.410
alright?
(laughs)

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.815
If you touch yourself below
the waste, weakness, okay?

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:26.820
I don't have a name
for my religion, but
I know that if I go

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.824
a week or two, I
can lift up a car.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.425
(laughs)

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.726
I don't often do it,
you know what I mean?

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.228
I don't feel the need.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:39.699
But, I think not having sex
or not releasing your demons,

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:47.507
as my mom would call them, if
you don't release your demons,

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:50.210
then you get more focused.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.444
You know what I mean?

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
You got more energy,
you can do more.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.714
In prison, the guys who get
like, super jacked and all

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start size:88% position:13%
about weights, they
don't touch themselves.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because they want
to lift more weight.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.123
- I'm suddenly having like, an
image of her yelling at like,

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.658 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Anthony, you're not releasing
your demons up there,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:06.759
"are you?"

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Is that an impression
of my mother?

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.265
Because, I mean, I don't know
what voice you think that is,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.733
but it's not a woman's voice.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's certainly not my
mom's, and you've met her,

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.003
and you know she listens.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.607
Yeah, she would yell
that all the time.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.409
I couldn't take a shower
without her just banging

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.946
on the door, like
there was a fire.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.615
And I knew that
something was up.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:33.052
I knew that my body was not my
body, that it belongs to God,

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:38.057
and I shall not desecrate him
by letting my hands wander.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.327
- You Catholics are weird.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.030
- No, this has nothing to do
with Catholicism, this is more

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.964
like a government thing.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.466
I wanna be like Mike Pence.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.837 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Cam Newton like, believes
in this stuff though.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.807 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's a lot of athletes,
you were saying that in prison

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.342
that they believe they--

00:02:56.342 --> 00:03:00.747
This is all weird, sort
of not backed by science,

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.683 align:start size:94% position:6%
conspiracy nonsense.
- It is backed by science,

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.486
I'll tell you this, I once
read an article in a magazine

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.088
about how doctors in the
ER who have to do like,

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:11.257
24-hour shifts, how
they stay awake.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.492 align:start size:84% position:16%
They'd have like,
different little tips,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.794
one of 'em was like, you
pound a cup of coffee,

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.396 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then take a nap
for like five minutes,

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
and when you wake up,
the caffeine's kicked in,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.532
and you're like, ready to go.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.535
The last guy was like, "I
don't know if this works

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.003 align:start size:81% position:19%
"for women, but
it works for men."

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:28.107 align:start size:97% position:3%
He goes, "you touch yourself
until you are just about

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.611 align:start size:97% position:3%
"to climax, and then you stop
and that keeps you awake.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:34.047
"That like, gives you like a
burst of energy, and you can

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.548
"go about your day."

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:39.686
He goes, "but, if you go
too far, if you don't have

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:44.457 align:start size:97% position:3%
"the expert touch that I have,
and you go too far, then,"

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.959
he's like, "you're done."

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.394 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's like, "go home, because
you are not going to save

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.330
"any lives that day."

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.798
So, I'd give it
up to Cam Newton.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.634 align:start size:94% position:6%
I would say this makes
the Panthers the favorites

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:55.969
to win it all this year.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.804
30 days without--

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:00.173
I know for Gregg that's
like, pretty normal.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.374
And I know

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.609 align:start size:97% position:3%
for a fact
(imitates trombone descending)

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.810
that your wife has
never once climaxed.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.515 align:start size:94% position:6%
She is the strongest
person, she's like an ant,

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.718
she can lift a hundred
times her own weight.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.188
And we have Gregg
to thank for that.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:18.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I found it very
interesting that, it was like

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.494
a off-season challenge
that he made for himself,

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.496 align:start size:88% position:13%
that each month, Cam
Newton was gonna give up

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:24.998
different things.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:28.034
So January, it was gambling,
interesting, as an NFL player.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:32.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
February was meat, and then
March was not only sex,

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.040
but Wi-Fi.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, I feel like giving
up Wi-Fi for a month

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.477
is a lot tougher than

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:38.745 align:start size:75% position:25%
anything
- If you're not

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.913
gonna masturbate, what
do you need Wi-Fi for?

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.148
Know what I mean?

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.016
What, are you gonna
check your email?

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.651
No, who cares?

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.120
See, this is why I think
that the NFL's unfair,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.522 align:start size:94% position:6%
in that it really is a
player's league, you know,

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.257
people show up to
watch the players.

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
But let's see Robert
Kraft do this.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.030
Let's see Robert
Kraft go 30 days.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.234
This guy can't even get to the
airport without pulling over

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:05.872 align:start size:94% position:6%
and climaxing, demons
everywhere, Robert Kraft.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.342
That was a good one, that
was more fun than I thought

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.843
we'd have on that.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:15.315
- Papa John's is hoping that
Shaquille O'Neal can help fix

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.752
the PR backlash that
they've had ever since

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:23.256 align:start size:88% position:13%
the actual Papa John
had to leave the company

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:24.957
because he said the N-word.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:29.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
Shaq, among his many
endorsements, has
now decided to join

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
Papa John Board of
Directors, and he's gonna own

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.866
nine Papa John's in Atlanta.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.668
- It's the funniest thing
that they would be like,

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.705 align:start position:0%
"okay, we got this scandal,
where our owner used the N-word

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:40.239
"on a conference call.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.908
"We had to let him go.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.277
"How can we ensure this
never happens again?

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.612
"Who's the biggest
black guy we know?

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Let's get him in here,
and ensure that everything

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.320
"is tip-top from here on out."

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.591
I don't know how bad Papa
John's' business suffered

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:02.061 align:start size:97% position:3%
when Papa dropped an N-bomb
on a conference call,

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.364
but I gotta think there's
some people who'd like,

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.832
switched over.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.333 align:start size:94% position:6%
I gotta think there's some
people in this country

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.534
who've never eaten pizza in
their lives who were like,

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.503
"we gotta support this guy."

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:11.838
And you know what?

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.006 align:start size:97% position:3%
I hope they're not
listenin', 'cause I hate you.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.676
But I do like Shaq.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.078 align:start size:94% position:6%
Shaq is obviously, he
endorses a lot of things,

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.514
but he's very particular.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.116
You know what I mean,
he's not gonna endorse

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.651
just any insurance company,
it's gonna be The General.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.521
- Right, but does this
make you think that like,

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.723
what is The General hiding?

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.259
Like, what are these other
companies that he endorse

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.093 align:start size:69% position:31%
hiding?
- Oh, he's

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:35.128
a confederate general.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.729
I mean, he's hiding quite a bit.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:41.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
Gold Bond medicated powder,
they had their run-ins

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:45.805 align:start size:97% position:3%
with slavery, Arm and
Hammer was basically built,

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.708
Gold Bond, I'm sorry, was
basically built on slavery.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.477
That's what the "bond" in
Gold Bond, comes from that.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:55.014 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I see how, it was just like,
used for torture back then.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.417
- If you see Amistad you'll
know what I'm talking about.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.252
But getting Shaq in
there, I think solves

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.186
all their problems.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.290
And he's on the board,
he's not just endorsing.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.192 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's not an opponent of
Peyton, he's not an opponent

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:09.529
of Peyton Manning, he is on
the board making decisions

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:10.863
about Papa John's pizza.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.099
And you can bet they're
non-racist decisions.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.600
Not like before.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now the most racist
pizza chain is Domino's,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.639
and then Pizza Hut.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.574
But I think that--

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:24.811 align:start size:97% position:3%
and Little Caesars, of
course, is beyond the pale.

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:27.580 align:start position:0%
Little Caesars does not
believe the Holocaust happened.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.382 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that is--
- [Gregg] Pizza, pizza.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.118
- Exactly, that's
all he talks about.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:38.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you look at their ovens,
they're modeled after

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.861
much of the Holocaust.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:44.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
But that is, that's how
we're gonna keep you updated

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.299
on the world of pizza.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.835 align:start position:0%
- Can you just imagine what
those Board of Director meetings

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.036
would be like?

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.238 align:start size:88% position:13%
They're like, "oh, what
do you think, Shaq?

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:56.108
"Is the expansion into
the Southwest racist?"

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:58.411
Like, what's he doing
at these meetings?

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.712
- Yes, that's very racist.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.915
That's my impression
of Shaqille O'Neal.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.417
- That's pretty good.

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.752 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, that's
very racist, Chuck.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.922
(upbeat guitar music)
