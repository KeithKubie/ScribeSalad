00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.020
it's very tricky to to you know but but
 

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.620
it's very tricky to to you know but but
it's still that 50% when they get it

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:01.630
it's still that 50% when they get it

right for me was good enough um and the
story and the pacing everything what was

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:06.610
story and the pacing everything what was
 

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.460
story and the pacing everything what was
so enjoyable to me

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:08.470
so enjoyable to me
 

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.440
so enjoyable to me
but there are still plot holes there are

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.450
but there are still plot holes there are
 

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.180
but there are still plot holes there are
still things that don't make sense and

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.190
still things that don't make sense and
 

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.330
still things that don't make sense and
if that kind of stuff really gets to you

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:15.340
if that kind of stuff really gets to you
 

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.000

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.820
gonna be able to overlook that and fair
enough

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:20.830
enough
 

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.770
enough
you know it's you're supposed to be

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:22.780
you know it's you're supposed to be
 

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.630
you know it's you're supposed to be
suspending your disbelief for this and

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640
suspending your disbelief for this and
 

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.480
suspending your disbelief for this and
they suspend it too much but for me

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.490
they suspend it too much but for me
 

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.570
they suspend it too much but for me
there was just enough to make it

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:29.580

legitimately enjoyable and a lot of fun
 

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.140
legitimately enjoyable and a lot of fun
um even at the points where I'm kind of

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.150
um even at the points where I'm kind of
 

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.610
um even at the points where I'm kind of
rolling my eyes and moaning at some of

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:35.620
rolling my eyes and moaning at some of
 

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.600
rolling my eyes and moaning at some of
the dialogue um like I said I really

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:38.610
the dialogue um like I said I really
 

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.310

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.730
legitimately wanted to know where this
was going and and it was throwing me for

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:44.740
was going and and it was throwing me for
 

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.590
was going and and it was throwing me for
a lot of loops I didn't know it will way

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600
a lot of loops I didn't know it will way
 

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.210
a lot of loops I didn't know it will way
are they going this direction are they I

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.220
are they going this direction are they I
 

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.650
are they going this direction are they I
think it kind of noise shell Milan's

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:49.660
think it kind of noise shell Milan's
 

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.530
think it kind of noise shell Milan's
writing it's like are they gonna go this

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:52.540
writing it's like are they gonna go this
 

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.330
writing it's like are they gonna go this
route because he's gone this stupid

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.340
route because he's gone this stupid
 

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.340
route because he's gone this stupid
route before like he's gone this really

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:56.350
route before like he's gone this really
 

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.050
route before like he's gone this really
really bad route and I don't know

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.060
really bad route and I don't know
 

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.640
really bad route and I don't know
it could still go that way I mean we

00:11:59.640 --> 00:11:59.650
it could still go that way I mean we
 

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.560
it could still go that way I mean we
don't know how far Shama has come or

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:01.570
don't know how far Shama has come or
 

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.650
don't know how far Shama has come or
whatever uh but it goes just the right

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:04.660
whatever uh but it goes just the right
 

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.080
whatever uh but it goes just the right
direction and it misleads you in just

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.090
direction and it misleads you in just
 

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.150
direction and it misleads you in just
the right ways and it gives enough hints

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160
the right ways and it gives enough hints
 

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.440
the right ways and it gives enough hints
in just the right way is that even if

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:10.450
in just the right way is that even if
 

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.230
in just the right way is that even if
you figure it out it's still a lot of

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240
you figure it out it's still a lot of
 

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.480
you figure it out it's still a lot of

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.430
uh what's going on it's fun to see the
interaction even if you know what's

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440
interaction even if you know what's
 

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.240
interaction even if you know what's
going on so um yeah that's about it I

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.250
going on so um yeah that's about it I
 

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.160
going on so um yeah that's about it I
hope somehow that helps clear that out

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.170
