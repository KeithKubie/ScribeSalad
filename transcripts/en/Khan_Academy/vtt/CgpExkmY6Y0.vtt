00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.233
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, hello Paige.

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.066
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.182
- [Voiceover] So, today we're
gonna learn about hyphens.

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:08.631
And what a hyphen is, it's
a little stick, like this,

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:11.502
as opposed to a dash, which
is about twice as long.

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:13.537
And people confuse them a lot,

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:16.271
but they have very different functions.

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.145
So what a hyphen is used to do

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:22.242
is it's used to join two words into one.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.275
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.524
- [Voiceover] So, for example,
we have the word yellow.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.995
That's a word with meaning.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.082
We have the word green.

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:29.282
That's a word with meaning.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.115
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:32.484
- [Voiceover] And we may
have a word that does

00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:34.770
fit right in between those two

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.216
or two at once, like
chartreuse or whatever.

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:39.049
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.073
- [Voiceover] You know,
but not everybody wants to

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.735
use the word chartreuse.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:42.756
- [Voiceover] No, it's kinda crazy.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.918
- [Voiceover] Kind of a wacky word.

00:00:44.918 --> 00:00:46.018
So, instead of doing that,

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:48.010
you might just wanna say yellow-green,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.057
and connect yellow and
green with a hyphen.

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:55.509
So yeah, so a hyphen is
joining these two things.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:58.857
But let's say we had a sentence like,

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.620
"Her hair was yellow --
green were her eyes."

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.364
You know, and so we're still separating

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:06.487
the words yellow and green with a stick,

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:08.410
but a dash is longer,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.785
and instead of uniting yellow-green,

00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.793
it's separating them the way

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:16.377
that you know, a semicolon might.

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:17.885
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's not one thing,

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.170
it's she has yellow hair and green eyes.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.156
- [Voiceover] If she
had yellow-green hair,

00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:23.289
that would be a different story.

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.122
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:25.204
- [Voiceover] So what's neat about hyphens

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:26.844
and what's kinda confusing about hyphens

00:01:26.844 --> 00:01:28.532
is that whether or not we use a hyphen

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:32.032
indicates how common a compound phrase is.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.036
So, Brian Gardner in Gardner's
Modern American Usage,

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.747
and in the Chicago Manual of Style

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:40.984
draws this distinction
with compound words.

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:44.768
And I should first say what
a compound word is, right?

00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:47.101
A compound word is two words

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.292
smacked together somehow, right?

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.739
So, if we take the...

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.397
so once upon a time, at the
dawn of the Internet page,

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:58.247
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:58.247 --> 00:02:01.002
- [Voiceover] when
dinosaurs walked the Earth,

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.619
and I was just a wee little baby,

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.494
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:07.661
- [Voiceover] you would refer
to getting on line, right.

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:11.637
And then, as it became
more and more prominent,

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:12.495
and more and more popular,

00:02:12.495 --> 00:02:15.983
this is what's called an open compound,

00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:19.733
then it became on-line,
separated with a hyphen.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.744
This is what's called
a hyphenated compound.

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:23.994
- [Voiceover] Makes sense.

00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:25.548
- [Voiceover] And now,
when we think about it,

00:02:25.548 --> 00:02:27.471
it's just an adjective, and it's online,

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:29.493
and this is a closed compound.

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:30.326
- [Voiceover] Right, okay.

00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:34.017
It became closed, cause
everyone knows what that means.

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:37.089
- [Voiceover] Right, so you
would use hyphenated compounds

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.123
when you're kind of in
this intermediary stage

00:02:39.123 --> 00:02:40.456
of acceptedness.

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:43.748
- [Voiceover] So like, maybe
one day, in the future,

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:46.637
yellow-green will be a super common color.

00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:48.984
Right, it's everyone's favorite color,

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.084
so it'll just be smushed
together with no hyphen.

00:02:52.084 --> 00:02:53.098
- [Voiceover] Today is not that day.

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:54.556
- [Voiceover] Today is not that day,

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.061
so there's a hyphen there.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:57.973
- [Voiceover] Right, I
think it's also important

00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:00.348
to hyphenate for clarity.

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:01.624
Let me explain what I mean by that.

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:02.774
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:04.239
- [Voiceover] So, first of
all, when I say hyphenate,

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.983
that's just a word that means
to put a hyphen in something.

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:07.816
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.257
- [voiceover] To hyphenify.

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:10.981
So if a compound word could be

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:13.464
misconstrued or misunderstood,

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.888
you just throw in a hyphen or

00:03:14.888 --> 00:03:16.238
check a dictionary or a style guide.

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.034
So, okay, so, Paige.

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:18.867
- [Voiceover] Yes.

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:20.647
- [Voiceover] I would like
to raise some chickens.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:21.480
- [Voiceover] Good idea.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.327
- [Voiceover] So, in order
to raise some chickens,

00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:24.647
I need a chicken coop, right.

00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:26.652
- [Voiceover] That is, yeah, true.

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:29.125
- [Voiceover] And a coop, right, C-O-O-P,

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.088
is a place where chickens live.

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:32.129
It's like a little enclosure.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.962
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.368
- [Voiceover] But let's
say I wanna buy this coop

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:37.499
from a community-run business, right,

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:42.329
what's called a cooperative
business, or a co-op.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.563
Well, now sometimes it appears like that.

00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:48.768
Like that, like C-O-O-P, but
if I said something like,

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:51.562
"I wanna by my coop from
the co-op," like that,

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:53.033
it'll end up looking like this.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.031
- [Voiceover] I wanna buy
my coop from the coop.

00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:56.031
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.215
- [Voiceover] Or my
co-op from the co-op, or

00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:59.722
co-op from the coop, or something.

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:01.894
- [Voiceover] So, in order to be clear,

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:04.038
it really helps to

00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:06.404
put in that little hyphen.

00:04:06.404 --> 00:04:07.607
And that's the difference, right.

00:04:07.607 --> 00:04:08.775
So you're using this to say,

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:13.494
oh, you know, this is actually
short for cooperative,

00:04:13.494 --> 00:04:14.631
you know, cause it's operated

00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.750
by a bunch of people working together,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.750
as opposed to this word,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.749
which is just C-O-O-P.

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:20.699
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:21.532
- [voiceover] So you wanna hyphenate

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:23.786
for clarity when you can.

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:24.921
- [Voiceover] Makes sense.

00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:27.105
- [Voiceover] So let's bring
all this together, right.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:30.978
So I made a yellow-green
coop with the co-op.

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:31.811
- [Voiceover] Okay,
you all worked together

00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.270
to make a yellow-green coop.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.286
That's pretty cool.

00:04:34.286 --> 00:04:36.504
- [Voiceover] So we're connecting

00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:38.465
yellow and green with a hyphen.

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:41.025
We're connecting co-op with a hyphen

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:43.138
to differentiate it from this word coop.

00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:47.163
And that's basically
what you use hyphens for.

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:49.000
You can learn anything, David out.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.153
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
