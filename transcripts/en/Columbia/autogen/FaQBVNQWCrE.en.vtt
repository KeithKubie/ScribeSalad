pocket and then machines begin to talk
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.330
pocket and then machines begin to talk
to each other as well right so this is

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
to each other as well right so this is
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.190
to each other as well right so this is
just an example of a modem that connects

environment becomes empowered by some

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
environment becomes empowered by some
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.690
environment becomes empowered by some
digital capacity and everything almost

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
digital capacity and everything almost
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.360
digital capacity and everything almost
starts to talk back to us so there's a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
starts to talk back to us so there's a
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.100
starts to talk back to us so there's a
lot we can see about what's going on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
lot we can see about what's going on
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.660
lot we can see about what's going on
around us in real time because of this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
around us in real time because of this
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910
around us in real time because of this
new type of connectivity or digital

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
new type of connectivity or digital
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.670
new type of connectivity or digital
empowerment or whatever everyday objects

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
empowerment or whatever everyday objects
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800
empowerment or whatever everyday objects
I'll give you some examples a little bit

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
I'll give you some examples a little bit
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.240
I'll give you some examples a little bit
now we've all seen what happened with

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
now we've all seen what happened with
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.250
now we've all seen what happened with
the mobile market recently but this is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
the mobile market recently but this is
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
the mobile market recently but this is
something slightly different in this is

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270
something slightly different in this is
 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.470
something slightly different in this is
a prediction by ericsson others had

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
a prediction by ericsson others had
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.900
a prediction by ericsson others had
similar numbers they they are saying

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910
similar numbers they they are saying
 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.270
similar numbers they they are saying
that by 2020 we're going to see 50

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
that by 2020 we're going to see 50
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.820
that by 2020 we're going to see 50
billion devices online that's extreme

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
billion devices online that's extreme
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.650
billion devices online that's extreme
right because the Internet today is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
right because the Internet today is
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.870
right because the Internet today is
empowered by what 1 billion servers or

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
empowered by what 1 billion servers or
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.600
empowered by what 1 billion servers or
so we are what 7 billion people on the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610
so we are what 7 billion people on the
 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.620
so we are what 7 billion people on the
planet this is an order of magnitude

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
planet this is an order of magnitude
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.830
planet this is an order of magnitude
more it really means that our

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
more it really means that our
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170
more it really means that our
environment is going to be empowered by

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
environment is going to be empowered by
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970
environment is going to be empowered by
an unprecedented number of digital

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
an unprecedented number of digital
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.400
an unprecedented number of digital
channels and in this case for example it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410
channels and in this case for example it
 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.400
channels and in this case for example it
probably means that we're going to need

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410
probably means that we're going to need
 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.820
probably means that we're going to need
new ways both of analyzing data but more

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830
new ways both of analyzing data but more
 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.400
new ways both of analyzing data but more
importantly of bringing this data back

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
importantly of bringing this data back
 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.810
importantly of bringing this data back
to us so we can make decisions and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
to us so we can make decisions and
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.790
to us so we can make decisions and
actually make it actionable because if

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800
actually make it actionable because if
 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.680
actually make it actionable because if
there are so many sources of data and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
there are so many sources of data and
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.620
there are so many sources of data and
and and the volume is going to be as big

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630
and and the volume is going to be as big
 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.810

now how do you make the city change how

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560
now how do you make the city change how
 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.200
now how do you make the city change how
would you actually take those

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210
would you actually take those
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.480
would you actually take those

that's where I think it really comes

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350
that's where I think it really comes
 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.630
that's where I think it really comes
really interesting so if we think about

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640
really interesting so if we think about
 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.070
really interesting so if we think about
that feedback loop of sensing and

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080
that feedback loop of sensing and
 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.070
that feedback loop of sensing and
actuated it's always interesting to

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080
actuated it's always interesting to
 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.900

think what happens when you put that the
 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.190
think what happens when you put that the
person in the middle of that feedback

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200
person in the middle of that feedback
 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.170
person in the middle of that feedback
loop okay so you have some sensor in

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180
loop okay so you have some sensor in
 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.190
loop okay so you have some sensor in
your environment that tells you

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
your environment that tells you
 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.080
your environment that tells you
something about air quality you mash it

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090
something about air quality you mash it
 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.540
something about air quality you mash it
up with some map okay it's one thing to

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
up with some map okay it's one thing to
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.860
up with some map okay it's one thing to
give it back to the infrastructure so

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870
give it back to the infrastructure so
 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.350
give it back to the infrastructure so
that it's managed more efficiently from

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360
that it's managed more efficiently from
 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.210
that it's managed more efficiently from

was to create a map full scale of the
 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.870
was to create a map full scale of the

beyond the funny context this is
 

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.610
beyond the funny context this is
interesting a one hand because we could

we could see that it captures easily the
 

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:38.300
we could see that it captures easily the
emotions that people had around the game

expressing themselves but can we do

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680
expressing themselves but can we do
 

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.009
expressing themselves but can we do
something more quantitative with this so

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019
something more quantitative with this so
 

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:47.569
something more quantitative with this so
we're wondering first this was one of

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:47.579
we're wondering first this was one of
 

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:49.009
we're wondering first this was one of
the first projects we did with cell

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019
the first projects we did with cell
 

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.530
the first projects we did with cell
phone data and it's not it's not

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540
phone data and it's not it's not
 

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.790
phone data and it's not it's not
straightforward for example if you want

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800
straightforward for example if you want
 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.100
straightforward for example if you want
to count people right because people

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.110
to count people right because people
 

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.809

talks but we know they're all still

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019
talks but we know they're all still
 

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.619
talks but we know they're all still
there and you know look looking at the

00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:00.629
there and you know look looking at the
 

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:04.610
there and you know look looking at the
game but if you just do some very basic

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620
game but if you just do some very basic
 

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.030
game but if you just do some very basic
signal processing you can capture very

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040
signal processing you can capture very
 

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.240
signal processing you can capture very
salient features so there are dominant

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.250
salient features so there are dominant
 

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.220
salient features so there are dominant
features and have to do with how we use

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:13.230
features and have to do with how we use
 

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.040
features and have to do with how we use
cell phones and what we physically do at

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.050
cell phones and what we physically do at
 

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.019

most of you are not on the phone when is

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.430
most of you are not on the phone when is
 

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.860
most of you are not on the phone when is
you know when this will end you'll

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:21.870
you know when this will end you'll
 

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.449
you know when this will end you'll
probably send it via small text or make

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459
probably send it via small text or make
 

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:25.369
probably send it via small text or make
a phone call it turns out that there's

00:10:25.369 --> 00:10:25.379
a phone call it turns out that there's
 

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:26.809
a phone call it turns out that there's
some relationship between how we use the

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:26.819
some relationship between how we use the
 

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:29.360

is all just bandwidth consumption it's

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:31.019
is all just bandwidth consumption it's

very aggregated right so its data that's
 

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.530
very aggregated right so its data that's
very easy to use it's almost it's almost

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540
very easy to use it's almost it's almost
 

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.150
very easy to use it's almost it's almost
like junk that's running on the cell

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160
like junk that's running on the cell

phone networks that they use in order to
 

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:44.809
phone networks that they use in order to
manage their own capacity but today we

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:44.819
manage their own capacity but today we

that gives us additional types of
 

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:53.389
that gives us additional types of

pattern we saw like 45 minutes of

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:54.990
pattern we saw like 45 minutes of
 

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.759
pattern we saw like 45 minutes of
silence 15 minutes of talking another 45

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:58.769
silence 15 minutes of talking another 45
 

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:00.259

minutes of silence that's very

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:00.269
minutes of silence that's very
 

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:02.179
minutes of silence that's very
indicative of watching football all

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:02.189
indicative of watching football all
 

00:11:02.189 --> 00:11:04.130
indicative of watching football all
right but maybe that's

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140
right but maybe that's
 

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.170
right but maybe that's
the most interesting application but it

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180
the most interesting application but it
 

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.670
the most interesting application but it
turns out if you cluster the city with

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680
turns out if you cluster the city with
 

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.110
turns out if you cluster the city with
the same signal processing technique

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120
the same signal processing technique
 

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.120
the same signal processing technique
it's just eigen vector decomposition for

order to understand really what what's

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000
order to understand really what what's
 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.280
order to understand really what what's
the risk and what's the benefit of

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.290
the risk and what's the benefit of
 

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:36.100

the environmental impact of different
 

00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:50.659
the environmental impact of different
modes of transport so we took all the

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:50.669
modes of transport so we took all the
 

00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:52.249

everything that that that is recorded on
through those sensors when we move

00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:08.759
through those sensors when we move
 

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:11.810
through those sensors when we move
around and again by basic signal

around and again by basic signal
 

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.629
around and again by basic signal
processing we could correlate the

00:30:14.629 --> 00:30:14.639
processing we could correlate the
 

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:16.699
processing we could correlate the
combination of signals that are recorded

00:30:16.699 --> 00:30:16.709
combination of signals that are recorded
 

00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:18.589
combination of signals that are recorded
on those sensors and the mode of

00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:18.599
on those sensors and the mode of
 

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:21.109
on those sensors and the mode of
transport that one person might be

00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:21.119
transport that one person might be
 

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.379
transport that one person might be
moving in and then we assign a co2

00:30:24.379 --> 00:30:24.389
moving in and then we assign a co2
 

00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:26.359
moving in and then we assign a co2
emission value to it so basically what

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:26.369
emission value to it so basically what
 

00:30:26.369 --> 00:30:28.729
emission value to it so basically what
you have is an art is an automated

00:30:28.729 --> 00:30:28.739
you have is an art is an automated
 

00:30:28.739 --> 00:30:30.709
you have is an art is an automated
automatic care system to figure out how

00:30:30.709 --> 00:30:30.719
automatic care system to figure out how
 

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:34.159

we could differentiate all of those

00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:36.549
we could differentiate all of those
 

00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:38.520
we could differentiate all of those
automatically and then you'll get some

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:38.530
automatically and then you'll get some
 

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.130
automatically and then you'll get some
feedback about the co2 emission value of

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.140
feedback about the co2 emission value of
 

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.990
feedback about the co2 emission value of
that mode of transport again for the

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000
that mode of transport again for the
 

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.940
that mode of transport again for the
purpose of helping people make more

purpose of helping people make more
 

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.120
purpose of helping people make more
informed choices so this is something

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.130
informed choices so this is something
 

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.310
informed choices so this is something
that we're just going to launch soon

it I'm going to go quickly through this
 

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:09.240
it I'm going to go quickly through this
if we think about again is a the idea of

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.250
if we think about again is a the idea of
 

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.010
if we think about again is a the idea of
the city as a control as a control

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020
the city as a control as a control
 

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.830
the city as a control as a control
feedback loop we've seen a lot that has

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840
feedback loop we've seen a lot that has
 

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.779
feedback loop we've seen a lot that has
to do with sensing right so networks can

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:18.789
to do with sensing right so networks can
 

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:20.450
to do with sensing right so networks can
tell us many interesting things

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460
tell us many interesting things
 

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.419
tell us many interesting things
user-generated content can reveal

00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:23.429
user-generated content can reveal
 

00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:27.029
user-generated content can reveal
something about dynamics in cities and

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039
something about dynamics in cities and
 

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:29.010
something about dynamics in cities and
you can instrument your environment with

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:29.020
you can instrument your environment with
 

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.779
you can instrument your environment with
sensors so but there are many options

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:30.789
sensors so but there are many options
 

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:32.310
sensors so but there are many options
for understanding what's going on

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320
for understanding what's going on
 

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.649
for understanding what's going on
processing this information now the

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:34.659
processing this information now the
 

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.210
processing this information now the
question is really how do we close that

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:36.220
question is really how do we close that
 

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.770
question is really how do we close that
feedback loop so i want to show some

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:37.780
feedback loop so i want to show some
 

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.390
feedback loop so i want to show some
example about what you might refer to as

you know more the actuation actuation

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:41.650
you know more the actuation actuation
 

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.760
you know more the actuation actuation
side of that control feedback loop or

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:44.770
side of that control feedback loop or
 

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.880
side of that control feedback loop or
center of sensing and actuated in cities

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:47.890

this was done with the mayor of Florence

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080
this was done with the mayor of Florence
 

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.260
this was done with the mayor of Florence
and starting two years ago the focus was

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.270
and starting two years ago the focus was
 

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.630
and starting two years ago the focus was
on really weaving real-time information

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:57.640
on really weaving real-time information
 

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.020
on really weaving real-time information
into the city and we were focusing on

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.030
into the city and we were focusing on
 

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.970
into the city and we were focusing on
urban furniture we decided specifically

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:02.980
urban furniture we decided specifically
 

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.600
urban furniture we decided specifically
to focus on the bus stop and think about

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:06.610
to focus on the bus stop and think about
 

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:07.830
to focus on the bus stop and think about
all this information we looked at

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840
all this information we looked at
 

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.720
all this information we looked at
earlier you know information about the

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:09.730
earlier you know information about the
 

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.580
earlier you know information about the
location of public transport vehicles

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:11.590
location of public transport vehicles
 

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.919

that could really be blended and

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.130
that could really be blended and
 

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.070
that could really be blended and
presented in a piece of let's say

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080
presented in a piece of let's say
 

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.070

this is the interaction that we've

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:47.980
this is the interaction that we've
 

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.169
this is the interaction that we've
designed for the large scale of display

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179
designed for the large scale of display

basically from far away you can see

00:32:53.249 --> 00:32:53.259
basically from far away you can see
 

00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:54.869
basically from far away you can see
whether you need to water to run to

you want to plan your route as you

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:07.419
you want to plan your route as you
 

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:10.139
you want to plan your route as you
approach the bus stop all you need to do

00:33:10.139 --> 00:33:10.149
approach the bus stop all you need to do
 

00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:13.590
approach the bus stop all you need to do
is to touch where you want to go right

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600
is to touch where you want to go right
 

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.299
is to touch where you want to go right
the bus stop doesn't move so it knows

00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:15.309
the bus stop doesn't move so it knows
 

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:17.820
the bus stop doesn't move so it knows
where it is so it just queries the

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:17.830
where it is so it just queries the
 

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.519
where it is so it just queries the
database and and tells you what's the

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:20.529
database and and tells you what's the
 

00:33:20.529 --> 00:33:21.930
database and and tells you what's the
easiest way of getting to where you want

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:21.940
easiest way of getting to where you want
 

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.369
easiest way of getting to where you want
to get how long it's going to take you

00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:23.379
to get how long it's going to take you
 

00:33:23.379 --> 00:33:25.919
to get how long it's going to take you
give you some environmental information

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:25.929
give you some environmental information
 

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:27.720
give you some environmental information
about the again the choices that you're

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:27.730
about the again the choices that you're
 

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.639
about the again the choices that you're
making there you know if it's by train

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:29.649
making there you know if it's by train
 

00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:32.730
making there you know if it's by train
and bus by bus and bus and if you're

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:32.740
and bus by bus and bus and if you're
 

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.200
and bus by bus and bus and if you're
going to be late to where you need to

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.210
going to be late to where you need to
 

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.029
going to be late to where you need to
get to it you could also recessed you to

00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039
get to it you could also recessed you to
 

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:39.330
get to it you could also recessed you to
take a taxi and so this is just an

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:39.340
take a taxi and so this is just an
 

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.460
take a taxi and so this is just an
example of how you can use something

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:41.470
example of how you can use something
 

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.590

that's oh that's been available for

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600
that's oh that's been available for
 

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.119
that's oh that's been available for
almost a decade this type of information

00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:45.129
almost a decade this type of information
 

00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:47.369
almost a decade this type of information
but just the idea of bringing it into

00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:47.379
but just the idea of bringing it into
 

00:33:47.379 --> 00:33:50.399
but just the idea of bringing it into
the city in a way that is designed could

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:50.409
the city in a way that is designed could
 

00:33:50.409 --> 00:33:52.019
the city in a way that is designed could
help could help make an impact and

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:52.029
help could help make an impact and
 

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.700
help could help make an impact and
improve you know the experience of

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:53.710
improve you know the experience of
 

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.919
improve you know the experience of
moving around with public transport

00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:55.929
moving around with public transport

again bringing information into physical

00:34:29.579 --> 00:34:29.589
again bringing information into physical
 

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:31.139
again bringing information into physical
environments here asking how can you

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:31.149
environments here asking how can you
 

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:36.210
environments here asking how can you
really atomized a displays sensing and

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.220
really atomized a displays sensing and
 

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.190
really atomized a displays sensing and
displays so if we're looking at you know

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200
displays so if we're looking at you know
 

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.470
displays so if we're looking at you know
a bus shelter is quite big you can put

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480
a bus shelter is quite big you can put
 

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.879
a bus shelter is quite big you can put
sensors on it you can display with it if

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:43.889
sensors on it you can display with it if
 

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.190
sensors on it you can display with it if
if you could actually make the sensor

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200
if you could actually make the sensor
 

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.470
if you could actually make the sensor
and a display almost one and bring it

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480
and a display almost one and bring it
 

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.480
and a display almost one and bring it
down to a very very small size we're

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:51.490
down to a very very small size we're
 

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:52.740
down to a very very small size we're
asking how can you use that to make a

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:52.750
asking how can you use that to make a
 

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.409
asking how can you use that to make a
very flexible display something that you

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:55.419
very flexible display something that you
 

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:57.960
very flexible display something that you
can really distribute any environment we

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:57.970
can really distribute any environment we
 

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.360
can really distribute any environment we
decided to

00:34:59.360 --> 00:34:59.370
decided to
 

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.340
decided to
instrument LEDs with little propellers

answered them in a new way um but I

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.010
answered them in a new way um but I
 

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.440
