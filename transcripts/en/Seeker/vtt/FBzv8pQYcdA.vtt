00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.730
Some company execs say, "diamonds are a girl's
best friend," but diamonds are also friendly

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.820
with both male and female chemists, engineers,
biologists, construction workers... diamonds

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:19.370
get around!

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.230
Diamonds became traditional for wedding bands
in the 1930s thanks to a clever marketing

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.000
scheme by De Beers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.930
Diamonds are a lattice formation of simple
carbon, the same thing you, or your house,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.090
or burned firewood is made of; carbon is one
of the most common elements on earth.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.309
The substance itself is a simple covalent
carbon lattice.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.960
Each carbon atom is bonded with four other
carbon atoms, making them SUPER strong.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.199
The carbon atoms are sharing their electrons,
meaning we'd need to apply a lot of energy

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.100
to break them up; that equates to a high boiling
and melting point.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.999
We love diamonds, not for their intrinsic
value, but because once cut, they looks purty,

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.379
and because of a psychological connection
reinforced by advertisers.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.820
Diamonds are not rare; they can be easily
manufactured in a lab, and if you look outside

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
the world of romance, diamond's got game.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.190
Covalent structures are valued in biological
applications, as well as electronics, optics,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.620
industry, research, and on and on.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.610
Because of their awesome covalent-bonded strength,
diamonds are preferred in "grinding, drilling,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.380
cutting, and polishing… [it] cuts faster
and lasts longer" than metals or silicates

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.350
-- imagine a diamondpaper instead of sandpaper,
a diamond file instead of a carbon steel one,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.960
diamonds suspended in oil for polishing, or
diamonds embedded in saw-wheels to cut through

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.480
steel, concrete, or pretty much whatever you
throw in front of it.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.710
Diamonds are useful in more than just industrial
tools.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.700
They don't have any free electrons, so diamonds
are not electrically conductive, but don't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.880
be sad for them.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.460
Diamonds make up for it by being the most
thermally conductive material of any solid

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.970
known to man!

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.200
Thermal conductivity means they make a great
heat sink for electronics!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.740
Additionally, they experience thermionic emission
when heated to around 400 C -- essentially,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.490
the added heat energy allows the diamond to
boil off electrons!

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.240
Researchers at the University of Melbourne
are attempting to use diamond in solar panels

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.800
in collect those extra electrons and increase
the efficiency of solar energy collection!

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
BOOM diamonds!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.180
Now, this is mostly with diamonds at normal
scale, but these covalent carbon celebs can

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.260
exist in the nanoscale too.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.190
A 2014 study in the Journal of Geology looked
at the "character and distribution of nanodiamonds"

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.450
produced during a theorized extraterrestrial
collision 13,000 years ago which caused an

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.050
extinction event of mastodons, saber-toothed
cats, and American camels and horses.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.080
Their paper uses the presence of nanodiamonds
to add more credence to a meteor impact theory,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.320
but nanodiamonds can also be created by nuclear
explosions… so… that seems bad, but they're

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320
not!

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720
Nanodiamonds could be the future of medicine!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.630
Nanodiamonds are biocompatible, which means
they're nontoxic to humans, so researchers

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.349
are doing to try and use them to deliver drugs.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.180
They're only about five-nanometers-long a
DNA strand is 2.5 nanometers in diameter,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.209
so these nanodiamonds are like… two DNA
widths.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.830
They can easily be created with a flawed colorful
center -- creating a 3D star formation.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.319
That nanodiamond star has a huge surface area
relatively speaking (they are nano after all),

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.120
but are so small they can slip through the
blood-brain barrier and deliver chemotherapy

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.989
directly to brain tumors!

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.530
YESS NANODIAMONDS!!

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.770
That's not all, they can easily create fluorescent
nanodiamonds to help with medical imaging

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.349
and microscopy, they can be derived so they
create visible blue-green light under certain

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.840
conditions, and can even be levitated in a
vacuum by a "trapping laser" like optical

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.880
tweezers.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.400
Considering they were only discovered during
nuclear tests done by the USSR in the early

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.310
60s, nanodiamonds seem to be everywhere and
their applications are incredible.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.400
We've talked about graphene on this show before,
perhaps you remember how incredibly incredible

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.980
that it… it could charge your cell phone
in five seconds, also has medical capabilities

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.319
and could completely change how we construct
future machines; diamonds and graphene are

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.569
related!

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.360
They're both arrangements of carbon.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.150
So maybe, next time you grab a wedding band
for your lovah, skip the diamond store and

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.950
get yourself some carbon.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:47.520
Cause that stuff is tight.
