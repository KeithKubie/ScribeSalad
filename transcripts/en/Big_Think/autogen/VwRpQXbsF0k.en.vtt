00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
I think there's a of course a chance

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
I think there's a of course a chance
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.829
I think there's a of course a chance
that there are aliens out there in space

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
that there are aliens out there in space
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.950
that there are aliens out there in space
I mean no one knows the answer to that

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
I mean no one knows the answer to that
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.379
I mean no one knows the answer to that
and no one has any particular expertise

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
and no one has any particular expertise
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299
and no one has any particular expertise
so anyone who answers a question on

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
so anyone who answers a question on
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.580
so anyone who answers a question on
alien life they're just talking from

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
alien life they're just talking from
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.200
alien life they're just talking from
their hunch from their gut so here's my

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
their hunch from their gut so here's my
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.540
their hunch from their gut so here's my
hunch my gut well like most people I

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
hunch my gut well like most people I
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.689
hunch my gut well like most people I
look out on a dark night and I see all

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
look out on a dark night and I see all
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089
look out on a dark night and I see all
of the stars out there and then I know

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
of the stars out there and then I know
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310
of the stars out there and then I know
about all the galaxies out there you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
about all the galaxies out there you
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.500
about all the galaxies out there you
know hundreds of billions of stars per

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
know hundreds of billions of stars per
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540
know hundreds of billions of stars per
galaxy hundreds of billions of galaxies

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
galaxy hundreds of billions of galaxies
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.389
galaxy hundreds of billions of galaxies
now we know that many of those stars

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
now we know that many of those stars
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270
now we know that many of those stars
have planetary systems and it can't help

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
have planetary systems and it can't help
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.119
have planetary systems and it can't help
but just have a a sense of with all of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
but just have a a sense of with all of
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.459
but just have a a sense of with all of
that out there there's got to be other

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
that out there there's got to be other
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100
that out there there's got to be other
life that somehow is populating some of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
life that somehow is populating some of
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920
life that somehow is populating some of
those planets but the big question to me

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
those planets but the big question to me
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229
those planets but the big question to me
is not so much whether there's other

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
is not so much whether there's other
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.889
is not so much whether there's other
life out there is there intelligent life

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
life out there is there intelligent life
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.560
life out there is there intelligent life
out there now look some will say that we

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
out there now look some will say that we
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.910
out there now look some will say that we
don't have a single example of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
don't have a single example of
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590
don't have a single example of
intelligent life in the universe right

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
intelligent life in the universe right
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200
intelligent life in the universe right
but putting that to the side what I mean

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
but putting that to the side what I mean
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.230
but putting that to the side what I mean
is and what many scientists mean is is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
is and what many scientists mean is is
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840
is and what many scientists mean is is
there life out there that can build

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
there life out there that can build
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.570
there life out there that can build
radio telescopes that could possibly

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
radio telescopes that could possibly
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280
radio telescopes that could possibly
communicate with us because if there's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
communicate with us because if there's
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109
communicate with us because if there's
life out there and we can't ever

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
life out there and we can't ever
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630
life out there and we can't ever
communicate it's hard to see how that's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
communicate it's hard to see how that's
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.090
communicate it's hard to see how that's
going to have much of an impact on us on

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
going to have much of an impact on us on
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.130
going to have much of an impact on us on
life as we know it I mean that big the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
life as we know it I mean that big the
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.580
life as we know it I mean that big the
radical break from the past will be when

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
radical break from the past will be when
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.560
radical break from the past will be when
we can actually communicate with life

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
we can actually communicate with life
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.920
we can actually communicate with life
out there and I don't think we know

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
out there and I don't think we know
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.740
out there and I don't think we know
enough about what it takes for alien

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
enough about what it takes for alien
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859
enough about what it takes for alien
life to become intelligent in this sense

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
life to become intelligent in this sense
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600
life to become intelligent in this sense
of building radio telescopes to have any

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
of building radio telescopes to have any
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.870
of building radio telescopes to have any
sense if it's likely or unlikely you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
sense if it's likely or unlikely you
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.350
sense if it's likely or unlikely you
know is it some strange coincidence of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
know is it some strange coincidence of
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.590
know is it some strange coincidence of
having you know big planets nearby like

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
having you know big planets nearby like
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870
having you know big planets nearby like
Jupiter that help deflect asteroids that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
Jupiter that help deflect asteroids that
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.630
Jupiter that help deflect asteroids that
allow enough time for life on this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
allow enough time for life on this
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.730
allow enough time for life on this
planet to have gotten to the point

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
planet to have gotten to the point
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340
planet to have gotten to the point
are there other contingencies that we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
are there other contingencies that we
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.510
are there other contingencies that we
don't know about that are so rare that

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
don't know about that are so rare that
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.999
don't know about that are so rare that
may be intelligent life happens only

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
may be intelligent life happens only
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119
may be intelligent life happens only
here we don't know but shooting from the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
here we don't know but shooting from the
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.670
here we don't know but shooting from the
hip speaking from the gut yeah

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
hip speaking from the gut yeah
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.899
hip speaking from the gut yeah
there's probably alien life out there

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909
there's probably alien life out there
 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.379
there's probably alien life out there
and probably intelligent life too
