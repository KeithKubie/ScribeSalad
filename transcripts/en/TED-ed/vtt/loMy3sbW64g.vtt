00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:11.963
On first glance, this painting might not
seem terribly special,

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:16.205
but it's actually one of the most analyzed
paintings in the history of art.

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:20.094
It's called "Las Meninas,"
or "The Maids of Honor,"

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:24.057
painted by Diego Vel치zquez in 1656,

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:27.762
and it depicts a scene in the life
of the Spanish Royal Court.

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:32.203
A well-dressed child princess refuses
a glass of water from a handmaid,

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:34.410
while a dwarf teases a dog.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.444
A second dwarf stands next to them,

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:39.304
while the artist himself 
pauses at his canvas.

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.496
Two more people whisper in the background,

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.814
while a third appears 
to be exiting the room,

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:47.903
and why wouldn't he when there seems
to be so little going on?

00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:51.186
Even the dog looks bored.

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:52.772
But look more closely.

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:55.765
The two people reflected
in the blurry mirror at the back,

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.019
easily missed at first glance,

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.011
are none other than
King Philip IV and Queen Mariana,

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.390
seemingly changing the scene from a simple
depiction of court life

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.962
to that of a royal portrait.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:09.662
And with this piece of information,

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:12.404
we can begin to understand far more
about the painting

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:16.302
and why it has captivated viewers
for centuries.

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:19.097
First, there's the historical context.

00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:21.995
When "Las Meninas" was painted
at the end of Philip's reign,

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:25.275
the Spanish Empire 
was in a period of decline,

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.823
having suffered defeat in
The Thirty Years War,

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:31.268
as well as economic 
and political difficulties.

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:33.676
The King himself had also 
suffered misfortune,

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:40.244
losing both his first wife and his only 
heir to the throne before remarrying.

00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:44.780
But the painting obscures their struggle
to provide food for their household.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.774
Even the monarch's advanced 
age is concealed

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.708
through the blurring of the mirror.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:53.246
What we do see in the geometric center
of the canvas,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.795
brightly illuminated by the light
from the window,

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:58.623
in the Infanta Margarita Teresa,

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:01.584
the King's only living legitimate child
at the time.

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:03.361
Her glowing and healthy appearance

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:07.376
is an idealized view of the struggling
empire's future.

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:11.177
However, the Infanta is not the only
center of the painting.

00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:13.112
Through the clever use of perspective,

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:18.225
as well as painting the work life-sized,
on a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas,

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:21.609
Vel치zquez blurs the boundary
between art and reality,

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.367
creating the sense of a three-dimensional
picture that we can walk into.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:30.203
The line between the ceiling and the wall
converges to the open door,

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:34.027
further creating the perception
of the painting as a physical space

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:36.766
seen from the viewer's perspective.

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:40.369
In this sense, the audience
and the real world are the focus,

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.652
underlined by the three figures
looking straight at the viewer.

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:47.130
But there is still another focal point.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.417
The line formed by the light fixtures
leads to the center of the back wall

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.561
to the mirror reflecting the royal couple.

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.855
And its positioning relative to the viewer

00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:01.647
has led to radically different 
interpretations of the entire work.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:05.704
The mirror could be reflecting the King
and Queen posing for their portrait,

00:03:05.704 --> 00:03:07.986
or is it reflecting the canvas?

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:09.496
And what do we make of the fact

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:13.430
that Vel치zquez never painted
the royal portrait implied here?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.647
Could the painting actually be
depicting its own creation instead?

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.024
With the incorporation of the mirror
into his work,

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:22.371
Vel치zquez elevated the art of painting

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:24.655
from its perception as a simple craft

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:26.899
to an intellectual endeavor.

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.778
With its three competing center points,

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:32.291
"Las Meninas" captures the contrast 
between the ideal,

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.601
the real,

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:34.991
and the reflected worlds,

00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:40.015
maintaining an unresolved tension
between them to tell a more complex story

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:41.944
than any mirror can provide.
