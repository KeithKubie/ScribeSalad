00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.270
Doppler echo location is something I've put
to use in recent years

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.610
for observing bats.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.040
I have a small doppler radar here for measuring
bat flight speeds

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.210
and it also can observe details of their wing
motion and their aerobatics.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.820
And we've learnt quite a lot about the details
of bird flight

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.560
by pointing it at birds.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.390
My first one proved that it was a useful technique

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.239
and then I got some very welcome help from
Marconis

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.399
who made me this superb little doppler radar.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.429
This is a true microwave radar.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:46.850
We could try to demonstrate this on the bats
if we get one of them to fly.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.989
Here he is.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:02.030
Let's switch it on first. Oh, I forgot.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.170
[Low wooshing sound]

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.310
Thank you, Bill.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.910
Of course that's at point blank range.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:20.190
The radar will detect a bat of that size at
up to about 30 metres.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.780
And a pigeon out to considerably further away.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.990
We're going to demonstrate it though by looking
at a different problem.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.280
You remember Galileo and the leaning tower
of Pisa?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.050
Where he dropped balls to see at what rate
they would fall.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.430
Well Phil here is going to try and take some
pictures

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.810
of balls as they fall from the ceiling.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.630
While I measure their speed on the doppler
radar.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.680
Phil, I think you better have this protective
clothing.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.410
Thank you.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.500
Is that comfortable?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.210
I'll switch on the radar.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.520
And you see the balls up there?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.640
See if we can get one as it comes down.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.100
OK, release one.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.190
Did it get you? - Yes.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.180
You or the camera? - I don't know.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.140
Let's try again. You hear the ball accelerate.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.560
The note goes up as it accelerates under gravity.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Fire two.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.950
Fire three.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:43.050
And now I think there's a parachute up there.
Can we have the parachute, please?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.870
[Whooshing whoomping sound]

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.810
[Applause]

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.910
Ten years before that machine was made said
Eric Eastwood that err...

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.260
was interested in a problem that had puzzled
radar engineers for a long time.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.709
Since the second world war.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.240
They often saw slow moving targets, moving
around over the countryside,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.650
and couldn't explain what they were.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.950
Using the powerful Marconi radar in Essex,
Sir Eric Eastwood discovered

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.700
that most of these angels, as they were called
for want of a better term,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.940
were in fact birds.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.000
I'm going to show you a film that he made.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.560
There's a watch in the top corner of the film.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.520
Those are planes moving over Heathrow.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.150
And you see in the middle they keep disappearing
as they land

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.090
and occasionally take off.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.420
Gives some impression for the, of the job
of air traffic controllers.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.120
Now there's southern England, France and Holland.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.660
You see some planes whizzing around

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.830
but the slow moving targets are birds migrating
across the Channel.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.640
And going up to East Anglia.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.319
There's some clouds going up from the Isle
of Wight towards the Midlands.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.599
And there again planes and birds migrating
south, in the opposite direction.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:22.470
Across the Channel towards France.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.580
Now there are ring angels. You see up to the
North West.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.780
You see the ring angels going out and the
line to the North East is the rising sun.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.590
Wave after wave of starlings going out.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:41.030
There are several roosts there but the best
one is to the North West.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.300
And finally a radar microscope close up view

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.280
of starlings radiating out from their roost
at dawn. Most of them have gone now.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.120
The ripples get weaker and weaker and the
show is over.
