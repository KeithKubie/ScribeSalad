here in this mouse wheel and we're only

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
here in this mouse wheel and we're only
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.870
here in this mouse wheel and we're only
getting started we only end of a very

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
getting started we only end of a very
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460
getting started we only end of a very
early stage of the development of this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
early stage of the development of this
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.069
early stage of the development of this
medium you can compare today with the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
medium you can compare today with the
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.020
medium you can compare today with the
1994 of the internet where

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
1994 of the internet where
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880
1994 of the internet where
come to such as Amazon Google Twitter

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
come to such as Amazon Google Twitter
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.870
come to such as Amazon Google Twitter
still had to be invented or the stage

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
still had to be invented or the stage
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880
still had to be invented or the stage
where actually radio became TV and the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
where actually radio became TV and the
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190
where actually radio became TV and the
first TV shows were still just a radio

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
first TV shows were still just a radio
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
American Idol or TV commercial so had to
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699
American Idol or TV commercial so had to
be invented so we can imagine that this

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
be invented so we can imagine that this
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.940
be invented so we can imagine that this
is a whole new industry which will be

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
is a whole new industry which will be
 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.620
is a whole new industry which will be
growing very very fast in the coming

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
growing very very fast in the coming
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.979
growing very very fast in the coming
years and yeah I think that's also our

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989
years and yeah I think that's also our
 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.920
years and yeah I think that's also our
contribute contribution to well to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
contribute contribution to well to
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.860
contribute contribution to well to
innovation and job creation that we

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870
innovation and job creation that we
 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.440
innovation and job creation that we
stimulate the creation of this whole

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
stimulate the creation of this whole
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.739
stimulate the creation of this whole
ecosystem and also new jobs
