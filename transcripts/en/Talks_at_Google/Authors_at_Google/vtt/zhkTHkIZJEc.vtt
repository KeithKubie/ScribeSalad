00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:09.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.060
DEMIS HASSABIS: Well, thank
you, everyone, for coming.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.080
It's a really special
privilege and honor

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.570
for me, actually,
to talk to Garry,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.040
in my opinion, my
humble opinion,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.280
the greatest chess
player of all time.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.490
And you know, I've
really enjoyed his book,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.140
which I reviewed recently.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.910
And you know, I was impressed
with Garry's understanding

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.881
of artificial intelligence and
the latest advances in that.

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.130
So you know, it's going to
be great to talk about that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.120
as well as chess today.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.530
GARRY KASPAROV: Yes.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.140
DEMIS HASSABIS: So welcome
to Google and DeepMind.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.440
GARRY KASPAROV: Thank you
very much for your review.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.820
It offered me all the
protection against all the tech

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.179
guys that tried to criticize
me for not being an expert.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.470
DEMIS HASSABIS: Well, I'm
glad that that can be of use.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.205
So before we get talking
about Deep Blue match--

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:55.580
I'm sure everyone's
going to want

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.121
to hear about your insights on
that and also machine learning

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.180
more generally.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.360
I wanted to begin by asking
you about growing up as a chess

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.519
champion in the Soviet Union.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.480
Did you always want
to be a chess player,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480
world champion at chess?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.830
Did you consider anything else?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.050
Or were you, from a
very young age, decided

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.500
that this was your path?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.990
GARRY KASPAROV: I
learned how to play chess

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.880
when I was five or six.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.380
I'm sorry.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.879
I couldn't give you
an exact moment.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.670
Nobody was there
to tweet about it.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.060
It was late '68,
maybe early '69,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.770
watching my parents trying
to solve chess problem.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.640
And I loved the
game at first sight.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.730
And ever since, I'm still
in awe with the game.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.470
And I could feel that was
a match made in heaven.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.070
And everybody around
also could see that chess

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.067
was a perfect fit for my mind.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:49.275
DEMIS HASSABIS: Skills, yeah.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:49.600
GARRY KASPAROV: Yeah.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.030
DEMIS HASSABIS:
And, actually, you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.065
talk about, in the
book, about chess

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:54.440
informing all of your thinking
and the rest of your life,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.950
right?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.991
What do you mean by that?

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:59.580
What skills can you see yourself
using in the rest of your life

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.535
that you learned from chess?

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:02.910
GARRY KASPAROV:
Naturally, if you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.190
are engaged in a competitive
sport at such an early age,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.030
you see many things just as a
reflection of your chess games,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.080
your engagement.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.870
Because you have to
play, you have to win.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.140
It means you have to
change certain habits

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.730
and certain customs.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.780
And what was important
for me, that's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.760
what I learned from my mother,
is that my game was not

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.050
just about winning.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.460
It was also about
making a difference.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.860
And that's what
helped me to make

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.910
a transition later on in
my life from playing chess,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.650
being number one chess
player for 20 years,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.580
to other things
that I'm doing now.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.450
Not pretending that
I could be number one

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.430
and repeat my
outstanding achievements

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.320
in the game of chess,
but still recognizing

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.550
that I'm quite useful.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.420
Because I'm trying to
bring my chess experience,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.350
what I learned from the game
of chess, my analytical skills,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.760
to make the
difference elsewhere.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.120
DEMIS HASSABIS: So maybe we
should talk about, obviously,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.210
the heart of your book,
which is the Deep Blue match.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.320
You know, I was
fascinated to see--

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.530
having gone through the
AlphaGo matches ourselves

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.570
from the other side--

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.170
your take on it from the
player's perspective.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.920
GARRY KASPAROV: It's
an interesting story.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.760
Because when we played
our first match--

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.770
and I always want
to remind people

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.040
that there were two matches.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.192
And I won the first one.

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:28.400
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yes, exactly.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.690
We should make that very clear.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.550
GARRY KASPAROV: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.383
DEMIS HASSABIS: I was
going to say, exactly.

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:37.910
GARRY KASPAROV: Now, the
first match in Philadelphia,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.180
it was organized as
quite a low-level event.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.460
The corporation was
not even involved.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.190
It was ACM behind it.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.180
And the team always
wanted to challenge me.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.750
And I had an experience of
playing against them in 1989

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.860
when they had Deep Thought, the
prototype from Carnegie Mellon

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.390
that they brought to IBM.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.930
It's turned into a
Deep Blue project.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.380
And everything has
changed after game one.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.080
By the way, if we're talking
about a watershed moment,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.480
that was in February
1996 in Philadelphia

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.640
when I lost game
one of that match.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.300
Because the rest is, you may
argue, a matter of technique,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.209
matter of time.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.269
It was like signing on the wall.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.980
If the machine can beat a world
champion in one game, then--

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.640
DEMIS HASSABIS: Eventually.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.985
GARRY KASPAROV: Eventually.

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.020
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.740
GARRY KASPAROV: I fought back.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.580
I won the match.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.680
I won game two and
game five and game six.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.600
But it was pretty clear that the
rest would be a matter of time.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.440
And the first game had
some kind of a record

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.880
following on internet.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.130
I think the numbers they
had, there were even higher

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.720
numbers later on in Atlanta
when IBM ran the website there.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.140
And suddenly, the corporation,
Lou Gerstner and his team,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.510
discovered the huge potential
at a rather low cost.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.490
And while the rest of the
match was still played just

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.660
about purely chess,
then it turned

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.700
into a big corporate endeavor.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.360
And look, it's water
under the bridge.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.740
20 years ago, I lost the match.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.020
But I think, and I
discuss it in the book,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.240
I made many mistakes
in preparation.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.420
And one of the biggest
mistakes, and that's

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.085
why I was so upset
with myself, is

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:25.080
that I didn't treat
IBM, Deep Blue,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.870
as just an opponent the way
I treated Anatoly Karpov

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.850
or Vishy Anand or Nigel Short.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.700
For me, I was still part of
a great social and scientific

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.550
experiment of the end of the
20th century, something that

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.160
could help us to understand
more about how we humans make

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.750
decisions, how machines
can play with us.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.740
It was not just
winning or losing--

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.782
big mistake.

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:48.930
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.100
GARRY KASPAROV: Now,
for IBM, it was just

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.910
about winning or losing.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.400
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.275
GARRY KASPAROV: Yeah.

00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:55.530
And one of the big
mistakes that I

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.434
made while signing the
contract, you always

00:05:59.434 --> 00:06:00.600
have to read the fine print.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.660
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.280
And say, hey, that
rematch clause is--

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.400
GARRY KASPAROV: And
because when people ask me

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.420
whether IBM cheated--

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.920
no.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.650
They just bent the
rules in their favor.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.160
They followed the letter but
not the spirit of the agreement.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.667
And, for instance,
one of the big issues

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.500
after our first match
in Philadelphia for me

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.544
was how can I prepare if
I didn't have any games?

00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:24.960
This is the normal
way to prepare.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.584
You look at the games
of your opponent.

00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:29.040
And Deep Blue in
Philadelphia was a black box.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.200
I had no idea what
it was capable of.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.710
There were so few games
that the machine played

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.070
against other computers,
but it was not

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.140
the machine that faced me.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.820
Now one year--
more than one year,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.100
15 months-- between the
first match and the second

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.770
match, and I was
under the impression

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.830
that I'll be treated fairly.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.050
Because after my first
victory in Philadelphia,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.275
I went to Yorktown Heights.

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:54.150
I sat with that team.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.880
They had similar regiments for
all IBM labs around the world.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.640
So the atmosphere
was very friendly.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.725
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:02.980
And then it changed.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.750
GARRY KASPAROV: And then
I expected the games

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.980
to be provided.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.740
And then they said, wait a
second, but did you read?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.015
The game's played in
official tournaments.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.640
And, of course, Deep
Blue hasn't played

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.460
a single game outside the lab,
which means that in May 1997,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.920
I faced another
black box that I knew

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.420
was much stronger than it
was before, but I still

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.220
no idea what to expect.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.720
I knew they had a
professional team.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.460
So they made a
massive preparation.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.550
And I have to also admit my
preparation was quite lousy.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.800
Because, again, only
just before the match,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.360
a week before the match,
I realized how difficult

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.680
the challenge could be.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.430
But also, one of
the key elements

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.450
of this contract that
I totally overlooked

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.129
was about machines rebooting.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:54.920
That's a big issue.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.380
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.610
GARRY KASPAROV: You
understand what it is?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.810
Here, I don't have to explain.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.280
But the general audience
doesn't understand it.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.510
The moment you
reboot the computer,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.820
you will never be able to
reconstruct the game, which

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.090
means that is a whole idea that
the match is fair and square.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.200
And you can always go back
and see why Deep Blue made

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.500
this move or that move.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.810
It's over.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.100
And also the--

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.170
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.570
Maybe people didn't
realize that.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.380
I didn't realize it till I
read the book that in fact

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.290
several times--

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.820
GARRY KASPAROV: They rebooted.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.920
DEMIS HASSABIS: --that
Deep Blue crashed.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.910
And then they rebooted it.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.140
GARRY KASPAROV: We don't
know that it crashed.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.490
DEMIS HASSABIS: And then they
came up with a different move

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.610
in a couple of situations.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.060
GARRY KASPAROV:
Look, no, no, no.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.660
It doesn't matter
what the move was.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.280
It's just the crash--

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.120
if you played a match, anything
but the problems was agreed--

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.620
crash.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.369
You lost the game.

00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:34.919
Heart attack.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.479
Sorry, go to see a doctor.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:38.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.250
DEMIS HASSABIS: Should
have just been a loss.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.260
GARRY KASPAROV: No.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.740
They have Ken Thompson,
the great computer expert,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.540
who was there in
Philadelphia helping me.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.998
He was also in
front of the screen.

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:52.950
But on the screen, you could
see the Deep Blue communication

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.480
back to the programmer.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.210
But you didn't see whether
they said anything--

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.670
DEMIS HASSABIS: The other way.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.300
GARRY KASPAROV: --the other way.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.510
Again, I don't know.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.390
But it definitely created a
lot of tension in the match.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.710
And, you know, after
losing game two--

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.850
which that's another story--

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.540
I was very upset.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.300
And I demanded logs.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.980
And by the way, if they
wanted to play a fair game,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.890
all they had to do
is produce the logs

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.740
to prove that my suspicions
were not well-founded.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.490
They didn't do it.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.365
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:26.700
GARRY KASPAROV: They just
wanted me just to be inflamed.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.040
Because they realized that
while Deep Blue was not

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.370
that strong at that time, I
still think I was stronger.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.610
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.030
You were definitely stronger
I would have said, too.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.200
GARRY KASPAROV: Now,
20 years later, you

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.360
can look at the games.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.859
You know, you can take a
chess engine on your laptop,

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:39.650
and you'll find out
that many mistakes were

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.770
made from both sides.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.960
I mean, one of
the most amazing--

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.000
not even game two,
but game five--

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.790
the end game, reaching the end
game, I was slightly better.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.650
And everybody at
that time in 1997

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.200
believed that was a brilliant
escape by Deep Blue.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.910
Now, in 30 seconds
to one minute,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.800
it depends on the strength of
the speed of your computer,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.840
chess engines like
Stockfish or Komodo

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.580
will tell you that the
end game was a draw.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.790
Deep Blue made a bad
mistake, and then that

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.030
missed the win, which no one saw
in 1997, including Deep Blue.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.640
So that tells you that's
the draw of the strength.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.460
And I think that if we played
the short match, the rubber

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.560
match, I still had a
good chance of winning.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.350
Again, it wouldn't change any
sort of long-term outcome.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.990
But at that--

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.210
DEMIS HASSABIS: How long do you
think you could have held them

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.920
off for at your full potential?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.820
GARRY KASPAROV: Maybe
two, three years.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:24.960
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.760
That's what I would
have guessed, too.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.885
GARRY KASPAROV: Deep Blue
maximum two, three years.

00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:32.110
I played two more matches with
Deep Fritz and Deep Junior

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.450
in 2003-- both ended in a draw.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.580
So that was a balance
in the next five years.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.180
But in 1997, they realized that
if putting pressure on only one

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.690
human player in a match, they
could achieve the result.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.490
If you cannot make
your player stronger,

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.980
you can definitely inflame the
other player and took him off

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.720
balance.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.200
DEMIS HASSABIS: So sort of
moving more to the present day

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.870
now, how have chess
computers changed chess?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.500
Do you think it's
for the better?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.920
It's just different?

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.136
What do you think
about that evolution?

00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.760
GARRY KASPAROV: It's
something that you

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.660
said that it's quite striking.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.330
Because you said is it
for better or worse.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.030
It's happening, period.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.960
The technology is
neither good nor bad.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.350
It's agnostic.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.487
You know, you can do many great
things with your mobile phone.

00:11:18.487 --> 00:11:20.320
But you can also create
a terrorist network.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.860
So it's happening, and
we just have to adjust.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.710
And as for the
game of chess, it's

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.340
different, because the young
generation of chess players,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.840
they learn very
differently from us.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.250
I remember I had books.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.600
And not so many new books you
can buy in the Soviet Union.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.370
Every book was cherished.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.040
And I had my notebooks.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.070
When I went to
the top and played

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.640
world championship matches, I
had also notebooks and recorded

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.680
my analysis.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.270
And I treasured them.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.080
I remember I had a couple
of quite thick notebooks

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.060
with analysis.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.980
And they were just top secret.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:05.066
And I believed in 1985, in 1986,
1987, that was a real treasure.

00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:06.190
That was a powerful weapon.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.580
It's like the magic
sword of Merlin.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.740
Now, when you look at this
analysis with computer,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.281
you understand it
was a broken knife.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.480
But also, when you look
at young chess players,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.630
under the umbrella of
Kasparov Foundation,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.790
I have been involved
in working with them.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.890
And I'm talking about kids
of international masters,

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.380
grandmaster level.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.130
It's such a difference in the
way they approach the game,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.530
The way they look at the pieces.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.510
It happened time and
again where you're

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.020
reaching a certain position
analyzing the game,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.134
and they say, bad move.

00:12:44.134 --> 00:12:45.050
I made a mistake here.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:46.080
I said, fine.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.210
Why?

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.920
Oh.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.270
And then it's a long line.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.520
So the machine show--

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.270
I said, I understand.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.650
I could see the screen.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.380
But why you think
this move is wrong?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.150
And they don't
understand the question.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.950
Because the machine said so.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.630
Because it's on the screen.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.500
So somehow their
mind's being hijacked

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.270
by the power of the machine.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.850
And one of the reasons Magnus
Carlsen was so successful

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.270
and still a dominant force
in the world of chess--

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.050
and I remember after working
with him in 2009, 2010,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.100
for more than a year, he
never looked at the machine

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.170
as an ultimate source of wisdom.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.050
For him, it was more
like a big calculator

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.090
to verify his own understanding
and evaluation of the position.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.090
This is a big challenge.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.640
But I believe it's
not only chess.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.320
It's elsewhere.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.200
Many people just are
staring at the computers.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.580
Eyes are just being caught
by the screen expecting

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.980
to find a solution there.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.980
DEMIS HASSABIS: Instead of
thinking for themselves.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.980
GARRY KASPAROV: Exactly.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.620
So that's why I always
bring, as a piece of wisdom,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.320
the classical phrase from
Pablo Picasso that computers

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.890
are useless, because they
can only give you answers.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.764
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:13:55.764 --> 00:13:58.540
GARRY KASPAROV: But everything
begins with a question.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.800
DEMIS HASSABIS: Since you're
talking about Magnus Carlsen,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.510
you say that interestingly,
although he's

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.010
grown up in the
computer chess era,

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.294
he's one of the most human--

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:06.460
I think you called it-- or
intuitive players around.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:06.730
Right?

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.000
So it's kind of interesting.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.170
GARRY KASPAROV: He's consistent.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.220
Yes, it's human.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.990
Because at the end
of the day, 20 years

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.940
after my match with
Deep Blue, more people

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.800
playing chess than ever before.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.980
And chess is still very popular,
because at the end of the day,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.780
it's a fight between
two individuals.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:31.450
And what has changed is
not just the game itself,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.240
but the way people
are watching it.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.120
20 years ago, or 30
years ago, 40 years ago,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.060
the world championship
match was kind of an event

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.380
of absolute quality.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.240
Even Karpov and Kasparov
played the game,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.280
and one made a terrible blunder.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.680
It could take time in the
precedent of the grandmasters

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.180
to--

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.540
DEMIS HASSABIS: To find out.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.310
GARRY KASPAROV:
--whisper it, mistake.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.000
And it's something that
you should worship.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.880
Today, when I'm watching
the games by Magnus Carlsen,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.270
Caruana, and you have
thousands of amateurs

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.881
from all over the
world watching it.

00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:07.880
Because they're screaming,
ah, mistake, mistake!

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.992
Because the machine shows
immediately-- it says,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:10.700
evaluation, drop.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.270
So some kind of respect
has disappeared.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.800
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yes, from that.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.150
It's a real shame.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.180
GARRY KASPAROV: But
also, it added interest.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.670
Because people can follow.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.710
They have access
to their computer.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.020
And they don't have
to be strong players

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.395
to understand what is happening.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.270
DEMIS HASSABIS: One of
the interesting things

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.280
you said, actually, about
the chess computers--

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.590
and I wonder if it's going
to happen with Go as well.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.350
In the countries that are not
traditionally good at chess

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.320
or Go, because they have
access to these machines,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.990
maybe kids in those countries
can now get very strong, right?

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.200
Like, Magnus in Norway.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.533
Or I don't know whether that's--

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:51.610
GARRY KASPAROV: I'm not sure
Magnus' rise, meteoric rise

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.350
was due to computers.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.800
Maybe it's because
in this environment

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.840
you don't have to spend
so much time learning

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.260
from other players.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.210
So the process of maturing
for the chess player

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.380
is much shorter.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.570
You have grandmasters
at 14, 15 today that

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.530
know much more than Bobby
Fischer knew 40 years ago just

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.030
because they've
played better games.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.780
They could travel around.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.010
They could watch the games.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.375
So chess is a perfect
match for internet,

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:19.750
because you can
follow the games.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.333
You can learn.

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:21.370
You can analyze.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.300
So there are many things you can
do that dramatically increase

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.662
the pace of learning
and getting to the top.

00:16:28.662 --> 00:16:30.370
DEMIS HASSABIS: So
you invented, I think,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.380
the concept of
advanced chess, right?

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.430
Man and computer.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.850
GARRY KASPAROV: Human.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.930
DEMIS HASSABIS:
Human and computer.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:35.805
GARRY KASPAROV: Sure.

00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:39.790
DEMIS HASSABIS: Human and
computer versus computer.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.850
Have you tried that recently
with the latest chess engines?

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.880
Is that still true now?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.780
GARRY KASPAROV: Yes.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.680
While licking my wounds after
Deep Blue match, so I thought,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.524
how about bringing it together
just out of curiosity?

00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:54.190
Because I said, wait
a second, if I just

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.760
can play with who is a machine,
just against another player,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.380
maybe we can play perfect chess.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.820
Now, the interesting
thing is when

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.240
we played this match
with Veselin Topalov,

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.940
another top player, in
1998, I can tell you

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.859
the quality was not very high.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.010
Because it was a
limited amount of time.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.040
And it was so new for us,
how to use the machine.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.310
And eventually, I realized--
and we had many events,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.349
so-called freestyle
events on the internet,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.690
that proved that--

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.500
it sounds quite ironic--

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.050
you don't need a
very strong player

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.010
to get the best result of
human plus machine combination.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.710
It could sound
like a heresy now.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:37.960
But I would say that you
don't want a strong player.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.820
You need a good operator,
a decent player,

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.180
but someone who will follow
the machine as you guide

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.670
the machine, but not
to use the machine

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.770
to back up his or her own ideas.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.440
Because, instinctively, if
I team up with a computer,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.180
I'll try to make my own moves.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.370
You don't have to.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.410
All you need is just to maximize
the effect of machine's play.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.760
Because machines are so
strong now all you have to do

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.870
is just to guide them.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.824
Sometimes you can feel, no,
just a slight correction.

00:18:07.824 --> 00:18:08.740
Move here, move there.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.140
So it's something that
requires very different kind

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.950
of qualities.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.750
It's more about interface.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.780
So you don't need a great
knowledge of the game.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.800
It may help.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.430
But on the other side,
it may preclude you

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.222
from sort of using
the machine's power.

00:18:27.222 --> 00:18:28.930
Because you'll try to
play your own game,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.186
which could be detrimental.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:31.560
DEMIS HASSABIS:
So it's something

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.712
that I think you touched
on in a few places,

00:18:34.712 --> 00:18:36.670
it's become known as
Kasparov's law now, right?

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.850
Something like it's where
the process is actually

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.200
more important.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.700
Do you want to
explain what that is?

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.700
GARRY KASPAROV: And
again, I relied on results

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.710
of the freestyle tournaments.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.490
And what's happened is
there, as predicted,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:54.370
a human plus machine beat
supercomputer quite handily.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.600
But the most unexpected
story was that,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.110
as I described, a relatively
weak human or group of humans

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.130
plus machine or machines plus--

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.740
DEMIS HASSABIS:
But a good process.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.110
GARRY KASPAROV: --a
better process, of course

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.830
they beat a supercomputer.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.850
More remarkably, they beat
a strong human plus machine

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.260
plus inferior process.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.000
So that's led me
to the conclusion

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.670
that it's all about interface.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:23.420
There's so many ways
of empowering machines

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.160
with our creativity.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.035
So not our creativity
with machine's

00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:28.160
brute force of calculation.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.800
Actually, you do it
other way around.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.025
And then the result is
it could be phenomenal.

00:19:32.025 --> 00:19:34.150
DEMIS HASSABIS: So it
strikes me in the whole book,

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.210
you're very optimistic about
technology in general in terms

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.400
of what it might be able to do.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.470
Is this kind of
process, is that a kind

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.020
of blueprint for an
advanced chess of how

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.840
you see things going forwards
in other areas of life

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.660
with machines and
humans working together

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.600
in a complementary way?

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.260
GARRY KASPAROV: I
believe the future

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.730
is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.280
And I cannot stand all this
doom and gloom predictions.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.780
It was quite amazing
when you just

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.190
look at the change of the
trend in science fiction

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:10.050
from '50s and '60s where
it was all about optimism,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.320
us teaming up with
computers, robots, cyborgs,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.230
flying not just to other planets
but to other star systems.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:25.780
And then it changed to
a very dystopian vision

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:31.120
of "The Terminator,"
and "The Matrix."

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.570
By the way, speaking about
"The Terminator," recently

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.390
I just got an idea of just
having a lecture in Dallas,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.940
Texas earlier this month.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.940
I looked at "The Terminator,"
I said, you know what, guys?

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.250
I can tell you that's
another proof of what

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.570
you call Kasparov's law.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.070
Because we all watched the
first one, human versus machine.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.250
But if you follow the
number two or number three,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.454
that was exactly what I
said, human plus machine

00:20:58.454 --> 00:21:00.370
plus a better process
beats the supercomputer.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.208
DEMIS HASSABIS:
With big machine.

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.670
It's very true.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:05.690
GARRY KASPAROV: Yeah.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.110
And I think what we
learned from chess

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.750
is that there are
many ways of us sort

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.930
of getting something
new, something positive,

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.070
out of this cooperation.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.890
And by the way, these things
are going to happen anyway.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.800
So what's the point of
trying to slow down?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.390
It's a natural cycle.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.710
We have technology
replacing certain elements

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.930
of human activities.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.940
For centuries,
technology was there.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.880
Machines have been
replacing blue collar jobs.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.350
Now, the difference
is now machines

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.240
are threatening
people with college

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.520
degree, political influence,
and Twitter accounts.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.810
That's why we hear all
the stories about it,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.440
but that's actually normal.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.600
I think that's called progress.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.940
And if machine's taking
over certain menial parts

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.220
of our elements or
aspects of convention,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.140
that's not the end of the world.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.430
There's still many things
that humans can do.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.770
All we need is just to
look for new challenges

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.015
and for new frontiers.

00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:06.640
DEMIS HASSABIS: So
we've just come back

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.490
from China for the AlphaGo
match against Ke Jie.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.890
And one thing that
happens in Go,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.931
which is slightly different
than chess, is in Go,

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:15.040
there's a tradition
of players thinking

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.290
about how far off
from optimal play

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.420
are they, theoretical
God play or optimal play.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.590
So how far do you think
even the top chess computers

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.712
are from optimal chess?

00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:26.920
I mean, what do you think
the top Elo rating would be

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.090
possible to play chess at is?

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.929
Do you have an idea?

00:22:30.929 --> 00:22:31.720
GARRY KASPAROV: No.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.710
I don't have an idea.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.190
Because as we briefly
discussed at lunch,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.320
when you look at the
endgame databases,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.880
now we have all seven pieces.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.100
That's 100 terabytes
or whatever.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:50.230
And so every position is being
calculated to the very end.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.990
And in many cases, you
just have a position

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:57.160
that says made in 492 moves.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.710
And I bet you that in
the first 450 moves,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.490
you will not see the difference.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.200
So I could see probably
420 moves, yes?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.020
Now, I don't know what it
tells about the game we play.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.480
Because the average
human game is 50 moves.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.600
Now, when you look at
average machine games,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.590
it's maybe 80, 90 moves.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.950
It doesn't mean that the
game should be too long.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.800
What we know, the game of
chess is ultimate endgame

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.580
of 32 pieces.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.270
So that's why I don't see
any chance in any future

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.900
that machine will
play E2, E4, and will

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.269
announce made in 16,755 moves.

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:33.310
It's not going to happen.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.460
The number of legal moves in
the game of chess, 10 power 45,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.490
that's enough to feel safe.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.204
But it's not about
solving the game,

00:23:41.204 --> 00:23:42.370
it's about winning the game.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.400
And I think there's
still some improvement.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.580
Machines could get
better and better.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.630
I mean, basically,
the sky is the limit.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.460
And today, I still think Magnus,
who was White in his good day,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.340
would probably secure a
draw against the machine.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.100
But winning against
a computer today,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.400
it's virtually impossible.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.140
The level of precision
that is required,

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.380
the level of vigilance,
just it's impossible.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.090
So we're not used to
play with such attention.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.410
So machines will get better.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.820
And by the way, we see an
improvement all the time.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.530
I remember this,
as well, by writing

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.420
my books, my great
predecessors, and then my

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.227
matches against Karpov,
and then my best games.

00:24:26.227 --> 00:24:27.810
And some of the
games, the same games,

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.980
analyzed two, three
years later was a just

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.120
new version of the same engine.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.110
And just I could see that.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:43.060
Some of the moves that I
treated as great in, say, 2009,

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.600
in 2012, was more
powerful computer.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.397
I had my doubts.

00:24:47.397 --> 00:24:48.730
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah, very cool.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.480
So, look, I've got so
many more questions.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.080
But I know I should
give some time--

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.484
the time is moving forward.

00:24:53.484 --> 00:24:54.150
So I don't know.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.830
I should let the audience
ask any questions.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.042
If you put your hand
up high so I can see?

00:25:00.042 --> 00:25:00.875
GARRY KASPAROV: Wow.

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:01.730
Total silence.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.570
DEMIS HASSABIS: We
covered everything?

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.320
Well, let me ask
another-- oh, one second,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.569
we have a question down there.

00:25:11.825 --> 00:25:14.637
AUDIENCE: So now, I
wanted to ask you,

00:25:14.637 --> 00:25:16.720
I was too young when the
Deep Blue match happened,

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.310
so I don't have any
personal memories of it.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.790
GARRY KASPAROV:
You're too young, yes.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.712
I can see.

00:25:19.712 --> 00:25:22.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.700
AUDIENCE: But when I
read stories of it,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.770
it kind of struck me
that the match seemed

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.820
like it had great publicity.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.380
But people really wanted to see
whether, well, to put it blunt,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.670
whether you would lose
against the machine.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.420
And I found this really--

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.950
my question is,
basically, do you

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.420
feel like this was the case?

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.090
Or do you feel it actually
felt like a normal chess

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.100
match, where people
would see who would win?

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.120
Or rather, do you feel like
you had support from your side

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.950
as well?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.210
GARRY KASPAROV: Oh, yeah.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.210
I had plenty of support.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.880
I can tell you that.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.490
Most of the people
who wanted me to lose,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.454
they were actually in
the world of chess.

00:25:59.454 --> 00:26:01.370
Because I was the world
champion for 12 years,

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.760
and that was the first
event I ever lost.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.120
So, naturally, a lot of people
wanted me to lose one day.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.660
And since I was
unbeatable in human chess,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.924
they had hopes in a machine.

00:26:14.924 --> 00:26:16.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.440
But the atmosphere
there was phenomenal.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.840
And it was a reflection of the
famous cover of "Newsweek,"

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.910
"The Brain's Last Stand."

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.700
And I remember when I won
game one of the match,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.350
it was a big celebration.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.690
I can remember on CNN,
the two presenters,

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.780
they talked about
it and said, it's

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.460
a Russian playing
an American machine,

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.038
but I'm rooting for a Russian.

00:26:44.038 --> 00:26:47.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.410
DEMIS HASSABIS: Any
other questions?

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.508
All right.

00:26:52.508 --> 00:26:54.870
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.550
[INAUDIBLE] from
the AlphaGo team.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.610
Humans seem to be more
efficient in playing both chess

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.630
and Go probably in that they
evaluate much fewer variations

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.210
and positions than
computers do, I mean,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.690
by many orders of
magnitude probably.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.580
Can you give us an
intuition of how

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.270
this difference can come about?

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.280
What are humans actually
so good at in chess

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.365
that they can do
this so efficiently,

00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:27.220
and that they only need to
examine so few variations as

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.390
compared to computers?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.880
GARRY KASPAROV: Now, we can
talk about general rules.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.800
But also you should
remember that there

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.480
are different playing styles.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.750
Because the way Karpov or myself
will look at the same positions

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.190
can be very different.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.180
Because I will maybe
look for an opportunity

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.180
to break through just
to sharpen the game,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.490
to create complication.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.660
And Karpov will be
looking for sort

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.550
of a long-term
strategic advantage that

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.240
could manifest in the endgame.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.630
Those are the differences.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.620
What brings us together
is that, as you just said,

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.180
we didn't have to analyze
millions of lines.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.280
We couldn't.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.870
So we could look for
one or two options.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.490
How do we know that those
two options are the best?

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.450
I don't know.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.660
I just simply know what it is.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:25.450
But, again, we had
another subtle difference.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.690
I will probably try to go as
deep as I can calculating.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.800
Karpov will try to
look for an option

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.550
where he doesn't have
to calculate at all,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.287
so relying on his understanding.

00:28:34.287 --> 00:28:35.620
Because there are many patterns.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.880
You can recognize patterns.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.379
And then bringing
patterns together,

00:28:38.379 --> 00:28:40.320
you can have a
picture, big picture.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.580
That's what humans
are unique at.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.290
And that's why, for instance,
if you team up with a computer,

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.720
sometimes if you
start calculating--

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.322
I wouldn't go there.

00:28:52.322 --> 00:28:54.280
And then it would be
quite interesting to check

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.100
whether the machine's
calculation proves it.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.670
But in many cases, I
think I'll be right,

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.480
especially at a time when
a machine goes very deep

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.000
and then reaches its horizon.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.240
And then you also should
look at the position and say,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:11.740
it smells.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.000
There's something wrong.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.500
I don't know exactly what is
wrong, but something is wrong.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.380
There are also situations
where you have to calculate,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.390
where you sacrifice something.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.440
You sacrifice material.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.480
And it's take it or break it.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.460
So you cannot afford to
use your common sense,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.410
because you have material down.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.450
So my game with Veselin
Topalov, another one I

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.840
played in 1999, that's
my longest combination.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.790
So I cannot tell you that
I saw every line there.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.110
It would not be true.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.990
But the combination,
the final position

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.200
that I saw like a
lightning, just very quickly

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:57.660
what will happen at the end,
included the 30 ply lengths,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.600
15 full moves.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.570
Ironically, because I saw
this, the final position,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.870
later the machine proved
that I could win earlier.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.550
And Topalov missed
the chance to-- not

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.790
to escape, but to have the
endgame that he could probably

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.130
defend.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.240
Otherwise, what you described
is just another proof

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.980
of the Moravec's paradox.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.790
That's the--

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:22.800
DEMIS HASSABIS: I was
going to bring that up.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.950
You should explain what
this is, because you

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:24.960
talk about that a lot in--

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.640
GARRY KASPAROV: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.100
DEMIS HASSABIS: --your book.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:27.820
GARRY KASPAROV:
Machines are very

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.361
good at what humans are not so
good and the other way around.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.280
It's interesting, chess was--

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.230
probably, because
Go and shogi, they

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.880
were just played elsewhere.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.700
But for the Western
science, chess

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.570
was an ultimate test for
artificial intelligence.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.880
And that was another
result of the 1997

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.740
match, the expectations of the
founding fathers of computer

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.960
science like Alan Turing,
Claude Shannon, Norbert

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.250
Weiner, that machine
beating strong chess

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.840
player and, of course, the
world champion, would be it.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.546
This is the moment for AI.

00:31:04.546 --> 00:31:06.200
I have to say they were wrong.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.320
So it was just this
people was as intelligent

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.790
as your alarm clock.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.545
They tend to go along, but--

00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:14.260
DEMIS HASSABIS: I
actually have a theory

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.350
about the Moravec's paradox
in explanation for that.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.600
If you have hand-built systems,
like Deep Blue was, then

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.700
as the programmers, you have to
understand clearly enough what

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.680
you're trying to
codify explicitly,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.200
so you can codify it in
the rules or heuristics

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.271
like Deep Blue was.

00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:32.020
And the problem is is
that for many things

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.440
that we take for granted
as humans, like vision

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.750
or riding a bike, all these
things we do implicitly.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.120
We don't explicitly
understand well enough

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.630
how we do those things.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.290
So we can't codify it.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.640
But that's why I think
that learning systems,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.140
the kinds of things
like AlphaGo,

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.550
might end up being
more powerful.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.920
Because they could
learn from experience

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.540
how to do those
things like humans do.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.650
GARRY KASPAROV: It's
one of the rules that

00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.200
are learned from my experience
is that anything that we do

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.880
and we know how we do,
machines will do better.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.380
Because we can communicate it.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.900
So it's, one way or
another, codified.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.552
So the big question is now
whether machines can ever do--

00:32:10.552 --> 00:32:12.510
DEMIS HASSABIS: The
intuitive, implicit things.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.290
GARRY KASPAROV:
--things that we do

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.330
without knowing how we do them.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.715
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:32:14.715 --> 00:32:15.470
No, exactly.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.990
That's the big question, right?

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.070
I mean, I think you
say in your book--

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.570
up till now, anybody who
attempted learning systems,

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.390
including your great
teacher Botvinnik,

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.582
fell short against especially
the hand-coded systems.

00:32:27.582 --> 00:32:29.790
GARRY KASPAROV: Oh, yeah,
50 years ago, 40 years ago.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.480
Because in the beginning,
there was a big debate.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.145
And I think Turing--

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:38.520
people know, by the way, that
he wrote the first program.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.210
In 1952, there was
a chess program.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.317
And the trick was that
there was no computer.

00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:47.150
It's the only game that
the Turing program--

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.550
DEMIS HASSABIS: He
wrote it by hand.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.010
GARRY KASPAROV: Yes, exactly.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.670
He put it on a piece of paper
and calculated the moves.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.694
And when I spoke
at the centenary,

00:32:54.694 --> 00:32:56.610
I asked my friends from
Germany, they actually

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.190
reconstructed it and
put it in a computer.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.510
DEMIS HASSABIS: How cool.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.080
GARRY KASPAROV: You can
actually play a Turing machine.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.592
Pretty weak, but it's from 1952.

00:33:04.592 --> 00:33:05.550
And that's interesting.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:10.800
They believed that the way
to make machines play chess--

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.080
it's not brute force
but understanding.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.110
But this concept
failed very quickly,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:21.310
because brute force kept coming
and was like an avalanche.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.190
They couldn't stand a chance.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.530
So that's why the old
attempts, including

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.930
one of my great teachers
Mikhail Botvinnik,

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:32.990
to come up with this parallel
concept of learning failed.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.380
And by the end of the '60s,
early '70s, the story was over.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.140
Now, it seems that we're
just like in seasons.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.990
We go back to this notion.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.680
And maybe it will
prove to be superior.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.346
DEMIS HASSABIS: Well,
hopefully, AlphaGo

00:33:46.346 --> 00:33:47.700
will make Botvinnik happy then.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.740
You know, it's sort of a
learning system, right?

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.122
So it turns out that
Go needed to happen.

00:33:52.122 --> 00:33:53.580
What do you think
the difference is

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.060
between Go and chess
that required Go to have

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.350
to have this other approach?

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.140
They couldn't do the
handcrafted approach.

00:34:02.827 --> 00:34:04.410
GARRY KASPAROV: It's
a tough question,

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.440
because I have near absolute
knowledge of the game of chess

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.310
and almost zero knowledge
of the game of Go.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:16.080
So from what I
know, it's that Go

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.090
doesn't have the same
tactical configuration.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:25.010
So it's all about strategy.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.670
It's a long-term.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:29.820
And that's why it's far
more difficult for machines

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.199
to learn how to do that.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:34.949
But also, if machines could
do it at a certain level,

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.600
that could be deadly for humans.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.989
Because they suddenly
become superior.

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.670
And, again, I'm not sure, since
I'm speaking to a great expert.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:49.409
I still think that relatively,
if you compare the strengths,

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.530
I think the chess playing
engines are relatively stronger

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.469
than AlphaGo.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:55.845
It's in absolute ratings.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.450
Just because the mistakes
made by human players in Go,

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.160
they are deadlier.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.310
They could offer more
openings for the machine.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:12.160
So in chess, the human
game is always unstable.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.070
So it's not as steady
as the machine.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:19.290
But I think in Go, the
depths of the mistake

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.974
could be far more
significant than in chess.

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.390
DEMIS HASSABIS: I guess we'll
have to put that to the test

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.640
by teaching AlphaGo chess
to play chess, right?

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.637
And then we'll see.

00:35:28.637 --> 00:35:30.720
GARRY KASPAROV: Ah, see,
that will be interesting.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.595
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yeah.

00:35:31.595 --> 00:35:35.070
GARRY KASPAROV: See how soon
AlphaGo can crush the strongest

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.240
chess engines.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.470
Again, it's what I said,
it's not about AlphaGo.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.730
But it's about the nature
of the game Go and chess.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.314
But you know--

00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:44.188
DEMIS HASSABIS: Would
you be pretty surprised

00:35:44.188 --> 00:35:47.001
if a learning system could beat
the hand-crafted system ever

00:35:47.001 --> 00:35:47.500
in chess?

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.760
GARRY KASPAROV: Look, that will
be another level of experiment.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.430
Because the current
systems, it's

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.400
not primitive brute
force anymore now.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.930
That's why I said, today--

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.680
and by the way, the
moment I say it,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.690
people just look
at me in disbelief

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.940
from nonprofessional audiences.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.966
I say, the free chess
app on your mobile phone

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:09.090
is stronger than Deep Blue.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.131
They say, ah, no, no, no.

00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:11.640
They say, you are sore loser.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.786
Yes, I'm sore loser.

00:36:12.786 --> 00:36:15.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.515
It doesn't change.

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:17.370
This is the fact.

00:36:20.651 --> 00:36:21.900
DEMIS HASSABIS: No, very good.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.130
So I don't know if
there's a last question

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:23.610
from the audience.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.860
We have time for one or two.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.680
Yes, from the lady at the front.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.136
GARRY KASPAROV: Wow.

00:36:28.136 --> 00:36:29.760
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yes,
at the front here.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.460
AUDIENCE: If you could, would
you play Deep Blue again?

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.551
GARRY KASPAROV: Oh, [MUMBLES].

00:36:39.551 --> 00:36:40.050
Yeah.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.481
There are a couple of problems.

00:36:41.481 --> 00:36:43.730
One, I'm retired, and I don't
play professional chess.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.980
Two, Deep Blue is dead.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.090
Yeah.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.310
I wanted to play in 1998.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:54.940
And I wish I had a chance.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.800
But that's it.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.340
You know, that's old history.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:05.180
It's spilled milk, water
on the bridge, you name it.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.300
But I played other computers.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.200
And as long as I was
an active chess player,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.050
I never ducked a challenge.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:19.630
And that's why this book
begins with the story of me

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:25.260
playing 32 chess
computers in 1985,

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.930
a simultaneous exhibition.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:35.990
I'm not sure, but anyone still
owns antique chess machines?

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.872
Anybody here?

00:37:36.872 --> 00:37:38.246
DEMIS HASSABIS:
I still have one.

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:39.060
GARRY KASPAROV:
You still have one?

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:39.484
DEMIS HASSABIS:
Yeah, I might have

00:37:39.484 --> 00:37:40.030
one called Kasparov's version.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.790
Yes.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.140
GARRY KASPAROV: So I played.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.740
It's 32 machines.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.840
And there were
four manufacturers,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.220
eight machines each.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.350
And I won all the games.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.780
Most amazing thing that
nobody was surprised.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.600
And I can tell you the progress.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.950
It's from that match in 1985--

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.350
I played in June, just
a few months before I

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.100
won the title beating Karpov--

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.360
to my match with Deep
Blue, just 12 years.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.460
It tells you that
something's happening.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.310
But I couldn't help
but reminding people

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.750
about this match in 1985.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.861
Because I say that
was the golden age.

00:38:14.861 --> 00:38:15.360
Yeah.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.151
Machines were weak.

00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:17.436
My hair was strong.

00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:18.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:18.524 --> 00:38:20.940
DEMIS HASSABIS: Yes, we're
entering another very exciting,

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.405
I think, interesting era.

00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:25.977
Look, let's all thank Garry
for an amazing discussion.

00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:27.060
GARRY KASPAROV: Thank you.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:28.860
DEMIS HASSABIS:
Thank you, Garry.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.160
GARRY KASPAROV: Thank you.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.010
DEMIS HASSABIS:
Thank you very much.
