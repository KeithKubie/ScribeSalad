00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.080
I think a lot about the contrast
between banality and wonder,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.050
between disengagement
and radiant ecstasy,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.950
between being unaffected
by the here and now

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.850
and being absolutely
ravished emotionally by it.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.850
And I think one of the
problems for human beings

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.200
is mental habits.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.240
Once we create a
comfort zone, we rarely

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.990
step outside of
that comfort zone.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.230
But the consequence of
that is a phenomenon

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.060
known as hedonic adaptation.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.510
Over stimulation to
the same kind of thing,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.770
the same stimuli again
and again and again,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.280
renders said stimuli invisible.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.820
Your brain has already
mapped it in its own head,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.550
and you no longer literally
have to be engaged by that.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.280
We have eyes, yet see
not, ears that hear not,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.954
and hearts that neither
feel nor understand.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.120
There's a great book called
The Wondering Brain that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.640
says that one of the ways
that we elicit wonder

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.330
is by scrambling
the self temporarily

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.220
so that the world can seep in.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.265
Henry Miller says
even a blade of grass,

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:15.630
when given proper
attention, becomes

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.540
an infinitely magnificent
world in itself.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.050
Darwin said attention, if
sudden and close, graduates

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.865
in surprise, and this
into astonishment,

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.870
and this into
stupefied amazement.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.690
That's what rapture is.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.510
That's what illumination is.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.290
That's what that sort of
infinite comprehending

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.210
awe that human
beings love so much.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.310
And so how do we do that?

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.480
How do we mess with our
perceptual apparatus

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.960
in order to have the kind
of emotional and aesthetic

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.227
experience from life that
we render most meaningful?

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.060
Because we all know
those moments are there.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.880
Those are the moments
that would make final cut.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.830
Only in these moments
we experience a fresh,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.020
the hardly bearable
ecstasy of different energy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.810
exploding on our nerve endings.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.240
This is the rhapsodic,
ecstatic, bursting forth

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.380
of awe that expands our
perceptual parameters

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.170
beyond all previous limits.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.700
And we literally have to
reconfigure our mental models

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.340
of the world in
order to assimilate

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.990
the beauty of that download.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.200
That is what it
means to be inspired.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.340
The Greek root of the term means
to breathe in, to take it in.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.535
We fit the universe
through our brains,

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:38.550
and it comes out in the form
of nothing less than poetry.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.970
We have a responsibility to awe.
