00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.760
Human beings are almost unique
in that they will entrain to

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.940
an external stimulus or sound.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.070
What this means is they'll
synchronise their bodily

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.120
movements with it.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.420
Like dancing - they'll tap their
feet or nod their heads

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060
in time with the rhythm
of music.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.200
In the natural world, humans
have a preferred speed, or

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.330
tempo, at which they
like to walk.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.930
And that's a bit like music,
which also has a tempo.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.490
But in the modern world,
everything's changing,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.740
including music.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.100
Live music is great, but there's
no point having a band

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580
if you're not all playing to
the same beat, which is why

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.140
orchestras have a conductor.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.900
For contemporary bands,
keeping the

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.800
rhythm together is important.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.710
Even bands that play live, such
as the Gorillaz, might

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.360
use samples or loops when
they're playing.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.600
And they use something
like a click track to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.970
keep them in time.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580
[CLICK TRACK CLICKING RHYTHM]

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.900
So the problem with the backing
track is that it

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.725
doesn't change, so the drummer's
forced to listen to

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:28.130
that to keep them in time.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.210
To try and solve this problem of
getting a computer sequence

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.040
to follow a drummer, the first
thing we want to do is give it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.950
something to listen to.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.130
So we put up microphones
on the drums.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.790
We've got a kick drum mic
and a snare drum mic.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.320
And we put those through
a process that's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990
called onset detection.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.860
It simply says when he actually

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.380
hits that drum - [DRUM HIT]

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.240
- and that gives us event times
of when they're hit.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.520
Then we have a click track from
the computer of where it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.680
thinks the bar and the beat
is, and the two have to be

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.280
compared to give it
a tempo output.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.540
What's complex is that the
drummer has a lot of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.600
techniques that you may not
ordinarily think of here.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.520
It's things like syncopation.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.690
He's putting beats or humming
in unusual places.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.490
And events can happen
early or late.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.680
That's part of the feel of
what a drummer does.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.810
A drummer isn't a metronome
robotically playing a pattern.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.620
They're putting accents and
moving the time around.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.230
So that really gives it
something complex in terms of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.820
the rhythm.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.450
And what I've had to do here is
try and create the best way

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.700
for the computer to understand
the information - almost to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.900
look around the beat, within a
window, and use the timing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.450
information it's getting to make
the best judgement it can

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.540
of what the tempo is, and
also not go wrong.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.670
The glorious thing about live
music is the ability to vary

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.570
things according

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.350
to the audience and
to your mood.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.217
So for example, you might want
to slow things down a little

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:11.560
bit - [DRUMMER PLAYING]

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.325
- or speed things up.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.070
[DRUMMER PLAYING]

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.380
Or you could get creative.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:33.090
[DRUMMER PLAYING]

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.940
Easy now, Dave.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.700
[DRUMMER PLAYING]

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.950
Alan Turing was a famous
mathematician and codebreaker.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.690
And in the '40s, he proposed
an experiment that sets the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.570
standard for what it might be
for a machine to be called

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.820
intelligent.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.680
This is if a person cannot
tell the difference in

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.150
conversation whether they're
talking to a machine or

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.600
talking to a person.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.430
And here, we're going
to apply the same

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.180
principle, but to music.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.380
We're going to ask David
if he can tell the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.710
difference between me tapping
and controlling a tempo and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.790
the computer controlling the
tempo by listening to him.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.899
I'm going to give
you two options.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.070
I'm going to flip a coin.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.500
And if it's heads, then I'm
going to tap and control the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.030
speed to match your drumming
of the music that you hear.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.690
And if it's tails, then the
computer system is going to

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.760
control the speed.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020
Both should feel like they
respond to you, so feel free

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.240
to try and experiment.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.910
Try and figure out which you
think it might be, and then at

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.370
the end of each piece, you
guess which control you

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.250
thought was in charge.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.730
Yeah?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.210
Yep.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.460
OK.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.640
The less able Dave is to tell
whether it's me or the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.680
software following his beat,
the better the software is,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.700
and the more highly it scores
on the Turing test.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.980
I repeated the experiment

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.730
eight times - four with me doing
the tapping, and four

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.980
with the software
doing the work.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.730
There were, actually, through
throwing this coin, there were

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.690
four times that it was the
tapper, me, and there's four

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.450
times that the machine
was controlling it.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.440
When it was the tapper, twice
you guessed the tapper

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.970
correctly, twice you guessed
the machine.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.830
When it was the machine in
control, you always guessed

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.540
the tapper.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.870
In which case, I'm pretty
happy with it.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.490
I'm happy with how it's
performed, and that really,

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.870
you can't tell the difference
on that.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.200
And it's an interesting test.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.330
Having music software that can
respond to human musicians is

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.180
a real breakthrough, and
could revolutionise

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.430
the future of music.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.680
