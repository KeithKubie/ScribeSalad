is there any other question yeah I'm
 

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.720
is there any other question yeah I'm
there resist go ahead about the dynamics

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.730
there resist go ahead about the dynamics
 

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.870
there resist go ahead about the dynamics
of this system so if one were to change

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880
of this system so if one were to change
 

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.530

which is a hormone that is secreted
 

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.620
which is a hormone that is secreted
before we go to sleep and it can also be

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:10.630
before we go to sleep and it can also be
 

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.590
before we go to sleep and it can also be
used to yeah for those kinds of problems

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600
used to yeah for those kinds of problems
 

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.389
used to yeah for those kinds of problems
and some people even use it for jetlag

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399
and some people even use it for jetlag
 

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:18.870

wasn't unknown at all and it was debated

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:02.680
wasn't unknown at all and it was debated
 

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.260
wasn't unknown at all and it was debated
for a long time whether it was a

something endogenous and they before

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.050
something endogenous and they before
 

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.450
something endogenous and they before
they started their work it was

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:12.460
they started their work it was
 

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.340
they started their work it was
understood that it was endogenous and it

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:14.350
understood that it was endogenous and it
 

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.140
understood that it was endogenous and it
was even understood that single genes

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.150
was even understood that single genes
 

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.690
was even understood that single genes
could influence the circadian rhythm but

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.700
could influence the circadian rhythm but
 

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.760
could influence the circadian rhythm but
nothing was known about the mechanism

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:20.770
nothing was known about the mechanism
 

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.680
nothing was known about the mechanism
and there were different hypotheses but

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:22.690
and there were different hypotheses but
 

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.770
and there were different hypotheses but
they found out the mechanism that

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.780
they found out the mechanism that
 

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.160
they found out the mechanism that
controls the machinery of the clock so

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.170
controls the machinery of the clock so
 

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.170
controls the machinery of the clock so

what were the key findings and who did
what yeah so first of all they studied

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:36.910
what yeah so first of all they studied
 

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.300
what yeah so first of all they studied
they used the fruit fly as a model

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.310
they used the fruit fly as a model
 

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.910
they used the fruit fly as a model
system and before their work there has

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:41.920

you identify mutants that arise due to

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.020
you identify mutants that arise due to
 

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.960
you identify mutants that arise due to
mutations in single genes so that was

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:54.970
mutations in single genes so that was
 

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.660
mutations in single genes so that was
sort of a basis before our laureate

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:57.670
sort of a basis before our laureate
 

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.950
sort of a basis before our laureate
started their work and they took

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960
started their work and they took
 

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.320
started their work and they took
advantage of that because the the gene

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:01.330
advantage of that because the the gene
 

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.080
advantage of that because the the gene
wasn't known there were mutant strains

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.090
wasn't known there were mutant strains
 

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.560
wasn't known there were mutant strains
known who had long or short or no rhythm

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:07.570
known who had long or short or no rhythm
 

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.450
known who had long or short or no rhythm
at all that were known to map to the

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:09.460
at all that were known to map to the
 

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.210
at all that were known to map to the
same locus so the laureates useless

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:12.220
same locus so the laureates useless
 

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.840
same locus so the laureates useless
surprised and went on to isolate the

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:15.850
surprised and went on to isolate the
 

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.970
surprised and went on to isolate the
gene and to determine what gene it was

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:17.980
gene and to determine what gene it was
 

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.070
gene and to determine what gene it was
but that didn't prove the mechanism

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080
but that didn't prove the mechanism
 

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.590
but that didn't prove the mechanism
either so what they then did was

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600
either so what they then did was
 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.210
either so what they then did was
experiments to understand the function

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:24.220
experiments to understand the function
 

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.700
experiments to understand the function
of the system by this gene and then

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.710
of the system by this gene and then
 

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.260
of the system by this gene and then
several others that they did in

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.270
several others that they did in
 

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.240
several others that they did in
sequential experiments why is circadian

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.250
sequential experiments why is circadian
 

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.780
sequential experiments why is circadian
rhythm important so we need the

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:36.790
rhythm important so we need the
 

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.750
rhythm important so we need the
circadian clock to anticipate the daily

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760
circadian clock to anticipate the daily
 

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.600
circadian clock to anticipate the daily
changes not only adapt but anticipate so

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.610
changes not only adapt but anticipate so
 

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.970
changes not only adapt but anticipate so
it's so there are dramatically different

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:44.980
it's so there are dramatically different
 

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.130
it's so there are dramatically different
conditions during day and night and we

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:47.140
conditions during day and night and we
 

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.990
conditions during day and night and we
need to be very active in the day and

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000
need to be very active in the day and
 

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.850
need to be very active in the day and
other processes need to take place

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:50.860
other processes need to take place
 

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.430
other processes need to take place
during night and evolutionary it's been

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440
during night and evolutionary it's been
 

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.610
during night and evolutionary it's been
a very great advantage to take to use

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:56.620
a very great advantage to take to use
 

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.660
a very great advantage to take to use
