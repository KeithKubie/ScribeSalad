00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.550
The sex addiction debate rages on.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.110
And that's not the only thing that's raging
on, ya feel me?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.930
No you don't.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.570
Hi folks, Laci Green here and you're watching
Dnews.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.660
At the very beginning of Dnews, back when
we were just a fetus, I did a video on sex

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.680
addiction and whether or not it's a real disorder.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.870
If you remember those days, you get a gold
star.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.170
Now, I'll let you watch that video if you're
interested, but today, I'm talking about a

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
new study, one of the first of its kind, that
shifts that debate.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.170
There's always a new study up in here isn't
it?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.800
The sex addiction study was published in the
journal of Sociaffective Neuroscience &amp; Psychology,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.570
and it looked at 52 men and women who have
trouble controlling their porn usage.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.240
The researchers hooked them up to an EEG and
monitored the neurons firing in their brains

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.420
while they various images.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.680
The images were divvied up into a few categories.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.020
There were pleasant sexual, pleasant non-sexual,
neutral, and unpleasant images.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.969
The study closely replicates how drug addiction
has been researched around the world.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.479
People addicted to alcohol, cocaine, heroine,
that kind of thing.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.439
In an addict, their brain gets all weird and
nutty when they're shown a visual stimuli

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.439
of their addiction.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.060
So that's what the researchers expected to
see if the sexy pics were to trigger addictive

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
impulses.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.810
But that's not what they saw.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.450
The EEG graphs came in and there's nothing
particular or special of the brain's response

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.520
to the images.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.649
The neuro activity didn't look like what you
would expect to see of someone who is an addict.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.109
It was no different than someone who has a
high libido.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.999
So, that's an interesting thingy.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.310
Does this mean that sex addiction has been
debunked for good and we can wave it bye bye?

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.310
Not quite.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.119
The study will need to be repeated and other
research teams will need to get the same results

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.409
independently before that's on the table.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.329
But this is a significant step.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.160
The researchers say these results alter our
understanding of what we're calling a sex

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
addiction.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.289
Possibly reframing it as an unusually high
libido.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.369
Which is an important difference.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.559
If it's a psychological addiction, that changes
the way we see normal sexuality.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.130
It changes treatment options and how it's
classified in the DSM.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.489
And FYI, the new DSM refrained from a yay
or nay on sex addiction as a disorder because

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.009
they say it needs more research.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.150
What's surprising to me is that, in all this
hubbub about sex addiction in the past 25

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.290
years, nobody thought, "Hey guys, maybe we
should actually try to study this."

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.430
Science, people.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.769
It helps you learn a thing.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.520
If this is all very confusing for you and
you're like, "Laci I have no idea what's going

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520
on!

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
Where am I?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520
What's sex addiction?"

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Just, shhhhh.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520
Watch my other video.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520
It's all going to be okay.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
Thanks for watching Dnews guys.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.020
We'll be back soon cause we update twice a
day.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.120
I'll see you then.
