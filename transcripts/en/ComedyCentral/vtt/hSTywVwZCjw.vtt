WAS REJECTED FROM WORKING
AT THE CLOTHING STORE

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.117 align:start position:0% line:85%

A JOB BECAUSE THE HEAD SCARF
VIOLATED THE RETAILER'S LOOK

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
POLICY.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.293 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHE WON!

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.828 align:start position:0% line:91%

DISAPPOINTING SHE WAS PUT IN

THAT POSITION BUT SHE WON.

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.398 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE STOOD UP AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION AND TRIUMPHED

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.035 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND AS A REWARDS FOR HER
BRAVE STRUGGLE I'M PROUD TO

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAY THAT SHE CAN NOW WORK AT
ABERCROMBIE &amp; FITCH.

COLOGNE SELLING PINK POLO
SHIRTS TO GUYS NAMED CHAD.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.462 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WINNING THE RIGHT TO WORK
IN A PSEUDO SEXSHOP IS A

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:40.333 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRIORIC VICTORY, BUT THAT IS NOT
THE BAD NEWS.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.668 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.842 line:91%
SHE WAS BASICALLY TRYING TO SAY
 TAHTI WHAT USE A CAN OF SODA AS

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.344 align:start position:0% line:85%
A WEAPON.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.412 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY, SOUNDS BAD.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.649 line:91%
BUT LOOK, YOU TAKE THAT SODA,
YOU ADD ALKA-SELTZER AND A

00:01:56.682 --> 00:02:03.055 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEAGULL AND YOU'VE GOT
YOURSELF A BOMB ON AN AIRPLANE.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.892 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I MEAN THERE'S-- THERE'S A
REASON THAT THEY DON'T LET

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.695 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU BRING SEAGULLS ON
AIRPLANES.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.264 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S-- WEIRD, WHEN THE
SEAGULL BLOWS UP AS ITS

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:20.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
 APPENDS AGES STAY INTACT...
JUST  THE FEATHERS...

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW YOU CAN AGREE OR
DISAGREE WITH THE AIRLINE

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.077 size:78% position:39% line:91%
POLICY OF DISTRIBUTION OF
UNOPENED CANS BUT ARE WE

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
REALLY SURE THIS IS
DISCRIMINATION.

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:30.149 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SHE ASKED THE MAN NEXT TO ME
WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DRINK,

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.418 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HE REQUESTED A CAN OF
BEER. 

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.121 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND SHE, I NOTICED THAT SHE
PLACED IT IN FRONT OF HIM

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.691 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT WAS A CLOSED BEVERAGE
CAN.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.761 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY, OKAY, SEEMS
LIKE A DOUBLE STANDARD.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.198 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT YOU THINK ABOUT T WHEN
HAS A WHITE GUY POUNDING

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:51.704 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEERS ON AN AIRPLANE EVER
LEAD TO VIOLENCE.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.541 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S JUST-- I'M BEING TOLD
ALMOST EVERY TIME --

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:57.043 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALMOST EVERY TIME.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.047 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT AS WITH ANY SITUATION
INVOLVING A MAJOR AIRLINE,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.116 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT COULD ALWAYS GET WORSE.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.719 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I ASKED THE PASSENGERS
AROUND ME, I SAID, DOES

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:07.954 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYONE WITNESS WHAT SHE JUST
SAID TO ME.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.923
I SAID HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
I WOULD USE IT AS A WEAPON.

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:14.827 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND THEN A MAN SITTING, YOU
KNOW, ACROSS FROM ME SAID

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.297 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU MUSLIM, YOU NEED TO SHUT
THE F UP.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.398
[AUDIENCE GROANS]

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:26.739 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS-- I'M SCOCKED AT
WHAT GOES ON IN COACH.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:27.406 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOY.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.574 align:start position:0% line:85%
AM I RIGHT?

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.143 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I MEAN IT'S-- CAN'T YOU JUST
SAY, CAN'T YOU JUST SAY TO

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:34.347 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE PERSON, COME ON, CALM
DOWN, THE SUNDAYS WILL BE

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.250 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:38.451 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRANK SINATRA!

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:42.722 line:91%
YOU KNOW, IN COACH HE'S STILL
DEAD, BUT IN FIRST, FLY ME TO

THE MOON.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, IF THERE WAS ANY
AMBIGUITY OF WHETHER OR NOT

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.693 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS INCIDENT HAD A
DISCRIMINATION COMPONENT,

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:49.495 align:start position:0% line:91%
OLD F-BOMB JOHNSON TOOK CARE OF
THAT.

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:52.431 align:start position:0% line:91%
AT LEAST NOW THE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT WILL SHUT THAT

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:54.700 align:start position:0% line:85%
DOWN.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO BYSTANDER
INVENTION.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.638 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO HIM

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.773 align:start position:0% line:85%
EITHER.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:04.677 size:88% position:44% line:85%

&gt;&gt; JON, ACTUALLY, THE
AIRLINE DID THE RIGHT THING.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.144 size:78% position:39% line:91%
YOU CAN'T RISK PASSENGER

ONE WOMAN'S CRAZY DEMANDS.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.069 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT THEN YOU ASK

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:08.007 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ANOTHER CAN OF SODA, 198
SODA CANS LATER, THE PLANE

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS YOURS.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:13.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, EVEN LESS IF IT'S A
COMMUTER FLIGHT.

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:16.048 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HASAN I DIDN'T REALIZE

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.689 size:75% position:38% line:91%
ANYTHING ON A PLANE IS A

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:24.690 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:28.260 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CORNER OF A DORITO CHIP
CAN SLICE THE NECK.

00:05:28.293 --> 00:05:31.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU THINK THAT SEAT CUSHON
IS A FLOTATION DEVICE?

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:33.599 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU  ARE WRONG, THAT IS A

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:40.005 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SEE A SKYMALL, I SEE A

PLANE.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:46.011 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE WAS WEARING A SCARF,
THAT IS ALL.

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:47.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AROUND HER HEAD.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.781 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:51.617 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SCARF AROUND THE HEAD IS
WAY SCARIER THAN SCARF

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.985 align:start position:0% line:85%
AROUND THE NECK.

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0% line:85%
BIG DIFFERENCE, OKAY.

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:56.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE
USING JUST A LITTLE PROP

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:57.890 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERE.

00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:59.825 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS A STANDARD SCARF
RIGHT HERE.

00:05:59.858 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS GOOD, OKAY.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:03.095 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS GOOD.

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:05.931 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT GOOD, OKAY.

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.933 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOOD, NOT GOOD, OKAY.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:08.701 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:10.803 align:start position:0% line:85%
FUN, SCARY.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:12.338 align:start position:0% line:85%

AROUND THE PLAZA.

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.979 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THIS IS AS I'M HERE TO KILL
AUDREY HEPBURN WHILE SHE

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:22.581 size:84% position:42% line:85%
GALAVANTS AROUND THE PLAZA.

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:25.551 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.353 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BUT THIS S LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, THIS IS AMERICA,

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.988 size:84% position:42% line:91%
FROM EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
LEARNED ABOUT AMERICA, WE

LOVE PEOPLE OF FAITH.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:31.924 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:35.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
IF IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.031 align:start position:0% line:91%

DEVIL WORSHIP, THEN RIGHT

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.579 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:55.414 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, SO ARE MUSLIMS
SUPPOSED TO HIDE THEIR FAITH?

00:06:55.447 --> 00:06:56.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS THAT THE IDEA?

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.717 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GREAT IDEA.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:02.121 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WHICH LEADS ME TO MY NEXT
SEGMENT, MINHAJ'S MUSLIM

MAKEOVER.

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:05.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT SAY REALLY
PRETTY GRAPHIC.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:06.358 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE IT?

00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.094
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE
BRANDING.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:14.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANYWAY STEP NUMBER ONE --
CHANGE YOUR NAME.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.235 line:85%
NOW -- THIS IS A SERIOUS THING.

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.337 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU ARE MOHAMMED, GO BY
MOE.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.476 align:start position:0% line:91%
SALOMON, SAL, FATIMA YOUR NAME
IS NOW CRAIG.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.211 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: CRAIG?

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.645 line:85%
 THAT SEEMS HUMILIATING, HASAN.

00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:27.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT IS.

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:28.614 align:start position:0% line:92%
CALL ME CODY, JON.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:29.915 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:32.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; STEP TWO -- IF YOU ARE A MAN
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW MY LEAD

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.154 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HERE AND HIDE YOUR BEARD.

00:07:35.187 --> 00:07:39.291 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE A
BEARD.

00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:40.826 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ON THE OUTSIDE.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:44.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY BEARD IS ACTUALLY ON THE
INSIDE OF MY MOUTH.

00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:45.564 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I'M CONSTANTLY JOKING, JON.

00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:48.868 line:91%
NOW, IF YOU ARE A MUSLIM WOMAN
FLYING ON A PLANE, THINGS GET

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.237 align:start position:0% line:85%
MORE COMPLICATED.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.538 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE GAME.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.473 size:88% position:44% line:91%
FIRST THINGS FIRST, YOU HAVE
TO GET YOUR HIJAB. NOW THAT

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:59.378 line:91%
IS GOING EXPOSE YOUR HAIR, SO
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THAT, TOO.

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:00.546 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.016
NOW THE NEXT STEP IS GETTING
RID OF ALL THOSE CLOTHES.

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:07.152 size:84% position:42% line:91%
REMEMBER, COVERED IN FABRIC
MEANS COVERED IN SECRETS.

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:09.021 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WEAR SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE AMERICA-LOVING. 

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:10.656 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT IS THE TICKET.

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:11.790 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THE TICKET.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.959 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW THAT IS A MUSLIM THAT ET GOS
AN UNOPENED CAN OF SODA.

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:15.192 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.
