JOHN MAYER: Thanks
very much, thank you

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.590
to Holly Manning for
helping to arrange this,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.520
and for others of you here today
who have helped arrange it.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.810
And I guess we just crossed
over into this afternoon,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.460
so this afternoon
I'll be talking

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
about personal
intelligence, and I'll

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.280
start with one big
idea behind this idea.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.800
If you're like me, you
encounter pretty much all

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.660
through your lives,
we encounter people

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.320
who advise us how to live.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.070
Philosophers, religious
figures, teachers,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.520
pundits, no matter where we've
come from around the world.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.800
Mental health
professionals, and life

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.410
coaches-- I suppose those are
a little bit more Western.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.220
But no matter where we
come from in the world,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.890
there are people
who want to give us

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.090
advice about how
to live our lives.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.720
And I wondered, what if there
were a common intelligence

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.930
that they used to understand
what they were saying?

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.200
A common logic that they drew
on to reason about people,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.860
and to understand people.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.650
Maybe to anticipate
they're using

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.220
some kind of common
intelligence that we

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.365
might call a personal
intelligence.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.540
So I'd like to start with
elaborating a little bit more

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.405
about this theoretical basis
for a personal intelligence.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.510
And I'll start with the idea
that we can't help but watch

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.880
people.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.030
No matter who we are, no
matter how shy we are,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.980
no matter how introverted
we are, by the way,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.042
I'm an introvert.

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.500
Even though I'm
really introverted,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.850
I can't help but watch people.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.000
We can't help but wonder
about the people who we see.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.470
For example, right now, I'm
so glad that you've come,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.230
and I'd like to
welcome you here,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.840
and I'm wondering
about all of you.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.050
May I ask a couple
questions of you all?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.220
I'm assuming you're pretty
much all from Google,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.006
but how many people
here are from marketing?

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:35.630
Or advertising?

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.920
How many people are from
the engineering area?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.170
OK, so I better talk about
personality in robots and stuff

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.750
like that, as part of the talk.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.520
How many people are from sales?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.720
OK.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.522
And did I leave out any areas,
is there some area I missed?

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:03.700
AUDIENCE: Editorial.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.730
JOHN MAYER: Editorial?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.980
How many people
are from editorial?

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.850
OK.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.730
Well great, welcome to
you all, and thank you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.660
for telling me a little
bit about who you are.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.510
But that's part of
understanding one another,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.860
and I tell this to my
students at the University

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.690
of New Hampshire too, usually
when I'm starting a course.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.850
They have already formed
an impression of me

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.852
from the first moment, even
from before I started talking.

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:33.810
In fact, the getting to
know you process really

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.550
begins finding out about
people's reputation sometimes

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.160
before you encounter them.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.290
So we can't help but wonder
about the people who we see.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.400
We watch people
wherever they are,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.310
and even things that look like
people catch our attention.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.620
So here are some sculptures by
Raymond Mason, or "Mah-sahn,"

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.280
and they just look like people,
but we can't help but look

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.970
at them.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.080
So now if I might, I'd like to
go into some ancient history.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.840
I'm going to go back
I think to 1988 or so.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.130
Now, you may have seen
this gentleman here,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.740
I know this gentleman was at
Google this past September.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.550
This is Professor Peter
Salovey, a colleague of mine,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.040
and now president
of Yale University.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.570
And I understand he
was somewhere in Google

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.160
in New York, speaking.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.440
But in 1998, sorry-- 1988, 1988.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.980
Peter and I had traveled to a
conference in social psychology

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.740
called the Nag's
Head Conference,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.060
and we were busy
working on a project

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.020
that we called Emotional
Intelligence, at the time.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.860
And to continue my
theme of people reading,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.980
you can already tell some
really important things

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.460
about my character, and
about Peter's character

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.280
I think, from this image.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.030
First of all, here I am,
wearing shorts and white socks.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.940
I'm the nerd, right?

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.850
And then Peter, we
didn't know at the time

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.710
why he was wearing long pants
at this hot, summer, North

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.400
Carolina location,
but we realize now

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.710
that he was aiming to
become president of Yale,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.250
and that's why he was
wearing the long pants.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.210
So if you can read
these clues, you

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.690
can figure out what happens.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.949
But actually, the
serious lesson in that

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.490
is, we didn't know
why he was wearing

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.360
long pants at that
time, and there

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.450
are a lot of clues that we
just, we don't understand,

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.000
and it may have nothing
to do with the fact

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.750
that he ultimately
became president of Yale.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:57.690
Now 1985, there were a
bunch of intelligences

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.220
that researchers were studying.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.260
Human intelligences that
researchers were studying.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.730
They included things
that I think many of you

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.740
have probably heard
of, you know what,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.770
can I just check,
how many people

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.670
have heard of
verbal intelligence?

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.290
How many people have heard
of general intelligence?

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.625
And of spatial intelligence?

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.400
Performance or
mechanical intelligence?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.240
They're sort of the same thing.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.850
That one's a little bit
less familiar to you?

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.350
OK.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.620
You don't have to know
what all these are,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.370
and I'm not going to
go over all of these,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.700
but I'm just mentioning
that in '85, these

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.860
were some of the intelligences
that were being discussed.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.690
Social intelligence?

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.190
OK.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.970
And then there were a
group of researchers

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.270
who were interested in
multiple intelligences as well.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.040
That is the idea that,
well that there's

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.720
more than just
general intelligence.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.730
So in 1990, there was
a grand organization

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.139
of accepted intelligences,
in which it kind of looks

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.180
like an organizational
chart, and you could think

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.550
of it as an organizational
chart, in which

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.940
general intelligence
is at the top,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.010
and then there are these
broad, important, intelligences

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.150
underneath, which include
spatial reasoning,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.420
and verbal comprehension.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.030
Those are the ones that
you're most familiar with.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.250
There were no what I would
refer to as newer intelligences,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.520
or well, that's probably
not the right word.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.970
But there was nothing like a
social intelligence in there,

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.650
and nobody had even heard
of emotional intelligence

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.420
at that time.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.130
So that was the
approximate status

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.100
of the field when I introduced
our 1990 Theory of Emotional

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.490
Intelligence with Peter Salovey.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.810
So in 1990, Peter Salovey
and I published this article

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.340
called "Emotional
Intelligence," and almost nobody

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.500
paid any attention to it.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.280
But the idea was, that people
have the capacity to reason

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.840
about emotions, to reason about
things like anger, sadness,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.650
happiness, and other
emotions, and could

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.160
use that to understand
one another.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.400
As I said, we published
this paper, we described it,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.070
and not many people paid
attention to it until 1995.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.400
And in 1995, a New
York Times journalist

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.720
named Dan Goleman, wrote
a book which covered,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.240
in part, our article.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.520
That he also entitled
"Emotional Intelligence."

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.530
And his account received an
enormous amount of attention.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.160
And people really
around the world

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.180
became very excited
and interested

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.730
in this idea of
emotional intelligence.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:01.380
But a few odd things happened
in that journalistic account

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:08.310
of our concept of emotional
intelligence, one of which

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.580
was that the book made an
enormous number of claims

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.220
about emotional intelligence
that Peter and I had not made.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.570
So there were claims
made around the book,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.960
I'll say around
the book, I don't

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.910
want to single out any
particular journalist.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.400
That emotional intelligence
predicted 80% of success

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.420
in life, for example.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.410
Well the original claim
was 50%, maybe as high

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.810
as 50% of the success in life.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.780
Then the claims rose higher,
80% of the success in life.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.850
Now Peter and I had
never made any statements

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.230
as to any-- we had not
quantified anything

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.650
about how important
emotional intelligence was.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.910
We just wanted to make
the point that we thought

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.210
it existed as a broad
human intelligence.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:03.640
That's a real key to
understanding our humanity.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.340
Because it meant that
instead of having

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.240
people who we might
label hopeless romantics,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.630
or people who think
with their hearts,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.370
that's an actual
reasoning was going on.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.290
The more interesting
thing to me,

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.040
and incredibly
frustrating thing to me,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.950
was that the concept of
emotional intelligence,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.000
which was really
focused on the ability

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.620
to reason with and about
emotions, became generalized,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:38.290
so that people said, and here I
will look at the actual quotes,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.940
that emotional intelligence
involved graciousness,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:51.060
super optimism, good networkers,
not too authoritarian, and then

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.980
another quote from
journalists, there's

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.210
an old fashioned word
for this body of skills

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.890
that emotional intelligence
represents, character.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.450
Well emotional intelligence
was none of those things.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.590
Emotional intelligence
involves the capacity

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.530
to reason with emotions.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.900
And so it's quite possible that
you can be very pessimistic,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.924
and be emotionally intelligent.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.340
And why should we pick on-- I
think the thing that I found

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.298
disturbing, is why should
we pick on people who

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:23.250
are pessimistic, maybe they've
had a tough upbringing already,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.851
and that says nothing about
their emotional intelligence.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.350
Emotional intelligence
is reasoning.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.160
At the same time, what
was fascinating about

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.500
it was people seemed
to need to broaden it.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:42.900
They really seemed to want
to talk about the personality

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.860
qualities beyond emotions.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.630
And I also resonated to that,
but in a more positive way.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.260
I thought well, of course,
I'm interested in that too.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.580
How do we think
about personalities?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.660
But Peter and I both
knew this theory

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.230
of emotional intelligence,
it wasn't powerful enough

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.660
to hold all of those
personality characteristics.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.967
And in fact, if you think about
reasoning about personality,

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:11.300
you should be able to reason
about personality no matter

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.200
what your personality is.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.140
And you may not decide
to become a let me see,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.760
a super optimist, or a gracious
person, or a good networker.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.820
You may decide to
become something else

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.560
if you reason with
your personality.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.840
So it didn't work.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.860
That broadening of the concept
in the media, did not work.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.680
It also didn't work from
a scientific standpoint,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.490
for reasons that I will maybe
talk about a little bit later.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.262
So there we were, we
had our hands full,

00:12:45.262 --> 00:12:47.470
it was actually kind of cool
that the journalists got

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.060
it a little bit off, emotional
intelligence a little bit

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.060
off, because that gave
Peter and I a very

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.139
nice job for the next
five or six years,

00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:57.680
we could travel all
around the world,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.710
explaining what emotional
intelligence actually was.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.420
And we had something fun
to say to people, I think,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.450
and that was very enjoyable.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.160
But meanwhile, what about
this personality issue?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.050
I mean, could there be
a personal intelligence?

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.670
Well, there were
a lot of reasons

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:22.070
why it wasn't really possible
to just turn around and publish

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:27.020
something, develop a theory
of personal intelligence.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.260
The first reason
was that in 1990,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.990
and in 1995, when the
journalistic accounts came up,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.340
many psychologists did not
believe that personality

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.090
was an important
system to begin with.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:48.190
There was a movement in
psychology, generally speaking,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.080
that people's behaviors were
all determined by the situation.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.640
And indeed, if you look at
our behavior in this room

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.700
right now, it is determined
by the situation.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.260
A number of you are sitting,
looking at me, listening to me,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:13.230
and I'm walking around, speaking
fairly louder than I usually

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.910
speak.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.420
If I did this at
home, my wife would

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.690
go, hey what are you doing?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.190
Right?

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.690
Or if I did this on the street,
you would think I was crazy.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.260
So the context,
situations really

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.450
do determine a lot
of how we behave

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.150
in one situation or another.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.700
And so there was this
concept of situationism,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.100
and there were
many psychologists

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.720
who said there's no
such thing as character.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.180
Who believed there is no
such thing as character.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.920
A second troubling issue
was that nobody understood

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:55.080
personality very
well in 1990, 1995.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.360
As a consequence really of this
belief that personality didn't

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.660
matter, and by the
way, I explain more

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.830
about the background of that,
it was a reasonable belief

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.230
to hold, as counter
intuitive as it is.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.646
I explain more about
this in the book,

00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:12.700
in the introductory
chapter, where

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.340
I'm talking about sort of
the context of all of this.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.020
Given that belief that
personality wasn't important,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.590
very few researchers wanted
to spend any time studying it.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.500
And so there was very little
good contemporary information

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.025
about how personality operated.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.150
Then I had some
personal reluctance

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:42.429
to propose the theory as well, I
was worried that it would seem,

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:44.720
kind of like, I don't know
if you know this expression,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.250
I guess it's an old fashioned
expression, like navel gazing.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.970
Lying around and
thinking about yourself,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.760
being just really self-absorbed.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.970
Would people think of
personal intelligence

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.880
as self absorption I wonder?

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.060
So these were some
of the impediments

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.710
to proposing a personal
intelligence back in the 1990s.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.410
Recently, I've
suggested that there

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.780
was a tipping point in
the field of personality

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.990
psychology in around 2007.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:25.110
And when I say 2007, I really
mean like, from 2000 to 2010.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.140
There were huge
changes in the field.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.890
There was an enormous
amount of data

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.920
that had been collected
about personality.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.890
So that, we knew a lot more
about how traits related

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.600
to one another across people,
a lot more about how people set

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.770
goals, effectively
or ineffectively.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.730
There was a consensus that
personality did matter,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.440
situations matter yes, but
personality matters as well.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.000
And so in the summer
of 2007, I was

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.116
working on a couple of different
papers, neither of them

00:17:01.116 --> 00:17:04.089
were going very well,
and then suddenly

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:12.130
this idea of a personal
intelligence came back to me,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:17.280
and I thought, well, you
know, now we know enough,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.339
I'll write the theory
up now, and let's see

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.869
if personal intelligence
actually exists.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:31.170
So in 2008, I published a paper
called "Personal Intelligence,"

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.599
I published it in
the same journal

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.890
that Peter and I had published
"Emotional Intelligence"

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.660
in earlier.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.400
Peter and I discussed
this, but by this time

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.350
Peter was provost at Yale,
and he was a busy guy.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.150
So I published the personal
intelligence paper,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.610
and I suggested that
there were four areas

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.040
that we use to reason
about one another.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.130
First, we pick up the
clues to one another

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.910
as we're looking at them.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.470
So for example, you picked
up clues to who I am

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.260
and to my behavior as
you've been watching me.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.290
Secondly, we form those clues
into models of one another's

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.670
personalities.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.285
That was the second area.

00:18:16.285 --> 00:18:19.920
Do we have a white
board here, would it

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.010
help to-- so clues to
people, the second area

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.520
was forming models
of what a person is

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.670
like, the third area is
guiding choices, both one's

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.020
own and others,
and the fourth area

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.390
is systematizing one's goals.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.960
So at this point in the talk,
I have a very nice picture

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.900
of my colleagues David
Caruso, and Abigail Panter.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.740
David Caruso and
I worked together

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.080
on developing the
Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.880
Intelligence Test, and
I contacted a professor

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.640
of what's called
psychometrics, which

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.450
is the study of mathematical
models of testing,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.380
named Abigail Panter, at
the LL Thurstone laboratory

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.730
at the University
of North Carolina.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.640
And I said, I've
got this new idea,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.820
and I know you guys
are busy, but would you

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.260
be willing to take a little
bit of time, and work with me,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.390
and see if we could
possibly develop

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.440
some measures in
this area, and see

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.140
if personal intelligence exists.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:51.550
Now it may seem-- I don't
know how intuitively clear

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.090
this is, it may be very
clear, it may not be clear.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.500
But to prove that an
intelligence exists,

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.670
that one of those
broad intelligences

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.590
that I was showing you earlier,
to prove that one of those

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.150
exist, you have to go
through certain stages

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.950
of empirical
research and testing.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.320
And the first is that you
have to create problems

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.460
that people can solve,
or fail at solving.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:24.200
So as I was writing the paper, I
started writing down test items

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.490
that I thought might be
difficult or easy for people

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.640
to answer.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.360
So for example, let's say
I tell you about a woman,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.160
and she prefers to
be around people more

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.030
than she prefers to be alone,
and she's also very talkative.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.491
Now I'm going to ask
you, so she prefers

00:20:47.491 --> 00:20:49.740
to be around people more
than she prefers to be alone,

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.390
and she's very talkative.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:57.510
Now I'm going to
ask you, is she A,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:05.450
anxiety prone and
fairly sensitive, or B,

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.784
full of energy and lively.

00:21:08.784 --> 00:21:10.700
And I won't go through
any other alternatives,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.460
we had other alternatives, but
I'll just stick with those two.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.560
Anxiety prone and
sensitive versus

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.930
full of energy and lively.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.330
So which would you say?

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:29.870
A, anxiety prone, or B,
lively and energetic.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.350
B. OK.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:36.910
So the answer there
was B. And the way

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:41.410
that we keyed the correct
answer, is we could-- by 2008,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.890
we could go back to tables
of which traits go together

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.520
in people, that had been
developed over hundreds

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.950
of-- well tens of thousands
of people by that time.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:22:00.680
And key the correct answers
to those questions that way.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.160
Now that's one kind of question.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.010
But here's another
kind of question,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.210
see if I actually--
well, I'll just-- which

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:18.540
goal is more likely
to work for a person?

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.510
To become a better
employee at work,

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:27.860
or to always tell the
truth to other people?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.660
A, all right.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.810
All right, A, right?

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.560
Now, when you think
about it though,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.940
and you're right,
again, A is the answer.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.670
I didn't do what I might do
if I had my full overheads

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.410
and stuff like that, which is
to go around the room and poll

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.660
people.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.210
But the first thing that
you notice when you do that,

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.240
is that there are differences.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.040
Some people pick B for
the second question.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.610
They think it's possible
to always tell the truth.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.880
And for the first question,
a certain number of people

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.420
pick A. They think that people
who are talkative and basically

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.840
sociable are anxiety prone,
more apt to be anxiety prone

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.730
and sensitive.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:23.030
And surely, there are people who
are outgoing and talkative who

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.390
are anxiety prone and sensitive.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.530
It's just that there
are more people who

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.170
are lively and have high energy.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.170
Now let me point out
another-- a key issue

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.870
with those two test items.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.210
They are very different.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.420
The reasoning is very different.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.900
In the first question,
I'm asking you basically,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.450
what have you noticed about
the people around you?

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.270
How can you describe
the people around you?

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.660
In the second question, which
asks about always telling

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.210
the truth, I'm
asking about what is

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.460
a plausible goal for
somebody to meet?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.010
Those are two very
different areas.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.150
We asked questions
in 16 different areas

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.120
in the first test
that we constructed.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.900
And the idea was,
our hypothesis was,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.840
if there is such a thing as
personal intelligence, then

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.460
people who are good at
any one of those 16 areas,

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.370
will be good at the other 15.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.500
On the other hand, there may not
be such a broad intelligence,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.480
and it could be that people
might be very good at noticing

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.000
traits, which social
traits go together,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.041
or socio-emotional
traits go together.

00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:54.790
And there might be
another group of people

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:59.750
who are really good at
solving questions about goals,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.120
and there may not
be much relationship

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.610
between those two
kinds of people.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:11.830
And at the same time, we
tracked verbal intelligence

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.770
as kind of a baseline.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.420
So we knew that this was not
a jumbled intelligence effect

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.300
that we were getting.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.260
Well I suppose I wouldn't be
speaking with you here today,

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.550
if it turned out that these
were all 16 different areas

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.980
of reasoning that were
unrelated to one another.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.460
It did in fact turn out
that the 16 areas, people

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.350
who are good at
some of those areas,

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.800
were good at the
rest of the areas.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.540
And what that allows
us to do, I think

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.160
is profound at several
different levels.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.610
It allows us to,
enlarge our knowledge,

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.680
enlarge our sense of
human intelligences,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.400
it allows us to understand
that there is information

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.740
about personality that
permeates our environments,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:20.090
and it also, this is maybe more
scientifically of importance,

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.240
it allows us to specify
what the reasoning is.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.930
Because although I presented
this to you rather simply,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.840
like all 16 areas work
together, and that basically

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.220
is the story.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.200
Since that time, we've been
building around those 16 areas

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.360
with new areas, and we find that
if we ask the questions in some

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.074
ways, people cannot answer them.

00:26:43.074 --> 00:26:44.990
Or it doesn't relate to
personal intelligence,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.180
but if we ask them in
other ways, it does.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.810
Now what does this mean?

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:57.090
What are the implications
of this in our daily lives?

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.260
Well, early on in
conducting this research,

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.410
I started to look at
biographies of people,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.790
to see if I could
locate individuals

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:10.780
who were particularly,
who exhibited particularly

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.300
high perception in this area.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.010
And one of the
biographies I encountered

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.820
was that of
Katharine Graham, who

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.230
is the publisher of
the Washington Post.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.240
And she has like five
pages in her memoir, where

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.086
she describes taking
over the Washington Post

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:31.585
from her husband, who tragically
had committed suicide-- who

00:27:31.585 --> 00:27:36.160
had led the paper, but
tragically committed suicide.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.790
And in this account, it's
so full of her models

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.270
of other people, her
understanding of herself

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:48.920
and her own reputation, that
it's really quite striking.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.940
The first thing
that she says, was

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.230
that people tried to
buy the paper from her,

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.850
and that made sense,
because she had never

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.900
run a business before.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.110
And so she's got that humility,
that self understanding,

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.330
she's never run a
business before,

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.579
she also has a very
good sense of her goal,

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:07.620
there was no way she was
going to sell the paper,

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.610
she said, not after what
her father and her husband

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.690
had put into it.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:18.150
By which I mean their effort
and their creative abilities.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.290
Then she said, she
started walking around

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.820
the halls of the
paper, which she owned,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.459
because she inherited it
from her father and husband.

00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:28.000
She started walking
around, she said,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.980
I realized people looked at
me-- I realized a lot of people

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.190
didn't care I was there.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.890
A lot of people looked at me
like an ignorant intruder,

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.170
and a few people were
interested in talking to me,

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.270
and maybe helping me out.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.870
And by the way, I'm
working no slides here,

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.260
no notes here, so this is
the gist of my recollection,

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.400
but it's pretty close, I think.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.320
Well I read that,
and I thought, that's

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.660
probably-- having
been an employee,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.320
and watched new bosses
come in, that probably

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.870
is the way people
were looking at her.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:09.570
And then she did something,
like several paragraphs

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.910
later, which again
amazed me, she said,

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.820
I started taking
over, and things

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.180
started to go well
for me, but I didn't

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.520
feel like I was living up
to what my husband had done

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.070
before me, and neither
did a lot of other people.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:27.990
And then, and this gets to
this forming models part.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.530
So she was getting clues from
how people reacted to her,

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.010
and the clues were not
necessarily very subtle,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:39.410
but some people miss even clues
to how people are responding.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.030
But in this forming
models point,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.920
she said, I realized I
had idolized my husband,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.670
I had idolized his leadership,
and of course when somebody

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:51.790
dies, we say all the wonderful
positive things about them,

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.830
so that's the tendency
to idolize rises.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.300
And she said, I realized
I could not become him,

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:07.820
and I couldn't reach that level
of becoming an idol myself.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.460
I had to start over again
and find my own style.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.560
And that's great, that's
both forming a model,

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.070
understanding that her
original model of her husband's

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.680
leadership might have
been exaggerated,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.360
and it's also guiding a choice.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.870
As a consequence, because I
cannot become what my husband

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.930
was, I have to start
over again with who I am,

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.080
and how I can lead.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.590
So that's an example, I think,
of how this capacity to reason

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.850
that we're able to now
isolate in the laboratory,

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.540
and track using this test of
personal intelligence, which

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.860
is called creative,
really creatively,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.400
the Test of Personal
Intelligence, or the TOPI,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.280
we can see that in the
laboratory on the one hand,

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.900
and then we can see
its consequences

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:07.920
for a person's life, in
situations such as biographies.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.610
If I might draw on
a second example.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.880
Yesterday I was at
the Rubin Museum,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.900
which I think is just several
blocks from here, yes?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.170
And I had the privilege
of interviewing a poker

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.840
player named Vanessa
Selbst, who's

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.630
one of the leading poker
players in the world.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:34.670
And as I interviewed her, I was
interested in kind of applying

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.740
some personal intelligence
ideas to how she thought

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.660
about her card game, I
should say, by the way,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.460
I know very little about poker.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.990
I was introduced
as knowing nothing

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.430
about poker, which isn't
too far from the truth.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.230
But I do know this
much about poker,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.710
it involves a variety of
different understandings

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.920
at the same time.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.890
So there is for example, this
statistical understanding

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.620
of the card game.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.090
And the statistical
understanding,

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.060
just to go back to that
diagram of broad intelligences

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.660
that we were talking about.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.810
That could come from either
of two different kinds

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.070
of intelligences.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.120
One is the verbal propositional.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.430
Because some mathematicians,
the engineers here,

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.680
because I know there are
a lot of engineers here--

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.200
a number of you probably work
with formulae a great deal.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.290
So you're masters at
manipulating formulae, using

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.990
formulate, and so forth.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:33.700
But there are some
of you who work

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.290
with a different intelligence
to solve math problems, which

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.300
is spatial intelligence.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.170
So you imagine,
if you are drawing

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.480
on spatial intelligence, or
some of you draw on both,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.220
in fact, all of you
draw on both, I'm sure.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:49.080
those of you who lean more
towards spatial intelligence,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.980
may manipulate geometrical
objects in your minds,

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.010
and get solutions that way.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.270
In fact, I had a
professor at Stanford,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:03.910
where I was a post doc,
and he would come up

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:05.970
with solutions to
problems completely

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.314
using spatial reasoning,
it seemed like.

00:33:09.314 --> 00:33:11.480
And then he would turn to
his graduate students, who

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.890
weren't entirely
happy about this,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.990
and say, OK, here's the answer,
can you please go prove it.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.410
And then they would
have to go, and go line

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.600
by line through the verbal
propositional proofs

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.940
to demonstrate what
he was imagining

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.470
in his head, which was great.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:30.710
I mean it did work out for both.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:34.870
But anyway, Vanessa is doing
that statistical calculation

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.120
as she is looking
at that poker game.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.506
She's calculating the
likelihood of different cards

00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:41.880
that people are
holding, and that

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.730
doesn't have much to do
with personal intelligence.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.880
She's also calculating
different wagers,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.240
the value of different
wagers she's making.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.140
But here's where the personal
intelligence comes in.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.960
She is forming models
of people, and what's

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.700
interesting about her models,
is they are very poker focused.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.010
So she doesn't
really care, I don't

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.820
think she would
mind my saying this,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.700
and this is my
characterization of it,

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.280
but there's a lot of
things for example,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.690
if you're trying to form
a model of your boss,

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.080
you want to know a
lot about your boss.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.540
She doesn't want to know
that much about the people

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.725
she's playing against,
she's got, I don't know,

00:34:19.725 --> 00:34:21.540
how many people sit
at a poker table,

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.305
I didn't ask her that
question, do any of you know?

00:34:23.305 --> 00:34:23.805
Sorry?

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.110
Three?

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.010
Three I heard, more?

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.260
Up to nine.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.980
OK.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.969
So some weren't like, she's
got let's say, five people

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.570
around her.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.670
She's got to form a model of
each of those five people,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.659
and as she said, I
hope I'm not giving it,

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.190
I don't think I'm giving away
any deep, dark secrets here,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.659
she said, if you're
a beginner at poker,

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.489
one of the mistakes beginners
make is that they talk.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:56.340
And she said, you should
never talk in my presence

00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:02.260
if you're a beginner because,
and she gave an example.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.040
I can't wait, I just saved
my money for two years

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.750
to join this tournament, and
I'm really looking forward

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.210
to playing with you all.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.770
She says, OK.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.410
So my model of that person
is now incremented, you know,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.690
n plus 1, for the engineers.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:21.110
I know that that person is
very unlikely to bluff early

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.810
in the game, because if
they were discovered,

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.820
they would lose all
their money, and they

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.870
would lose their part
in the tournament.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.290
So I know that if that
person starts wagering,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.050
they've got a good hand.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:32.550
OK.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.760
That's her poker limited model.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.360
She also looks at
socioeconomic status

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.030
of the people who
she's looking at.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.710
So if they seem wealthy,
she evaluates their behavior

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:47.440
at the table differently than
if they seemed less wealthy.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.020
And she has limits
on her-- she knows,

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.500
she's really quite
remarkable, she

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.960
knows the limits of
her mental models.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.870
She knows that a lot
of her mental models

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.110
work in the United States,
but if she's playing overseas

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.800
in London, and if she's got
foreigners at the table,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.140
her models won't work
well enough for her

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.850
to use in guiding
the way she gambles.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.510
So that's a very different
kind of personal intelligence

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:17.781
than Katharine Graham used,
but it's personal intelligence

00:36:17.781 --> 00:36:18.280
nonetheless.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.960
It's a very utilitarian
personal intelligence,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.220
that she uses for those
moments when she's gambling.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.770
And I assume, I
didn't ask her, I'm

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.960
sure she uses personal
intelligence in other areas

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.990
of her life as well,
maybe more broadly,

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.620
when she's deciding
to get married

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.200
or whatever, she's
going to evaluate

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.760
her partner a lot
differently than that.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.910
So, had I my slides here,
I would invite you all

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:53.060
to take a test of personal
intelligence with me,

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.880
but I don't have
them here, so I can

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.250
invite you to go online, to
personalintelligence.info,

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.220
personalintelligence, all one
word, dot info, or of course

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.970
you could just Google
it, and it would,

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.540
and it actually comes up first.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.270
And on the banner
navigation bar, is the quiz.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.010
And so after this
lecture if you like,

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.780
you can take the quiz
if you're interested.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.910
I will say a few
things about the quiz.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:26.480
Our tests are about
140 items in length,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.940
because we're serious
about our measurement,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.990
we want to give people
accurate feedback.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.600
You cannot give people accurate
feedback by either asking

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.060
people, oh how good is
your personal intelligence?

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.510
Because everybody's
above average.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.300
On average, people
are above average.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.820
And so we set them
problems to do.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.820
But anybody here,
how long did you

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.200
stay in school to
get a job at Google?

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.500
Some number of years, right?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.470
Some number of years.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.060
You do not learn
an area quickly,

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.870
and it is not possible
to measure your aptitude

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.470
in an area quickly either.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:11.360
Which is why the SATs
are four hours long,

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.480
and our test has to be-- well
we're measuring one sub area,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.900
our test is about 40
to 45 minutes long.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.070
So when you do
that quiz, it just

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.120
shows you how the test works.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.090
It doesn't really give you much
of an answer, because as I say,

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.966
those items are too short to do.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:41.510
So to sum up, I think
that personal intelligence

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.870
is really important, because it
tells us the logic that people

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.670
use when they reason
about personality.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.760
I'm kind of a lazy person
in certain respects,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.260
and all those people giving
me advice throughout my life

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.050
is difficult for me, because
it's a lot of different things

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.470
to remember, and I
do notice that there

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.850
are repetitions that run through
them, which help me remember,

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:12.250
kind of like, follow what
you're interested in, one which

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.490
is very high in
personal intelligence,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.220
but I really don't
like is, I can't answer

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.820
that question for you, you
need to make up your own mind.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.830
I hate that, like when I'm
asking what should I do,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.080
and people say, well
that's really up to you,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.840
like, go, go away.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.966
But that's got high
personal intelligence,

00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:34.590
because the answer is, I mean we
have to guide our own choices,

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.230
only we know how we are inside.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.060
And so, I'm very
excited that we've

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.990
uncovered this new
area of reasoning,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:49.200
and I think also it has to
come back to that robot issue,

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.430
it has applications
in engineering

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.310
as well, soon after
Peter and I came out

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.450
with emotional
intelligence, I don't

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.970
think I'm remembering
her first name correctly,

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:05.120
but I think her last
name is Breazeal, at MIT,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.460
created Kismet,
a robot who could

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.790
perceive emotions
and express emotions.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.610
And I noticed in the front
page of the Wall Street Journal

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:19.950
today, there's an article
about how at Carnegie Mellon,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.360
there's a person
there who's developed

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.240
a robot that or rather
artificial, an expert

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.210
system that plays Scrabble,
and the expert system

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:35.220
has the advantage of making
rude comments to other players

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.800
while playing, so as to gain
some kind of an advantage,

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.130
and to cover up, actually,
for its less than superb

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.960
Scrabble playing skills.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.480
So I think probably as we
understand personality more,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.780
and we start deciphering
the exact rules, which

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.200
is to me the most exciting part
of understanding personality

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.150
that people employ,
that may have

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.950
some practical
applications as well.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.850
So I want to thank
you very much,

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:06.175
and I'm very open to questions.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:16.788
Yes please.

00:41:16.788 --> 00:41:18.780
AUDIENCE: This is a
really great topic,

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.270
so thank you so much for
coming here and talking to us.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:24.756
I've got two quick
questions, so you

00:41:24.756 --> 00:41:27.987
know when you talk about
personality, a lot of people

00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:29.990
say how malleable
is personality?

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.013
Surrounding like, time,
situation, and your need

00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:34.314
to change, you have to adapt
to different situations,

00:41:34.314 --> 00:41:37.200
are you changing your
core personality?

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.790
What are your thoughts on that?

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.530
And then a follow
up question is,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.060
do people with higher
emotional personal intelligence

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.475
have a higher degree
of self awareness?

00:41:45.475 --> 00:41:48.340
If they are able to see
maybe others clearly,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.860
do they see themselves
more clearly?

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.310
Or is there no correlation?

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.270
JOHN MAYER: OK.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.040
So the first
question, and this is

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.994
going to require
some concentration,

00:41:58.994 --> 00:42:00.410
so if I forget the
second question

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:01.580
I may come back to you.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.850
But the first question is how
much can personality change?

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.230
And I believe
personality can change,

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.340
I think I've changed
my own personality,

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.080
I think I've watched
other people change.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.490
A few years ago I had braces,
because I had braces as a kid,

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.410
but my teeth didn't,
it didn't take,

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.270
my teeth got crooked again,
so I had to have braces again.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.040
It took like three or four
years to get my teeth straight

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.010
the second time, and I
think with personality,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.250
one of the issues
if it's something

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.390
core about your
personality, it may

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:39.670
take a few years to guide
yourself into a new place,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:44.010
but I do think it's
quite possible to do.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:45.425
Your second question was--

00:42:49.774 --> 00:42:50.690
Self awareness, right.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:56.800
Yes, I think that
people are-- I think

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.030
people have an enormous
advantage if they are higher

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.610
in personal
intelligence, in becoming

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.000
self aware for a couple reasons.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.280
First of all, I
mentioned in 2007,

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.470
I was working on several papers
that didn't work well together.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.660
The reason was, one was
actually on self understanding,

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.570
and the other was on
understanding personality.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:19.560
And I realized in the midst
of that, oh, you know,

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.320
you can't do one
without the other.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.880
Like, if I don't know the
difference between somebody

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.930
who's an introvert, who
likes to spend time alone,

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.800
and somebody who's shy, who
might prefer to spend more

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.400
time with other people,
but is anxious doing so,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.870
how am I ever going to use
those labels accurately

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.990
as applying them to myself.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.820
So that's one advantage, is
that, we have to understand

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.860
personality in general,
which is why I call

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.622
it personal
intelligence, in part,

00:43:49.622 --> 00:43:51.080
we have to understand
it in general

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.180
to apply it either to
ourselves or to others.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.030
But the other, as I was writing
the book, another thing that

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:04.230
really, surprised
me, because I thought

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.760
I was sort of done with
the theory, but in the book

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.840
I learned all kinds
of new things.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.900
And very instructed
by the people

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.800
whose examples are there.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.830
If you're defensive, sorry--
if you're low in personal

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.770
intelligence, you don't know who
to trust and who not to trust,

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:24.450
and who is accurate about
personality, and who isn't.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.520
So you are in a position
of not being able--

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.430
and people say all kinds
of things about us, right?

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.330
And some of it's true
sometimes, and some of it

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.460
isn't at all true.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.250
And so one of the hard
things about taking criticism

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.750
and feedback, is you have to
sit there, and of course nobody

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.060
likes criticism and
feedback, and you

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.360
have to sit there and go,
oh darn it, is that right?

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.730
Could I be a
controlling bastard?

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.670
Or whatever.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.010
Could that apply to me?

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.320
And we think about
that for a while,

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.120
and we go, you know, I think
there might be a germ of truth

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.640
in that, because I can see it
in this spot, and that spot,

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.389
and the other spot,
and plus somebody else

00:45:04.389 --> 00:45:05.930
said that to me once too.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.500
But if you're low in
personal intelligence,

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.940
you hear that and you
go, well I don't know,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.400
that could be as
much off the wall

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.170
as what that person
said to me yesterday,

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:15.940
I don't know whether
it's true or not.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.740
So I'm not going to
take it seriously.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.630
And you're in that
existential position

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.970
of not knowing whose
advice, whose feedback

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.260
is accurate or not.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.450
Because sometimes
people say things to us

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.840
that are completely wrong.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.750
And we have to be able
to know which is right,

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.150
and we have to be able
to know on reflection,

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.104
and thinking about it, which
is right and which is wrong.

00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:43.780
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.330
JOHN MAYER: Yes,
please, Matthew, right?

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.580
AUDIENCE: You mentioned sort
of practical applications

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.180
and things like artificial
intelligence systems

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.980
and [INAUDIBLE],
and you did tell us

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.800
where we can go and take
the test, I'm wondering,

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.408
it almost sounds like you be
better having everyone else's

00:45:58.408 --> 00:46:02.270
test answers walking into the
room, so that you can apply

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.960
that out, what are
the like, lower level

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.630
first steps of personal
application of getting

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.204
the results of the test.

00:46:11.204 --> 00:46:13.620
JOHN MAYER: Sorry, can you
clarify just a little bit more?

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.120
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm wondering
like, if you go and you find

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.640
out that you have
a certain skill set

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.860
in this personal
intelligence, how can you

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:25.120
apply that back onto yourself
to change parts of your day

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.475
to day life that you might
want to tweak or improve.

00:46:29.475 --> 00:46:30.100
JOHN MAYER: OK.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:35.880
So I think one way to look at
that question is, how can we

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.910
learn more, how can we gain more
knowledge about personality so

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.130
as to be able to
reason with it better.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.020
And my first line of
defense, I realize

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.690
it sounds self serving, in
answering that question,

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:50.240
is to say, take a look at the
book, because that's actually,

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.775
that's one of my joys
in working on the book,

00:46:53.775 --> 00:46:55.650
was to be able to look
at a lot of people who

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.150
are high in personal
intelligence,

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.550
and think about those people as
role models for how to do it.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:04.610
Now ultimately, I'd like
to see there be curricula

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.770
that teach us about personality.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:09.970
But the other way that
I hear your question

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:15.100
is asking, if there's a
part of my personality

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.000
that I want to tweak, how
do I go about doing that?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.601
And I think that the steps
involved in that are probably

00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:24.350
first, are you sure
you want to change it,

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:28.700
because it is time consuming,
like when I got my braces,

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.850
my dentist and some other
dentist, the orthodontist,

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.290
were having a debate as to
whether I should have braces.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.900
And I think, start that debate.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.080
You can ask people who
you trust and know,

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.580
hey if I changed in
such and such a way,

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.530
would that make me a
better person, or would

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.470
you like, relate to me
better, if I were that way,

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.290
and if they say yes, then I
think the change process itself

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:57.840
is a matter of self coaxing, and
having very low expectations,

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.222
and realizing that
you're going to fail--

00:48:00.222 --> 00:48:02.180
and I'm saying this out
of personal experience.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.920
When I try to change
something in myself.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.870
OK, it's not going to be
tomorrow, it's going to be,

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:10.270
I'm going to try this out
for a year very gently,

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.741
month after month, and I'm going
to backslide, but kind of lean

00:48:14.741 --> 00:48:15.240
it that way.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.156
Does that help at all?

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.240
How about one, two, and three?

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:23.788
Go ahead.

00:48:23.788 --> 00:48:24.704
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.980
JOHN MAYER: Well
intelligence, researchers

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.730
think of intelligence
as an aptitude.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.320
But I think it's possible
to improve your functioning

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.750
with whatever personal
intelligence you have.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:47.950
And I like to draw the
analogy of most of us,

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.040
no matter how good or
bad at math we are,

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.330
we usually use textbooks
to teach us about math.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.080
So same way with
personality, it doesn't

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.057
matter, as long as we
have a reasonable amount

00:48:58.057 --> 00:48:59.640
of personal intelligence,
we can learn

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.800
some amount of, if you will,
personal intelligence algebra,

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.730
from the experts.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.271
There are few exceptions
sorry, it just

00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:10.396
comes to mind, I can't
help-- John Stuart Mill, who

00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:15.130
had a recorded IQ of 210,
reports from his tutors were,

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.337
that it would be
easier for him to solve

00:49:18.337 --> 00:49:20.420
the problem mathematically
and derive the formula,

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.904
rather than look
it up in the book.

00:49:21.904 --> 00:49:23.820
So it said that he was
able to solve most math

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.590
problems without
reference to the book.

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.990
But most of us
refer to the book.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.130
And so-- whatever
book that may be,

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:34.034
and so I think that's
the better way to do it.

00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:35.700
Now, did I miss a
part of your question?

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.320
No, OK.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.820
Yes?

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.804
AUDIENCE: From a
marketing perspective

00:49:39.804 --> 00:49:44.268
in your book, [INAUDIBLE] you
want to measure something,

00:49:44.268 --> 00:49:46.490
you usually want to measure
something to improve it.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.406
So you talked about the
Stanford professor who

00:49:48.406 --> 00:49:50.780
has the high spatial
intelligence ability,

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.759
and you alluded to having some
of these examples in your book,

00:49:54.759 --> 00:49:57.513
could it be some of these
emotional intelligence heroes

00:49:57.513 --> 00:50:00.510
are people that we would
look up to, and want

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:05.238
to be like, and therefore want
to take this quiz so that we

00:50:05.238 --> 00:50:07.070
can improve ourselves,
and be like them?

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:11.040
JOHN MAYER: Well first,
your premise, if I may.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.600
There are intelligences that
I'm not particularly good at,

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.730
and I just go, OK.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.140
There are a lot of
broad intelligences,

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.380
I don't got 'em all,
I don't have them all,

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:25.320
and that's all right with me.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.300
So one of the points I
try to make in the book

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.430
is that, you can do
this as a voyeur,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.620
without necessarily
needing to go there.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:39.260
But if you were interested
in that, some of the people

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.280
who, there are a lot of
different people, some

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.370
of the public figures that
I talk about are people

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:56.880
like Oprah Winfrey, gosh,
who is the Michael Jordan,

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:03.830
a all the people are, hang
on, I have them on a slide.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.080
Yeah, Katharine Graham, Oprah
Winfrey, Michael Jordan,

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.370
David Carr of the New York
Times, Sydney Blatt of Yale

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.600
University, and
research participants

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.760
in dozens of
ingenious experiments.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.290
That's a short list of some
of the people who are there.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.870
Other questions?

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.750
Yes, oh right, sorry.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.060
AUDIENCE: So with
emotional intelligence,

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.672
I think there are like
four key pro tips right?

00:51:27.672 --> 00:51:30.580
So you got the self
awareness, I think

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.063
it's situational awareness, I
can't think of the third one,

00:51:33.063 --> 00:51:34.896
and then it's like,
relationship management?

00:51:34.896 --> 00:51:37.810
JOHN MAYER: Yeah, that's
the journalistic account,

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:38.706
that's not our four.

00:51:38.706 --> 00:51:41.080
That's not the four that Peter
and David and I work with,

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.050
but that's OK, I can go
there with you, so go ahead.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.860
AUDIENCE: So would
you say that the four

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.550
concepts of personal
intelligence map in parallel,

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.640
or is it more so mapped
to one in particular?

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.250
JOHN MAYER: Well these four
are different than either-- I

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:01.300
think the issue with
the broadened emotional

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:06.280
intelligence model, is
that model emphasizes

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.740
having a certain personality.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:13.710
And that personality is good
social relationships, optimism,

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:17.180
persistence, zeal, you probably
know them better than I do.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.930
But there's a long
list of qualities

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.720
you're supposed
to develop, right?

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.570
I think that's wrong.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:26.580
I think you can have, and
we know from our research,

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.720
that people of all
different personalities

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.350
can be high or low in
personal intelligence.

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:35.380
And in fact, the
personality that you

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.600
want to develop-- well
first of all, some of it,

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.940
it's set to some degree, I
mean we have some genetics

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:47.720
and learning, you know, 10,
20, 30 years of background

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.890
that's formed our
personality as it is.

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:52.800
So I'm more of a kind of-- to
go back to the poker analogy,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.100
you've got your hand, what's
the best way to play it,

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.150
kind of person.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.370
How can I be the most high
functioning pessimist ever?

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:11.560
How can I be completely
oblivious to social cues,

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.620
but still have people
like me, and respect me,

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.950
and want me to be around.

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.240
So I think that's more of
the personal intelligence

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.427
model I'm talking about.

00:53:22.427 --> 00:53:23.260
Any other questions?

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.250
Thank you very much.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:31.290
Thanks, thanks very
much for coming.
