00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Right, so let's go back to, to 20 questions that we

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.460
talked about a number of lectures ago. And we're going to consider the following

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.904
analogy. That in, in some sense, what is a, what is a

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.460
learner? What is an inductive learner trying to do? It's trying to find

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.680
the best hypothesis in some class H. And the hypotheses all map

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.520
input to yes or no. Let's say that what we're trying to do

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.560
in twenty questions is, deal with our hypothesis class H, which is maybe

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.505
a set of possible people. And so, these are the possible answers to

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:28.210
the 20 questions problem. And, X is the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.120
set of questions that you can actually ask.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.110
So X, they're kind of like training examples. That's

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.630
how the learner's getting information about what the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.270
right answer is. But no question, in and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.720
of itself, might actually be sufficiently revealing of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.220
what the hypothesis is. All right does that,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.630
does that analogy make sense to you, Charles?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.570
&gt;&gt; Makes perfect sense to me.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.160
&gt;&gt; All right, good. So, now let's think about two

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.760
different cases. One where the teacher is going to try to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.440
select which questions to ask. So the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.960
teacher's going to say to the student, here's

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.350
the question you should ask me next. To try to figure out which person

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.360
it is, as quickly as possible. And then we'll, next we'll look at what

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.788
happens if the learner's the one asking

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:03.720
those questions. So in some sense, it doesn't

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.950
seem like it should make a difference, because, you know, in either case, the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.270
learner is going to ask the question and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.580
the teacher is going to answer truthfully. Just in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.500
one case, the learner has to come up with the questions, and in the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.820
other case the teacher has to come up with the questions. So why, why are

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.910
these different from each other? What does

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.840
the teacher have that the learner doesn't have?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.120
&gt;&gt; Well, the teacher actually knows the answer.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.850
&gt;&gt; Indeed. Alright, so let's let's just do a quick

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.120
quiz and say, how many questions are necessary for a smart

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.340
learner to figure out the right person, assuming that the teacher

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.150
is the one who gets to feed the learner good questions?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.660
&gt;&gt; Go.
