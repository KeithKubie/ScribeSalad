00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
James Grime: A new proof has been announced which they claim is the largest proof ever.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
It comes in two parts. The first part is this. This is part one.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.420
And part two is 200 terabytes large. That is huge!

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.520
I'm gonna start with something simpler, something perhaps you can try yourselves.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.640
This is the idea. Let's take the numbers 1 to 9. I'm just gonna draw them out in a grid, here.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.580
Imagine these are the number 1 to 9. I'm not gonna write the numbers in quite yet.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.060
Now I'm interested in a+b=c.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.780
These are gonna be whole numbers, and I"m gonna have a+b=c. That's not a difficult equation.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.700
I want them to be different, so let's have a&lt;b&lt;c.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:00.480
Can I color these numbers, 1 to 9, using red and blue, so I don't have a+b=c all the same color?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.740
I don't want them to be all red or all blue. That's something I want to avoid.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:13.300
So let's try to see if we can. Let's start with 1 as a red. There's no reason why not. And let's have 2 be a blue.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.700
This means 3, it's 1+2... Well, that's okay. We can pick a color. It could be red or blue.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520
Brady, you can pick if you want. Do you want to be red?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.320
Brady: Let's make it red.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.720
Yeah, ok, fine. So we'll have 3 in red. Well, that's interesting because now we can make some deductions.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.640
3 is red, 1 is red, so 4 can't be red. That's what we're trying to avoid.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.160
We don't want them all to be the same color, because then we would have a+b=c all the same color.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.120
1+3=4 would all be red. That would be something we're trying to avoid.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.860
That means 4 is gonna be blue. Let's write 4 as blue. Great.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.200
Well, that's something we can use as well. 2 is blue, 4 is blue, 6 will have to be red. Let's put 6 as red.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.440
Well, that's interesting now, because we've got...

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.640
1+6=7. We're trying to avoid it being red. It'll have to be blue. Let's make it blue.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:19.640
6+3, those are both red, so I'm gonna have 9 as blue. We're doing okay so far, don't have a problem.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.560
Oh, but wait. There is a problem.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.980
Because 2+7=9, and they're all the same color.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.240
Oh, no, I messed up. I didn't do it. I failed here. This has failed.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.880
Well, there's lots of other ways of coloring in the numbers 1 to 9.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.800
In fact, each number has two options, red or blue, so it's gonna be 2 to the power 9. That's 512.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.860
So there's 512 ways you could color this in.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.680
It's not very hard for you to convince yourself that you're always going to fail, it's always going to end up with something like that.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.960
Or you could just check all the options, if you want. You could check the 512 options

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.900
and you'll see that it's not possible to avoid a+b=c in the same color.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.840
That's what this problem was about, but they took it one step further. They were interested in a²+b²=c².

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.580
And they wanted to color in the numbers using red and blue just like we did before,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.480
but they wanted to avoid a²+b²=c² being the same color, so all being red or all being blue.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.360
Now, you might recognize a²+b²=c². That's Pythagoras's theorem.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:53.580
But we're interested in whole-number solutions for this. A solution might be 3²+4². That is actually equal to 5².

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:05.220
Shall we just check and see if that's a solution? 3²=9, 4²=16. Add them together, 25. Great because 25=5².

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:17.100
Another solution to this might be 5²+12²=13². That is another solution that just uses whole numbers.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.740
These are called Pythagorean triples. They're not particularly rare. In fact, the ancient Greeks knew how to make them.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.580
I'll show you how to make a Pythagorean triple, if you want.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:40.800
You just take two numbers, m and n, and what you do is... a=m²-n². So we're assuming m is the bigger one.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.640
b=2mn, and c=m²+n².

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.040
And that is a Pythagorean triple. All you have to do is pick two numbers and you can generate a Pythagorean triple.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.660
There's an infinite number of them, absolutely. So, this is a well known thing. This is not a mystery.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:09.880
But the mystery now is, can we color in the integers using red and blue so that we don't get a Pythagorean triple in the same color?

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.320
So, imagine we have a blue set of numbers and a red set of numbers,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.820
and the red set do not contain a Pythagorean triple, and the blue set do not contain a Pythagorean triple.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.320
Now, there's lots of ways you can color your numbers. Is there a way to avoid this problem?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.440
This is called the Pythagorean Triple Problem.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.240
Now, this is an application of something called Ramsey theory.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.780
Ramsey theory is about finding structure in large numbers of objects.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.980
So, if you have a large number of objects, is a structure unavoidable, is it inevitable?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.200
Can you avoid this problem?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.100
Now, the answer is no, you can't avoid it.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:06:05.200
So, what these guys have shown is that this is a solution, coloring the integers from 1 to 7824.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.040
They've split them up into red numbers, blue numbers, and you see the white squares, perhaps?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.940
The white squares represent numbers that could be red or blue and it doesn't matter, it would be a solution either way.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:27.060
But when they took it one step further and they looked at coloring in the integers from 1 to 7825,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.320
that's when it failed. That's when they showed that it can't be done.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.320
In fact, you're always gonna end up with a Pythagorean triple in the red set or in the blue set.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.980
This number, 7825, is the straw that broke the camel's back. It's the last item on Buckaroo. It's the thing that broke it all down.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:55.320
The reason 7825 broke the solution is because it's in two Pythagorean triples. Here they are.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:16.660
625² + 7800² = 7825² and 5180² + 5865² is also equal to 7825²

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:26.220
So what they found is that when they looked at the solutions for 7824, you look at all the possible solutions,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.000
625 and 7800 were always the same color. They were either... Let's say they're blue.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.520
And these numbers, 5180 and 5865, were always the same color and the other color. They were always red, perhaps, in this case.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:53.440
Which means 7825 now has to be red and blue at the same time, which is not possible, and the whole thing fails.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:02.200
In the 1980s, our friend Ron Graham actually offered a prize for the person who solved this problem, the Pythagorean Triple Problem.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:10.520
He offered a $100 prize, which he has now delivered to one of the computer scientists at the University of Texas.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.660
He's delivered the check. He's paid up.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.760
So, to show that this is a solution for 1 to 7824,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.100
to show that is a solution, and to confirm it's a solution, takes seconds on a computer. It's not very difficult to do.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:37.740
But to show that there are no solutions for 1 to 7825, and he checked every possibility, would take a massive amount of computing time.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:48.000
The number of ways you could fill those in, when each integer has two options, would be 2 to the power 7825.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.740
And that number is so massive, well, you could take a supercomputer... it would take too long for a supercomputer to check.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:04.720
Imagine all the supercomputers in the world, and imagine them checking all the possibilities since the dawn of time, since the Big Bang,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.320
you still won't be able to check all the possibilities. So that's not what they did.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:18.760
What they did is they used some clever mathematical tricks to reduce the number of things they had to check.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:29.880
They boiled this down to about a trillion things that they had to check, and that took them about two days using a supercomputer in the University of Texas.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:39.140
The only problem really with this type of proof is it doesn't increase our understanding of why this is true.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:46.780
What is special about the number 7825? Why that number?

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:56.320
These kind of proofs that require this huge amount of computation does not tell us anything about why something is true.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.780
And there is a conjecture that this will always be true no matter how many colors we use.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.980
We might use three colors or four colors.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:14.240
Now, that number's gonna get larger and larger, and the amount of computation it takes to find where it fails is gonna be bigger and bigger.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.000
But to find a proof that shows it's always true, that's probably gonna take traditional mathematics.
