some of the stuff behind I'd be lying if
I said I didn't feel that was totally

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
I said I didn't feel that was totally
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.340
I said I didn't feel that was totally
true especially with something as heavy

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350
true especially with something as heavy
 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170
true especially with something as heavy
as the story of Moses but I also

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
as the story of Moses but I also
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.910
as the story of Moses but I also
understand the need to appeal to a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920
understand the need to appeal to a
 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.220
understand the need to appeal to a
general public and like I said I think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
general public and like I said I think
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.620
general public and like I said I think
they work it in pretty well so I stand

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
they work it in pretty well so I stand
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.949
they work it in pretty well so I stand
by it

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
by it
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.259
by it
well at least by the songs I do feel bad

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269
well at least by the songs I do feel bad
 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.569
well at least by the songs I do feel bad
this movie is not more appreciated and

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
this movie is not more appreciated and
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.670
this movie is not more appreciated and
maybe it is because Ten Commandments was

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
maybe it is because Ten Commandments was
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.770
maybe it is because Ten Commandments was
just such a landmark and even though

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780
just such a landmark and even though
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.599
just such a landmark and even though
this is a good film yeah it's probably

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609
this is a good film yeah it's probably
 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.210
this is a good film yeah it's probably
not really a landmark in any way at

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
not really a landmark in any way at
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.129
not really a landmark in any way at
least not the way that most people view

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139
least not the way that most people view
 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.740
least not the way that most people view
cinematic landmarks but I still think

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
cinematic landmarks but I still think
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.840
cinematic landmarks but I still think
it's a good strong film better than 10

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850
it's a good strong film better than 10
 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.759
it's a good strong film better than 10

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950
and I think the story of Moses deserves
 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.349
and I think the story of Moses deserves
to be told from a different point of

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
to be told from a different point of
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.839
to be told from a different point of
view and this is a very smart point of
