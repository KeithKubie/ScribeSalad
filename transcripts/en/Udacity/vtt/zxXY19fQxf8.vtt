Not only do chromosomal translocations happen, not only

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.410
can you swap genetic information actual genes in

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.200
frame to get fusion proteins, but there are

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.980
certain kinds of translocations that are known to happen

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.070
on a regular basis. A very famous one

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.160
that results in something called the Philadelphia chromosome is

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.820
actually chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and chromosomes

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.540
22. There is a gene in chromosome 22 called

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:33.120
BCR, and another gene on chromosome 9 called A B L or ABL. What happens

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.260
is the tip of chromosome 9 here can actually break off, and this end from

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.180
here down on chromosome 22 can get

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990
broken off, and these pieces get swapped. This

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.710
large chunk here gets put at the end of chromosome 9. So if I highlight this

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:59.610
here, it's now down here. And this tiny region, ABL is over here. So the gene

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.830
ABL was the edge of the breaking point, and the gene BCR was the edge of the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.080
breaking point. And now the ABL and BCR genes are right here next to each other,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
and they produce a fusion protein called BCR-ABL.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.210
As you can imagine this fusion protein is abnormal

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.150
activity, and the result is a form of blood cancer called chronic

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.620
myelogenous leukemia or CML. Amazingly, there's a drug that can

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.440
inhibit this unique protein and treat patients suffering from this chromosomal

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.430
aberration. Scientists brought us a long ways people. This is pretty cool.
