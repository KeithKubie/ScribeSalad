So, if I did this about 18 times, do you think you'd get it right most of the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.200
time? Well you probably would, but now I want you to try it with help from Greg

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.170
and me. So here's your standard line. I want you to tell me which line you

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.968
think is closest in length to the standard line I showed you. I think it's this

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:16.524
one.

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:18.392
&gt;&gt; I think it's this one.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:20.752
&gt;&gt; Type in the correct letter in this box.
