00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.770
BRADY HARAN: OK, everyone.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.740
Prepare yourselves for two of
the most extraordinary dice

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.870
rolls you have ever seen
on Numberphile.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.510
But before that, it's time for
some more one-roll Yahtzees

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.700
from Numberphile viewers.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.890
First of all, there's this
one from Justin and Ryan.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.120
[BOTH HOLLER]

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.750
BRADY HARAN: They get massive
bonus points for the I love

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.370
Numberphile body decoration.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.340
But the question I have is did
the other guy, the one who

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
didn't roll the Yahtzee, also
have I love Numberphile on his

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.760
chest, just in case he was the
one that got it first?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.580
RYAN: Boom.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.446
JUSTIN: 2,363.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.240
RYAN: Boom.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.480
RYAN: All 4's, [BLEEP].

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.610
Woo-hoo!

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.696
LUKE: We're gonna try
to roll a Yahtzee.

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:53.670
VICTORIA: Yeah.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.700
For you, Brady.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.580
We're going to roll
you a Yahtzee.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.160
We're going to get this
on the first shot.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.778
We promise.

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:01.590
OK.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.265
Attempt number one.

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:05.690
Oh, shoot!

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.580
LUKE: Well, it wasn't Yahtzee.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.530
VICTORIA: OK, it was a 1.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.940
LUKE: Ah!

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.360
You got four 1's and
then a 3 then.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.340
VICTORIA: On the very first
try, I got four--

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.030
actually, here.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.860
Let's do four of a kind.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.730
LUKE: That's too complicated.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.190
VICTORIA: No, no.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.560
I want to see how many times
we get four of a kind.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.430
LUKE: Look, we're being
so organized.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.580
BRADY HARAN: Now here
are some more.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.000
Just a reminder, each person
has a 1 in 1,296 chance of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.250
rolling a Yahtzee.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.230
ANDREW: Dad!

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.660
Look at these!

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.620
BRADY HARAN: This one comes from
our friends in Holland.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.410
MARTIJN: Yes.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.500
Oh, yeah.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.700
BRADY HARAN: And OK, here's a
quick little moment for all

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.770
the people that used software
or computers and didn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.590
actually roll real dice.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.820
Not exactly the spirit of
what we're doing, but

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.300
you get geek points.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.290
Brett here includes some lovely
graphs with his video.

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:03.672
BRETT: Yes!

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:08.300
BRADY HARAN: Only 55
rolls for this one.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.220
Sometimes when people roll a
Yahtzee, they don't quite

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.970
realize they've done
it-- like this.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.280
PERRY: 81 rolls.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.930
Holy cow!

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.180
BRADY HARAN: And this.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.467
SETH: Oh, shoot!

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:26.717
BRADY HARAN: And this.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.208
This video came from Iceland.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.176
HAUKER: [CLAPS LOUDLY]

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.630
RUSSELL: Yessss!

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.040
BRADY HARAN: This Popsicle
stick counting system

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.320
definitely caught my eye.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.240
JORGE: So I know the odds for
rolling a one roll Yahtzee are

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.270
about one in 1,296.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.860
I only have 1,000
Popsicle sticks.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.700
Oh my God.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.780
Oh my God.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.595
BRADY HARAN: And how's this
for cool as a cucumber.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.270
JAMES: There we go.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.890
Five 2's.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.190
BRADY HARAN: Compared
to this somewhat

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.900
more animated reaction.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.356
TEHCUBEDUDE: Oh, oh, [BLEEP].

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.610
We got it.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.090
TEHCUBEDUDE'S FRIEND:
Yeah, [BLEEP]

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.530
[BLEEP]

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.290
[BLEEP]!

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.620
[BLEEP]

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.114
yeah.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:19.608
[DOG BARKING]

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:21.090
TEHCUBEDUDE: Aaaahhhh!

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.584
[DOG BARKING]

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:22.078
TEHCUBEDUDE'S FRIEND: Yeah.

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:22.572
Yeah!

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:23.070
Got a Yahtzee!

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.098
TEHCUBEDUDE: Now I don't
know what to do.

00:03:26.098 --> 00:03:27.535
TEHCUBEDUDE'S FRIEND:
We got a Yahtzee.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:28.972
TEHCUBEDUDE: You're
full of [BLEEP].

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:29.930
That did not happen.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.305
TEHCUBEDUDE'S FRIEND:
Yes it did.

00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:32.112
TEHCUBEDUDE: Holy [BLEEP].

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.780
TEHCUBEDUDE: I got a Yahtzee.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.255
That was 592.

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:37.550
592 rolls.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.310
I don't know if I counted--

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.910
592 or 593 rolls.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.610
BRADY HARAN: Now not everyone
who's tried has been

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.460
successful, but you can
still send in the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.860
videos, like this one.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.285
VICTORIA: We have a kind
of lot though.

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:49.760
[GASP]

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.710
Yahtzee!

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.254
Oh my God!

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:56.170
(IN SLOW MOTION) We have
a kind of lot though.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.142
[GASP]

00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:58.610
Yahtzee!

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.066
Oh my God!

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.880
LUKE: We got it.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.760
VICTORIA: That was so quick!

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.660
I was expecting this to
take like two hours.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.220
It only took like, OK--

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.160
5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 36 tries.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.579
And we only had two
four-of-a-kinds before that.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.440
But only 36 tries.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.460
It took us, like, four minutes
and should have

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.734
taken, like, two hours.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:23.851
So we are freaking lucky.

00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:24.767
Nice.

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:27.070
BRADY HARAN: Now poor old Lukas,
he missed the moment he

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.020
rolled his Yahtzee.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.860
I think his camera stopped
recording.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.750
But don't worry, Lukas.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.960
We believe you.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.680
LUKAS: All right.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.450
I rolled a 5 Yahtzee, but my
camera stopped recording.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.470
LUKAS' FRIEND: He did
it 362 times.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.560
LUKAS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.250
362 times.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.700
LUKAS' FRIEND: He's going
to try again.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.742
LUKAS: Yep, I'm going
to do this again.

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:55.718
How much time?

00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:57.206
How much time has it been?

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:57.702
LUKAS' FRIEND: Mmm.

00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:58.694
LUKAS: How much time?

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.182
LUKAS' FRIEND: Mmm.

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:01.432
Nine.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.910
LUKAS: Ha-ha!

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:07.770
NICK: [GASP]

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.020
I did it.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.470
MIKE: [GASP]

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.400
I did it.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.710
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.780
Now for those two amazing rolls
I was telling you about.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.950
This first one comes
from James.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.150
Now he upped the ante by not
using a six-sided dice but

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.440
using five 10-sided dice.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.610
Now you'll hear his wife asking
something about the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.470
washing machine.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.282
But James, he's on the
brink of greatness.

00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:35.091
LAURA: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:35.568
JAMES: Yeah.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.953
LAURA: Can you check to see
if the washer's ready?

00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:39.384
JAMES: Yeah, babe.

00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:41.580
3,440.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.910
Oh my God!

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.200
Laura!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.120
It just happened!

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.790
It just happened!

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.730
On 3,440!

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.610
7, 7, 7, 7, 7.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.400
Holy [BLEEP]!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.945
BRADY HARAN: And even the cat
now gets in on the action.

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:57.920
JAMES: My quest is done.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.390
[CAT MEOWS]

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.846
JAMES: Exactly, cat!

00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.135
[CAT MEOWS]

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:04.770
JAMES: Yeah!

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.380
And yeah.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.390
3,440.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.530
Magic number.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.330
BRADY HARAN: And finally, well,
I think this is the most

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.860
amazing roll of all, and it
comes from Seth who was

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.570
featured earlier in this video
rolling a Yahtzee.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.325
And I think this is so amazing
I'm going to play it twice.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.700
SETH: Are you kidding me?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.100
Are you kidding me?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.890
BRADY HARAN: Now if you want
to watch some of the other

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.010
viewer Yahtzees on the previous
videos, I'll put the

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.800
links below the video
and on the screen.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.340
You can also see me
rolling a Yahtzee.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.730
if you want to roll one
yourself, send me the video.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.620
You can upload it to YouTube
or send me the file.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.610
Email address.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.530
And if you've watched all the
Numberphile videos so far, why

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.800
not check out 60 Symbols?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.450
It's my physics channel.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.450
I think you'll like
those films, too.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.485
VICTORIA: So we just rolled a
Yahtzee a few minutes ago, and

00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:03.980
we decided that we're going to
try to roll it one more time

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.100
and see if we can do two
in a row, because--

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.575
how epic would that be?

00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:08.825
So let's try.

00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:13.250
OK.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.590
So this is lucky two-in-a-row
Yahtzee.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.890
Come on, universe!

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.080
LUKE: Huaaahhh.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.280
VICTORIA: Noooooo.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.530
LUKE: Awwwwwwwww.
