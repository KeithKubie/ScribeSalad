00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.180
Let's say we had the reaction
molecule A plus molecule B is

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.260
in dynamic equilibrium with
molecules C plus D.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.550
Which just means that the rate
of the forward reaction is

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.840
going at the same rate as the
backward reaction, or the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.740
reverse reaction.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.510
There will be some equilibrium
concentrations of A, B, C, and

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.320
D, and we can figure out
what the equilibrium

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.580
constant is if we want.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.730
And I'll say it again.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.710
I've said it like four
times so far.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.840
The fact that the forward
reaction rate is the same as

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.150
the backward reaction rate
doesn't mean that all of the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.350
concentrations are the same.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.980
The concentrations themselves of
each of the molecules could

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.090
be very different.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.500
They're just not changing
anymore because the forward

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.960
and backward rates
are the same.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.070
Now, given this, given that
we're at equilibrium now,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.140
what's going to happen if I
add more A to the system?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.100
So remember, it was
in equilibrium.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.400
The concentrations
were constant.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.410
But now all of a sudden, I'm
adding more A to the system.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.750
So now, the odds of an A and a
B particle, even though I'm

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.520
not adding any more B molecule
to the system, the odds are

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.910
slightly higher that an A and
a B are going to collide in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.580
just the right way, so the
forward reaction is going to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.570
be more likely.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.585
So if we add more A to the
system, you're going

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:20.440
to have more A's.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.850
They're going to bump with
more B's, so the B's are

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.510
actually going to go down
a little bit, right?

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.250
Because more B's are going
to be consumed.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.960
And even more important, the
C's and D's are going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.100
definitely be increased.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.360
And the way it would really
happen, you would add more A.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.160
Those A's would bump into some
more B's, and so this forward

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.570
reaction, all of a sudden, it's
rate would go faster than

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.650
this backward reaction.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.540
So the reaction would go
in that direction.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.590
Then you would have more C's
and D's and maybe some of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.810
those are more likely to bump
and go back in this direction.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.960
Eventually, you would reach
a new equilibrium.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.330
But the bottom line is you'll be
left with more A, a little

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.810
bit less B because you
didn't add more B.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.820
So more B's going to be used
to consume with those extra

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.960
A's you just added.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.580
And then those are going to
produce more C's and D's in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.539
equilibrium.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
And you can imagine, if you
added more A and more B, let's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.390
say if you added more B as well,
then the reaction is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.450
going to go in the forward
direction even more.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.350
I don't think this is an amazing
insight of the world.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.440
I think this is kind of obvious,
that if you stress

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.910
this reaction by adding more on
this side, that naturally

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.170
it's going to move in
the direction that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.610
relieves the stress.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.010
So if you add more A, you're
going to have more A's bumping

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.260
with B's and go in that
direction and maybe consume a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.140
little bit more B's.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.220
If you add more of both, the
whole thing's going to go in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.820
that direction.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.730
Likewise-- let me rewrite
the reaction.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.650
A plus B, dynamic equilibrium,
C plus D.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.380
If I add more C-- I think you
get the point here-- what's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.420
going to happen?

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.640
Well, that's going to drive A
and B up, and it's maybe going

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.990
to consume a little
bit extra D.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.400
And then if you added more C and
D, then, of course, it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.940
going to produce a
lot more A and B.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.920
And this idea, it seems pretty
common sense, but there's a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.170
fancy name for it, and it's
called Le-- let me put a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.315
capital L-- Chatelier's
principle.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.910
If you've watched enough of
these videos, you know I have

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.620
to be careful with
my spelling.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.540
And all it says is that when you
stress a reaction that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.330
in equilibrium, the reaction
will favor the side or one

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.270
side of the reaction to
relieve that stress.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.290
When they say stress the
reaction, that's like adding

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.780
more A, so the reaction's going
to move towards the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.490
forward direction to relieve
the stress-- the quote,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.860
unquote stress--
of that more A.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.890
I mean, that's not stress in
its traditional way of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800
thinking about stress, but
that is a kind of stress.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.140
You're somehow changing
it relative to it.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.290
It was nice and comfortable
before in a nice, stable

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.180
environment.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.870
So given Le Chatelier's
principle, let's think of some

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.579
other situations.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:28.620
Let's say if I had A plus B
plus some heat, and that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.490
produces some C plus D.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.030
And maybe it produces
some E as well.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.200
So if I were to add
heat to this

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.850
system, what would happen?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.870
So in order for the reaction
to progress in the forward

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.260
direction, you need heat.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.460
The more heat you have, the more
likely you're going to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.270
progress in the forward
direction.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.620
So Le Chatelier's principle will
say we're stressing this

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.540
reaction by adding heat, so the
reaction will favor the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.870
direction that relieves
that stressor.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.650
And so to relieve that stressor,
you have more of

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.250
this input, so you're going
to consume more A.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.520
So the stable concentration of
A once we reach equilibrium

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.460
will go down.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.240
B will go down because they're
going to be consumed more.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.420
The forward reaction
is happening more.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.410
And then C, D, and
E would go up.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.210
Now, if you did the opposite.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.280
Let me erase what I just did.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:36.000
Let's say instead of adding
heat, you were

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.790
to take away heat.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.346
So let's say you were
to take away heat.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:43.080
Let me make sure my
cursor's right.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.820
So if you took heat away
from the reaction,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.270
what will be favored?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.240
Well, then you're going to be
favoring it in the other

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.590
direction because there'll
be less heat here.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.660
I mean, all of this
is together.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.090
There'll be less heat for this
reaction to occur, so this

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.300
rate will start dominating this
rate over here, right?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.520
If you take away heat, the rate
of this reaction will

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.040
slow down, this one will be
bigger, and so you'll have

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.090
more movement of concentration
in that direction, or the

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.360
reverse reaction will
be favored.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.880
Now, let's think of another
stressor-- pressure.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.610
Now, imagine that we had-- we
mentioned the Haber process

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.410
before, and this
is the reaction

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.480
for the Haber process.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:31.590
Nitrogen gas plus 3 moles of
hydrogen gas in equilibrium

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.890
with 2 moles of ammonia gas.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.560
Now, what's going to
happen if I apply

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.140
pressure to this system?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.925
I'm going to apply pressure.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.840
So if you think about what
happens with pressure,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.130
everything all of a sudden is
getting squeezed, although the

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.370
volume isn't necessarily
decreasing, but something is

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.220
somehow making all the molecules
want to be or

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.410
forcing them to be
closer together.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.440
Now, when things are getting
closer together, the stress of

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.450
the pressure could be
relieved if we end

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.890
up with fewer molecules.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.140
Think about it this way.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.610
PV is equal to nRT.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.810
We learned this multiple
times, right?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:23.960
And let's say we could write
P is equal to nRT/V.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.300
Now, if we increase
the pressure, how

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.820
can we relieve that?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.600
Remember, Le Chatelier's
principle says that whatever's

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.140
going to happen is going to
relieve the stressor.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.660
The reaction is going to
go in the direction

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.460
that it relieves it.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.410
Well, if we lower the number of
molecules, then that will

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.580
relieve the pressure, right?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.970
You'll have fewer things
bouncing against each other.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.000
So if we lower the number of
molecules where you can kind

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.680
of view it-- I mean, I shouldn't
have written it this

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.000
way, because it's not quite an
equation, but I want you to

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.530
think of it that way.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.490
Let me erase this.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.280
This probably wasn't
the best intuition.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.610
If I have a container--
nope, too shocking.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.316
If I-- nope, same thing.

00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:22.710
If I have a container and I'm
applying pressure to it, and

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.220
in one option I could have 2
molecules-- let's say I could

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.309
have 4 molecules
in some volume.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.140
And in another situation, let's
say they get merged and

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.299
I only have 2 molecules,
right?

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.710
In either of these, the reaction
can go between these,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.360
these 4 could merge to
make 2 molecules.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.540
Actually, let me use this
example up here.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.100
Let's say this nitrogen
molecule is

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.150
this blue one here.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.420
Actually, let me do it in
a more different color.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.570
This brown one right here, it
can merge with 3 hydrogen.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.980
It could produce this.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.750
So this is another way of
writing this reaction, maybe

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.440
in a more visual way.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.070
Now, if I'm applying pressure,
if I'm applying pressure to

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.490
this system, so pressure I just
imagine is kind of more

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.220
force per area from every
direction, which of these

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.880
situations is more likely to
relieve the situation?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.390
Well, the situation where we
have fewer molecules bumping

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.720
around because it's easier to
kind of apply or I guess

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.590
squeeze them together than when
you have more molecules

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.540
bumping around.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.310
I'm doing this very hand
wavy, but I think it

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.170
gives you the intuition.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.410
So if you apply pressure to the
system, if pressure goes

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.120
up, you're applying-- this
doesn't mean the

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.760
pressure goes down.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.820
This means pressure is applying
to the system.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.350
But the pressure is going up,
what side of the reaction is

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.030
going to be favored?

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.190
The reaction's going to be
favoring the side of that has

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.600
fewer molecules.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.330
And this side has 2 molecules,
although they'll be bigger

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.430
molecules obviously, because
it's not like we're losing

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.890
mass in one direction or the
other, as opposed to this

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.830
situation where we have
4 molecules, right?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:05.830
1 mole of nitrogen gas and
3 moles of hydrogen.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.550
And just to bring this all back
to the whole idea that we

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.650
saw earlier with the kinetic
equilibrium, let's just

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.070
imagine a reaction like this.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.000
And to show that it works with
Le Chatelier's principle is

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.140
consistent with everything
we've learned

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.045
with equilibrium constants.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:27.960
So let's say we had the reaction
2 moles, or the

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.850
coefficient of two, 2 A's in the
gaseous form plus B in the

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:38.860
gaseous form is in equilibrium
with C in the gaseous form.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.170
And let's say initially where
our first equilibrium, our

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:49.680
concentration of A is 2 molar,
or our molarity is 2, our

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.880
concentration of B is 6 molar
concentration, and then our

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.470
concentration of C is 8 molar.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.972
So what's the equilibrium
constant here?

00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:08.250
The equilibrium constant here is
the product, concentration

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:14.960
of C, that's 8 molar divided by
2 molar squared, because of

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.070
this, 2 squared times 6.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.720
Which is equal to 8/24,
which is equal to 1/3.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.290
Now, let's say we were to add
more A, and I'm not going to

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.190
say exactly how much.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.940
We could actually get quite
complicated with the

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.030
mathematics, but let's say after
adding more A, we have a

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.360
new concentration.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.940
Now, let's say our concentration
of A is 3 molar.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.310
You might say, hey, Sal,
didn't you add 1 molar?

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.030
No.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.140
I actually added probably
more than 1 molar.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.560
What happens is, whatever I
added, that'll push the

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.010
reaction towards the right
direction, or towards the

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.800
forward direction, and so some
of it will get consumed and go

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.150
in that direction, but
whatever's left over is here.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.040
So I might have added more than
1 molar concentration to

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.160
this system.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.650
But whatever was extra beyond
the 1 was consumed, and I'm

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.350
just left with this equilibrium

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.410
concentration of 3.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.840
So I didn't necessarily add 1.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.180
I could've added
more than that.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:22.160
And let's say that our new
equilibrium for C is 12 molar,

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.360
which is consistent
with what we say.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.640
We should be producing-- if
we add some A, then our

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.860
concentration of C should go up,
and the intuition is that

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.160
the concentration of B should go
down a little bit, because

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.280
a little bit more B is going to
be consumed, because it's

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.740
going to be colliding with-- or
it's more likely to collide

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.090
with-- more A particles
or A molecules.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.790
So let's see what B's new
concentration is.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:51.730
So remember, the equilibrium
constant stays constant.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.540
So our equilibrium constant is
now going to be equal to the

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.120
concentration of C, right?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.150
That was the reaction.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:04.070
So it's 12 molar-- whoops-- I
don't have to write the units

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.920
here-- divided by our new
concentration of A, that's 3.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.020
But remember the reaction.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.710
The coefficient on A is 2.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.880
So it's 3 squared times the new

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.950
concentration for B, right?

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.770
There's no coefficient here so
I don't have to worry about

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.220
any exponents.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.260
And let's just solve this.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.990
So you get 1/3 is equal
to 12 over 9B.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.250
So if we just cross-multiply,
we get 9 times the

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:45.370
concentration of B is equal to
3 times 12, which is 36.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.170
And so divide both sides by 9.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:53.450
The new concentration of
B is 4, or 4 molar.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.880
So B is equal to 4 molar.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.680
So that makes sense.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.440
We added some more A
to the reaction.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.380
So we started with 2 molar of A,
6 molar of B, 8 molar of C.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.180
When we added more A, at the
end, we added a bunch.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.340
It went in that direction, maybe
it went back and forth a

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.240
little bit, but it stabilized
at 3 molar of A, 12 molar of

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.200
C, so C went up, so that
definitely went up.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.250
And notice, our stable
equilibrium concentration of B

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.630
actually went down, and this
is consistent with what we

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.140
were saying, that the reaction
moves in that direction, more

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.050
C gets produced, a little
bit of B gets consumed.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.850
So anyway, hopefully you're
fairly comfortable now with

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.870
the whole notion of stressing
a reaction and

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.520
Le Chatelier's principle.
