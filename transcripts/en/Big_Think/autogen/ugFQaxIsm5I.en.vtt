he wanted to know how the various bones

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
he wanted to know how the various bones
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.079
he wanted to know how the various bones
related to one each other and how the

related to one each other and how the
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.240
related to one each other and how the
muscles related to the bones so he

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
muscles related to the bones so he
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.920
muscles related to the bones so he
wanted to have a realistic understanding

wanted to have a realistic understanding
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740
wanted to have a realistic understanding
of the human anatomy because he was

so in order to understand how the body

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
so in order to understand how the body
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.420
so in order to understand how the body
functions we need to know something

about the anatomy the body it's sort of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
you have lesions of the left hemisphere
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.690

that removes the inhibitory constraint
on the right hemisphere and frees up
