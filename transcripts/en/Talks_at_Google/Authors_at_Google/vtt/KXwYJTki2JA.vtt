HOLMAN WANG: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.490
My name is Holman Wang,
and my presentation today

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.540
is called From Bar
Wars to Star Wars--

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.110
How a Lawyer Came to Create
Kids Books in a Galaxy Far,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.610
Far Away.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.640
So today, I am going to talk
a little bit about my work,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.260
and I'm going to talk a little
bit about my career transition

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.610
as well.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.520
The reference to bar
wars, of course--

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.230
I used to fight many
a battle at the bar.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.720
I used to be a lawyer.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.540
And in Canada, we
actually have to gown up

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.820
for certain court proceedings.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.310
And so these are fairly
preposterous photos,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.480
but the only ones I had of
me actually wearing a gown.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.730
So there I am.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.470
But now, I am no
longer a lawyer.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.900
I quit in December 2012,
and now I do kids books.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.010
And the most recent series
of books that I've done

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.460
is called "Star
Wars Epic Yarns."

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.600
where we-- we being my brother
and I, my brother Jack--

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.920
we abridge each of the
original "Star Wars" movies

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.750
into word primers that are
just 12 words and 12 images.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.380
And we have a particular
illustration technique

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.060
which we use, which is
called needle felting.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.370
And I will talk more
about that later.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.360
But very quickly
right now, there

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.860
is the cast of
characters-- most the cast

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.230
of characters for the books
that are made out of wool.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.320
And then like I said,
we abridge the books

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830
to 12 words and
12 illustrations.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.890
So a typical spread will look
something like this-- captain,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.290
and there's Han Solo and Greedo.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.190
In our world, Han
shoots first, of course.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.720
In fact, Greedo doesn't
have a gun at all.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.170
And here's another
image of Jabba the Hutt

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.190
paired with the word "monster."

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.590
And the spread of the
books looks like this.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.100
So this is how the
actual books look.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.960
And they are board book
format, so nice and chunky,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.834
fairly indestructible
for young children.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.000
Now, I'm going to back up
the narrative a little bit

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.780
to tell you a little
bit about my life.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.160
My brother I were
born in Taiwan.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.100
And we came to Canada when
we were one and a half,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.340
and this is our first
birthday in Canada.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.280
And we were big "Star Wars"
fans when we were kids.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.140
So here's a picture of Jack
and I. Jack has the lightsaber,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.760
and I'm in the kung fu pose.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.200
I like to think of this
picture as Crouching Tiger,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.140
not-so-hidden lightsaber.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.610
And it's funny, because I
was at a school presentation,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.477
and I said, well, this is sort
of kung fu meet Star Wars.

00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:01.310
And one of the little
kids said, no, no, no.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.280
That's not kung fu.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.470
That's the emperor
zapping Luke Skywalker

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.440
with his force of
lightning, which

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.857
I thought was quite clever,
except I didn't have the heart

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.564
to tell him that the
"Return of the Jedi"

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:15.390
had not actually come
out by this point.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.670
But at any rate,
my brother and I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.780
were always quite
artistic as young kids.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.930
Here we are, some
random art contest.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.880
I don't even
remember what it was.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.490
We look fairly
enthused about winning.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.050
I'm not sure about
that girl, though.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.880
Fast-forwarding to high
school, here are my brother

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.780
and I coaching the grade
ten girls basketball team

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.090
to the Vancouver
city championships.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.630
There we are in the background.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.040
But I'll be perfectly honest.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.740
We were probably less jock
and more Spock in high school

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.370
because we were in fact,
science fair kings.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.350
And I don't know if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.720
But we were science fair kings.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.030
We went to the National Science
Fair in Canada four times.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.520
And that sort of led to a
meandering wayward career

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.300
trajectory for me.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.680
Because we did most of
our science fair projects

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.940
in plant physiology,
I wound up-- well,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.390
I call this my over-educated
and underemployed period

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.550
of my life.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.990
So first I went to university
originally to study biology.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.570
But then I thought that was
not really to my interest,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.100
so I shifted gears a little
bit and did a double major

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.454
in biology and anthropology.

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:35.870
And then I wasn't sure what
to do with my life after that,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.270
so I went to get a
bachelor in education

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.959
to teach middle school.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:42.500
And then after that,
I thought, well,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.580
I don't really want
to teach either.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.460
So I'm going to
become an architect.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.700
That's more creative.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.260
So I spent a year in the
architecture design program

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.100
and then decided that
wasn't for me either.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.540
So I dropped out, and just
hung around the department

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.530
and did a master's of
architecture history

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.680
apropos of nothing
really, and then

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.140
did a number of
non-career related jobs.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.700
And then when I was
30, decided maybe I

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.430
should get my act together and
I should go back to law school

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.500
and get my law degree,
and that was what I did.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.920
So after I got my law degree,
I was more well-employed

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.170
than I had been in the past.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.889
And here I am on the day
that I got called to the bar.

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.180
Strange thing happened,
though, after a couple of years

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.440
of practicing as a lawyer.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.250
I developed a cough that
would never go away.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.530
It would actually get worse
when I wanted to go to court,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.420
and it was sort of some
high-stress situation.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.190
And they tested.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.380
The doctors tested
for tuberculosis

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.280
and asthma and heart
conditions and cancer

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.710
and all sorts of things.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.140
At the end of the
day, the doctor

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.290
told me it was a
psychogenic cough, which

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.970
meant the genesis
was in my psyche,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.570
or that I basically
was so depressed

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.680
or had such underlying stress
or anxiety about the career

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.310
that I had chosen that it was
manifesting itself in this way.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.087
And so it became clear to me
that I needed to make a career

00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:15.920
shift at some point.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.700
I wasn't exactly sure
what that would be.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.330
Here's my office
on the 32nd floor.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.410
You can see that there are
a number of pieces of paper

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.432
that I've collected over
the years on the wall.

00:06:27.432 --> 00:06:28.890
And then I brought
all those plants

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.020
in because I thought maybe
I was on the 32nd floor

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.730
and couldn't breathe because
there wasn't enough oxygen

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.230
up there.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.730
And so anyways,
this is my office.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.020
And it was about five
or six years ago,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.430
and my brother came to
me one day and said,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.750
I know I've got this
idea for kids books.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.050
It was almost as
a joke at first,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.120
because he wanted to abridge
theorists, like really

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.310
high-level theorists
like Freud and Jung,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.380
and say, why don't we
make baby books for them

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.420
out of those theorists?

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.975
And it was kind of
just a joke thing.

00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:00.600
But then we got to
talking, and then he

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.140
had a more serious
proposal, which

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.360
was why don't we
abridge classics

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.350
for very young children
in just a couple of words?

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.010
Because we had gotten very
used to reading a lot of word

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.330
primers to our very
young children.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.220
And word primers,
they can tend to get

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.650
a little stale-- barnyard
animals, shapes, colors.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.477
These are all very important
things, but after a while,

00:07:26.477 --> 00:07:28.560
they're a little bit boring,
frankly, for parents.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.190
And sometimes, the
art in the books

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:37.350
is also a little bit stale--
clip art or stock photography.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.920
So here, I actually
have a picture

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.870
of a word primer, which I
didn't want to offend any North

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.090
American publishers so I've
gone to an overseas publication

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.730
here.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.840
And it's bilingual.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.150
And you see there's all
kinds of issues here.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.600
Instead of "my actions,"
it says "my acting" here.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.850
And then apparently
children grovel and creep.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.190
And then this little
boy here in the blue box

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.500
is ready for life in
the 17th century here.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.200
So anyways, this is
the kind of thing

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.990
that you tend to-- not always,
but very often experience

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.740
with word primers.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.310
And we thought how can we make
word primers more exciting?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.150
Why do they always have
to be concept books?

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.520
Why can't they be storybooks?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.540
Why can't they have a
narrative for young children?

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.400
So that's when we came up
with the idea of needle

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.420
felting some figures.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.400
I hope this video works.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.590
Here's a time-lapse video.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.090
And needle felting's a technique
where you take a loose wool

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.220
roving, and you basically
stab it again and again

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.620
with a specialized
barbed needle.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.110
And what that does is
entangles the fibers.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.536
And when you
entangle the fibers,

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:47.160
it gets firmer and
firmer, and then you

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.650
can start to sculpt with it.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.540
So here, I've
bulked out the body,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.250
and then now I'm
adding the details

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.500
to this particular figure,
which happens to be

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.450
Mr. Rochester from "Jane Eyre."

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.490
And we thought that
would be a great way

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.910
to illustrate children's books.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.620
And so this is the very
first concept illustration

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.640
that we did.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.960
This is for "Moby
Dick," and this

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.120
is Ishmeal from "Moby Dick."

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.220
And originally, it was this
idea that we might even just

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:23.460
use paper backgrounds
with old woodcut prints,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.520
or maps and that kind of thing--
very gestural, very simple.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.030
And then we also explored the
possibility of illustrating two

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.380
dimensionally with wool.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.340
And here you can see we've
illustrated a stormy sea

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.420
in a boat that's lost.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.270
But ultimately, we
rejected this concept

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.370
in favor of taking
the wool figures,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.290
and either building
three-dimensional sets

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.030
for them, or taking them
actually out on location

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.675
and shooting them in
natural environments.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.700
So or first two books
that came out in late 2012

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.620
were "Moby Dick" and
"Pride and Prejudice."

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.100
And you see, the entire book
is just 12 words and 12 images.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.100
And here, we have
Mr. Darcy refusing

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.390
to dance with Lizzie Bennett,
and paired with the word

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.310
"mean."

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.230
There's Captain Ahab
with his peg leg

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:25.040
from "Moby Dick" This is
Andrei Bolkonsky and Natasha

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.960
Rostova from "War and Peace."

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.830
And that's Pierre Bezukhov
sort of looking on jealously

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.830
during the dance in
the middle there.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.770
So the idea is that for
very young children--

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.570
and this is Jane Eyre and
Mr. Rochester kissing.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.570
So the idea is that for
very young children,

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.945
they're just simple
word primers.

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.680
You can just illustrate
simple concepts,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.271
simple words-- "kiss,"
"dance," that kind of thing.

00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:51.770
As children get a
little bit older--

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.380
they're four,
five, or six-- they

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.350
become storytelling vehicles
because they're narrative.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.950
Parents can fill in the detail.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.980
And if you know the story,
you can fill in the details.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.250
Even if you don't know the
story, it doesn't matter.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.330
The idea is to use
your imaginations.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.170
You can get your
kids to tell you

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.720
the story, what's happening
from one picture to the next.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.640
There's no wrong way
to read our books.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.760
So we found that as we got along
into this project of abridging

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.560
classics, the
illustrations really

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.320
got more and more involved.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.020
Here we are building an
entire miniature forest.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.710
And that's Tom
Sawyer and Huck Finn

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.650
in the forest for this
shot of them camping.

00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:35.590
And sometimes, it's possible
to take things and do them

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.170
on location.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.190
But when you have them
around a campfire,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.440
everything has to be
at a smaller scale.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.090
You just wind up having
to build the whole thing.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.680
Here I am in some
very sexy hip waders

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.830
that I borrowed from
a friend, and just

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.290
got right out into the muddy
slew with a little raft.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.310
There's Huck and Jim
from "Huckleberry Finn."

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.050
And I was able to get this shot.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.650
So I was actually in the
slew with the camera,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.020
frightened that I was going to
slip and lose my $1,500 camera.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.620
But it's just all part of
trying to get the right image

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.255
for these books.

00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:15.380
Now,it's sort of interesting
because there was this

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.660
particular trend in children's
books to really stay away from

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.450
adult themes, to
really sanitize things,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.690
have a lot of pink bunnies and
magical unicorns and things

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.900
that are kind of
divorced from real life,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.410
and this insulated world
of children's books.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.090
It's illustrated perfectly
by this "New Yorker" cartoon.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.480
There are these two kids here.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.760
They're watching television.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.780
There's two animals.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.680
And there's the word
"respect" at the top.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.450
And it says "Everything
I know about being

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.780
human I learned from animals."

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.480
And there is this kind of trend
that we have to teach lessons

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.030
through animals and through
some kind of slightly

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.960
sanitized world.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.630
And so we're taking
a different approach.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.924
We think that some of these
great classics, these stories

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:05.090
that people love, have
lessons that you can actually

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.000
share with children.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.360
Of course, it's totally
up to the adult,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.985
right, what you share
at any one point.

00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:12.090
Because those lessons are not
embedded in the story per se.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.500
There's only 12 words, right?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.880
But kids are curious.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.120
And my own kids
ask me questions.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.750
We have other
parents who tell us

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.300
that they have very inquisitive
children who ask questions

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.400
about what's going on, what's
the motivation that's going on

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.570
with particular characters.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.930
And parents can sort
of adapt their answers

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:34.940
to their child at
the appropriate age.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.110
And so people seem
to like our books.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.630
This is sort of the neatest
piece of publicity we probably

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.632
got, which is in "People"
magazine with a cover

00:13:44.632 --> 00:13:45.590
graced with Brangelina.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.320
And so that takes
us to 2013, when

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.610
we exhibited some of our artwork
at the Bologna Children's Book

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.340
Fair.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.060
And that's the world's
largest book fair

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.530
where publishers and
authors, illustrators,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.620
and agents-- the biggest book
fair for children's books.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.112
And people go in and sell
rights and that sort of thing.

00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:10.070
There's also an illustrator's
exhibition there,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.780
and we were very
fortunate to have

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.319
some of our "Pride and
Prejudice" images selected

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:15.110
for the exhibition.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.040
So we had a chance to go to
Italy-- used it as an excuse

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.100
to take our wives there.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.010
And look, you don't
need to be a lawyer

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.870
to have a wonderful,
glamorous life.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.280
You could be a
kid's Illustrator.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.410
We could go to Italy.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:38.010
This is part of how I'm selling
the career change to my wife.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.760
But importantly,
while we were there,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.480
we met a representative
from Chronicle Books who

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.380
took some of our
Cozy Classics back

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.240
to the head of the children's
department at Chronicle,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.200
and she liked our
books and talked to us

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.190
about doing a new project.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.210
And she said, well, what do
you guys interested in doing?

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.100
And we just thought,
well, why don't we

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.400
just shoot for the moon and
say "Star Wars," because--

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.160
and we grew up with "Star Wars."

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.020
This is "Star Wars" to
us, the original trilogy,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.790
with all due respect to
the young children who

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.440
think that Jar Jar Binks
is the bee's knees.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.590
This is "Star Wars" for us.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:21.550
And Lucas Film sort of said,
hm, interesting-- 12 words,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.560
needle felted characters.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.460
Why don't you needle
felt something for us?

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.950
Let's see what you guys can
do in the Star Wars universe.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.220
And so we did this.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.730
This is our very first figure.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.250
It's Luke in an X-wing costume,
and we sent these images

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.780
to Lucas.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.660
And that's what sort
of got us the gig.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.460
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.850
going to run through "A New
Hope" for you in 12 words

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.920
so you get a sense of
how our books actually

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.890
work cover to cover.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.330
So here we go.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:56.830
Princess.

00:16:00.931 --> 00:16:01.430
Trouble.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.300
Boy.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.830
Learn.

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:14.405
Captain.

00:16:17.466 --> 00:16:17.965
Space.

00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.270
Help.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.370
Garbage.

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:31.345
Swing.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:35.670
Duel.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.180
Fly.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.930
And finally, heroes.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.070
And that's "Star
Wars" in 12 words.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.200
And so like I said, for
very young children,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.650
it's a word primer.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.700
They get to learn.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.540
You get to just say, hey,
look, the spaceship is flying.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.380
With my own children who are
three and five, we sit down

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.619
and I do my best, or
worst, Chewbacca imitation

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.980
as the case may be--
Yoda imitations,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.159
Darth Vader impressions.

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:13.700
I just sort of have
some fun with it.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.879
It's a storytelling vehicle.

00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:17.420
And I know that lots of adults
like our books because they're

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.579
just kind of fun, and they're
ironic that a story that they

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.050
love has been abridged
into 12 words.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.574
So they keep it around
as a coffee table book.

00:17:25.574 --> 00:17:26.990
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.730
going to just talk
a little bit more

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.170
about the process of
creating the books.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.140
What you didn't see in the
video is that the figures all

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.860
start with a wire armature.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.920
So that helps us, one,
get the general size

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.120
of the figure mapped
out beforehand.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.810
All of these "Star Wars" figures
are done in the exact one

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.130
to seven scale so that
all the relative heights

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.380
of the characters are correct.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.370
But more importantly,
the wire armature

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.527
allows the figures to
be posed and reposed.

00:17:55.527 --> 00:17:57.860
And then you can put them
into the various action poses.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:03.050
So then you see, as you wind the
roving around and you stab it,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:07.500
it starts to entangle and you
start to bulk up the bodies.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.480
And then here, you see
a half completed Luke.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.570
We had one question early
on that troubled us,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.320
which was how we're
going to deal with all

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.220
these elaborate "Star
Wars" costume changes

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.500
and keep character continuity.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.930
Because we knew we couldn't do
a whole bunch of different Luke

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.100
heads and make them
look exactly the same.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.170
So we came up with a
system of removable heads

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.490
so that Luke's
head could actually

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.812
pop off and go to another
body with another costume.

00:18:36.812 --> 00:18:38.520
And for those of you
who are in the room,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.220
I can do a quick demonstration.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.900
See this-- Luke's head
just comes right off right

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.930
here like that.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.680
And then the storm
trooper head comes off.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.770
And then you see, now Luke
is ready for the Death Star,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.320
you see.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.100
So that saved us a lot
of time because we didn't

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.940
have to destroy costumes.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.270
But at the same time,
we were able to maintain

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.120
character continuity and do
elaborate costume changes.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.870
Other figures like R2-D2
started off, again, very simply.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:20.710
This cross piece is where
his legs would fit into.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:25.500
And then you'd bulk up his
body into this cylinder, felt

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.850
the top part, and top part
just fits onto the wire that's

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:29.430
sticking out.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.100
And then his head can rotate.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.380
And then we had to do
slightly different techniques

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.730
for the legs because
needle felting

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.490
is very good for sort
of soft, curvy elements.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.510
It's harder to create
hard edges with wool.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.970
So what we did is
we took craft felt,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.170
which you can get at any kind
of craft store that kids cut up

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.050
and make two-dimensional
illustrations with-- we took

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.580
that craft felt and glued
it into layers in order

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.800
to ultimately achieve the
hard edges of R2-D2's legs.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.000
Now, for Darth Vader, we
knew that we wanted his eyes

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.890
to have a different texture,
so they couldn't be wool.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.900
We wanted them to catch and
reflect light a little bit

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.670
differently.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.010
So I was sitting around
in my studio one day

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.000
and thinking about what that
could be, that material.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.394
And I saw a beer can
just sitting there.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.310
And it was painted black,
and I thought, oh, I

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.726
could just cut up some of this
aluminum from the beer can.

00:20:31.726 --> 00:20:35.480
So then I cut out some ovals and
glued that on top of the wool.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.260
And Darth Vader literally
has beer goggles on,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:46.610
but it does a very effective
job of capturing the light.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:52.550
We really wanted to be true to
"Star Wars," get things right.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.120
Because we know that "Star
Wars" fans are very discerning.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.980
So Princess Leia
actually features

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.510
nine different hairstyles
through the three books.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.856
Because of course, her
hairstyles are famous,

00:21:01.856 --> 00:21:03.230
and we had to get
them all right.

00:21:07.791 --> 00:21:10.040
All the humanoid figures are
wool through and through.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.969
Some of the larger figures
start off with a Styrofoam core,

00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:15.260
just because it would save
hours and hours of this sort

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.280
of felting and bulking up.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:24.402
So we would put Styrofoam
boards together,

00:21:24.402 --> 00:21:26.110
glue them into a large
block, and then we

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.130
would start shaving it
down a hot melting tool.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.480
And then just sort of shave
it down, shave it down.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.290
And you know who
this is going to be.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.860
And there I am with the
studio set up with a visit

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.630
from my children.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.630
And you've already seen this
shot with Jabba the Hutt.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.760
The same technique was
used for the tauntaun.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.850
And there, I bought a
little plastic tauntaun

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.830
to try to copy the proportions.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.580
And there's the final
tauntaun with Luke on it.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.700
And then I took this out to a
local ski hill to shoot this.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.450
And it's kind of an
illusion, because he

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:18.630
looks like he's on a
sort of rocky outcropping

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.930
and there's snow on it.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.230
In fact, it's just
a snow pile that's

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:28.550
been pushed to the side of
the parking lot by a plow.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:31.200
And the parts that look
like rocks, it's just dirt.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.330
It's just dirty snow.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.105
But it creates the illusion of
it being like a rocky hillside.

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:36.230
It worked very effectively.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.650
Some of the other sets required
very elaborate cut pieces.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.944
And so I would start
with a paper template.

00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:46.610
For example, I would
draw it out to know

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.660
exactly what I was cutting.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.030
And in this case, this is part
of the blockade runner scene

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.950
where Princess Leia is
putting the Death Star

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.370
plans into R2-D2.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:01.957
And I just used pliable foam and
cut out holes on the top level,

00:23:01.957 --> 00:23:03.540
and then put another
level in the back

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.530
to create these
indentations, sprayed

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.950
the foam with a metallic
paint and started

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:20.200
to set those pieces up,
tested some lighting, and then

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.320
basically just kind of--

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.609
A lot of these shots involve
a lot of MacGyver-ing

00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:25.400
because you're just
kind of figuring it out

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.050
as you go along.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.925
You need some red lighting
in the background.

00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:29.850
You need light at this angle.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.130
You can see the front light,
it's a little bit too wide.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.820
So I've put tin foil on to
narrow the focus of the light

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.900
at the front because
they don't really

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.220
make lights to work
at this small scale--

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.960
or at least I haven't found any.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.230
So I sort of jimmy the
equipment that I have.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.250
And that was the princess scene.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.250
The most complicated
set to build

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.340
was possibly the
blockade runner hallway

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.040
because it had a lot of curved
elements, which I had to make

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.120
out of, again, pliable foam.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.020
And so I cut these elements.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.340
To give it some rigidity,
I used some foam core.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.760
And then I would put
together a column like this.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.620
And then I would put together
a whole number of columns.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.840
And then I would start
to assemble them.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.560
Add the consoles.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.250
Add the detailing, the flooring.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.807
Also needed to add some
lighting panels for the ceiling.

00:24:28.807 --> 00:24:30.390
And then this is the
finished hallway.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.460
And then I put the figures in.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.049
And you can there's
all the top lighting.

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:41.340
And then that's the final shot.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.290
So the whole process of
making these three books

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.570
took us about a year.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.500
We did about five
months of needle felting

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.770
before we even did any
set making or photography.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.880
And that, we've probably got
most of the felt figures,

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.180
but by all means,
not all the figures

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.800
done in the first five months.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.459
So some of the sets also
started off with Styrofoam.

00:25:09.459 --> 00:25:11.000
And then what we
would do is we would

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.740
add quick-set
concrete texturize it.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.450
And then we would
paint that concrete,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.350
and this is that
Ben Kenobi's hut.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.290
And then we put the figures in.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.700
And this is the "learn"
image that you saw earlier.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.900
This is another Styrofoam
and concrete set.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.360
This is a cantina booth.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.410
And sometimes,
some of these sets

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.960
call for very
simple electronics.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.719
There's a table lamp
in this instance.

00:25:41.719 --> 00:25:43.135
And so here are
the figures posed.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.350
And there's some lighting
through the little small window

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.830
at the back.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:55.810
And then ultimately, this
is the shot that results.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.160
And because these
books are supposed

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.730
to be for very young
children potentially,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.730
we did make some modifications.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.400
We didn't want any drawn guns.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.519
So as I mentioned
earlier, Hans definitely

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:11.310
shoots first in our
version, because Greedo

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.810
doesn't have a gun at all.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.880
So he's just sort of
pointing somewhat menacing.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.640
But he actually has a gun in the
movie, but there's no gun here.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.880
Some of the other, this is the
beginnings of the Millennium

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.290
Falcon cockpit.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.930
And it's just balsa wood.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.060
These colored circles at the top
are actually embroidery hoops

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.730
that you would get at a
store like Michael's if you

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.170
like to do needlepoint work.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.060
The wood circle at the
bottom is something

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.160
that someone might
make a wreath with.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.200
So when we were
making these books,

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.210
there was a lot of walking
around hardware stores

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.150
and craft stores and just
looking at objects and going,

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.765
can that be something else?

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:55.140
There was a lot
of plumbing parts

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.460
that I was looking at in
hardware stores, thinking,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.750
could they become space
components of spaceships?

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.530
So it was sort of fun and
also a bit of a challenge

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:09.560
sometimes to find things
that could serve as a prop.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.850
So then the interior of
this cockpit gets painted.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.470
Some of the metallic elements
at the very top, those

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.810
are like model train parts.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.140
And then this is
just a test shot

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.060
of putting the Death
Star into the shot.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.420
And then ultimately, the setup
started to look like this.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.387
And it's a little bit difficult
to see from this slide,

00:27:33.387 --> 00:27:35.220
but what's behind the
Death Star is actually

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.400
a piece of black card stock
with holes punched in it.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.730
And there's Christmas
lights behind it

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.822
so that in the final
shot when you see stars,

00:27:44.822 --> 00:27:46.280
those are not
computer-illustrated.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.210
Those are actual lights
coming through the card stock.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.770
For the trash compactor
scene, I actually

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:57.720
had to get an
iron-based paint that

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.240
would rust when you applied
an oxidizing solution.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.260
So this is the paint in
the process of rusting.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.341
It starts off gray.

00:28:07.341 --> 00:28:09.590
And then when you add the
solution, it starts to rust.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:14.280
And then ultimately, the
walls look like that.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.960
And then I added
the various pieces

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:24.930
for the garbage-- pieces of foam
and rubber and metal and so on.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.010
Oh, actually, just
there's some dirt

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.820
on the walls that's
sort of dripping down,

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.130
and I just wound up put coffee
rinds and a little bit of oil

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.240
on to the walls.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.595
And the oil actually started
seeping into the walls

00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:41.720
and spreading a little bit.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.880
So I had to get my shot
quickly before that oil just

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.838
got all over the place.

00:28:44.838 --> 00:28:46.694
So that was kind
of a-- at first,

00:28:46.694 --> 00:28:48.360
I thought it was a
clever move, and then

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.422
kind of backfired on me.

00:28:49.422 --> 00:28:51.380
So these are things that
you kind of figure out

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.770
as you go along.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.150
This is the shot
of Luke and Leia

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:02.327
swinging across the
Death Star where

00:29:02.327 --> 00:29:03.410
there's the broken bridge.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:06.740
And this is a shot from behind
the Death Star walls, which

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.830
are all backlit with lights.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.200
And there, as you can see,
in the background, Luke

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.070
and Leia hanging by string.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.970
So they are still,
and they don't

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.070
move when I'm taking the shot.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.100
But as you can see
from this angle,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:26.320
I built the whole Death Star
wall on a platform with wheels

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.010
so that when I
take the shot, I'm

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:32.330
actually pushing the Death Star
wall to create a slight blur.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.090
So that there is this
kind of motion effect.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.810
And it's much more dramatic
in the next sequence

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.530
here with the X-wing fighter.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.300
First of all, the
X-wing fighters,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.830
or the spaceships
in general, were

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.790
too delicate to needle
felt in their entirety.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.170
So we built those
out of cardboard,

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.640
and then put craft felt
over top of the surfaces.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.360
And here are the components
of the X-wing fighter.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.440
Then I took the fuselage,
put it on some pegs,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.032
and then started
adding the wings.

00:30:03.032 --> 00:30:04.740
And there's the
completed X-wing fighter.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.762
And then for the
Death Star wall,

00:30:09.762 --> 00:30:12.220
I knew I just needed to create
a bunch of light and shadow.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.230
It didn't necessarily need
to look like the Death Star

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.729
per se.

00:30:14.729 --> 00:30:18.840
So I just took a whole
bunch of Styrofoam

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.400
from electronics packages or
whatever and other garbage

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.110
and just glued it onto
this large Styrofoam board,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.257
painted it all gray,
and then set it up

00:30:30.257 --> 00:30:31.340
behind the X-wing fighter.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.380
And then did a
long exposure shot.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.600
And then when that
shot was taken,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.480
I pulled the wall very quickly.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.210
And then the final
effect was like this.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.730
So it creates the
illusion of flight.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.530
And then digitally,
I removed those two

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.390
pegs so those aren't seen.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.320
Here is the Dagobah set.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.280
And this was kind of fun
because, well, first of all,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.940
I got to get some tree branches
and put some soil down.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.050
I took dried leaves and I
actually put them in a blender

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.930
to scale them down
into little pieces.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.070
Took a bunch of yarn,
painted them green to create

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.112
all those hanging vines.

00:31:11.112 --> 00:31:12.570
But the really fun
part was there's

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.150
a couple of baking
dishes you can

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.660
see in a shot around the edges.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.530
And I filled those
with hot water,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.930
and then I put dry
ice in them to create

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.300
the misty effects of Dagobah.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.490
And I have a video here
that I'll show you.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.200
Hope this works.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.055
Nope, let's see.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:31.930
Let's try that again.

00:31:34.762 --> 00:31:36.467
Oh, that video's
not cooperating.

00:31:36.467 --> 00:31:38.300
So at any rate, we've
got a still shot here.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:45.800
And you can see that the dry ice
vapors are sort of coming out.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.600
The dry ice vapors
are heavier than air,

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.630
so they just kind of
roll across the surface.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:54.970
And it creates that misty
atmosphere of Dagobah.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.110
And there's the final shot.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.110
And it's a very subtle touch.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.570
You only see a little bit
of the mist at the bottom.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.570
But again, it's not
computer-generated.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:09.080
Our goal is to try to
do things in camera.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.690
This is just the setup for
the shuttle Tydirium shot

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.860
where they're flying
to the Endor moon.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.390
And this is the final set.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.516
And there's the final image
with all the characters

00:32:24.516 --> 00:32:25.140
in the shuttle.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.020
For the Endor scenes,
I tried to get a tree

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:36.750
stump from the forest
and bring it home.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.280
If anyone's ever
tried to do that,

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.490
it's actually a very
difficult task-- one,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.740
because there are not tree
stumps lying around for you

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.290
to pick up and take home.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.610
And if you do see a
whole fallen tree,

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:52.980
it'll take you five days to cut
through it without a chainsaw.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:58.300
So I decided to just build
my own cedar tree with cedar

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.960
bark and just a Styrofoam base.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.060
And that wound up in
a number of shots.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.340
This is the interior
of the Ewok village.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.500
And here I am using real fire.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.020
There's little candle
at the top by wicket.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.010
And the fire in
the middle, there's

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:20.410
a couple of candles in there.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.040
And the final shot here.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.470
The word is "storytime."

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.200
This is from "Return
of the Jedi."

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.285
And then here's the tree for
the outdoor scene in the Ewok

00:33:34.285 --> 00:33:34.785
village.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.440
And for this scene here
where Luke tells Leia

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.860
that they're related,
they're brother and sister,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.830
I actually feel my entire
studio slash office

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.730
with incense smoke,
just to create

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:54.770
a little bit of that haze
that's seen in the movie.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:59.590
So we did whatever we could
to try to recreate the tone

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.870
and feel of the movies.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.310
And those were the studio shots.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.464
And we also did some
location shooting as well.

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:11.380
I already showed you the
shot of the tauntaun.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.474
Here I am on Mount Seymour
doing another Hoth scene.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.360
There's the felted
Luke in the foreground.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.469
There's a cardboard snow speeder
that's crashed, which we built.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.620
And then for AT-AT,
we thought, well,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.203
we're not going to
reinvent the wheel.

00:34:29.203 --> 00:34:32.510
Let's just use that wonderful
Kenner plastic AT-AT that we

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.330
all remember from the '80s.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.620
And we got one of those, set
that up in the background.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.840
And then the final
shot looks like this.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.300
And I think with blurring
and people's understanding

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.860
of the scale of
the AT-AT, people

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.689
are imagining there's a
big menacing machine off

00:34:47.689 --> 00:34:48.355
in the distance.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.510
All right, here's the cover
for "Return the Jedi."

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:00.480
And those are, again--
the speeder bikes

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.240
were too hard to make, so we
decided to use toys again.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.280
And then we found
perfectly scaled ones.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.290
And we put our felt figures
on the speeder bikes,

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.180
set those up in the
forest, and that

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:19.770
wound up being the cover
of "Return of the Jedi."

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:21.920
And I live in Vancouver.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.850
My brother, he is a
writing professor.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.730
He lives in Ithaca, New York.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.560
But we decided, well,
we need some desert.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.659
And there's no desert in
Vancouver or New York.

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:32.700
So we decided to come down
to California find it.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.820
And this, in fact, is
the imperial sand dunes

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.240
where George Lucas filmed
parts of "Return of the Jedi."

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.100
So we thought why
not just go back,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.030
make a pilgrimage of sorts,
to where George Lucas filmed.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.800
And here I am in the desert.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.800
And we got this shot down there
of Luke rescuing Chewbacca

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.900
and Han Solo from
Jabba the Hutt.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.620
And we didn't know
this, but it's

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.110
incredibly windy in the desert.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.693
Maybe if you're from California,
that's like an obvious thing.

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:06.210
But you know, these images of
the desert seem quite tranquil,

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.560
but it's actually
violently windy out there.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.800
So I managed to get my shot
before like my whole set blew

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.160
apart from the wind.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.250
Chewbacca fell over
and broke the set.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.860
And in fact, there
were parts of the set

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.930
that fell down into a dune.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.160
It's like, I don't know if
you've ever walked a dune,

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.630
but it's kind of hard to go
all the way down 30, 40 feet

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.140
into the dune and walk back up.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.170
And there just happened to
be a couple of ATV riders

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.200
bombing around in that area.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.810
And they were nice enough to go
and fetch some of these pieces

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.760
for me.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.474
And even though California
does have desert,

00:36:42.474 --> 00:36:43.890
there's somethings
you can't find.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.980
And that is desert-- at
least we couldn't find it.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.520
We didn't know
where it was-- flat

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.980
desert all the way
to the horizon.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.560
The images that you
know of Tatooine,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.700
those were done in
Tunisia by George Lucas.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.210
And so here, we are in Arizona.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.610
And there's like cactuses
everywhere and mountains.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:03.630
And so we knew we weren't
going find any flat desert.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.270
So we just decided
to just dummy it up

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.970
with a couple of cardboard
boxes and a little bit of sand.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:13.180
And that wound up being
the cover of "A New Hope."

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.200
And there, we just
created the illusion

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.440
of that Tunisian desert.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.500
OK, so that's the
end of my discussion

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.750
about how we made the books.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.330
I just want to talk a little
bit more about my career change

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.910
and come to this principle
called ride mule chase horse.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.870
And that's a literal translation
of a Chinese proverb.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.180
And it means just hang
on to what you have

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.640
while you're looking
for something better.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.390
And even more directly,
don't quit your day job.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.940
Your mule is your day job, and
the horse is the dream job.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.760
And for me, when I was
making the transition,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.930
I was moonlighting as a
children's Illustrator

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.860
for three years before
I gave up my day job.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.950
And even today, I can't say
that I've made it, made it

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.920
as a children's Illustrator.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.520
I might have to go and get
a real job again sometime.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.200
I'm not sure.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.200
I hope to do this
as long as I can.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.300
But just when
you're starting out,

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.700
especially if you're
down-shifting-- someone like me

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.990
who had a well-paying,
high-stress time-consuming

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.810
job-- if you want to
downshift, sometimes people

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.470
think that the best
way to do that is

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.835
to just throw it all away.

00:38:34.835 --> 00:38:36.250
OK, I'm quitting today.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.140
I'm done.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.382
I'm going to go and
pursue my dream.

00:38:40.382 --> 00:38:41.840
But you know, the
research actually

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.026
shows if you're kind
of A type personality,

00:38:44.026 --> 00:38:45.900
you sort of strive on
a little bit of stress,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.420
you can actually be bored if
you're just quitting your job

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.830
and you're not sure exactly
what you're going to move onto.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.600
You're going to feel
the loss of status

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.470
and the loss of financial
freedom very acutely.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.740
So you're probably better
off taking on more than less.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.740
So that's what I wound
up doing for three years,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.900
is I actually took on more.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.350
So I had very young children.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.360
I was working as a lawyer and
basically used all my free time

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.870
on evenings and weekends to
work on the Cozy Classics books

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.010
to try to get that started.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.640
So in those first
two and a half years,

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.020
I only got two books done
because I didn't have much time

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:21.520
to do them.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.090
But it was certainly
an outlet for me.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:30.300
I think that when you have a
day job that sometimes you're

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.350
a little bit frustrated by,
you actually have more energy

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.384
to put into your side pursuits.

00:39:36.384 --> 00:39:37.800
If that becomes
your main pursuit,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.320
then maybe you're
not using that energy

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.110
that you get from being
frustrated from your day job

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.430
and pouring it
into your sideline.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.910
So I mean, that was a really
healthy energy for me to have,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.649
is like I was really
motivated to work

00:39:55.649 --> 00:39:56.940
on the needle felting projects.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.160
Because somewhere in
the back of my mind,

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.950
I knew it was kind of
crazy, but I thought, oh,

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.860
maybe a different life can come
from doing these children's

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.360
books.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.890
And it seems so far fetched,
my wife thought I was crazy.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.754
And fair enough.

00:40:11.754 --> 00:40:13.920
You've got a busy life and
you're spending your time

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.200
needle felting.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.650
But it has worked
out well for me.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:26.070
I had the great pleasure
of doing a Google

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.829
doodle this February.

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:30.870
I don't know if some of
you remember this or not,

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.470
but it is from February 17
commemorating Laura Ingalls

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.450
Wilder's birthday.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.650
She, of course, of "Little
House on Prairie" fame

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.460
And same kind of idea.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.750
Here's some behind
the scenes photos.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.800
Here I am making that
prairie landscape.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.430
Again, we wanted to
find this in Vancouver,

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.450
but we don't have this kind
of landscape in Vancouver.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.260
So we were forced to build it.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:08.670
And there's my brother building
the actual little house.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.870
Here we are doing
interior test shots.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:16.660
And then finally,
we took it outside

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.340
to shoot with natural lighting.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.649
And it was January
that we did this,

00:41:21.649 --> 00:41:23.190
so the light was
very low in the sky.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.380
So I had to tilt the whole set
to get a more summery angle

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.530
of light because it
would immediately

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:33.510
seem odd to have sun coming
at a very low angle for this.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.340
And so we actually
got bumped for a year.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.780
We were ready to go for 2014,
and then they said, oh, well,

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.780
we have a conflict.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.430
So we're going to have to
put you guys off to 2015.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.040
And we were kind of
bummed about that.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.290
So our idea is, well, if
the parents already love

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.860
the stories-- "Pride and
Prejudice," "Star Wars"--

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.940
maybe they'll present these
books with just that extra bit

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.730
of enthusiasm.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.060
And that will make kids
love books, love reading,

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:11.450
and hopefully just be a good
first step into a lifetime

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.940
of loving books.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.327
So thank you very
much for your time.

00:42:17.327 --> 00:42:19.410
This is the last image
from "Empire Strikes Back,"

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.000
of course.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.980
It's paired with
the word "goodbye,"

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.470
which is apropos for today.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.250
And I'd be very pleased
to take any questions

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.120
if anybody has any.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:31.710
Thank you.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.412
Yes?

00:42:34.412 --> 00:42:36.870
AUDIENCE: So with the Princess
Leia, the different hairdos,

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:37.369
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:45.857
HOLMAN WANG: For Princess
Leia, she had kind of a--

00:42:45.857 --> 00:42:47.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry, could
you repeat the question?

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.985
HOLMAN WANG: Oh, yes.

00:42:47.985 --> 00:42:53.630
The question is, how did you
recreate Princes Leia's hair?

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:57.390
And did you have to have
different versions of her head

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.740
or of her hair?

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.880
What I basically did was had
a very flat base of brown hair

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.300
to her head, and then I would
add extra pieces to that.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.090
So the buns could be
added and removed.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:17.410
Various kinds of braids
and as that sort of thing

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.760
were added and removed.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.680
But she had kind of a flat
base of brown felt on her head.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.012
But it was the same Leia head.

00:43:27.012 --> 00:43:28.970
Some of these felt figures
take quite a beating

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.360
while they go through
the process of making

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.860
a book because you're sort
of taking things apart

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.990
and putting them back on, yeah.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.490
Yes?

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.700
AUDIENCE: How [INAUDIBLE]
to work with your brother?

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.110
HOLMAN WANG: Well, my brother
and I-- I worked on "Star Wars"

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:46.590
full-time And he still had a
day job as a writing professor

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.590
at the college.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.390
So we both did the
needle felting,

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.930
although I did
the heavy lifting.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.950
But we both created
the felt figures.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.680
And I did the set building and
the photography in Vancouver.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.660
And because he's the
writing professor,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.547
he's the one who takes the
first crack at the words.

00:44:02.547 --> 00:44:03.880
And it seems a little bit silly.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.680
It's like, oh, well, how hard
can it be to write 12 words?

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.700
But we actually had to go
through many rounds of editing,

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.450
if you can believe it,
for those 12 words.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.300
Because it's almost like
if you have fewer words,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.890
you have to get
them perfect, right?

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.473
Because they have
to do a lot of work.

00:44:17.473 --> 00:44:19.680
They have to describe an image.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.720
They have to move
the narrative along.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.970
They have to express
Star Wars-y terms.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:33.240
So my brother and I went through
our own rounds of hashing out

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240
what the words would be.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.720
Then we had a round of
editing with Chronicle Books

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.950
and our editors there.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.780
And then finally, we had
a round with Lucas Film.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.970
So for example, the very first
picture in "Return of the Jedi"

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:50.180
is an image of R2-D2
and C3PO just in desert,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.930
just the two of them.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.950
And the word was
"robots" originally

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:58.530
because we thought, well, that's
the simplest word for children.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.550
And Lucas Films said no,
we need the word "droids,"

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.820
which is fair enough
because that's what is used.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.610
But we just thought, well,
if kids are going to say,

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.160
what's a droid, you're going
to say, well, they're robots.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.030
But they can learn
"droids" first.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.630
That's perfectly fine.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.740
So there's those kinds
of considerations

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.466
that go into figuring out what
the words should be, yeah.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.651
AUDIENCE: When Jack
came up with the idea

00:45:24.651 --> 00:45:28.419
about let's do these
books in so many words,

00:45:28.419 --> 00:45:31.540
had you guys already been
needle felting as a hobby?

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.529
Or how did that come into being?

00:45:33.529 --> 00:45:34.320
HOLMAN WANG: Right.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.240
So the question is
when my brother came up

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.160
with the concept
for Cozy Classics,

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.840
had we ever done
any needle felting?

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.200
The answer's no.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.110
We had no experience
whatsoever in needle felting.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:51.450
I had just seen my sister-in-law
make some small animals

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.340
or pieces of fruit.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.490
And it was just very
tangentially introduced

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.237
to even the concept
needle feting.

00:45:59.237 --> 00:46:01.070
Many people, when I
tell them I needle felt,

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.010
they don't know anything
about the technique at all.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:05.780
So it's still gaining
in popularity.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.590
But I just thought
it might be something

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.320
that I could try my
hand at and see if I

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:14.220
could create little figures.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.780
And basically, it's been
a lot of trial and error

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.990
to learn the techniques
that we have.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:22.829
I mean, certainly, if
for some crazy reason,

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:25.120
we were offered "Star Wars"
as the first needle felting

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.050
project, it would've been
a very different project

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.885
than what it is now.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:31.450
We sort of cut our teeth a
little bit on Cozy Classics.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.860
Like, the very first
Cozy Classics books,

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.110
you'll see subtle differences.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.840
For example, certain characters
don't even have eyebrows.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.090
They don't have thumbs.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.568
They don't have three
dimensional ears.

00:46:45.568 --> 00:46:47.860
OK, yeah, sure.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.392
Yeah, great, perfect.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.220
So we had to learn a lot of
different-- sort of teach

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.945
ourselves different
techniques and things improved

00:46:58.945 --> 00:47:01.320
over time to the point that
we could execute on something

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.660
like "Star Wars."

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.378
Yeah?

00:47:03.378 --> 00:47:04.294
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:07.615 --> 00:47:09.490
HOLMAN WANG: So the
question is, is that also

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.550
the case with the
photography and model making?

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.840
And absolutely, yeah.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.890
I would say yes.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.030
It's interesting because with
Cozy Classics and our first two

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.740
books, you can look at them.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.950
There's definitely a
very strong justification

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.680
for keeping things very
simple because children

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.260
who are very young,
they can't necessary

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.640
process a lot visually.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.510
So you want to keep
things very simple.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:40.640
So there's a kind of charm
about the simplicity and maybe

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.200
even crudeness of some of
the work at the beginning.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.530
It works quite well.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.530
But then when you get
to a Star Wars universe,

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.890
people expect to see
certain things, right?

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:51.660
And so it became a much
more complicated process

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.780
of replicating something
just as people know it.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.050
Because "Star Wars," of
course, it's a classic,

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.740
but it's a visual text, whereas
with classics like "Pride

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.260
and Prejudice," people
might have an idea of what

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.030
things look like.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.570
But you have a lot more license
to create things the way

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.610
you want.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:13.260
And so "Star Wars"
was definitely

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.200
a challenge of replicating
a visual text that people

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.720
are going to be very,
very protective of, right?

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:25.160
So yeah, our techniques
definitely improved.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.070
I'm also a self-taught
photographer as well.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.295
So in terms of those
techniques, certainly had

00:48:32.295 --> 00:48:34.140
to improve on those.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:34.640
Yes?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.791
AUDIENCE: Why the needling
felting as opposed

00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:37.990
to like clay? [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:45.800
HOLMAN WANG: The question is
why needle felting as opposed

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.390
to clay or some other way.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:54.260
To us, it just really seemed
like we needed a technique that

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.200
would, one, be appropriate
for very young children

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.860
but that would be interesting
for adults to look at.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:07.050
And that could be clay, but we
have seen clay artists before

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:08.802
in doing children's books.

00:49:08.802 --> 00:49:10.510
And it seemed a little
bit fresher for us

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.590
to do needling felting.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.930
And the plushness
seemed to be something

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:20.140
that would be appropriate for
very, very young children,

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.810
whereas the hand-craft
aspect was something

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.036
that adults would appreciate.

00:49:24.036 --> 00:49:25.410
So we were kind
of creating books

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:28.220
with a whole range
of audiences in mind.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:33.470
And we were reviewed in
"Apartment Therapy" recently,

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.280
and they said "Star Wars" books
are-- and it said age group.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.660
It said 1 to 100.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.760
And that's very gratifying
because they got it.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.510
These books are really
for any age group.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.590
And needle felting
for us was just,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.720
we thought, a technique that
really offered something

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.260
for everybody, yeah.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:50.760
Yes?

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.593
AUDIENCE: How long does
it take [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:56.260
HOLMAN WANG: Yeah, the
question is, how long does it

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.800
take to make the figures?

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:01.620
The really complicated ones--
Chewbacca, Darth Vader--

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.430
are on the order of like
50 or 60 hours to make.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:09.030
And the smaller ones, like
a little Ewok or Yoda,

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.450
would probably be
more around 20 hours.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:17.345
So it's very labor intensive.

00:50:17.345 --> 00:50:19.090
It's very labor intensive, yeah.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:20.006
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:22.902 --> 00:50:23.860
HOLMAN WANG: Pardon me?

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.780
AUDIENCE: Another revenue
stream might be to sell those.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.530
HOLMAN WANG: Yeah,
people-- the question

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.160
is about selling the figures.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.780
Many people ask about
buying the figures,

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.885
and we would have to--
well, first of all,

00:50:36.885 --> 00:50:38.176
we're not allowed to sell them.

00:50:38.176 --> 00:50:40.780
But even if we were,
they would have

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:46.070
to be one-off art
pieces that would-- I

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:48.680
wouldn't part with them except
for some exorbitant amount

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680
of money.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.010
Because I put so much time
and love into them, so yeah.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.340
OK, well, thank you all
very much for your time.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.360
I really appreciate it.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.443
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:50:59.443 --> 00:51:01.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:04.780
Great, thank you, Holman.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:09.010
Any last questions
before we wrap up?

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:13.140
AUDIENCE: Are there any
other [? dramas ?] or stories

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.287
that you would ever
want to pursue?

00:51:15.287 --> 00:51:15.786
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:20.570
HOLMAN WANG: Right.

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.010
The question is are there
other kinds of books

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.090
that we want to adapt?

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:29.180
We certainly have lots of ideas
about what we'd like to do.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.740
We're doing more Cozy Classics,
so we're doing more things

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.640
in the public domain.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.840
We're working on "The
Nutcracker" right now.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.280
The "Wizard of Oz" is
coming out in 2017.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:42.240
So those projects are-- and
right now, our Cozy Classics

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.110
are with a Vancouver publisher.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.930
But they're all going to be
reissued by Chronicle Books

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:48.490
next year.

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:50.430
So woo-hoo, that's awesome.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:53.929
We're really happy to be
moving over to Chronicle

00:51:53.929 --> 00:51:54.720
with Cozy Classics.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.930
There are other
things that we would

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:05.410
like to adapt, something like
the "Chronicles of Narnia,"

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:10.382
"Harry Potter," "Little Pie in
the Sky," something like that.

00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:12.090
Right now, for us,
the question is, do we

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:17.320
want to do more licensed
projects, or whether we want

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.510
to create something on our own.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.470
Because I think our felt
figures might lend themselves

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:25.220
to creating our own
universe of characters

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.070
that people can love directly,
not just be derivative

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.090
of another franchise.

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.360
So that's our
question right now--

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.490
is whether we want to
embark on that project

00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:38.402
and create our own
universe of characters.

00:52:38.402 --> 00:52:40.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great,
thank you so much.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.669
It was a great presentation.

00:52:41.669 --> 00:52:42.960
We hope you have you back soon.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.810
HOLMAN WANG: Thank
you very much.
