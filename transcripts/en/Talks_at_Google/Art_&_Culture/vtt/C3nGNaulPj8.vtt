00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.910
KATE FLINT: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.060
And thank you to
Google for inviting me.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.130
It is a real treat to be
here, let me tell you.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.900
All photography requires light.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.850
But the sudden intrusive light
of flash photography is unique.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.030
It's quite unlike
the illumination

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.590
that comes from the sun or
even from artificial lighting.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.640
"Flash!"

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
is the first book to
tell the history of flash

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.330
and its effects and
associations in a way that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.695
links it to the broader
history of photography.

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.030
And I'm interested
in it in particular,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.460
because flash photography
breaks down familiar categories

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.240
and hierarchies, since
it's used across the board.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.840
It's used for fine artwork.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.470
It's used for news photography.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.140
It's used for amateur snapshots.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.310
It's been used to reveal
shocking social conditions.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.880
It puts on display the
most overlooked corners

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.680
of everyday life.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.000
Paparazzi chase
celebrities with flash.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.410
Large public events and
intimate family occasions

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.390
are captured through flash.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.690
Flash is used to record and
detect crime and its aftermath.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.550
What's more, flash is used not
just to illuminate darkness

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.840
but also, so to
speak, to stop time.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.340
It allows one to photograph
really rapidly moving objects,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.410
like the ball of
ice cream that's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.360
being flipped into a milkshake.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.330
So in the book I ask, what is it
that makes flash photography so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.100
distinctive?

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.150
And I think, too, about
flash's associations,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.310
like the connection
of flash with memory.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.910
I do things like
tracing the origin

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.310
of the cinematic flashback.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.050
And I think about the concepts
of flash drives or flashbulb

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.400
memories.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720
So this history is
about several things.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.820
It's about a piece of
technological apparatus--

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.540
or rather, successive
pieces of apparatus

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.380
that are used to provide
enough illumination to take

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.770
an effective photograph
in a particular place,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.290
at a particular time, when
there wouldn't otherwise

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.410
be enough light to do so.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.060
It's concerned, too, with the
practice of flash photography

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.040
and the uses to
which it's been put.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.320
And more provocatively,
it's about light itself

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.960
and its relationship to time.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.700
So I ask questions like,
how long is a flash?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.270
And then what happens if
a flash is too bright?

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.890
Can one have too much light, as
with the biggest flash of all,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.250
that of the atomic bomb?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.370
So in a moment, I'm
going to elaborate

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.990
on four specific features.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.480
And I want to locate
them in various phases

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.100
of flash photography's history.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.730
I want to think about the
sense of astonishment and awe

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.310
that it originally evoked.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.760
I want to think about that
capacity to stop time.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.060
I want to think
about flash's ability

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.230
to light up dark places,
to break into darkness.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.400
And I want to think, too,
about flash's associations

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.490
with violence and aggressiveness
and invasiveness and intrusion.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.130
And then I'm going
to wind up by looking

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.240
at the work of some
contemporary photographers whose

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.370
experimentation rescues flash
photography from the bad press

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.870
that it's increasingly received
during the 20th and 21st

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.339
century.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.970
But first, a little
bit of history.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.280
So the history of
flash goes right back

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.800
to the early days
of photography when

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.980
people needed more
light than was provided

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.200
by sunlight or daylight.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.320
And they tried to use,
first of all, limelight

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.170
and then brightly
burning magnesium

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.600
to provide illumination.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.530
And I think that this is
the very first photograph

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.690
to be taken by flash.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.680
It was taken using
limelight in 1839.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.310
It's actually a
daguerreotype of a fossil.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.600
But it was so hit and miss
for a number of decades.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.040
In most circumstances, limelight
produced really over-bleached

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.390
images.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.670
Magnesium was somewhat better.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.950
It was burnt as wire to
take pictures of caves.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.650
It was blown in powder
form through a flame.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.380
It certainly produced
better images.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.180
But until extraction became
cheaper in the 1880s,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.820
magnesium was not
just expensive,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.940
but it was somewhat unreliable.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.610
And then, all importantly, in
1887 a compound flash powder

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.550
was invented by a couple
of German chemists.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.980
And this could be exploded
in so-called flash guns.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.560
Early ones even looked
like a very crude pistol.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.050
It could be ignited on a tray.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.170
It was available for
do-it-yourself mixing.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.720
It was supplied on
impregnated sheets.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
Or it was made into
little explosive devices,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.750
rather like tea bags.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.940
And then the flashbulb,
pioneered in the late 1920s,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.570
coming into more general
use around 1930--

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.540
its ease, its
portability, completely

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.410
transformed news journalism.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.930
The earliest cheap
cameras with synchronized

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.790
flash date from around 1940.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.540
And then, after
World War II, a line

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.270
stretches from
little flash bulbs

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.750
to flash cubes to the
electronic flash that's

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.650
now a built-in part of
most consumer cameras.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.120
And then there's also that
bright burst of LED light

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.120
that one finds on cellphones.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.400
These developments overlapped.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.150
And there are many
variants to be found

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.210
within flash's technology.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.450
What remains linked, and
what remains constant,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.220
though, is the linking of flash
photography in advice manuals,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.410
in specialist publications, in
advertising with the modern--

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.820
indeed, with the flashy.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.600
There's a great TV ad from the
1960s that goes, "It's new.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.440
It's now.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.950
It's flash cube," together
with some very Dave Clark

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.260
Five-style music and linking
flash to the dance floor

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.390
and to the swinging '60s.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.650
And then you see here, on the
right, how Sylvania flashbulb

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.720
publicity even offered the
homemaker, for $3 and a coupon,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.550
a foam rubber Sylvania
pop art pillow.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.570
You can make your home swing
now for practically no money

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.320
at all.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.710
You, too, can have a
picture of a flashbulb

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.320
there in your living room.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.810
And yes, I found one
on eBay, and I do.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.120
OK.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.140
Before I go onto those four
categories I was talking about,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.120
I want to make an
important point.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.930
And it's one that has excited
me in conceptual terms

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.330
throughout my research.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.970
And that point is
that flash photography

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.930
is a practice that overturns
some of what we think

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.330
that we know about photography.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.320
Because in flash
photography, the exposure

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.940
is based on the very brief
flaring of an intense light.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.740
It's not you take
a picture and it's

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.060
like a freezing of
a moment of time

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.190
in a continuity that's
going on both sides of it.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.030
You create the light yourself
with flash photographs.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.590
They're not based on the opening
and closing of a shutter,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.910
according to the strength of
a continuously available light

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.020
source.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.060
Rather, flash causes
that sudden interruption.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.360
It breaks into the darkness.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.290
It's human made.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.380
What's more, if, as
can so easily happen

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.810
in flash photography, the flash
gets reflected onto a window

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.300
pane or a polished
surface, one's

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.800
really directly reminded of
the artifice and the technology

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.610
involved in the illumination.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.710
And we see this, too, when
as here, the brightness

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.540
of the flash results in part
of the plate or film being

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.370
flooded with light.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:31.820
And we see here, even, the hand
of the photographer setting off

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.480
that flash in its tray.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.130
And occasionally, too, other
forms of flash apparatus

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.370
appear, as there, in
John Collier's photograph

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.260
of a family in
northern New Mexico.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.510
When it's so obvious, as
it is in these photographs,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.500
that a flash has been
used, we can no longer

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.050
believe in the fiction that
somehow the lens of the camera

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.620
operates as the
photographer's eye.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.000
Indeed, at the very moment of
taking the flash photograph,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.690
the photographer, if
she's close to her camera,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.440
is going to have her
vision momentarily blinded

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.510
just as dramatically and
uncomfortably as her subject.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.070
So the eruption of
flash disorients subject

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.620
and photographer alike.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.110
And that's something that's
used to really great effect,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.430
of course, near the end of
Hitchcock's "Rear Window,"

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.230
where the effect
is really something

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:42.830
like seeing the flash from
inside your own eyeball.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.450
So let's look in more detail at
four central features of flash

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.250
photography, starting with the
shockingly bright explosion

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.570
of light itself and its capacity
for creating astonishment.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.420
Flashes of light
have for a long time

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.740
been associated with sudden
inspiration and clarity.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.680
Think about the revelation
of St. Paul on the road

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.390
to Damascus.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.320
And in the early decades
of flash photography,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.430
some of its practitioners
appropriated this sense

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.090
of quasi-divine
revelation, especially

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.950
if they were using
flash to expose

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.430
deplorable social conditions.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.620
Jacob Riis, for example, working
as an investigative journalist

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.430
in New York in the
late 1880s, saw himself

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.920
as he took up this
new technology

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.500
as providing illumination.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.490
And the transcendental
overtones of his vocabulary

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.090
helped to underscore its
significance as an instrument

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.540
of intervention and purgation.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:06.180
"I hate darkness and dirt
anywhere and naturally want

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.800
to let in the light," he said.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.650
In the early decades
of flash photography,

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.980
commentators looked for
appropriate language

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.980
in which to write about it.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.590
If a theologically-based
vocabulary

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.710
suited some of its
ends, if occasionally it

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.780
was called "bottled sunlight,"
the most pervasive metaphor

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.150
used to describe flash was
the phenomenon of lightning.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.080
Because lightning
shocks, startles,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.450
interrupts the moment--

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:47.430
or creates it, rather, in a
sudden instant of illumination,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:51.390
rendering everything around
it preternaturally clear

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.200
by contrast to the
surrounding darkness.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.440
Lightning was commonly
used in romantic art

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.900
and writing-- you know,
think of Frankenstein--

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.300
to invoke awe, grandeur,
the sublime, the unknowable,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.460
or even being shocked
by some sudden light.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.470
Looking to borrow
the connotations

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.090
of this electrical energy, Adolf
Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.610
who invented the first
flash powder in 1887,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.690
called it Blitzlichtpulver,
or lightning light powder.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.210
And lightning bolts,
as at the bottom,

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.010
as here, long continued to
feature in the advertising

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.960
of flash bulbs and cameras.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.800
And indeed, there's probably
one of those bolts signifying

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.560
a flash feature on your
cell phone right now.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.150
The artificial flash and
the flash of lightning

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.670
seem superficially really close.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.320
Indeed, they are
compressed and amalgamated

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.460
in this deliberately brief
poem by Bill Knott, "Flash."

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.610
In its entirety, it
flares up and reads,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.250
"Photographs--
lightningbolts which,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.560
their shadows having caught
up with them, perish."

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.320
But in fact, lightning
and the photographic flash

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.360
are very different.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.350
Lightning is unpredictable.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.260
It's uncontrollable in its
occurrence and its location.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.140
When you represent
lightning, almost always

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.040
it means being at some
kind of distance from it.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.420
Flash photography doesn't
give us any such distance.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.710
It's often quite
literally in your face.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.720
In other words,
flash doesn't live up

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.110
to those awe-inspiring
expectations set up

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.200
for it through a
comparison with lightning.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.000
And above all,
that's because it's

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.140
the product of human agency.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.310
But exploring the
differences between the two I

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.710
found really productive.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.170
Because it's helped
me understand

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.390
what is distinctive about
flash as a technological form

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.980
of illumination.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.160
It also brings home
that long-lasting desire

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.830
to make grandiose claims for
the almost defined properties

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.270
of technology, even
as technology here

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.170
is coupled with the
innovative and the modern.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.950
And being coupled
with the innovative

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.670
leads us to the whole
idea of stopping time.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.170
Because the technology of
flash is about speed as well as

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.890
about light.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.980
The word flash is commonly
used, as you know,

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.260
in all kinds of contexts--

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.540
not necessarily visual ones--

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.320
to indicate the extremely
short or the transitory

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.320
or the spontaneous, as in flash
mobs and flash floods and flash

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.000
fiction.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.850
The two meanings of the
words signifying speed,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:06.760
signifying light, converge
in high speed photography.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.720
Photographic pioneer
Fox Talbot in 1851

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.510
was the first to patent
the use of a spark

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.120
to capture a moving object.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.870
That was an experiment
said to have been suggested

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:25.330
by how lightning flash at night
seems to freeze drops of rain

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.030
or freeze the water
playing in a fountain

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.220
so it looks stationary.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.190
Unfortunately, there's
only verbal, no visual,

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.810
evidence for this.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.130
We have to wait until the
work of Arthur Worthington

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.140
in the late 19th century.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.190
He showed us what
a splash really

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.690
looks like by using
electrical spark photography.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.090
Then, most notably,
there are all

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.740
the really beautiful pictures
produced by Harold Edgerton

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.500
in the mid 20th century.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.050
And Edgerton's
high speed images,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:07.210
made by very high speed bursts
of light from electrically

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.960
controlled neon tubes, created
the illusion of stopped motion.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.650
Whether he's showing milk drops
falling or bullets piercing

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.760
playing cards or
bananas or balloons

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.050
or whether he's showing golfers
or tennis players swinging

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.650
at balls, these are
photographs that

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.570
break down the distinctions
between science and art.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.300
And they reveal far
more than is ever

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.940
available to the human eye.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.070
They're a really
powerful manifestation

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:47.940
of what Walter Benjamin called
"the optical unconscious."

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.000
High speed flash's
techniques continue

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.910
to be used by
photographers to create

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.420
eye-catching, arresting effects.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.330
Japanese photographer
Shinichi Maruyma, for example,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:07.170
has produced these images by
throwing water, here, or ink

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:12.040
into the air and then capturing
the forms as they fall.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.670
Ori Gersht's work simultaneously
references old master paintings

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.000
and Harold Edgerton
when, for example, he

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.460
shows a bullet exploding
a freeze-dried pomegranate

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.000
into an airy bowl of shards.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.570
Hiroshi Sugimoto's
theaters series,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.450
consisting of long
exposure photographs taken

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:41.160
in cinemas which produce an
image of a plain, extremely

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.730
bright white light
on the screen,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:50.840
is, in some ways, though,
the antithesis of flash.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.910
He actually has his lens
open for two or more hours,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.220
the length of the movie.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.690
And the end result is this
really stunningly bright

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.970
blank rectangle.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.350
It's a composite image.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.350
It's a record of the
many, many flashes that

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.460
go to make up the motion
picture, certainly

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.570
in pre-digital form.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.550
It's a film distilled
into a flash.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.770
What's more, as
Sugimoto puts it,

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.650
this is not simply white light.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.520
He calls it the result
of too much information.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.980
And I think that this last
phrase can be seen as a rebuff

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.740
to the speed with
which we're invited

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.900
to view, to experience, to
consume, not just a film,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.460
but culture in general,
life in general.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:51.550
Sugimoto is saying we're not
given enough time to reflect.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.350
There are too many
continual demands

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.460
on our attention, made by
the rapid interruptions

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.830
of technological modernity.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.830
Flash photography's
relationship to time

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.880
has always been a
really double-edged one.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.360
It allows one to see
the beauties of a moment

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.140
that we couldn't
ever visually process

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.630
without mechanical aids.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.750
But it's also being
continually associated,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.340
especially in the second half
of the 20th century and beyond,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.920
with a kind of here
today, gone tomorrow

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.080
speediness of superficial
consumer culture.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.910
Somehow, flash photography
still is hung around

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.560
with all of those
associations with flashiness

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.890
and superficiality.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.910
But flash, obviously enough,
is extraordinarily useful.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.430
And let's think about
what happens when it's

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.360
used to light up dark places.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.210
I've already talked
about Jacob Riis's desire

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.410
for the social and
illumination and transformation

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.040
that he thought flash
photography could bring about.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.600
And this is something
that he shared

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.230
with other documentarians
like Lewis Hine,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.220
or like one of the
earliest American woman

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.240
photojournalists,
Jessie Tarbox Beals, who

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.510
exposed both the
despair of poverty

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.660
and the drive towards
respectability

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.840
that she witnessed in the
tenements of Newark, New

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.930
Jersey.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.650
Flash, in other words, has been
indispensable to the practice

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.360
of documentary.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.510
It's in relation to
documentary that we encounter

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:54.240
most starkly its most singular
and its most contradictory

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.470
aspects--

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:59.580
on the one hand, its
impetus towards revelation

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.910
and its capacity
to render visible

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.290
what we would otherwise
never see, and on the other,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.840
its associations with
unwelcome intrusion.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.510
Documentary work
brings out, as well,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.220
a further notable characteristic
of flash photography--

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.660
and that's its impetus
towards the democratic,

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.260
the way in which
it gives emphasis

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.340
to all the elements
of an interior.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.870
Because especially in the early
decades of its use in the 1890s

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:43.080
the 1900s, it really couldn't
be carefully controlled.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.890
So many details very
often take on a kind

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.440
of unplanned prominence.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.070
A sudden flare of light
reveals with clarity

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.600
each dent on a kitchen
utensil, each photograph

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.500
on a mantle shelf,
or each image hanging

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.550
or pasted on the walls--

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.190
each cherished
ornament, each piece

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.720
of polished furniture, or
stained and scuffed floor,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.160
or domestic cat, or
marble fireplace,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.360
each accumulation of dust, each
shiny button, each wrinkle.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.710
Flash can bring something
out of obscurity.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.900
It can reveal
details never fully

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:37.260
visible to those who experience
them on a daily basis.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.880
And this giving
prominence to objects

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.200
and apparently kind
of random assemblage

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.980
is one major way in
flash's usefulness

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.730
is invoked for so-called
visual anthropology.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:59.420
Visual anthropology is a term
pioneered by the Farm Security

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.200
photographer John
Collier, seen here

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:09.020
flaring his flash onto a
dressing table of objects

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.780
in a Pueblo home, where you see
both traditional bits of Pueblo

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.310
ceremonial materials and
family photographs and a very

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:24.640
modern alarm clock and a little
figurine of a horse and a whip

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.000
on the right hand side--

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.620
all kinds of things.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.940
The detail that flash gives
us can deepen our knowledge

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.600
of the material environment
and of the lives of those

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.160
who live there.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.460
And I think that much of the
fascination of early flash

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.430
photography, of the images
that I've just shown you,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.690
come precisely from
this privileged access

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.660
to the lives of others.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.300
Flash, as well as
being responsible

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.090
for a violent
interruption, allowed

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.900
for the preservation
and representation

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.790
of the ordinary--

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.360
of what Jacques
Ranciere in his thesis,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.810
really beautifully
terms "the apprehension

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.730
of the inexhaustible historicity
found at every street corner,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.890
in every skin fold, and
at every moment of time."

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.370
Flash, that is to
say, is associated,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.120
not just with that rapid
explosion of light,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.670
but with enabling
and encouraging

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.720
a form of attentive
looking turned upon very

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.420
everyday surroundings.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.330
Now the invention
of the flash bulb

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.200
made documenting
interiors even easier.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.480
This is something
that we see reflected

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.750
in the archives of the Farm
Security Administration.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.480
We've just seen a
couple of examples

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.970
in the early 1930s
and early 1940s.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.560
It also gave more control.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.520
While flash readily makes
visible every last stain,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.640
smudge, and scratch,
it can also work

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.470
to emphasize cleanliness
and respectability.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.500
Some of the FSA
photographers, though,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.200
were really reluctant
to use flash.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.900
And this brings us to
the last of the areas

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.180
that I want to
consider, and that's

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.540
flash's association with
violence, aggression,

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.700
and invasiveness.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.270
Because it's really fair
to ask, what, if anything,

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:40.090
might justify flash's unexpected
intrusion into daily lives,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.820
especially if you don't know
the photographer already.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.510
Among the FSA photographers,
Dorothea Lange, for example,

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.030
saw its use as really invasive.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.270
Ben Shahn had some doubts,
both about photographing

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.050
someone else's private
space, but also

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:05.520
about flash's very aesthetic.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.420
"When some of the people came
in and began to use flash,"

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.250
he said--

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.750
and he's looking back
to the late 1930s--

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.030
"I thought it was immoral.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.430
You know, you come into
a sharecropper's cabin

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.930
and it's dark.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.480
But a flash destroyed
that darkness.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.400
It's true that a
flash would actually

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.680
illuminate the comic
papers that they

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.620
used to paste on their walls."

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.210
But what met to the biggest
impact on him, he said,

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.130
was not actually the
poverty that walls papered

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:40.060
like this revealed, but
something far less tangible,

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.710
something that, in fact,
was far less easy to record.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.190
"It was," he said, "the
darkness, the glistening

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.530
of eyes, the
glistening of a brass

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.050
ornament on top of a big bed.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:56.550
You know, a glass, a mirror,
that would catch light.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.070
Now, that's a matter
of personal judgment

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.880
about this thing, whether
you divulge everything

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.860
as a flash would do, or whether
things are kept mysterious

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.880
as they are viewed."

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.580
This refusal to use flash was
in part a question of ethics.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.630
But it was also in part a
desire to grant darkness

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.960
its own mysterious qualities.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.040
It was also, for many
mid-century photographers,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.190
a desire just to use
so-called available light

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.460
as a matter of purity and
a matter of distinguishing

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.110
themselves as art photographers
from news photographers

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.420
or commercial photographers.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:47.610
Cartier-Bresson, in particular,
[SIGHS] wanted "no photographs

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.890
taken with the
aid of flashlight,

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.580
if only out of respect
for the actual light--

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.700
even where there
is not any of it."

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.100
He said, that to use
flash is "impolite,

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.360
like coming to a concert
with a pistol in your hand."

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.750
The African American
Roy DeCarava

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.170
said, "I don't try
and alter light,

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.440
which is why I never use flash.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.410
I hate it with a
passion, because it

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.240
obliterates what I saw."

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.520
Of course, the introduction
of the flashbulb

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.820
had greatly enhanced the
ability of press photographers

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.420
to work at night.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.730
And so it consolidated the
association of flash newspaper

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.370
photographers and
the documentation

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.780
of crimes committed under
the cover of darkness.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.230
Flash was increasingly
used by police forces,

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:48.240
by journalists, even by
detectives for recording crimes

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.380
and criminals.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.920
And it inspired detective
fiction and film.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.810
I really recommend George
Harmon Coxe's Flash Casey,

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:02.640
and less recommend the TV
series, "Man With a Camera"

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.560
from the 1950s, largely
because it is so obviously

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.690
a vehicle, a commercial vehicle,
for Sylvania flashbulbs.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.110
It's a huge plug for
them-- so much so that

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.850
the star, Charles Bronson,
he complained really grumpily

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.650
that, "by the 10th
week I realized

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.300
I was playing second
banana to a flashbulb."

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.220
But nobody more famously
brought flash and crime together

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.720
than Weegee.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.980
recording murders,
accidents, arrests.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.460
His self-publicity was
completely synonymous

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.360
with his Graflex Speed
Graphic camera and its flash

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.070
synchronizer, to the extent
that he once montaged himself

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.500
into a flashbulb.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.310
Even Weegee, though, despite
his reliance on the flashgun,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:01.890
expressed some ambiguity
about its powers.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.840
And the frontispiece to his
1945 photo book, "Naked City,"

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.260
suggests through
visual irony that he

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.580
knew it was possible to stand
back from flash's illumination,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.230
and acknowledge a potentially
more sublime electrical force.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.870
I think this is a
really atypical moment

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.780
of humility on Weegee's part.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.410
Overall, his work added to
that growing association

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.500
of the flash with aggression
and intrusiveness,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.560
especially in the
hands of the rapacious

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.250
and sensation-seeking
news photographer.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.210
And nowhere has this
determined intrusiveness

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:46.740
been more apparent than
in the work of paparazzi.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.850
The popping of flashbulbs
has become visual shorthand

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.660
for the achievement
of fame or notoriety.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.680
And this firing off,
a barrage of light,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.200
can be a terrifying onslaught.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.220
Think of King Kong
brought to New York City,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:11.010
exhibited on stage, and then
startled into destructive rage

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.960
by the flashes of
newspaper photographers.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.570
Paparazzi flash has come to
equal unwelcome exposure.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:25.230
And paparazzi themselves
really work as a stand

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.100
in for the worst excesses
of the exploitative,

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.280
the invasive photographer,
caring for nothing

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.000
other than hunting
down the shot.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.070
So flash photographers have
come to take on a bad name.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.670
In my conclusion, I'm
going to really ask,

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.740
can flash photography
be redeemed?

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.630
Flash photography is no
longer awe-inspiring.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.810
Indeed, it still can
disturb us today--

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.980
and largely, I guess,
because we experience it

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.750
as invading our private
space, hurting our eyes,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.440
breaking into whatever
we might be looking at,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.720
or thinking about.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.500
By and large, photographic
flash has lost its novelty.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.610
It's certainly lost all
association it might ever

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.470
have had to the sublime.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.570
It's now a finely-tuned means
of creating and controlling

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.560
light--

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.300
not just illuminating darkness
but providing fill flash

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:41.150
or, as Martin Parr does,
intensifying color.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.280
But however pragmatic
this might be,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.140
it's very much been at the
expense of an aesthetics that

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.260
emphasizes the surprising,
the unpredictable,

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.870
and the revelatory.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.280
But in contemporary
photography, flash

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.590
has recently come to take
on a strong self-referential

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.700
presence.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.760
And often this calls
attention to one or more

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.310
of the major themes
that I've talked about--

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:15.260
illumination, speed,
violence, paparazzi.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.920
And sometimes, photographers
try to recapture

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.639
some of its early properties,
showing that it can still

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.850
captivate and astound.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.719
Flash illumination
registers most obviously

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.719
when the photographer
deliberately calls attention

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:37.070
to the artifice that they're
employing, as here, not least

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.310
by calling the image "Flash."

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.810
Or in Maya Dickerhof's
image, "Family,"

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.409
from a series which
is called "Memory."

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:53.060
And this is an image that riffs
off amateur mistakes-- getting

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.540
too close with the
flash, bleaching out

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.960
what it is that you really
want to take the photograph of,

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.460
the family grouping
in the middle.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.530
Via its title, though--

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.760
or the title of the
series, "Memory"--

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.900
it speaks to how difficult it
can be to recollect a moment

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.270
except through a photograph,
because that bleaching

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:22.190
light stands for time's passage,
the fading, obliterating

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.520
effects of memory that
family photography

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.510
so desperately tries to deny.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.750
Or a quite different
[INAUDIBLE] paparazzi work

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:39.410
is appropriated by Cindy Sherman
in "Untitled Film Still #54."

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:44.510
And so here she is caught
in flash's sudden glare

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.180
with her expression
somewhere between

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.390
surreptitious and angry--

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.320
sort of somewhere between
Marilyn Monroe and Princess Di.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:00.260
Or consider the series by German
artist Viktoria Binschtok,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.640
"Flash."

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.120
In pale greys and
whites, her images

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.200
show very faintly,
barely discernible,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.810
a celebrity actor
walking through a crush

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.170
of photographers
entering their car.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.210
And I think the point
that she is making

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.240
is that both image
and celebrity may

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:26.290
be said to be overexposed
through flash.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.930
This intense
bleaching, of course,

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.170
recalls flash's
largest and most deadly

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:36.030
form, one that I showed earlier,
the flash of the nuclear bomb--

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:40.500
the extreme point reached
by flashes that accompany

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.920
potentially lethal activity.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.030
The close relationship of flash
photography to actual weaponry

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.890
is explicitly referenced in
British photographer Sarah

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.280
Pickering's "Celestial
Objects" series.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.150
Unlike Harold Edgerton, who
uses the strobe light to turn

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:04.860
the flight of a bullet into a
disconcerting thing of beauty

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.520
rather than a display
of force, Pickering

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.700
opens up her camera's
shutter and photographs

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.800
a bullet fired from a
revolver in the complete dark.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.480
All the light comes from
the explosion itself.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.940
In her use of darkness and
flame, the blur of light

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.150
and the white hot core
of gunpowder's ignition,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:34.860
she returns flash photography to
the unpredictable and thrilling

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.800
category of the sublime.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.370
And the raw power of
electrical discharge,

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.340
too, is still being
used by photographers.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.860
Floris Neususs made his
Nachtbilder, his night photos,

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.410
by leaving sheets of
photographic paper

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.730
out at night in thunderstorms
so that they carry the imprint

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.750
of exposures made by lightning.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.330
And Hiroshi Sugimoto's
"Lightning Fields" project

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.820
deliberately harks
back to earlier

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.090
technological experimentation,
like Etienne Leopold

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:13.770
Trouvelot's studies of sparks.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.640
As well, too, through its
title, "Lightning Fields,"

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.780
evoking the potential for
natural sublimity inherent

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.040
in Walter de Maria's New
Mexican installation.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.180
As with Neususs'
work, no camera is

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.780
involved in Sugimoto's
"Lightning Fields."

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.680
He introduced a Van de Graaff
generator into his studio,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.350
capturing on film its 400,000
volt electrical charges.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.410
The end results look
a bit like streaks

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.200
of lightning branching
off, root-like,

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.870
from an incandescent
spinal core.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.550
Or they look like trees.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.640
Or they looked like Edward
Weston's cabbage leaf.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.360
They look like bleached
trunks and leaves and branches

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.040
in a pitch dark landscape, or
like forms of primeval life

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.670
turning and sending
out fern-like tendrils

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.590
of new growth in swirling water.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.490
So in the cultural history
of flash photography

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.400
that I've been
outlining, we see how

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.100
it's been useful for
practical ends, how

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.630
it's been useful in journalism,
and in fine art work.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.250
To be sure, flash is often
irritating or invasive.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:36.610
And in the book, I show
how these associations

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.260
of interruption
and of irritation

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:43.090
are taken up in
literature and in film.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.060
But as Sugimoto's
"Lightning Fields" suggests,

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.060
the imaginative
photographer can still

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:55.000
turn sudden and surprising
light to thought-provoking ends.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.840
Despite the bad press that
flash photography has received--

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.180
and I would argue, plenty
of times really quite

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.890
justifiably--

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.440
despite the bad press
that it's received

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.250
over the century and a
half since its invention,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.070
something of its
original sense of wonder

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:17.020
may still, very
effectively, be reclaimed.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.708
Thank you.

00:40:23.919 --> 00:40:25.210
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:26.460
We do have time for questions.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.676
Please raise your hand
if you have a question.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.916
I can start with one
whilst you're thinking.

00:40:34.916 --> 00:40:36.290
So my question
would be, it seems

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:42.060
quite unusual to specifically
talk about flash photography.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.910
What got you interested
in this subject?

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.630
KATE FLINT: I was--

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.350
OK, I've got a background
in both literature

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:53.970
and in art history.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.660
And I've written quite a lot
about Victorian visuality

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.770
and visual cultures.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.510
And I was deeply aware that I
haven't ever written very much

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.070
about photography.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.580
And so I started a project
which was about language

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.820
and photography, and the
kind of language that people

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.750
use to write about
photographic images,

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.840
and the taking of images,
and the representation

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.180
of photographers
within literary texts--

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.740
that kind of thing.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.840
But I'm also a photographer.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.960
And I was-- and I showed
one of my pictures

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:33.670
earlier of lightning striking
over some hills in New Mexico.

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.430
And I was just
thinking, wow, it's

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.020
hard, unless you're
taking a video,

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.375
to take photographs
of lightning.

00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:42.270
And then I thought, huh.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.300
I mean, you wouldn't use
flash to take a lightning

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.130
photo at night.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:50.880
But I wonder if people ever
brought lightning and flash

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.080
together.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.540
And so yes, the tool was Google.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.920
I went off and thought,
lightning, flash, photography.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.530
And I turned up
so many references

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.260
in the 19th century
in particular

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.940
that I started to write
a lecture about that.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.970
I had to give a lecture
at a conference on light.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.370
And it's like so often
with projects, you

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.900
start off with
something that you

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.560
think might be a chapter
or even half a chapter.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.830
And before you know where you've
gone, you've found out so much,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.800
and you've gotten
so excited about it,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.180
that it's just mushroomed
into an entire project.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.490
So that was how it got going.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:33.770
I think that this--

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:38.190
I mean, I'm intrigued that I,
myself, very, very, very rarely

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.530
use flash as a photographer.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.680
And I don't know if there are
photographers among you here

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.060
who want to claim, yes,
I use it all the time.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.140
I'll do anything
other than use flash,

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.170
except for fill
photography in daylight.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.001
But I felt I
learned a lot more--

00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:58.170
felt I'd gotten a
lot more respect

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.570
for the aesthetics of flash
through writing this book.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.760
And so that was a really kind of
great but surprising byproduct

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.670
for me.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.284
Yes.

00:43:10.284 --> 00:43:11.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.482
This talk, it's amazing.

00:43:13.482 --> 00:43:15.440
As a continuation,
actually, from what you said

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.120
and from your
question, do you think

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.570
there is room, a good place
for flash photography,

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.090
in today's society,
given that it

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.230
is considered intrusive,
aggressive, quite violent.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.314
Where do you think flash
could be better used?

00:43:30.314 --> 00:43:31.730
KATE FLINT: I think
sometimes it's

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.630
just going to be necessary
because you are somewhere

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:41.240
where you can't bring
in studio lights.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:46.340
But I think that,
firstly, the improvement

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:52.460
of digital photography and
the speed of digital chips

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.080
means that a lot
of the time, you

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.920
don't need flash nearly
as much as you used to,

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.470
just even for
taking a photograph,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.390
an ordinary photograph,
in a room like this.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:05.480
You wouldn't even think,
probably, about using flash.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.050
I'm much more
intrigued by somebody--

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.330
I mean Martin Parr is
the most obvious example

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.590
I can think of--

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.290
who does use flash
in daylight and uses

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.050
it to make color pop
out just a bit more.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.740
And now, he knows he could make
that color pop with Photoshop.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.770
But he still prefers
to use flash.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.560
But he's not using
a flash attachment

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.660
like most of us would use
on a camera, or, you know,

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.280
holding a flash gun at the side.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.720
He actually uses a ring flash,
which was developed for taking

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.480
photographs in your
mouth at the dentist's.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.810
And so that doesn't
show a big shadow.

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:50.930
It was used a lot for fashion
photography in the 1980s.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:52.710
There was a whole--

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.060
there's an amazing kind of
cover of "Vogue" with Linda

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.830
Evangelista, herself holding
up a kind of a flash gun

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.350
photograph using ring flash.

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.470
And I think that that
is an example of sort

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.860
of experimentation with
the lighting technique

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.900
that happens to be
flash but happens

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.960
to be the right technique
for Parr for the effects

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.820
that he is trying to create.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:21.380
But I do wonder whether the
current photographic interest

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.470
or an interest that's been
going on maybe 10, 15 years

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:28.070
and saying, let's use a
photograph to think about flash

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.220
and to think about the
effects that it creates,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.590
whether they're good
or bad, has something

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:37.700
to do with a kind of a
diminishing use of it

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:44.120
except, in particular,
by paparazzi, by news

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.860
photographers, and suchlike.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:50.730
Though, of course, ever
since the allegations,

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.250
which seem not to
be true at all,

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:55.340
but it was a flash
going off being

00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:01.940
fired into Princess Diana's car
that caused that car to crash.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.090
That kind of urban
legend is one of many

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:10.590
that has really consolidated the
totally bad rap that flash has.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.792
So people then play
and riff on that.

00:46:14.792 --> 00:46:16.250
Yes, I think I saw
your hand first.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.400
AUDIENCE: So you actually
just mentioned the bad rap

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.150
that flash has.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:29.330
And I guess to some degree,
it may be warranted,

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.660
especially if it's
used badly like it

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.330
might be by amateur
photographers that might--

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.240
especially the on-camera flash.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.430
Like, I always have to--

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.090
I'm sure that you
feel the same--

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:46.360
but I always have to
cringe when people, well,

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.900
quite obviously use their
camera in automatic mode.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.140
And then the pop-up
flash pops up

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.810
and then they take a
night photo outside

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.470
and use the flash for that,
or they take an indoor photo

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:02.550
and completely ruin the
image because that's what

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:03.960
the pop-up flash normally does.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.300
Do you think there's
a need for more

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.940
education around good
and bad uses of flash?

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.610
And how could we go about this?

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:14.430
KATE FLINT: One of
the things I totally

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.340
loved about writing the
book was immersing myself

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:20.730
for a while in photo
manuals, going back

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:25.110
to the 19th century and all the
way through the 20th century

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.850
and into the 21st.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.090
And of course, now there is
masses of online information

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:34.710
about how to use flash, how to
take a good flash photograph,

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.900
all the pitfalls
not to fall into.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.060
So I honestly think it's
one of those areas in which,

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:47.550
if people want to have
even rudimentary education,

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.620
that they can find out.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.290
And I suppose a certain
amount of education

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:56.430
then comes in a sideways
way when you see photographs

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.920
that say no flash allowed here.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.510
And then you think,
well why not?

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.160
So no flash allowed here
might be at a sporting event.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.300
You're in an arena and flash
might just catch a player's eye

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.770
and distract.

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:15.090
Or you're told in
a wildlife refuge

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.390
that you can't use flash
at all because if you're

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.020
taking pictures into a
dark bush or at night,

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.380
then that really would
have a disruptive

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.320
effect on the animals there.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.660
The whole question
about whether or not

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.690
you should or shouldn't
use flash in museums

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.980
is one which has really
exercised museum curators.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.720
Because probably even with
multiple, multiple uses

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.560
of flash, there's very little
these days since flashbulbs

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.670
going off isn't going to
happen anymore-- you know,

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:52.890
they're not going to get their
canvases spiked with those.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.510
So is it about copyright?

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:57.420
Is it about disrupting
the viewing experience?

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.100
Is it just sort of traditional?

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.550
We don't use flash in a museum.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.800
But I think it provokes people
to say, well, why can't we

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.990
use flash here, even at a
kind of subliminal level.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:13.180
So I guess there's some kind
of education going on there.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.700
I think what really gets me is
when I see people using flash

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.240
at a concert, say.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.230
And you just see all these--

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:22.630
you know, light all over.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.970
And that's great for
a cinematographer who

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:30.180
wants to get some kind of a
sense of, I am at a concert.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.910
But this has been turned,
that kind of phenomenon,

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:37.560
to amazing use by this New
York-based group called Improv

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.810
Everywhere, which
some of you will know

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.570
for doing these
sort of great, let's

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.510
freeze for five minutes
in Grand Central Station.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.750
So everybody-- you
know, normal people.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:49.440
"Normal people."

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.390
Everyday people walking
through Grand Central

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.800
are going, uh, what's
happening here?

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.920
But they had an experiment, an
improv, where they asked people

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.220
to turn up with
their cell phones,

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.180
with their point and shoot
cameras and their flashes

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.260
and all let them off at the
same time from Brooklyn Bridge.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.300
And photographs
are taken of this.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.900
And of course it was entirely
and utterly ineffectual.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.110
So it was one of those
sort of demonstrations

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:24.180
of both a communal event
showing that flash, perhaps,

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.668
doesn't do all that much.

00:50:27.668 --> 00:50:30.302
Yes.

00:50:30.302 --> 00:50:31.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.468
When did photographers
really start

00:50:32.468 --> 00:50:36.680
to want to control the output
and application of their flash

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.050
using things like bounce
and diffusers and umbrellas

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.389
and all of that kind of stuff?

00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:43.180
And was it a long time
after they'd already

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:46.060
realized how unflattering
the full-on flash effect is?

00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.420
KATE FLINT: That's
a great question.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.810
And it is one that--

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.460
I would say once you have
that compound flash powder,

00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.880
in particular-- so, post 1887--

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.790
manuals and
photographic magazines

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.750
continue to be
full of instruction

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:14.480
about how you can bounce flash
off a curtain at the side,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.380
or how you can use a
newspaper that is held up,

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.220
or how you can position
flash in particular places

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.540
within your
fireplace, or how you

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.860
can hang a gauze
curtain over a window

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.240
and let off flash behind it.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.000
And so one of those things
that is compelling to me

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.550
about the photo manuals
of the late 19th

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:42.470
and the early 20th century
is how inventive, you know,

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.170
so-called amateur
photographers were.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.600
If you were a
professional photographer,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.990
if you had a studio,
you could afford

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:55.670
some of those readymade
screens and hoods and devices

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.120
that were advertised
for use with flash.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.940
On the other hand, if you're
a really well-to-do poncey

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.920
photographer with a
studio, you probably

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.040
had electric lighting
by that stage,

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.190
but that's another question.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:11.510
But the amateur photographer
was forever swapping stories

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:14.930
about, hey, maybe you could use
this, maybe you could use that.

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.890
And so really, the whole
history of photography

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:22.130
has been asking, how
do we control light.

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:25.400
How do we use either natural
light or artificial light,

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.660
however it's produced, to
create the particular, either

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.850
practical effects or aesthetic
effects, that we want?

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.000
So the answer is,
that experimentation

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.790
has been going on
ever since people

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.280
were using artificial lighting.

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.260
SPEAKER 1: We would
have time for one more

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.490
question if anyone has one.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.876
If not-- one
question over there.

00:52:52.694 --> 00:52:53.360
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.860
Hi.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.850
KATE FLINT: Hi.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:59.870
AUDIENCE: I wonder how
you think about the future

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:03.090
of photography--

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:07.630
if you're kind of in line with
the technological developments.

00:53:10.127 --> 00:53:11.710
It would be interesting,
your opinion.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.730
Thank you.

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.620
KATE FLINT: So the
question's about how

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:21.300
I see the technological future
of photography and flash.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.680
And I think a lot
there I would take back

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.970
to what I was saying about
speed with digital photography.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:31.240
I mean, how fast,
how sensitive, can

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.980
we make digital chips in terms
of their reaction to light.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:39.850
Is flash going to seem like
something which, you know,

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:44.290
is some strange,
quaint old technology?

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:48.370
Are we going to talk about
flash photography in retro terms

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:49.570
at some point?

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.560
I think we probably do that
already in some quarters.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.680
But I also think that it's like
one of those questions which

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.800
is completely
unanswerable, because it's

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.820
going to be the more exciting
photographers and artists

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:10.420
and installation artists,
and perhaps particularly

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.690
installation artists
like Eliasson

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:19.450
who will use flash as
part of an installation.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:23.260
That show on light that was
at the Serpentine a while

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.440
back had some terrific
examples of what

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.650
one could call flash
light, but used

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:32.380
not to record a
photographic image

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.330
so much as to give the viewer a
certain kind of experience when

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:41.200
they were themselves
at an installation,

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:45.580
getting them to think
about what light can do.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.820
So it's going to continue
to be used in photography.

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:51.950
But the imaginative ends
to which it is put--

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.090
I guess we will have to say,
well, what do we want to do?

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:56.530
What do we want to show?

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:58.840
And how do we want
people to think

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.390
about light, and
the power of light,

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:07.990
and in what ways do we calibrate
between light's controlability

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.772
and its unpredictability.

00:55:10.772 --> 00:55:12.980
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very
much, Professor Kate Flint.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.830
KATE FLINT: Thank you.
