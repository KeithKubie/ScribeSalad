00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.470
We’re used to dividing how people vote in
elections according to the categories of right-wing

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.340
and left-wing. But there might be another
way of labelling an electorate that taps into

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.869
something broader and deeper in human personality.
We might apportion people into the camps of

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.900
Romantic and Classical voters. Which might
you be? Here is some of what separates these

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.160
two fundamental electoral types.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.480
The Romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the
corner, if only bold and swift action could

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.010
be taken: if we entered an agreement or scrapped
an agreement, started a war or ended a war.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.000
The Romantic considers a degree of impatience
to be a vital resource in governing a nation.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.760
They may not think too badly of anger either,
so long as it’s handled correctly. You can

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.060
be too forgiving, after all. The Romantic
is excited by how things might ideally be,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.580
and always judges what currently exists in
the world by the standard of a better imagined

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.780
alternative. Most of the time, the current
state of things arouses them to intense disappointment

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.110
as they consider the injustices, prevarications,
compromises, and timidity of almost everyone

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.140
in government. For their part, the Classical
voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.780
and actions. They pay special attention to
what can go wrong. They are very concerned

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.680
to mitigate the downside. They are aware that
most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.950
a policy, they consider the standard of policy
across history and may regard a current arrangement

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.420
as bearable, under the circumstances… Their
view of people is fundamentally rather dark.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.880
They believe that everyone is probably slightly
worse than they seem. They feel humans have

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.159
deeply dangerous impulses, lusts and drives,
and believe the task of politics is to try

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.479
to contain them – rather than liberate genius,
strength, beauty or benevolence. High ideals

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.240
make them nervous: they are led by a desire
not to make anything worse. Insofar as they

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.700
hope for improvement, it is in a cautious,
modest way. They dare to suppose that the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.280
world may be a marginally better place – in
300 years time.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.640
Romantics see a lot that is wrong with the
world and feel confident about analysing who

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.250
might be to blame for it: perhaps this particular
social group or that class… A problem can’t

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.010
just be no one’s fault – and therefore
the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.910
and respond appropriately. Romantics feel
a basic trust in their own capacity for purity:

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.319
they are sure they would be unable to be as
shabby as their enemies – whom they can

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.819
therefore attack with a relatively clean conscience.
Classical voters also notice what is wrong,

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.550
but are highly aware of their own capacity
for sinfulness and error which makes them

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.069
hesitant about apportioning blame. They recognise
how easily they might have been active wrongdoers

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.400
if circumstances had been different and suppose
that no one has a monopoly on righteousness.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.510
They would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately
distributed across all groups and classes

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.069
– and that a priority is therefore for us
to tolerantly cut each other slack at every

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.289
turn. 3.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:39.520
Romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals
taking destiny into their hands and struggling

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.230
against the inertia and conservatism of the
mass and, most importantly, of institutions.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.280
Classical voters are deeply worried by the
possibility of lone actors taking matters

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.710
into their hands and, through natural weaknesses
which all of us – even the most intelligent

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.739
– are afflicted by, creating disaster. They
are therefore on the side of legally grounded,

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.349
extremely slow-moving institutions that are
designed to restrain individual power and

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.200
contain the capacity of any one person to
shift the direction of the group too quickly.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.400
Romantic voters
believe it is possible to understand a situation

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.170
or issue so clearly, one can be sure of complete
justice and rightness. Therefore, those who

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.760
don’t agree don’t have to be listened
to politely. They are evidently wrong – and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.510
can be silenced or sidelined as required.
Classical voters are extremely alert to the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.060
possibility of error in their own and others’
analyses of policy. They are therefore committed

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.820
to hearing and tolerating dissenting views
– in which they suspect a portion of the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.300
truth may always be lodged.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.700
Romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is
for it to seem prominently ‘strong’. Classical

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.130
voters feel that the best way to be safe in
the world is to be thought well of; and will

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.580
therefore avoid actions that could upset,
alarm or confuse neighbours. They’re aware

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.061
of how easily strength arouses the desire
of others to be equally strong back. They

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:19.840
suspect the best way to proceed might be to
train in private for the worst – but extend

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.900
a hand of friendship at every public turn.
Both Romantic and Classical political orientations

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.260
have important truths to impart. Neither is
wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.880
And none of us are in any case ever simply
one or the other. But because a good political

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.160
landscape requires a judicious balance of
both, at this point in history, in many countries,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.919
it might be the Classical electoral attitude
whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.380
to listen to most intently and which is most
ripe for rediscovery.
