00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.723
 Well let's watch 

00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:03.568
 Overview of glycolysis 

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:04.962
 Sugar decomposition is a very important chemical pathway 

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.585
 Sugar decomposition is a very important chemical pathway 

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:10.441
 It happens practically in all forms of life as we know it 

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:14.249
 It is the taking of glucose as fuel 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.060
 And by smashing it 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.544
 Leading to glucose, decomposition, 

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.979
 Break it into two pyruvate molecules 

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:25.846
 Glucose is a molecule of 6 carbon atoms 

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:29.306
 Each pyruvate is a molecule made up of 3 carbon atoms 

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:30.908
 And by doing this 

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:33.508
 2ATP is produced as a result 

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.387
 In fact, you need to use 2 ATP 

00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:38.339
 And then produce 4 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.235
 If you are using 2ATP 

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:43.930
 This is called the stage of investment 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.289
 We'll talk about it later 

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.258
 And then produces 4ATP 

00:00:51.258 --> 00:00:54.717
 The result is 

00:00:54.717 --> 00:00:57.411
 + 2ATP 

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.152
 That is what we see here 

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:03.656
 In sum 2ATP is produced directly from 

00:01:03.656 --> 00:01:08.149
 Sugar decomposition, we also have 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.736
 NAD returns to NADH 

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:15.509
 Remember that the return is the acquisition of electrons 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.528
 Here is NAD, Nicotine Amide 

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:21.390
 Here is NAD, nicotine adenine, adenine, dichlorotide there are other videos about this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.747
 It's an interesting molecule and it's really 

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.974
 Molecule is somewhat large, note 

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.493
 We observe a positive charge, and then see that it has not only gained hydrogen 

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:32.036
 But also lost its negative charge 

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:34.915
 They gain hydrogen and electrons 

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:37.051
 This can be thought of as acquired 

00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.606
 Hydride in the aggregate 

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.412
 Of course anhydride anion will not normally exist alone 

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:47.036
 But by the end you can think that's what happens 

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:48.952
 But by the end you can think that's what happens 

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:52.968
 If they acquire hydrogen and an additional electron 

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:57.488
 If NAD + is returned 

00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:00.831
 It will be returned to NADH 

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:03.443
 It will be returned to NADH 

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:06.763
 The NADH can then 

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:09.747
 To be oxidized in the electron transport chain 

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.581
 We will study this later, when we think about 

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.240
 When we think of oxidative phosphorylation to produce 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.900
 More ATPs 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.988
 But at a high level and simple basis 

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.101
 Glucose is broken into pyruvate 

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.968
 6 carbon atoms to 3 carbon atoms per molecule of pyruvate, 

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:25.605
 But there are other things associated with carbon 

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.602
 Associated with carbon and we'll see it soon 

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:31.885
 2ATP is produced in the sum, and also returns 

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:36.506
 And also returns 2NAD to 2NADH which can be used 

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.706
 Later to produce more ATP 

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:42.724
 Sugar decomposition is usually just the beginning 

00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:44.140
 For cellular respiration 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.207
 When oxygen is available, we have these products 

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.968
 Some of these outputs will move to the quantifier 

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.872
 Where there is a loop of citric acid (ring Krebs) 

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:58.226
 Lemon acid ring (crybs loop) where oxidative phosphorylation occurs 

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.629
 When oxygen is not available, then 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.229
 Anaerobic breathing will occur 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.191
 Will enter the fermentation process 

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:07.014
 We'll talk about this in subsequent videos, if the command is 

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.428
 Understand what will happen to these outputs 

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:13.863
 Especially the NAD + 

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:15.871
 Now we have an overview 

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.553
 For glycolysis, let us take a better estimate 

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:20.968
 Exactly what is happening 

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.914
 Whenever you see these detailed processes 

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.576
 The only thing to be appreciated 

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.617
 Is the complexity of what happens 

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.417
 In all your body cells currently 

00:03:32.417 --> 00:03:35.145
 This is just a approximation 

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:37.699
 To help us imagine these things, but this 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.800
 Happens in your body 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.064
 Millions of times, at the moment 

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:43.260
 This is nothing 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.479
 Away from you 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.498
 And it's fun to appreciate, how 

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.356
 All these things were discovered by scientists 

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:51.119
 This is a fascinating subject in itself 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.756
 But the purpose of this video is only 

00:03:52.756 --> 00:03:55.855
 Give an estimate of the real mechanism 

00:03:55.855 --> 00:03:57.724
 Or interaction that occurs 

00:03:57.724 --> 00:03:58.978
 I will not go into details 

00:03:58.978 --> 00:04:01.381
 Mechanisms of Organic Chemistry 

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.353
 We see the glucose molecule here 

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:07.894
 We see one, two, three, four, five, six carbon atoms 

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:11.295
 The first step is phosphorylation 

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.234
 We have a complete video on glucose phosphorylation 

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:16.183
 All these steps are stimulated 

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:17.216
 By Enzymes 

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:20.374
 Phosphorylation is stimulated by the enzyme hexokinase 

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:23.035
 Kinase is a generic term for the enzyme 

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.705
 Which either vibrates violently 

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:29.211
 Or remove phosphorylation, if it can be said: 

00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:31.150
 It deals with phosphorylation 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.007
 The enzymes are reduced 

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.505
 Power activation 

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:36.745
 The way the hexokinase, or part of the 

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:39.369
 The way it does its job, including coenzyme (Tamim) 

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:40.843
 A magnesium ion 

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.003
 We talked about it in other videos 

00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.207
 On how coenzymes (amulets) help reduce 

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.553
 Power activation 

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:51.210
 For phosphorylation, we use the ATP molecule 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.670
 If here 1ATP- 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.205
 If we are now in the investment phase (Phase I) 

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:01.147
 But this interaction occurs strongly in the direction of 

00:05:01.147 --> 00:05:05.164
 Left to right, this interaction is associated with where 

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:08.228
 That the phosphorylation of glucose 

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:11.746
 You need free energy, but ATP frees energy 

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:13.905
 We make the horn of these two interactions, and the interaction gets strong 

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.298
 From left to right 

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:17.899
 Now, let's make sure we understand what happened 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:21.242
 These here have been replaced 

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:25.387
 More precisely here, replaced 

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.882
 With those there 

00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:29.690
 Just to follow what is happening 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.430
 Now, another reaction is an enzyme booster 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.171
 This is a reversible interaction in fact 

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:36.992
 It can get in both directions, but as we'll see, that 

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:39.639
 The right direction or objects that you follow in 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.810
 Sugar decomposition, these constantly 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.190
 Are constantly transformed into subsequent outputs, if 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.792
 Its concentration will decrease 

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:48.439
 The interaction will tend to get in that direction 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.608
 Although this particular interaction, gets from 

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.255
 Glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate 

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:56.275
 It could be reversible 

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.457
 But the enzyme that stimulates this 

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:02.915
 Phosphoglobulin isomerase, isomerase 

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.080
 They are enzymes that help in the transformation of the pathogen 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.775
 Of the molecular to another procession 

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:09.040
 That's what happens here 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.360
 Instead of oxygen being associated with this carbon atom 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.659
 The bond is formed with this atom 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.899
 If we have fructose, ZO 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.453
 The pentagonal ring here, excuse us for the constituent ring 

00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:21.102
 Of 5 elements, containing 4 carbon atoms 

00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:23.268
 Against the six-party here 

00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:24.905
 We have 5 carbon atoms 

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:27.146
 If this bond goes to the carbon atom there 

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:28.887
 That is the fundamental difference 

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.209
 And then we have an interaction 

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:33.508
 One-way forward, again stimulated 

00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:37.931
 With ATP, this is obtained by phosphofructokinase 

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.684
 Which contains the word kinase in his name. 

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:41.947
 It uses ATP, you can guess 

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:42.911
 What will happen 

00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:44.884
 We will link another phosphate group 

00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:48.878
 To fructose-6-phosphate, and now 

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:50.712
 We have two phosphate groups. 

00:06:50.712 --> 00:06:54.497
 If this hydrogen is here now 

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.978
 It has been replaced by another phosphate mantle. 

00:06:58.978 --> 00:07:00.499
 Again it is stimulated by 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.575
 As the enzyme is magnesium, this helps to stabilize 

00:07:03.575 --> 00:07:05.432
 Some special negative charges 

00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:08.149
 Bzamra phosphate, we talked about this in other videos 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.773
 But the important thing is that they consume another molecule of ATP 

00:07:10.773 --> 00:07:13.545
 We are still in the process of investing 

00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:16.389
 Minus one ATP 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.805
 And every time I look at this ... it is truly stunning 

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.290
 How all these things happen in your cells 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.671
 While talking 

00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.213
 In fact so I can speak you must get all this 

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:26.454
 Because my body needs to take glucose and get 

00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:30.064
 On some energy to convert it to ATPs so that my muscles can 

00:07:30.064 --> 00:07:32.769
 To move and to be able to breathe and exhale 

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:34.267
 And all those things that need to be done so that she can speak 

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:37.065
 So much as it gets here. 

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:38.806
 Now in the next step we will talk about 

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:43.008
 All glycolysis processes are a lysing analysis of glucose 

00:07:43.008 --> 00:07:45.493
 These here are derived from 

00:07:45.493 --> 00:07:47.269
 Glucose and some phosphate 

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:49.707
 In the next step we will destroy it 

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:52.029
 We will destroy it with the enzyme 

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:54.269
 Fructose diphosphate aldolase 

00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:57.787
 Aldolase is an enzyme that stimulates the reactions of aldols 

00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.909
 Here, the reaction of aldol can be 

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:05.449
 Integrates two molecules, or in this case 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.503
 He will separate them 

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:10.963
 They will be separated into two seltsin consisting of three carbon atoms 

00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:12.507
 Now these two statins are carbon tetrachloride, 

00:08:12.507 --> 00:08:14.782
 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, this compound is here 

00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:17.104
 This compound here can be converted between them 

00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:19.461
 By another isomerase 

00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:22.479
 It is the isomerase triosphosphate here. 

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:25.602
 At this stage of glycolysis, we can say 

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:27.424
 That we have two of these in fact 

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.988
 To transfer two hit glyceride-3-phosphate 

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.521
 So as we progress, let us imagine 

00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:36.886
 This will happen twice per glucose molecule. 

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:38.441
 Anytime you feel confused, I encourage you 

00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:39.683
 To stop the video. 

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:42.319
 And see how these parts and these parts 

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:45.140
 When combined with each other, they can form this here 

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.661
 Now we have another interaction, 

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.667
 It is stimulated by dehydrogenase enzyme. 

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:52.906
 Dehydrogenase enzymes often interfere 

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:56.342
 In this case, this returns the NAD. 

00:08:56.342 --> 00:08:58.444
 We saw this in the overview video 

00:08:58.444 --> 00:09:02.286
 If the NAD is returned. 

00:09:02.286 --> 00:09:04.736
 These can be used - this NAD - later 

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:06.698
 Can be used in electron transmission chain 

00:09:06.698 --> 00:09:09.577
 Possibly producing more ATP 

00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:12.699
 But during the return we add also 

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:14.278
 Other phosphate group to 

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:16.205
 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:19.456
 As you see this group of phosphate 

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:23.710
 Here perfectly, they did not exist before 

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.984
 In fact here it is 

00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:33.641
 I had to put arrows on both sides 

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:35.278
 This is here, that interaction 

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:36.926
 It can actually get in two directions 

00:09:36.926 --> 00:09:39.063
 In fact this interaction also 

00:09:39.063 --> 00:09:43.265
 And then, now 

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:45.900
 We will enter the profit phase (second stage) 

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.303
 If this is here, we are starting 

00:09:48.303 --> 00:09:50.033
 With this molecule that possesses 

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:52.448
 Phosphate, and then 

00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:55.350
 Using kinase phosphoglycerides, we were able to 

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.323
 We were able to separate one of the phosphate groups 

00:09:57.323 --> 00:10:01.131
 During this, production of ATP. 

00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:02.942
 Now we may say that we won the ATP molecule 

00:10:02.942 --> 00:10:03.906
 But we have to remember, that is now 

00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:05.171
 Get twice 

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.946
 Because we have two molecules of glyceride-3-phosphate 

00:10:07.946 --> 00:10:09.606
 If now can be said, if we are talking 

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:13.866
 For getting this twice, 2ATP + 

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:16.142
 Now we are in the making. 

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:18.138
 Then we have a catalyst reaction by 

00:10:18.138 --> 00:10:21.691
 Phosphoglycerides Motaz, Metaphysics 

00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.235
 Belongs to the row of isomers (impregnated enzymes) 

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.396
 I have difficulty pronouncing his name 

00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:26.021
 Which will take an effective coterie of place 

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:28.157
 Or transfer a section of the molecule 

00:10:28.157 --> 00:10:31.162
 To another section, as you see this phosphate group 

00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:37.192
 It moves from this carbon atom to the carbon atom in the middle 

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:38.725
 This is what the enzyme does 

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.731
 Then we use Ainolas to get here 

00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:46.469
 And then Peruvat Kinase, here 

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:47.888
 Kinase will be used 

00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:50.802
 To remove the phosphorylation of this molecule here 

00:10:50.802 --> 00:10:52.601
 This brings us to - in this way I drew it - 

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:55.829
 Peruvian acid, because I painted hydrogen here, 

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:57.837
 If hydrogen goes, take oxygen 

00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:01.203
 Electron, we would have pyruvate 

00:11:01.203 --> 00:11:04.419
 This is considered the end, 

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:06.996
 This is considered the end, you might say, the sugar-glycol stream 

00:11:06.996 --> 00:11:09.179
 But what happens, I do not want 

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.327
 I do not want to mention what is happening here 

00:11:11.327 --> 00:11:14.287
 These ADPs are converted to another ATP 

00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:15.796
 But this will happen twice 

00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:19.418
 So this is 2ATPs + other 

00:11:19.418 --> 00:11:22.436
 I hope you understand that it is in the process of investing 

00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:25.032
 We used the ATP molecule here for glucose phosphorylation, 

00:11:25.032 --> 00:11:28.418
 Glucose phosphorylation, and we used another ATP molecule here 

00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:30.461
 Add the second phosphate group 

00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:34.002
 To what was fructose-6-phosphate 

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:36.045
 And then we reach the profit stage 

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.239
 Where we were able to produce this NADH 

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.899
 In fact these will be two molecules of NADH 

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.478
 Because all this is here 

00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:43.928
 Occurs twice, we can consider that this molecule is here 

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:45.959
 It is also converted 

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:49.326
 To Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Now 

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:51.787
 We produced 2ATP because this happens twice, 

00:11:51.787 --> 00:11:54.445
 We produced 2ATP there 

00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:57.965
 I hope that everything we talked about from the beginning 

00:11:57.965 --> 00:12:00.237
 It seems logical now.
