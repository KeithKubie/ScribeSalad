00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:23.825
Try to pause the video and figure it out 
on your own.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:25.450
So what I like to do is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.710
I like to write down what they tell us

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:31.802
and then think about what might make sense.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.718
So, first of all we have Emeka.

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:41.712
They tell us that Emeka got a 17 
when she spinned the wheel.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:47.009
So Emeka got a 17. This is Emeka's number 
right over here, she got a 17.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:48.499
Now, what about Tom?

00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:54.121
They tell us Tom got a number

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.871
that was 15 more than Emeka's number

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:03.042
So, did Tom get a higher number or a
lower number than Emeka?

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:06.173
Well, Tom's number is 15 more than Emeka's.

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.507
So, it's going to be a larger number.

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:11.683
So, it's going to be Emeka's number plus 15.

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.743
So, 15 more than 17.

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:18.770
So, it's Emeka's number, 
and it's going to be 15 more than that.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.221
So, notice 15 more than Emeka's number

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:26.976
Well, Emeka's number is 17.

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:31.296
15 more than that is going to be 17 + 15.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.330
So what's 17 + 15 going to be?

00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:39.107
So, I can calculate it right over here. 
So, I'll line them up.

00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:42.487
So, 17 is 1 ten and 7 ones

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:46.617
and 15 is 1 ten and 5 ones

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.306
and I'm going to add.

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:52.762
So let's first look at the ones place.

00:01:52.772 --> 00:01:58.106
So, 7 ones + 5 ones, that's going to be 
12 ones.

00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:03.016
But, 12 ones is the same thing as 1 ten 
and 2 ones.

00:02:03.037 --> 00:02:07.817
So, I could write the 2 ones down here
and then I would write the 1 ten up here.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.720
Another way you could think about it is 
I just carried the 1.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.713
7 + 5 is 12, I wrote the 2 down here
and I carried the 1.

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:16.486
But what I'm really saying is

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:21.486
look 7 + 5 is 12, 12 is 2 ones and 1 ten.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:25.926
And now I just add up the tens
1 ten + 1 ten + 1 ten is 3 tens

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:29.235
So it's 32.

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:31.065
So, Tom got a 32.

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:34.601
And you should always check to see if 
that makes sense.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.840
It says that Tom got a number that was 15
more than Emeka's number.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.813
Well, is 32, 15 more than Emeka's number?

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:45.646
Is 32, 15 more than 17?

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:49.362
Sure it is, because 17 + 15 is 32.

00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:52.012
That's how we figured it out.
