00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.460
We're going to have a talk by Serge Michel
and Paolo Woods on their book, “China Safari.”

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.180
I started reading about this topic about a
year and a half ago, and got very interested.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.390
So when the topic came up, I jumped at the
chance to present -- to host -- them.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.320
I think everyone's going to find it very fascinating
to hear about how these two very important

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.140
parts of the world are coming together in
a way that's going to have a big impact on

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.460
both of their economies and on the rest of
the world.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.690
If you've got your computer and you're not
on call, please turn it off.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.899
And please welcome our speakers.
Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.190
&gt;&gt; [Clapping].

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.300
Serge Michel: Hello.
So do you hear as well? Yeah?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.870
So my name is Serge Michel, and I'm a writer
from Switzerland working mostly for European

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.380
newspapers and magazines.
I've been based in Zurich, in Tehran, in Belgrade,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.550
and in Dakar.
And now, I'm back home in Geneva.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.840
And I'm also the founder of the Bondy Blog,
which is in the volatile suburbs of Paris,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.630
and it's a 2.0 Web Project that employs about
a hundred young immigrants in France.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.920
It has been ten years that I work with Paolo,
and we've produced three books together, which

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.780
is the last one.
And now we are working on a new one about

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.569
Iran.
We've been there the whole month of June.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.790
Paolo Woods: Hello, my name is Paolo Woods.
I'm the son of a Dutch mother and a Canadian

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.970
father.
I was brought up in Italy.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.110
I presently live in Paris.
And I'm a photographer.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.910
I've been a photographer since I was 17.
And in the last ten years, I've been working

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.650
on long-term projects, mainly with Serge,
which are stories that have something to do

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.250
with the news but is not hard news.
We don't work directly for tomorrow's newspaper.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.890
We work for stories that try to look into
depth in subjects that we think are necessary.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.920
The first two books we did before this one
 -- the first one was called "A Crude World.”

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.600
And it's a story about oil through the whole
world for 12 different countries and four

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.190
different continents.
And to see, we investigated they've actually

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.360
been an oil producing country -- is a blessing
or is a curse for its own people.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.500
And the second one was a long investigation
into two wars of George Bush in Afghanistan

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.950
and in Iraq, where we worked for a very long
time both times.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.850
So then, we have this project.
And then, we are also together publishers

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.780
of a small -- we have a small publishing company
together with a third colleague called Claude

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.290
Baechtold, and we produce small travel guidebooks
and images to expected destinations like this

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.020
one.
So, it's guidebooks just composed of images.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.960
This one was to Afghanistan.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.250
Serge Michel: So why did we do the book called
China Safari?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.720
When I was correspondent in West Africa for
Le Monde, I felt that there was a new phenomenon

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.870
taking place, one that would change the face
of Africa.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.870
Half a million Chinese had come to Africa,
not as missionaries, not as aid workers, but

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.590
for the raw materials they need to fuel their
amazing growth.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.520
And we were sinners.
We often see only misery, genocide, wars,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.980
disease, and drugs in Africa.
But the Chinese -- they are going there, to

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.170
some of the poorest and the most dangerous
places in the world, with the real sense of

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.750
21st century adventure.
And they're investing there, and sometimes,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.390
making a fortune.
So they consider Africa actually as an opportunity

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.590
while we westerners we often see it as with
empathy as a place for handout.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.830
So we felt that it was a very important story
that was not getting enough attention.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.599
The story is not only about China and Africa;
it concerns actually the whole world.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.980
This is a bit the accomplishment of globalization.
China is using Africa as a trampoline to become

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.220
the first world power.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.630
Paolo Woods: So how did we do this story?
This is the kind of story that cannot anymore

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.290
be financed by a magazine or a newspaper.
No newspaper will send you today for over

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.500
two years to 12 African countries and twice
to China on assignment.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.760
And we wanted very much not to do a story
sitting in an office looking at statistics

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.060
and numbers, but we wanted to do on-ground
reporting like we always did.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.940
We wanted actually to meet these Chinese,
go into Africa, and for the 21st century adventure

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.400
for them for looking for a new place for the
development for themselves.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.510
So we started in North Africa and southern
Africa, in the west and in the east, and tried

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.400
to cover all the different aspects.
In each country, tried to analyze why the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.030
Chinese were there, what were they doing there,
what were the specific issues in each country.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.250
Serge Michel: The man under the umbrella is
called Jacob Wood.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.470
And -- I'm sorry to say it here -- but, before
we interviewed him in Lagos, Nigeria, in April

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.770
2007, he did not exist on Google.
But he ought to, because this man is one of

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.460
the biggest Chinese entrepreneurs in Nigeria.
He's the owner of about 15 factories there,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.490
and he's an adviser to the president, who's
offering him a constant police escort.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.990
He stands here in front of 544 villas that
his company has built in six months for the

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.370
American oil company, Chevron.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:04.050
Paolo Woods: And here we are in a steel factory
also in Nigeria, owned by a friend of Jacob

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.050
Wood we just saw.
And what you see here is a Chinese supervisor

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.510
and a Nigerian worker in a not a very friendly
pose.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.340
What you might notice as well is, that the
Chinese supervisor is wearing protective shoes,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.990
while the Nigerian worker is just wearing
flip-flops.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.300
Serge Michel: So still, the relationship -- the
working relationship -- can be tough, but

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.889
there is also a real proximity.
Look at this supervisor here teaching a Nigerian

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.960
worker in the heat of the same steel factory.
If he was a westerner, he would just sit in

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.370
the office with air conditioning and checking
the production figures on the computer, and

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.260
he would also get 20 times more money.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.500
Paolo Woods: This is another factory.
This is a biscuit factory -- Nabisco biscuit

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
factory.
And it's interesting because, this factory

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.790
produces about seventy tons of biscuits each
day which cover just one percent of the demand

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.190
in Nigeria.
But this biscuit factory had been previously

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.810
owned by British, by Indians, by Nigerians,
and it always went bankrupt.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.080
And when the Chinese took it over with their
very strong work ethic, they're making it

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.260
work in one of the countries where businesses,
which is not oil, have a hard time flourishing

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:27.250
 -- you know that Nigeria is Africa's biggest
oil producer -- and this company is now running

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:36.060
24/7 with two shifts a day -- two 12-hour
shifts a day -- employing a lot of local workforce.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.290
So this engineer is explaining to the workers
some of the workings of the factory.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.840
Serge Michel: There is a club in Lagos for
Chinese entrepreneurs with about 200 members.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.590
And some of them are in their early 20's and
but all very successful.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.320
Here is their monthly meeting in the restaurant.
It's an expensive one.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.070
And the African waiters are wearing traditional
Chinese costumes directly imported.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:13.190
Paolo Woods: This is the wife of Mr. Wood,
the man we saw in the very first photograph

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.700
under the umbrella -- or I should probably
better say, one of the wives of Mr. Wood -- because,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.479
Mr. Wood has adopted a lot of local customs,
so he has become polygamous as well as also

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:30.320
learning the local language and all that.
So this wife is called Amy Wood, and she is

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:37.039
shown here in one of the restaurants she runs.
This is a five-story restaurant, 1,500 seats

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:44.259
in the center of Lagos.
And in this particular photo, she is throwing

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:50.610
a banquet for the president of the Nigerian
senate, who's celebrating here his 70th birthday

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.170
with 300 guests.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:59.130
Serge Michel: Let's go now to Congo.
This picture, which is also the cover of the

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.959
book -- it's a dam under construction and
a dam for which the western aid agencies -- the

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:13.070
IMF, the World Bank -- constantly refused
to finance because of the lack of transparency,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.920
the lack of good governance, the lack of democracy,
the lack of stability in the country.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:25.929
The Chinese were not bothered by these shortcomings,
and they not only financed the dam, but they

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:30.970
also are building it.
They sent 400 workers from China to Congo

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.390
for that project, and they hired about a thousand
Congolese workers.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.800
And to make that sure they know who's who,
they have asked the Chinese supervisors to

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.070
have yellow helmets and the Africans to have
blue helmets.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:51.670
Paolo Woods: This dam, when completed, will
double Congo's electricity output.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.889
Which is something which is badly needed if
you think that Congo -- the capital, Brazzaville

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.110
 -- only has three hours of electricity a
day.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.040
It might be very difficult to operate a company
like Google in a place that only has three

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.209
hours of electricity each day.
So you see that infrastructures, at times,

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:13.739
come before the necessity of good governance,
democracy, in any case, in the Chinese vision.

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:22.559
Serge Michel: Ministers in Africa have the
reputation of not doing many things for their

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:27.779
own people, and that is often the case.
But China now helps African governments to

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:34.190
achieve more and to get so easily reelected.
Alphonse Nsilou here -- you see him -- is

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.569
the housing and construction minister in Congo.
And Chinese have made his life very easy.

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:44.939
He's also an architect, and he can sketch
whatever he likes -- they will build it, just

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:50.559
in time for the election.
And the Chinese will later get repaid by Congolese

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:51.559
oil.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:56.209
Paolo Woods: So here you can see behind is
people here.

00:10:56.209 --> 00:11:01.769
Some of these villas that minister Nsilou
has designed, which are being constructed

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:05.949
by the Chinese company.
And these are going to be villas for middle-class

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:12.730
Congolese families.
The two Chinese here are photographing this

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.269
project with their Congolese translator, and
these images will then be used back home to

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:20.730
raise more capital for investment in Africa.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:27.209
Serge Michel: One of the problems in the working
sites in Africa with the Chinese is that they

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:32.839
don't share any common language, so the only
way to communicate is by gestures and not

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:34.310
always very friendly ones.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:43.089
Paolo Woods: And this, you could say, is a
photograph speaking about the birth of the

00:11:43.089 --> 00:11:47.439
union.
These are Congolese workers working on a project

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:53.160
run by Chinese.
And they're paid roughly four dollars a day.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.519
About half of that goes away in transport
to get to worksite and in the lunch -- the

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:01.170
lunch is not offered like it is here, in this
case.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.860
And so they're left only with two dollars,
and they don't have a contract.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.190
They're not insured.
They claim to get regularly beaten by their

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:19.239
Chinese bosses.
And when -- if they're injured, they get fired

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:24.230
immediately.
So there is a very strong, anti-Chinese sentiment

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:30.800
growing in the lower sections of the population.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.790
Serge Michel: But still, the Chinese language
and Chinese themselves remain very attractive.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.840
And here, we are in the high school at Brazzaville,
with students passing their exams in Chinese

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.660
language.
These classes had to be doubled every year,

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.009
because more and more students in Congo want
to learn Chinese.

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:57.569
And one of the reasons for that is that if
they learn English, they will not -- the chance

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:02.309
to get an American visa is very low.
And if they learn French -- well, they speak

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:06.920
some French basically, but not very well -- they
will also never get a French visa.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.300
But there are more and more visas for them
in China, and you have a growing diaspora

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.110
 -- African diaspora -- in cities like Canton
and in Beijing.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:24.220
Paolo Woods: Here we're on the beach of Pointe-Noire
in Congo.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.860
And this is some of the members of the family
Ye.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:35.389
The lady you see standing next to the small
girl is called Jessica Ye, and she arrived

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:43.790
in 2001 to Congo penniless from China.
She was working as a translator on a Chinese

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.730
construction site.
She had learned some French.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:53.089
And eight years on, she today is at the head
of a small empire that spans from logging

00:13:53.089 --> 00:14:01.149
concessions in the Congo forest till cement
import, from prostitution to a factory producing

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:06.649
aluminum window frames.
And in the years, she has brought eighty members

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:09.829
of her family to Congo, of which you will
see some of them here.

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:17.089
Serge Michel: And here we witnessed the very
animated discussion between Phillip -- who

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:23.319
is Jessica's brother -- and the former owner
of her restaurant that Phillip has just bought.

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:27.449
The Congolese man came to claim the money
for the restaurant and the Chinese man was

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.170
trying to delay the payment.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:37.589
Paolo Woods: This is the husband of Jessica,
Mr. Zhang, and he is photographed here in

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:46.160
one of his houses in Pointe-Noire.
This house used to be the residence of the

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.429
German counsel and now, it is one of his properties
there.

00:14:50.429 --> 00:14:55.730
He is at the head of the family's logging
business.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:02.529
Each member of the family is given one business
to supervise, and he is the one taking care

00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:07.749
of the whole logging business.
He used to be a journalist for the Chinese

00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:11.779
news agency, but now has gone into the private
and is working on that.

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:19.549
Serge Michel: And the Ye family has managed
to get the largest concession in Congo, which

00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:23.759
consists of 800,000 hectares in the Congo
Basin Forest.

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:30.019
And you know, the Congolese forest is the
second largest rain forest in the world after

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:34.139
the Amazon.
And to our astonishment, actually part of

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:40.139
the family's concession is right in the middle
of the national park.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:45.319
So we went together with Mr. Zhang to that
controversial concession.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:48.189
It was an eight-hour jeep ride from Pointe-Noire.

00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:52.069
Paolo Woods: And you here see one of these
trees falling.

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:57.639
These trees take about 100 years to grow,
and about five minutes to be cut down.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:00.970
And this particular tree is supposed to be
in a protected species.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:08.160
So we were quite taken aback by the fact that
this logging concession was in a national

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.879
forest.
And, especially, because we had interviewed

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:16.569
for a couple of days earlier, the Minister
of Forestry of Congo.

00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:20.689
For someone who is very vocal about the fact
that he's there to protect the forest -- "It's

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:24.939
a big asset for Congo," and he has written
books about it.

00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:30.829
And so, we were pretty encouraged by this
man's engagement to protect his country.

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:41.919
And so, we spoke with Mr. Zhang -- the man
who runs the timber activity -- about how,

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:47.319
you know, he had been able to get this logging
concession in the national forest since the

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:51.419
minister is so strong about it.
And, you know, he smiled to us with a smirk

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:55.369
and said, "You know, the minister is one of
the shareholders of my company."

00:16:55.369 --> 00:17:05.160
Serge Michel: And one of the problems of this
logging activity in the Congo forest is that

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.530
the workers are not fed by the Chinese bus.
And there is no supermarket, no village around.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:17.100
It's really deep into the forest.
So, the only way to survive is to hunt for

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.180
animals.
So the damage they exert on the environment

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.750
is double.
During the day, they cut trees; and during

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.250
the night, they kill animals.
This is a brew diker, which is not a species

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:34.710
very protected, but if they cross the path
of a gorilla, they wouldn't refrain themselves

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.710
and shoot.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:41.610
Paolo Woods: Here's another case.
Another worker showing off his night catch

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.750
which then will become his lunch.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:53.160
Serge Michel: So the law in Congo says that
80 percent of the wood must be processed there

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.680
in Congo, but the reality is more close to
ten to 15 percent.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.580
So the Chinese, the Ye family has managed
to revive a wood factory where they do plywood

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:11.240
for export and it comes actually to America.
But this represents very small fraction of

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240
their production there.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.890
Paolo Woods: Most of it, as you see here is
waiting at harbor for the boats that will

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:22.980
bring it to China, where it then will be worked
on and then will be exported around the world.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:31.320
This table here, for example, might be done
with African wood, then worked in China.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.040
What we have to understand today is that,
when we see on something written, "Made in

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.551
China", more and more that actually means,
"Extracted in Africa."

00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:47.380
Serge Michel: So we see here, Phillip -- he
was just on the picture before on the logs

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.560
in the harbor of Pointe-Noire.
We see him now in a different setting.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.630
He's here in his hometown in China called
Wenzhou, south of Shanghai.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:03.000
And he's on the top of his building for holidays.
He's going to spend three weeks there.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.760
And you know, it's often said that Chinese
have no right to go back after they emigrate.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.840
The only way to come back is to be successful.
So he went back to China with a lot of money,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.630
with a good car, with a very high lifestyle
to just show off and spend his Afro dollars,

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.130
we could call them.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.840
Paolo Woods: And he does party a lot.
He parties hard with his friend.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.310
This is in a karaoke bar, and the friend is
one of the responsibles of the local policemen.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.810
But he just doesn't -- not only parties -- he's
also always doing business.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:41.510
So right here, what he's doing -- he's prospecting
for the next things he's going to develop

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.310
in Africa.
He has bought a cigarette factory, which he's

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.780
going to bring to Congo, and he's also starting
a business where he's importing spare car

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.170
parts to Congo.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:56.770
Serge Michel: So while we were in China, we
also wanted to see who are the simple workers

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:03.480
who get ready to leave to Africa.
So we went to Sichuan Province, and we found

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.430
this man called Peng Shu Lin.
It was actually the very day of his departure

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.970
to Nigeria for three years.
You see on his bed, the small bag is the only

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.750
luggage he will take with him to Africa.
And he's here in China.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:26.190
He was earning about a hundred dollars a month
for being a specialized worker in plastic

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.940
molding.
For the very same job in Africa, he will get

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:34.870
five hundred dollars.
And this man has never left his province,

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.740
has never taken the plane, has never seen
a black man.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.250
And he's leaving tonight to Nigeria for three
years.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:50.160
All his objective is to save money there,
and then come back to China with 15 or $20,000

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.551
and open his own small business.

00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:56.540
Paolo Woods: And now we are in the north of
Africa, in Nigeria.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:03.860
This is suburbs of Abuja, the capital.
And this used to be a nomad path, as you still

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:10.910
see some go through, but behind them there
spurt up like mushrooms, housing developments

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:19.190
built by a Chinese company to relieve Algeria
of the very big housing crisis they have.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:26.510
Serge Michel: Algeria has gone through a terrible
decade of terrorism, and after that, the country

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:33.500
found itself with a terrible housing crisis.
So the Chinese were asked to build 55,000

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.500
housing units around Abuja.
You can see some of them here.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.310
And never in the country, the housing blocks
have been so high.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:45.870
It's like 15 floors, and it's the first time
in the country they built so high housing

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.870
units.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:54.110
Paolo Woods: The Chinese working on government
projects, tend to live in a very isolated

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:58.000
way.
They live in compounds cut off from the local

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.530
population.
And they sleep there, are fed there, and this

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.700
is their lunch break in one of these such
compounds.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:10.411
And they will feed the rest of their meal
to the dog, who eventually then they will

00:22:10.411 --> 00:22:13.750
kill and eat, which is something which has
created a lot of problems in Algeria, because

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.120
this is unimaginable in a Muslim country that
you might eat a dog.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.990
And a lot of misunderstandings and uncomprehension
between the two communities has been growing.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.130
Serge Michel: Here, it's the working site
of the highway they are building.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:34.280
So you should imagine it's a thousand kilometers
highway, stretching from Morocco to Tunisia

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.870
all across Algeria.
And the Chinese had only 14 months to do the

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:44.880
work, because the president wanted the highway
to be finished for the elections.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:53.130
And to meet the challenge, they had to import
to Algeria about 12,000 Chinese workers, of

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.380
which you see just one here on the picture.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:04.030
Paolo Woods: And here, we're again in one
of these camps where the Chinese live.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.270
It's a very weird place.
I mean, these are prefabricated camps which

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.990
are then moved along with the work of the
highway.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.240
It's strange, because they're almost a mix
between a concentration camp and Disneyland.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:23.390
They're very esthetic, they're very pure,
and even if we had all the government authorizations

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.830
 -- the Algerian government authorizations
 -- to visit them, when we got there, they

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.440
tried everything to refuse us to go in, because
they considered this as Chinese territory

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.810
like if it was an embassy.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:43.720
Serge Michel: So now we just move to Angola.
Angola had experienced 27 years of civil war.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:51.850
The country is at its knees.
And after the war, the country asked the western

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:57.750
agencies and governments, IMF, World Bank,
to organize a donor's conference, but everybody

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.600
refused, because the country was lacking democracy
and good governance.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.580
So then Angola turned to the Chinese, and
they came in with about $10 billion in their

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.280
suitcases.
And they also moved in a lot of workers -- of

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.510
which one is here -- doing a very simple work.
So it's not very high qualified work, just

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:24.060
moving your shovel in the side of the road.
But the Chinese had built that road between

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:29.220
the capital Rwanda and Lobito in the south
in six months, which is very fast.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.110
And it's badly needed.
The country is one of the most heavily mined

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.630
countries in the world.
And having safe roads is an essential condition

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.150
for the _________.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:45.390
Paolo Woods: Yes, and it's not only roads
are needed but also railroads.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.270
This is one of the very few stretches of railroad
actually still working in Angola.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:55.110
And the Chinese have bid and are going to
construct the railroads in the future.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.370
As you see, the ones that exist are in very
bad condition, very short.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:04.140
And to bring all the produce from the inside
of the country to the coast, railroads and

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.780
roads are essential.
And so, in the future the road will be built

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.780
by the Chinese.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.090
Serge Michel: You know, this is one of the
railways that is already done by the Chinese.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.130
They are doing three lines, all at different
levels in the country.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:24.740
And this is very important.
You know we have gone to the center of Angola,

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:32.690
and you had farmers there cultivating carrots
and other vegetables unable to ship them to

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.760
the capital cities, so they were not knowing
what to do with their production.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.800
And on the other side, if you are in Rwanda,
the carrots you eat are coming from Brazil

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.670
by boat.
So it's at a very expensive price because

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:49.090
you have -- the country's so rich now.
The country that had the record growth rate

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:59.981
last year 27 percent and because of oil, it's
the second oil-producing country now in Africa

00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:04.680
after Nigeria.
So everybody is importing stuff there in such

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:10.030
a rich place, and there is a long queue for
boats to unload in the ports of Rwanda.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:22.270
Paolo Woods: And this is still in Angola.
This is an engineer on his one day of a month

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:28.260
in the warehouse of the company which also
doubles as their sleeping quarters.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.910
You can see that, behind him, the nettings
are covering the bed; and that's where they

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.241
sleep.
You have to think that this guy -- he's an

00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:38.790
engineer.
He's a qualified engineer, but he works for

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:47.150
something probably less than a thousand dollars
a month setting up antennas for mobile networks.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:52.400
And these are the living conditions.
He sleeps in the warehouse, he works extremely

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.690
hard, very long hours.
And it's very difficult to imagine an American

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.911
company or a British company or a French one
would send workers to Africa -- engineers

00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:04.200
to Africa -- and live and work in such conditions.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:12.310
Serge Michel: We just had an interview with
this man's boss in the office just behind

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:17.320
the wall that you see here, and the company
is building hotels in the south of Angola.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.770
Amongst other things, the boss told us that
the relationship between Chinese workers and

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:29.480
local women were forbidden, and that if any
of his men would have been caught, he would

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.370
be immediately sent back to China.
But, when we came out, we stumbled on this

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:40.740
night guard with his female companion cooling
off in the African night, and you might notice

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.510
that his zipper is open.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:52.559
Paolo Woods: And here, we go to Zambia, where
Chinese farmers are buying big parts of land

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:59.090
 -- cultivatable land, what they're going
to cultivate on -- and they're doing very

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:05.180
well, because the price of food has gone up
so much in the recent years, that, every year,

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.890
they buy more land around them.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:14.590
Serge Michel: Here, the main reason why China
is in Zambia is for the copper.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:20.970
There is a province called "Copper Belt" full
of mines, and China has bought a few of these

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:26.580
mines.
And you see now here the official meeting

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.530
on this smelter.
It is a 300 million project that China is

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:36.300
building, a copper smelter with officials.
And we like the way it is, because it is very

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:43.260
much a souvenir of the sixties when the Chinese
would go to Africa for friendship and cooperation

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:49.750
 -- friendship among people and the old cooperation.
At that time they had ideology, and they wanted

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.640
to prove that they were the best communists,
better than the USSR.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.710
But now, they don't have any other ideology
other than just business.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.450
Paolo Woods: And they're doing a lot of business.
Like, in this case, this is one of the bosses,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:07.100
one of the companies standing on some of the
copper that he's extracted.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.650
Copper had shot up in price a lot more than
what oil had a couple of years ago.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.850
And the profits were amazing for the Chinese
companies, but not all is smiles.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.210
The anti-Chinese sentiment in Zambia is growing
very fast.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:27.040
The Chinese pay very little, do not observe
security regulations, and there have been

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.930
big incidents in Zambia, killing a lot of
workers.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:35.600
Serge Michel: Well, getting access to copper
mines -- Chinese copper mines -- in Zambia

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:41.400
has been tremendously difficult for us.
And they believe that journalists are all

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.100
spies or anti-Chinese agents.
So soon after the previous picture of the

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:51.670
boss on his copper, we've been expelled from
the Chinese vicinities, and we were left outside

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:57.850
contemplating the toxic by-products of the
smelting being done in the nature.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:05.910
Paolo Woods: Here is Vivian and her four-year-old
son, Jonathan.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:11.880
When Vivian gave birth to Jonathan, she and
her immediate family were pretty astonished

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:17.870
to see Jonathan had Asian features.
And she deeply regretted having had a relationship

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:22.501
with her boss in a Chinese restaurant.
And she was abandoned by her husband as a

00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:27.280
consequence.
And Jonathan -- for the time being -- is refused

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.400
by both communities, the African community,
the Zambian community, and the Chinese community.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:38.480
Serge Michel: In this final image of our presentation
here today, you see another case of a child

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:46.620
born from a Zambian mother and a Chinese father.
The father disappeared soon after his birth,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.280
and for the time being, these children are
not well-accepted.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:56.090
This one is not even allowed to leave the
house where his mother lives, because the

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:02.210
Zambian-Chinese relationship right now are
very tense, because the Chinese are in Africa

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.260
to stay.
This will happen, I think, more and more in

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.100
the future.
And maybe, one day, these kids will embody

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.100
a new Africa.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.419
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:13.419 --> 00:31:14.780
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:22.080
Paolo Woods: If anybody has questions concerning
 -- yes.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.390
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:32.680
&gt;&gt; I actually didn't realize this was the
book I bought in Korea.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.650
I was traveling through, and I saw this book.
It said, "China/Africa," which is, I think,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.650
a direct translation of your original title?

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:40.650
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.650
&gt;&gt; And I read like maybe a couple of pages
of the book.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:46.770
I bought it, just to tell you.
[laughter] Just to make you feel better.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:52.550
No, I'm just kidding.
And you mention that there was like an interesting

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.520
gaze that you had on this particular issue,
because you are French.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.679
Like, could you expound a little more on that?

00:31:57.679 --> 00:31:59.880
Paolo Woods: None of us is actually French.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880
Paolo Woods: Serge is Swiss, and I am.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I apologize for that.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.390
Serge Michel: You can guess from my terrible
"Frenchy" accent that, no, I'm Swiss.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:15.720
But, the fact that I work for French media,
and France had colonies in Africa.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:23.000
So I mean, we can easily go through some places.
But the thing is that Chinese themselves have

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.730
no colonial history in Africa.
So they are not limited to a few countries

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:34.070
where they were the masters before independence.
And, for this strip, we went to former Portuguese,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:38.550
former British, former French colonies, and
that is very important, because the Chinese

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.301
do have 53 countries in Africa where they
are present in.

00:32:42.301 --> 00:32:47.750
&gt;&gt; So just as a follow up question, do you
think China will become like sort of a colonial

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.750
power in Africa?

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.049
Paolo Woods: I think it's --

00:32:50.049 --> 00:32:54.410
&gt;&gt; I mean, because the only reason I ask is
like, their relationship with like a couple

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.410
of their boundary regions, and also because
you did end the note with, "Look at these

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.410
children."

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.410
Paolo Woods: Right.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.550
&gt;&gt; So I just want to follow up with that.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:07.640
Paolo Woods: Well, I have problems with the
word "colonial," because colonial immediately

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:13.610
defines in the minds of the Africans a very
specific period, very specific things.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:21.420
The Chinese are clearly in Africa to stay,
but the Chinese do not have a colonial past,

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:27.680
and -- differently from the colonial powers
 -- they do not come and try to impose their

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.450
religion, their philosophy, their way of living.
They're coming for business.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.050
They're very clear, very pragmatic about it.
They want to speak about "win-win" relationship.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.740
As you have seen their presentation, sometimes
it's "win-win," sometimes it's not.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.570
But they do not come with the idea of "We're
colonizing this.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:53.030
This is going to become a province of China.”
So that is very important that there is a

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.480
difference.
But that does not mean that there are a lot

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.440
of elements that are not problematic of the
Chinese expansion there.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:07.400
Serge Michel: For instance, the fact that
they take from Africa raw materials, they

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:15.089
process it in China, and re-export it in Africa
as finished product is a colonial scheme.

00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:20.409
And the French, the British, do the same.
So, in this way, Africans must be aware that

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:29.679
they should ask more of the Chinese.
Because, the more Africans will request, the

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.990
more they will get from China.
And China is also in the learning process

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:36.750
in Africa.
I mean, there have been mistakes.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.450
Zambia, apparently, is one of the biggest
mistakes.

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.519
And they have understood that they have created
an anti-Chinese feeling.

00:34:42.519 --> 00:34:50.169
And they are learning quite fast.
So probably, if Africans manage to tell their

00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:55.199
Chinese partners to behave better, they will.
You bought it in Chinese?

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:58.469
&gt;&gt; I bought it in Korean.

00:34:58.469 --> 00:34:59.469
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:01.079
Serge Michel: Okay.

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:06.489
Paolo Woods: We've been very lucky the book
has been translated in ten different languages.

00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:10.839
And one of the things I'm particularly proud
about is the fact that it's been translated

00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:17.680
in Chinese -- which is not expected, you know.
And a lot of people have felt that maybe there

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.660
was an anti-Chinese sentiment in our book.
And I think that our aim to try to be as balanced

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:28.259
as possible is a proof that it's in English,
in French, in Italian, and in lots of languages,

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:29.869
but in Chinese, in mainland China.

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:39.119
&gt;&gt; Hi. Given that a lot of western governments,
corporations aren't investing in Africa as

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:47.309
much because of security concerns or lack
of good governance, do you think they're missing

00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:52.690
out somehow on big opportunities for business?
is the first part of the question.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:57.829
Second part would be, you know, ultimately
do you think this is going to be a good thing

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:00.359
for the continent?
I mean, you have all this money coming in;

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:05.190
surely, the Chinese government doesn't care
about safety as much in some cases.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:12.970
But do you think like, all this money and
all this interaction will eventually help

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.970
the continent grow economically?

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.839
Serge Michel: If we start maybe from the second
part, I mean, yes, I think it will help -- not

00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:24.710
only because China is actually leaving good
things behind her in Africa like infrastructures.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:31.950
You know, in the past, the West would buy
or extract African oil, and pay it with money

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:38.489
to local governments, and that would fill
their pockets and never reach the simple people.

00:36:38.489 --> 00:36:44.829
China pays in infrastructures, bridge, dams,
railways.

00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:49.890
And, that is more useful for common people.
So I think it's good.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.980
And it's also good, because it has awakened
actually the west.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:58.690
You know, in the 90's, America and Europe
were a bit fed up about Africa.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:03.480
They had the impression -- especially after
the genocide in Rwanda -- that there was nothing

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.730
to be done with Africa.
The more money you pour in Africa, the more

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.259
money disappears, and it will never take off
and never develop.

00:37:11.259 --> 00:37:18.970
So Chinese went there and are showing to the
western powers that there is something to

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.539
be done and there are some good reasons to
go.

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:27.160
And now, you can see -- for example in Angola
 -- many countries have wakened up, and are

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:33.470
queuing in at the airport of Rwanda to make
partnership with Angolese people.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:41.329
So for these reasons, I think it's good.
But, you want to answer the first part of

00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:42.329
the question?

00:37:42.329 --> 00:37:43.369
Paolo Woods: I forgot what the first part
of the question is.

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:44.569
&gt;&gt; Basically, is the West missing out?
It seems apparent.

00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:49.030
Paolo Woods: No, it's coming back fast, the
West.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:54.089
It definitely has missed out, but at times,
you take like Sudan, you know?

00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:56.749
Western companies cannot do business there,
because it's under sanction.

00:37:56.749 --> 00:38:02.580
So that was a golden opportunity for China
to go in and go for the Sudanese oil.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.099
For once they were not buying the oil, they
were actually producing the oil, they were

00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:11.410
extracting the oil themselves.
The Sinopec Chinese companies were there.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:17.730
But, more and more, I think what we will see
is that, the West will start looking at Africa

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:23.660
again not only as a place, you know, good
for handouts or good for aid campaigns.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.640
You know, "Poor Africans, let's help them,"
but sees them as a place where you can do

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.339
business.
And this will happen if the countries have

00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:34.770
more infrastructure.
Obviously, if they have more stable, reliable,

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.950
democratic governments.
And Chinese are not pushing for that side.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.019
They're pushing for infrastructure, and they're
pushing for their own interest of raw materials.

00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:48.960
But the attention on Africa is going to attract,
again, attention from other countries.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.359
As we have recently seen with your president
going to Ghana.

00:38:52.359 --> 00:38:59.089
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like there's going to be
a tension ultimately, because -- whereas the

00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:04.460
Chinese government is very lax about safety
or regulations or who they do business with,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.089
and maybe they're willing to pay their workers
pittance.

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:09.399
Paolo Woods: Mm-hmm.

00:39:09.399 --> 00:39:14.940
&gt;&gt; It seems like if American corporations
tried to go in there, they wouldn't be able

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.940
to compete with that.
There would be a lot of backlash.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:21.019
They would have to follow a lot more regulations.
And so, it almost -- you have these corporations

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:26.940
which will probably try to do that, but not
really be able to compete with the Chinese.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.940
Serge Michel: Sure.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.420
Paolo Woods: If there's going to be competition,
I mean, Africa was a place for ideological

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:36.910
competition in the 60's and 70's between the
two blocks during the cold war.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:40.619
And I think now, it's going to become a place
for business competition.

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:45.809
Chinese obviously have an advantage right
now, but western business can bring other

00:39:45.809 --> 00:39:49.470
advantages, other accesses, that the Chinese
cannot necessarily bring.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.880
Serge Michel: You know, many countries in
Africa were, after independence, locked in

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.220
a close relationship with their former colonial
power.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:04.200
Like Gabon was locked with France and Brazzaville
as well and Zambia with Britain.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:10.009
And this was odd, because the former Metropol
like ______ would decide everything which

00:40:10.009 --> 00:40:16.391
was going on in Brazzaville or in Neboville,
and Chinese came as competitors to the French

00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:23.099
there, and they opened the market.
And they can level.

00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:30.289
The African government, if clever, can use
this competition to get better conditions,

00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:35.359
both from the French and from the Chinese.
We've seen that in Niger.

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:42.440
There's a chapter in the book where the Niger
government was locked in the relationship

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.839
for uranium with the French Areva, which is
one of the world's biggest nuclear companies.

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:52.829
And they were not satisfied with the conditions
the French were giving, so they called the

00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:57.720
Chinese in.
They did as if they were ready to give a big

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:05.059
uranium mine to the Chinese, and they pushed
that impression very far.

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:11.830
And then, the French panicked and offered
double price for the yellow cake, and they

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.559
signed it.
The Chinese were, in this case, just used

00:41:13.559 --> 00:41:15.799
as a.
But it's clever from the Niger countries.

00:41:15.799 --> 00:41:16.799
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:41:16.799 --> 00:41:17.799
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:18.799
&gt;&gt; The last few minutes of conversation seems
like focused on Chinese governments, African

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:19.799
governments.
I was actually visiting Saigon Amigos in May,

00:41:19.799 --> 00:41:20.799
and anecdotally, I just noticed in some places,
the relationship between individuals and the

00:41:20.799 --> 00:41:21.799
government was stronger than in others.
And so, especially in the case of the poor

00:41:21.799 --> 00:41:22.799
working conditions that you mentioned, which
by the way, I think is universal -- like Nike

00:41:22.799 --> 00:41:25.819
has horrible factories in southeast Asia too.
I don't think China's the only perpetrator.

00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:54.599
Who do you think is in the best position to
change that like, the worker's union, or do

00:41:54.599 --> 00:42:09.030
you think governments -- African governments
 -- will even be motivated to?

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:15.940
Serge Michel: It's very difficult.
I mean, in Africa, cynicism has been a way

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.450
to govern and a real -- and a characteristic
of ministers, so.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:26.359
I don't know.
Nigeria is a good example, because it has

00:42:26.359 --> 00:42:30.099
a real market -- inner market -- you know,
150 million people.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:41.200
It's the largest population in Africa.
And there are elections, almost fair and free.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:47.119
And it's a country that is much advanced,
and they are also one of the most interesting

00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:52.009
places for Chinese.
You have about -- we estimate -- 50,000 Chinese

00:42:52.009 --> 00:42:59.400
in Nigeria.
And the plane -- the flight line of Beijing/Lagos

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.529
was the first direct air link between China
and Africa two years ago.

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:09.930
So it's a country, like a laboratory, for
these new kinds of settings.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:19.749
And I think, well, Nigeria has many problems.
Like, it has guerilla in the Niger delta.

00:43:19.749 --> 00:43:28.019
It has also some fighters in the north -- Muslim
fighters -- these days very much enraged.

00:43:28.019 --> 00:43:34.920
But, I think, it can deliver yeah, better
relationship for workers.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.950
Better working conditions.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.799
Paolo Woods: And at the end, I think that
who is going to make a difference are the

00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:44.799
African people, if they live in a country
where the government can be kept accountable,

00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:48.400
which is not the case in many places.
If you have a country which is very rich in

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:54.279
resources, and the government money does not
come from taxes but comes from the resources,

00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:58.559
the government has no problems being reelected,
because it does not depend on the people.

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:04.499
Instead, if there is a system where the government
is accountable to the people, and there's

00:44:04.499 --> 00:44:08.940
really a vote that's going to happen like
it happened in Europe during the Industrial

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:14.759
Revolution, where people then were able to
pass laws that make things respected.

00:44:14.759 --> 00:44:20.349
In the photograph I showed of the workers,
who I said was the birth of a union.

00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:26.039
Those workers actually paid less than the
country's minimum wage.

00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:30.720
So Congo has a minimum wage.
And in a government project being constructed

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.319
by Chinese, the minimum wage is not observed.
So that's the whole, you know, absurdity of

00:44:35.319 --> 00:44:38.330
it all.
So you often have African countries that have

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:47.910
systems -- rules -- that are not that bad,
but they're not observed by the local power.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.140
And well, this will change through the effort
of the people there.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.140
If that answers your question, I'm not sure.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.140
&gt;&gt; I'm curious.
I spent some time living in African settlements

00:44:51.140 --> 00:45:02.190
in East Africa, and there was sort of a rule
of thumb at the time, even back then.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:12.690
And it was, the French would build the railroads,
and the Chinese would build your highways.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:20.700
And so this division of labor and the two
competed with each other.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.359
It was all very polite, you know.
Both working on infrastructure, but Chinese

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:26.830
did the highways, French did railroads.
Now, that's changed.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:34.460
Particularly if Chinese are building railroads.
My question really is, "Are the French still

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:42.171
in the railroad game?
And what -- when -- in the process did the

00:45:42.171 --> 00:45:45.650
 -- and why did the Chinese beat them at that
game?

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:50.259
Because they really, really wanted to keep
the railroad business, at least back in the

00:45:50.259 --> 00:45:52.869
70's.
When did that change?"

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:55.829
Serge Michel: Well, it changed in the 90's
when Chinese came in.

00:45:55.829 --> 00:46:01.619
The World Bank has actually eased a lot the
penetration of China in Africa, because they

00:46:01.619 --> 00:46:06.720
have imposed tenders for all projects of a
certain amount.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.089
So now, they are bidding companies, and the
Chinese always win because they are cheaper

00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:15.510
and they pretend to have the same quality
as the other.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.859
The company doing the railway in Africa is
the one that has built this amazing line in

00:46:19.859 --> 00:46:26.269
China between the main center of China and
Tibet that goes over 4,000 meters high tunnels,

00:46:26.269 --> 00:46:30.280
you know, they have the technical skills to
do that.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:38.109
Now, every time there is a tender, the Chinese
outbid the French, and the French have lost

00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:41.789
the thing.
The French were not able to send a lot of

00:46:41.789 --> 00:46:46.690
workers there.
They would send supervisors, engineers, head

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.140
of project, and then they would recruit locally
people.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.640
And that has proved to be more expensive than
the Chinese method, which is sending thousands

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.480
of Chinese workers there, and working night
and day.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:06.119
So this way, yeah.
I think from the 90's on, French has been

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:14.730
out of the railway business.
And I don't know any project done in Africa

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:21.599
 -- like a road or railway -- done by a western
company, except Brazil is doing a few roads

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:22.599
in Angola.

00:47:22.599 --> 00:47:27.380
&gt;&gt; One other question too, and I came in a
few minutes late, so you might have mentioned

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.979
this, because you were talking about dam when
I came in.

00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:35.680
But, as I understand it, the Chinese at the
moment basically are going around Africa,

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.960
and if there's a river, they'll put a dam
on it.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.519
There are a lot of environmentalists who are
very afraid, because a lot of the places they're

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:52.279
putting dams are going to be flooding wetlands,
which for instance, are the only habitat for

00:47:52.279 --> 00:47:54.489
things like hippopotamus or whatever.
And the thought of the tremendous amount of

00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:59.759
species, in fact, are going to be threatened
if these dams go in.

00:47:59.759 --> 00:48:08.880
Is there any -- this is sort of an odd place
for this sort of thing.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.519
But, can you speak at all to any awareness
of the environmental impact of what's going

00:48:14.519 --> 00:48:15.519
on?

00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:21.839
Paolo Woods: You have loads of western environmental
NGOs in Africa trying to protect African environment.

00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:32.880
Very often, it's as I say it's western and
not African NGOs, because it's difficult if

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.930
you are a westerner and there are Africans
living in very simple conditions telling them,

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.450
"Look, this is beautiful.
You have a beautiful nature here.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.460
You should not get factories.
You should not get roads.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.869
You should not get dams.
You should not get Blackberries.

00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:46.579
You should just live the way you are.
It's so beautiful.

00:48:46.579 --> 00:48:49.999
Because I need those photographs for National
Geographic," you know?

00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:52.569
And so, I completely understand what you are
saying.

00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:59.759
And it's a sentiment that we as westerners
feel when we go there and see what development

00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:07.180
can bring in good and in bad.
And today, many of these environmental NGOs

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:15.359
 -- their chief enemy is the Chinese companies.
And so, it's extremely important that they're

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:21.579
present, and extremely important that they
keep controlling that -- if there is a development

00:49:21.579 --> 00:49:27.559
that is going to take place, can take place
along lines which are possibly a bit sustainable.

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:31.749
Serge Michel: Yeah.
The thing is that the Chinese companies are

00:49:31.749 --> 00:49:38.289
not sensitive to public opinion.
If you take any western company like, even

00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:46.650
Chevron or the oil companies Texaco, Mobile,
they would somehow feel, I mean, that a good

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:51.829
article in New York times would frighten them
to do a very bad project or a project very

00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:57.019
bad for the environment somewhere.
And because they have shareholders, they have

00:49:57.019 --> 00:50:00.229
prepress, and everything.
In China, it's not the case at all.

00:50:00.229 --> 00:50:03.799
So the companies feel very free to do what
they want.

00:50:03.799 --> 00:50:11.210
The thing is that, as for the dam you mentioned,
in Africa there have been about a hundred

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:18.640
sites prepared for dams -- or, not prepared,
but analyzed that were good for dams.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.940
And there is a huge hydropower potential in
Africa, and all the projects Chinese are doing

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:30.849
right now are projects that have never been
financed, but had been prepared and analyzed

00:50:30.849 --> 00:50:35.690
before by western agencies.
So it's places where the damage, for the time

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:42.539
being, is limited, because it has been already
studied by the western NGOs and companies.

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:46.800
The only thing is that, in the west, nobody
was ready to finance the projects, so they

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:53.819
were like on hold for decades.
And now, Chinese are just using the same sketches,

00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:55.950
and doing them.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:01.380
Serge Michel: Yes, yes?

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:07.680
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.
You have mentioned that there is a growing

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.339
diaspora of African people in China.
So, do you have numbers about how many people

00:51:14.339 --> 00:51:18.910
approximately might be immigrating?
And the second question is, you also mentioned

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:24.910
that you didn't want to just read numbers;
you actually wanted to go there and see it

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.249
in person.
What do you consider the most value-added

00:51:27.249 --> 00:51:36.489
benefit of going there in person as opposed
to just reading numbers and stats?

00:51:36.489 --> 00:51:43.029
Serge Michel: Well, the number of Africans
in China is very difficult to say.

00:51:43.029 --> 00:51:47.349
But I've seen figures like 10, 20, 30,000
people in the west coast.

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:55.900
And
you have local -- there is a city in China

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:01.440
called Yu, where it's one of the world's biggest
markets.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:07.769
And you have kilometers of stands to build,
each one sells one product.

00:52:07.769 --> 00:52:14.140
And in this place for example, you have two,
three thousand Africans living there on a

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:19.030
permanent basis to ship containers to their
homeland.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:24.630
And now, you have more and more also students
 -- African students -- that are getting grants

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:29.089
to study Chinese in China.
Translators are badly needed.

00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:34.519
We witnessed that in Africa.
There is a lack of translators that is not

00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:37.539
easing the communication between the two sides.

00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:44.960
Paolo Woods: And a lot of African businessmen
are not part of the diaspora in the sense

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.650
they don't live in China all the time, but
will go there regularly.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.481
So they will go there, you know, when the
containers are getting ready to then bring

00:52:51.481 --> 00:52:58.260
goods to Africa.
And on your other question, "Why is it better

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:04.460
to do on-the-ground reporting than analyze
statistics?" is that, if you analyze statistics,

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.890
somebody is doing those statistics, and those
statistics have to be done on the ground in

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:11.140
the first place.
Because otherwise, it's very difficult to

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:17.460
know exactly what is happening.
A lot of things we had read in articles before

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:26.759
we set out to do this book, were misleading,
were wrong, were even racist.

00:53:26.759 --> 00:53:33.609
And I think that to make an issue like this
interesting and touch the reader, you cannot

00:53:33.609 --> 00:53:36.469
just have analysis.
You have to meet these people.

00:53:36.469 --> 00:53:40.640
You have to spend time with them.
And we were spending endless nights in karaoke

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:48.410
bars with Chinese or in casinos.
And that's what, I think, we tried to transmit

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:52.150
in the book that, not only were you seeing
a phenomenon from a statistical point of view,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.319
but also you're seeing it from a human point
of view.

00:53:55.319 --> 00:54:01.809
You have to think that Africa and China are
probably two of the most different people

00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:04.229
you can imagine.
And they're brought together -- not by an

00:54:04.229 --> 00:54:07.890
empathy -- but are brought together by business
needs.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:13.269
And this collision is a collision will be
very important for what the world is going

00:54:13.269 --> 00:54:16.469
to be in the future.
And we wanted to tell this collision from

00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:20.779
an on-the-ground reporting aspect.
And we wanted to have text and photographs

00:54:20.779 --> 00:54:27.489
to give you an image of what this meant and
what this included.

00:54:27.489 --> 00:54:32.940
You know, we have been working in Afghanistan,
in Iraq, in Kosovo, in many war situations.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:40.019
Just a couple of weeks ago -- one month ago
 -- we were in Iran doing the uprising after

00:54:40.019 --> 00:54:45.339
the election.
And I think we've never done such a hard assignment

00:54:45.339 --> 00:54:51.569
as this one, because getting access to the
Chinese in Africa is very, very difficult.

00:54:51.569 --> 00:54:56.380
In Zambia, we spent there over a month, and
the first three weeks, I did not take one

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.400
single picture, because I was only trying
to get access.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.019
And it was a door closed, a phone slammed
down all the time.

00:55:04.019 --> 00:55:10.509
And I think that's what still makes journalism
interesting and still necessary, especially

00:55:10.509 --> 00:55:17.469
in a time where the press is living such a
hard metamorphosis.

00:55:17.469 --> 00:55:19.929
[pause]

00:55:19.929 --> 00:55:34.880
&gt;&gt; How did you choose the countries that you
visited, and did you consider Tanzania at

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.029
all, specifically?

00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:42.690
Serge Michel: Well, it was very difficult,
because the Chinese are present in 50 countries

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.049
in Africa.
And in every country, they do almost everything.

00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:52.739
We wanted to choose countries which, each
time, something specific would be highlighted,

00:55:52.739 --> 00:55:59.420
like the forest in Congo, like the highway
in Algeria, like the mines in Zambia.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:06.209
We thought that every aspect of the story
should be covered -- embodied by one place.

00:56:06.209 --> 00:56:12.190
Yeah, we considered Tanzania.
But, as we were in Zambia next door, we thought

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:17.339
it's -- I know there are many Chinese there
as well.

00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:26.969
On this East Coast of Africa, southeast coast,
there are many Chinese there that have been

00:56:26.969 --> 00:56:33.859
there for a long time, like a century or so.
You know, when slavery was abolished at the

00:56:33.859 --> 00:56:41.349
end of the 19th century, the slaves were actually
replaced by coolies, the Chinese labor, and

00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:49.729
these coolies were imported massively in Africa
and also as well in America to build the railways,

00:56:49.729 --> 00:56:52.049
TransAtlantic.
And you have these communities -- they are

00:56:52.049 --> 00:56:54.859
living, but they don't even speak Chinese
anymore.

00:56:54.859 --> 00:57:01.049
They are called by Chinese, "The birds without
wings," because they don't speak their own

00:57:01.049 --> 00:57:08.430
language.
We were a bit -- we don't want to report on

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:12.729
these people, because they are not a new phenomenon.
They are left from history.

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:16.349
So we wanted to see the newcomers the last
ten years.

00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:21.319
And they are mostly in Nigeria, in Angola,
in Zambia.

00:57:21.319 --> 00:57:28.009
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:57:28.009 --> 00:57:29.689
