00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.877
Now I want to present you with three questions. I really want you to think

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.468
about this and discuss it with your peers on the forum. First, I want you to

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:10.300
think about how old your parents were when they got married, if they got

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.510
married. Now does this significantly differ from when you got married, or from

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.675
when you actually want to get married? Why yes or why no? Here’s the second

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:24.164
question. Why do you think there’s a shift in the age people get married? And

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:27.851
the last question. What are the main things that make you think that you are,

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:32.956
will be, or were ready to get married? So go to the forum and let’s talk about

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.797
this. I’m really excited to see what you guys say. I think this is going to be

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:37.200
a great discussion that we can have.
