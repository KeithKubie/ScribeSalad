00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.520
Welcome back.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.610
I tried to start doing problem
number 10 in the last video,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.800
but I realized I was running
out of time, so

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.240
let me start over.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.520
Problem number 10.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.180
The Smith Metals Company
old machine makes

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.191
300 bolts per hour.

00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:23.410
Its new machine makes
450 bolts per hour.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.080
If both machines begin running
at the same time, how many

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.420
minutes will it take the
two machines to make a

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.330
total of 900 bolts?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.560
So the important thing
to realize is

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.630
that they said minutes.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.580
So we could convert both of
these rates to minutes now, or

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.120
we could say how many hours is
it going to take, and then

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.180
convert that to minutes after
we have our answer.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.220
Actually, let's do it the second
way, let's say how many

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.510
hours and then convert
that to minutes.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.560
So let's say we want to
produce 900 bolts.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.280
And how much are we going
to produce in each hour?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.800
Well, they're both running
at the same time, right?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.810
So in every hour, we're going to
produce 300 plus 450 bolts.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:18.260
We're going to produce
750 bolts per hour.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.500
Times, let's say x hours.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.530
The units might confuse you, so
just leave out the units.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.740
This is how many hours it takes
to produce 900 bolts, so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460
you divide both sides by 750.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.620
You get x is equal to 900/750.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.350
Let's see what I can do here.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.040
See, if I divide the top and the
bottom by 30, the top will

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.390
become 30 over-- and then the
bottom, 75 divided by 3 is

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.540
20-- 75 divided by 3 is 25.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.280
So 30/25.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.890
Then I could-- let's see,
5 is a common factor.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.550
I can do it all in
one fell swoop.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.590
So that's 6/5.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.520
So it's going to
take 6/5 hours.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.680
That's how long it's
going to take us.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.470
How many minutes is that?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.910
Every hour is 1 minute--
I mean, sorry,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.420
every hour is 60 minutes.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.560
It's getting late.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.700
So 6/5 hours.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.660
You just have to multiply it by
60 to get how many minutes

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.070
is equal to-- see, you can
cancel this 5, make this a 12.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.670
You get 6 times 12
is 72 minutes.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.730
And that is choice B.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.980
Next problem.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.050
I've been using this yellow
a while, let me switch.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.110
Problem 11.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.390
The table above gives the values
of the linear function

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.620
g for selected values of t.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.130
Which of the following
defines g?

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.570
OK, so they say t and
they say g of t.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.280
They go from negative 1, 0,
1, 2, let's see, it's

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.450
4, 2, 0, minus 2.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.090
So the one thing I always look
at is what g of 0 is because

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.080
that tends to be interesting.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.700
Especially when I look at
all of the choices.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270
All of the choices are of this
form, they're all of the form

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.220
m times t plus B.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.290
Where m is the slope-- if you're
familiar with linear

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.060
equations, you're familiar
with this form.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
And so when t equals 0, g of t
tells you what the y-intercept

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.040
is going to be, right?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.130
So let's see, g of
0 is equal to 2.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.710
So that tells us that this
equation g of t is going to be

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.620
equal to the slope times
t plus 2, right?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.170
Because when t was 0, all
we had left with was 2.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.190
And so immediately, we can
cancel out all but the last

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.915
two choices.

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:05.470
So the last two choices, choice
D is g of t is equal to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.460
minus t plus 2.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.910
And then the last choice
is g of t is equal to

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.650
minus 2t plus 2.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.050
Let's see which one of
these works, we can

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.670
try out some numbers.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.450
So what happens when
t is negative 1?

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.760
When t is negative 1, this
expression becomes negative 1

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.950
times negative.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.550
Negative negative 1 is positive
1, so this becomes 3.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.080
That's not right.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.740
This one becomes negative
2 times negative 1 is

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.630
positive 2, plus 2.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.600
So this becomes 4.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.830
So we can immediately cancel
this one out because it

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.930
didn't-- here, for this g of t,
g of negative 1 equaled 3,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.980
and they tell us right here
it's supposed to equal 4.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.760
This one worked.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.300
And this is kind of the only
one that still works.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.750
It had a 2 for the y-intercept,
and when you

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.660
evaluate it for just even
the first point, you

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.650
got the right answer.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.230
So that's the answer,
the answer is E.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.010
Next problem.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.540
OK, survey results.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.150
I guess I should draw this.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.220
I haven't read the question, but
it's probably important.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.440
Let's see, there's about
five squares that way.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:33.950
So that means I have to draw
four lines, that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.720
And then eight lines
I have to draw.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.790
1-- that's always the hardest
part, just drawing these

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:49.320
diagrams-- 2, 3, 4-- and you're
learning how to count--

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:59.230
5, 6, 7-- almost
there-- and 8.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.500
All righty.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.560
And then they say, these
are the grades--

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.440
the y-axis is grade.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.990
Grade 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.060
The x-axis is distance
to school in miles.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.390
And these are the points.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.220
1 comma 10 is right here.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.330
2 comma 9.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.770
2 comma 11.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.260
3 comma 10.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.380
3 comma 12.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.440
4 comma-- let's see,
4 is at 10 and 11.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.290
5-- they have one point at 11.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.640
6 has three points right
here, 10, 11, and 12.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.080
Let's see.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.770
There's a point here,
here, here.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.470
And then a point
here and here.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.710
Now we can start the problem.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.490
The results of a survey of 16
students at Thompson High

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.680
School are given in
the grid above.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.300
It shows the distance to the
nearest mile that students at

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.180
various grade levels
travel to school.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.510
So this is miles.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.760
And this is grade.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.430
According to the grid, which
of the following is true?

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.010
So I'll just read them out.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.180
A, there's only one student
who travels

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.605
two miles to school.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.060
Let's see, two miles.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.050
False, there's two students.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.500
There is this guy
and this guy.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.600
So it's not A.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.540
Choice B, half of the students
travel less than

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.500
four miles to school.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.250
So that's-- less than four miles
is everyone to the left

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.450
of this line, right?

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.490
And this is actually
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.800
5 out of 16 is not half, so
we know it's not choice B.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.640
C, more 12th graders than 11th
graders travel six miles or

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.890
more to school.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.560
So they're saying more 12th
graders than 11th graders.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.110
So six miles or more.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.530
So let's see, six miles or more
is anything to the right

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.310
of this line, right?

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.090
That's six miles or more.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.670
There are three 12th graders.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.220
And how many 11th graders
are there?

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.140
There are two 11th graders.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.770
I think that is correct.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.280
More 12th graders than 11th
graders travel six or more

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.540
miles to school.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.430
Six or more miles, three 12th
graders, two 11th graders.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.420
That's our answer,
our answer is C.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.000
Next problem.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.950
I don't know if I'll have time
for this one, I'll try.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.520
Problem 13.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.429
How many positive three digit
integers have the hundreds

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:47.960
digit equal to 3 and the units
digit is equal to 4.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.190
So it's going to be
like 3 blank 4.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.410
So how many numbers are here?

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.630
Well, how many digits can
we stick in for that?

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.240
Well, we could put a
0, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.940
6, 7, 8, or 9 there.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.240
We could put any of those
in that middle spot.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.500
And there are 10 digits we can
put there, so there are 10

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.230
possibilities.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.640
There are 10 positive three
digit integers that have the

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.060
hundreds digit equal to 3 and
the units digit equal to 4.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.900
That's choice A.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.740
That's one of those problems
that you question yourself

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.140
because it seems maybe
even too easy.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.420
I'll see you in the
next video.
