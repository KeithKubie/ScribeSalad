brain scientist I think we all think
about is how do we know when computers

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
about is how do we know when computers

this what are the sort of standard by
 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.280
this what are the sort of standard by
which we say a machine is intelligent

I keep pondering is when there'll be an

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
I keep pondering is when there'll be an
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.539
I keep pondering is when there'll be an
ethical question whether or not we're

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549
ethical question whether or not we're
 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.470
ethical question whether or not we're
allowed to unplug Watson okay it's not

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
allowed to unplug Watson okay it's not
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.880
allowed to unplug Watson okay it's not
this when he complains it's got to be

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
this when he complains it's got to be
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.640
this when he complains it's got to be
deeper than that okay and so that's my

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
deeper than that okay and so that's my
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.930
deeper than that okay and so that's my
first question to the audience will

perspective on this perhaps I would say

00:07:59.800 --> 00:07:59.810
perspective on this perhaps I would say

that I have a more circumscribed

because my own area of interest really
 

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.460
because my own area of interest really
is human cognition and so for me it's a

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.470
is human cognition and so for me it's a
 

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.620
is human cognition and so for me it's a
really deep issue about what human

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:11.630
really deep issue about what human

artificial intelligence and the one is
that it's not clear that intelligence is

is related if you unplug the machine you

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.410

have a much better chance to be able to

have a much better chance to be able to
restore it to that state again then we

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.550
restore it to that state again then we
 

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.130
restore it to that state again then we
do then what then we certainly could for

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.140
do then what then we certainly could for

and I think I had a new appreciation for
 

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.070
and I think I had a new appreciation for

the things become clear is that our kids

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:02.060
the things become clear is that our kids
 

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.210
the things become clear is that our kids
rapidly outperform even the smartest

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:04.220

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340
kind of plexiglass just as you can see
 

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.160
kind of plexiglass just as you can see
in the bottom and then put them in a box

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.170
in the bottom and then put them in a box
 

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.470
in the bottom and then put them in a box
and illuminated it from the bottom as

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480
and illuminated it from the bottom as
 

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.960
and illuminated it from the bottom as
though this were sort of something of an

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:08.970
though this were sort of something of an
 

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.650
though this were sort of something of an
intelligent sort of sculpture in itself

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:12.660
intelligent sort of sculpture in itself
 

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:18.500
intelligent sort of sculpture in itself
so I think that there are at CMU

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.510
so I think that there are at CMU
 

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.900
so I think that there are at CMU
initiatives to really bring science and

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:20.910
initiatives to really bring science and
 

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.780
initiatives to really bring science and
art together and so maybe one day we'll

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:23.790
art together and so maybe one day we'll
 

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.760
art together and so maybe one day we'll
have Jerry Cohen standing here and

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:25.770
have Jerry Cohen standing here and
 

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.340
have Jerry Cohen standing here and
saying we've got Nobel winners and Tony

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:28.350
saying we've got Nobel winners and Tony
 

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.830
saying we've got Nobel winners and Tony
winners and some individuals who in fact

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840
winners and some individuals who in fact
 

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.770
winners and some individuals who in fact
have been able to to garner both and so

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:33.780
have been able to to garner both and so
 

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.360
have been able to to garner both and so
the question is well what is this

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.370
the question is well what is this
 

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.490
the question is well what is this
creativity and while we can teach it to

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500
creativity and while we can teach it to
 

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.680
creativity and while we can teach it to
our students

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:38.690
our students
 

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.330
our students
why can't computer said it could we

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340
why can't computer said it could we
 

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.910
why can't computer said it could we
teach it to computers so this is a

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:43.920
teach it to computers so this is a
 

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.340
teach it to computers so this is a
question that I have for Tom maybe in

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:46.350
question that I have for Tom maybe in
 

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.920
question that I have for Tom maybe in
when I watched Watson performing I

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:48.930
when I watched Watson performing I
 

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.150
when I watched Watson performing I
actually think Watson's quite creative

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:50.160
actually think Watson's quite creative
 

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.050
actually think Watson's quite creative
and that's in an unusual session comes

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:54.060
and that's in an unusual session comes
 

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.750
and that's in an unusual session comes
up with error responses they really

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760
up with error responses they really
 

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.030
up with error responses they really
humans would not come up with but some

00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.040
humans would not come up with but some
 

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.340
humans would not come up with but some
of them are really quite quirky quite

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:01.350
of them are really quite quirky quite
 

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.970
of them are really quite quirky quite
sunny and quite quaint is this computer

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980
sunny and quite quaint is this computer
 

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.010
sunny and quite quaint is this computer
creativity

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:06.020
creativity
 

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.640
creativity
what's creative if you I think if you

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:09.650
what's creative if you I think if you
 

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.860
what's creative if you I think if you
one type of creativity I think is really

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:12.870
one type of creativity I think is really
 

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.660
one type of creativity I think is really
connecting up fats that you didn't think

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:14.670
connecting up fats that you didn't think
 

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.180
connecting up fats that you didn't think
we're connected yeah and I think that's

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:17.190
we're connected yeah and I think that's
 

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.730
we're connected yeah and I think that's
exactly what Watson does in fact right

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740
exactly what Watson does in fact right
 

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.660
exactly what Watson does in fact right
so it's got this tremendous volume of

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:22.670
so it's got this tremendous volume of
 

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.880
so it's got this tremendous volume of
facts sitting around you get a question

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:25.890
facts sitting around you get a question
 

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.340
facts sitting around you get a question
in those jeopardy questions demand that

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.350
in those jeopardy questions demand that
 

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.470
in those jeopardy questions demand that
you put together weird chains and things

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480
you put together weird chains and things
 

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.510
you put together weird chains and things
if that's not creativity I don't know

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520
if that's not creativity I don't know
 

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.430
if that's not creativity I don't know
what is well what about also though I

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440
what is well what about also though I
 

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.870
what is well what about also though I
mean herb Simon used to love to talk

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880
mean herb Simon used to love to talk
 

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.140
mean herb Simon used to love to talk
about insight so I mean what about the

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:39.150
about insight so I mean what about the
 

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.820
about insight so I mean what about the
whole I can computers new insight at

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:40.830
whole I can computers new insight at
 

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.170
whole I can computers new insight at
this pointer is it's something uniquely

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:42.180
this pointer is it's something uniquely
 

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:48.110
this pointer is it's something uniquely
human yeah well I could have an insight

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120
human yeah well I could have an insight
 

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.169
human yeah well I could have an insight
on this I could try and channel but I

00:25:52.169 --> 00:25:52.179
on this I could try and channel but I
 

00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:55.799
on this I could try and channel but I
I'm thinking that this question has to

00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:55.809
I'm thinking that this question has to
 

00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:58.289
I'm thinking that this question has to
do with thinking that computers that

00:25:58.289 --> 00:25:58.299
do with thinking that computers that
 

00:25:58.299 --> 00:26:00.210
do with thinking that computers that
when we build computers we're building

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:00.220
when we build computers we're building
 

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.749
when we build computers we're building
approximate people and then all the

00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:03.759
approximate people and then all the
 

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:06.359
approximate people and then all the
questions of Rights and personhood and

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:06.369
questions of Rights and personhood and
 

00:26:06.369 --> 00:26:08.310
questions of Rights and personhood and
all those things keep cropping up effect

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320
all those things keep cropping up effect
 

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.799
all those things keep cropping up effect
for those people so on but I want to

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:10.809
for those people so on but I want to
 

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:12.749
for those people so on but I want to
think let's think about computers

00:26:12.749 --> 00:26:12.759
think let's think about computers
 

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:14.460
think let's think about computers
somewhat differently go around at a

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:14.470
somewhat differently go around at a
 

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.139
somewhat differently go around at a
different way rather than saying they're

humans they don't populate this
continuum so why don't we think about

00:26:19.769 --> 00:26:19.779
continuum so why don't we think about
 

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:22.259
continuum so why don't we think about
something else that's a person that's

00:26:22.259 --> 00:26:22.269
something else that's a person that's
 

00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:24.539
something else that's a person that's
not on this continuum at all I know of

not on this continuum at all I know of
something systems that have that are not

something systems that have that are not

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.480
sentient have no physical existence are
not even intelligent and then they have

not even intelligent and then they have
 

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.460
not even intelligent and then they have
rights and they have rights in every

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:44.879
corporations have rights and preparation
 

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:48.899
corporations have rights and preparation
corporations are our creatures and they

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:48.909
corporations are our creatures and they
 

00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:50.759
corporations are our creatures and they
have rights not because they have moral

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:50.769
have rights not because they have moral
 

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:53.430
have rights not because they have moral
worth or because they are like us they

that's what we want all these AI systems

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:06.309
that's what we want all these AI systems
 

00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:09.389
that's what we want all these AI systems
to do not to mimic us I mean there are

00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399
to do not to mimic us I mean there are
 

00:27:09.399 --> 00:27:10.859
to do not to mimic us I mean there are
plenty of really interesting people

plenty of really interesting people

plenty of really interesting people
around but to do something on their own

automated Supreme Court I think that's a

automated Supreme Court I think that's a
really interesting idea and it makes me

really interesting idea and it makes me

know so there are programs out there
 

00:27:39.639 --> 00:27:41.970

may be that again the standards of what
we consider creativity or insight and

we consider creativity or insight and

we consider creativity or insight and
things actually have to be different

things actually have to be different
 

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.619
things actually have to be different
because there's things that are human

you've said maybe it's already creative

necessarily do I'd like to sort of think
 

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.269
necessarily do I'd like to sort of think
about this from a somewhat different

about this from a somewhat different
 

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:03.880
about this from a somewhat different

it that the two-dollar calculator can

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:08.310
it that the two-dollar calculator can
 

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.940
it that the two-dollar calculator can
solve math problems that I can and from

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:10.950
solve math problems that I can and from
 

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.380
solve math problems that I can and from
my perspective one of the interesting

my perspective one of the interesting
 

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.850
my perspective one of the interesting
things and this gets back to my sort of

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860
things and this gets back to my sort of
 

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.350

response to the earlier question is that

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360
response to the earlier question is that
 

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.480
response to the earlier question is that
there's there's a biological hardware on

there's there's a biological hardware on
 

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.180
there's there's a biological hardware on
that underlies it and that biological

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.190
that underlies it and that biological
 

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.710

and all these other things and I think
 

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.200
and all these other things and I think
that by appreciating some of the aspects

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.210
that by appreciating some of the aspects
 

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.960
that by appreciating some of the aspects
of this biological hardware will

of this biological hardware will
 

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.800

thought is that you kind of run a little

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.280
thought is that you kind of run a little
 

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.010
thought is that you kind of run a little
mental simulation of it because you

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.020
mental simulation of it because you
 

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.780

I don't have access to your thoughts but
 

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.450
I don't have access to your thoughts but
what I can do is I can look at you

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:22.460
what I can do is I can look at you
 

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.580
what I can do is I can look at you
really carefully and I can very quickly

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:24.590
really carefully and I can very quickly
 

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.560
really carefully and I can very quickly
try and run a little mental mental

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:26.570
try and run a little mental mental
 

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.530
try and run a little mental mental
simulation if I were bluffing I would be

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:29.540
simulation if I were bluffing I would be
 

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.300
simulation if I were bluffing I would be
doing X and then I can look at you and

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:31.310
doing X and then I can look at you and
 

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.420
doing X and then I can look at you and
say well maybe you are bluffing because

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:34.430
say well maybe you are bluffing because
 

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.230
say well maybe you are bluffing because
you've got the same

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240

I don't know fidgety nurse that I would
 

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.150
I don't know fidgety nurse that I would
have if I were bluffing and so this is

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.160
have if I were bluffing and so this is
 

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.830
have if I were bluffing and so this is
kind of

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840
kind of
 

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.020
kind of
it's in their idea to do this kind of

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.030
it's in their idea to do this kind of
 

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.180
it's in their idea to do this kind of
theory of mind as it's called to run

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.190
theory of mind as it's called to run
 

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.910
theory of mind as it's called to run
these mental simulations I think maybe

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:48.920
these mental simulations I think maybe
 

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.870
these mental simulations I think maybe
uniquely human I may be wrong well I

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880
uniquely human I may be wrong well I
 

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.220
uniquely human I may be wrong well I
think that's when the challenge is I

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:54.230
think that's when the challenge is I
 

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.740

would say is maybe we certainly don't

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:56.750
would say is maybe we certainly don't
 

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.990
would say is maybe we certainly don't
have automated systems that are able to

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000
have automated systems that are able to
 

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.700
have automated systems that are able to
incorporate this and so I think that

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:00.710
incorporate this and so I think that
 

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.010
incorporate this and so I think that
this is sort of part of the the Kenyan

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.020
this is sort of part of the the Kenyan
 

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.600
this is sort of part of the the Kenyan

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:04.610
that will have to be crossed in order to
 

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.789
that will have to be crossed in order to
be able to get around to a level playing

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799
be able to get around to a level playing
 

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:09.520
be able to get around to a level playing

of course the computer is expressionless

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:11.330
of course the computer is expressionless

of course the computer is expressionless
yes you'll never know if it's bluffing

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960

mean that's the sort of minimal

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:19.910
mean that's the sort of minimal
 

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.700
mean that's the sort of minimal

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.710
information that I think you could gain
 

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.200
information that I think you could gain
and then of course the computer could

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.210
and then of course the computer could
 

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.419
and then of course the computer could
randomize that if it so chose so so I

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:25.429
randomize that if it so chose so so I

well and that's if your computer is

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:43.700
well and that's if your computer is
 

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.010
well and that's if your computer is
consistent and that's something that

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:45.020

chess-playing computers certainly you

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960

know looked at every game that their
 

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.060
know looked at every game that their
opponents had ever played and new

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280
detailed pictures of the way our brains
 

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.730
detailed pictures of the way our brains
work so that'll be the first part the

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:18.740
work so that'll be the first part the
 

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.930
work so that'll be the first part the
problem is getting good pictures and

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:19.940
problem is getting good pictures and
 

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.220
problem is getting good pictures and
then we have to understand what we've

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:21.230
then we have to understand what we've
 

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.570
then we have to understand what we've
got when we've got these huge piles of

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:22.580
got when we've got these huge piles of
 

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.400
got when we've got these huge piles of
data and that's where people like Tom

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.410
data and that's where people like Tom
 

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.530

I didn't quite hear all the questions so

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.330
I didn't quite hear all the questions so
 

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.630
I didn't quite hear all the questions so
tell me if I didn't if I missed the

ask the question of how they have

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:56.940
ask the question of how they have
 

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.390
ask the question of how they have
changed how individual cells are changed

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400

this Nathan mentioned that the wonderful

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:48.270
this Nathan mentioned that the wonderful
 

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.880
this Nathan mentioned that the wonderful
thing about brain imaging is we can see

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:49.890
thing about brain imaging is we can see
 

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.680
thing about brain imaging is we can see
where the activity is and we some of

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.690
where the activity is and we some of
 

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.630
where the activity is and we some of
these other techniques we can see where

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640
these other techniques we can see where
 

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.420
these other techniques we can see where
the changes are but it's a lot different

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.430
the changes are but it's a lot different
 

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.000
the changes are but it's a lot different
to see where the activity is and to see

00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.010
to see where the activity is and to see

to see where the activity is and to see
where is the information coded in the

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680
where is the information coded in the
 

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.790
where is the information coded in the
brain and so what we found we can do by

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800
brain and so what we found we can do by
 

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.100
brain and so what we found we can do by
using machine learning methods is that

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.110
using machine learning methods is that
 

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.860
using machine learning methods is that
we can essentially build virtual sensors

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:09.870
we can essentially build virtual sensors
 

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.100
we can essentially build virtual sensors
of where the information is and we do it

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.110
of where the information is and we do it
 

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.170
of where the information is and we do it
like this we have let's suppose we
