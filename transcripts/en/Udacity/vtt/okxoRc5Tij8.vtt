00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alright, so we know that the running time for simulating

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
if&lt;u&gt;better on a deterministic RAM is 2 to the number of times used.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Once we realize that, we really just have to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
plug in these times to figure it out.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So for a constant number of times,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
this increases it to polynomial and similarly with order log N times.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now for order N times,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we have essentially 2 to the N here,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which is exponential.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now this last one is a little tricky,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but really you just need to realize that this is a polynomial time algorithm,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so it's at least slower than an order N algorithm,

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so it's also exponential.
