00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.340
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.080
prove the change of base
formula for logarithms,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.090
which tells us-- let me
write this-- formula.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.040
Which tells us that if I want
to figure out the logarithm base

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.150
a of x, that I can
figure this out

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.430
by taking logarithms
with a different base.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.790
That this would be equal
to the logarithm base

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:47.020
b-- so some other base-- base b
of x, divided by the logarithm

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.720
base b of a.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.320
And this is a really
useful result.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.590
If your calculator only
has natural logarithm

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.450
or log base 10, you can
now use this to figure out

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.850
the logarithm using any base.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.440
If you want to figure
out the log base

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.481
2-- let me make it clear.

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:09.270
If you want to figure
out the logarithm base,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.950
let's say, base 3
of, let's say, 25,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.740
you can use your calculator
either using log base 10

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.332
or log base 2.

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:20.790
So you could say
that this is going

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.810
to be equal to log
base 10 of 25--

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.920
and most calculators have
a button for that-- divided

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.760
by log base 10 of 3.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.500
So this is an application of
the change of base formula.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770
But let's actually prove it.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.550
So let's say that
we want to-- let's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:01.980
set logarithm base a of x to
be equal to some new variable.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.170
Let's call that variable,
let's call that equal to y.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.139
So this right over here, we are
just setting that equal to y.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.160
Well, this is just another way
of saying that a to the y power

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.740
is equal to x.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:24.630
So we can rewrite this as a
to the y power is equal to x.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.180
I'll write the x out
here, because I'm

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.029
about to-- these two
things are equal.

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:30.570
This is just another
way of restating

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.320
what we just wrote up here.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.760
Now, let's introduce
the logarithm base b.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.240
And to introduce it, I'm
just to take log base

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.220
b of both sides
of this equation.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.640
So let's take logarithm base
b of the left-hand side,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.680
and logarithm base b
of the right-hand side.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.710
Well, we know from our
logarithm properties

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.110
that the logarithm of
something to a power

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.350
is the exact same
thing as the power

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.210
times the logarithm
of that something.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.040
So logarithm base
b of a to the y

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.920
is the same thing as y times
the logarithm base b of a.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.870
So this is just a traditional
logarithm property.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.480
We prove it elsewhere.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.990
And we already know
it's going to be

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.230
equal to the right-hand side.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.090
It's going to be equal
to log base b of x.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.190
And now, let's just solve for y.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.357
And this is exciting, because y
was this thing right over here.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:33.940
But now if we solve
for y, we're going

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.540
to be solving for y in
terms of logarithm base b.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.170
To solve for y, we
just have to divide

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.000
both sides of this equation
by log base b of a.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.970
So we divide by log base b
of a on the left-hand side,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.850
and we divide by log base b
of a on the right-hand side.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.480
And so on the left-hand
side, these two characters

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.790
are going to cancel out.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.090
And we are left with-- and
we deserve a drum roll now--

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.759
that y is equal to log base b
of x divided by log base b of a.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.550
So let me write it.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.533
Just copy and paste
this so I don't

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:20.410
have to keep switching colors.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.800
So let me paste this.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.860
So there you have it.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.590
You have your change
of base formula.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.800
Remember, y is the same thing
as this thing right over here.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.290
y is log of a.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.800
Actually, let me make it clear.
y, which is equal to log of a,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.840
which is equal to log base
a of x-- so copy and paste--

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.510
y, which is equal to this thing,
which is how we defined it

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.120
right over here, y is equal
to log base a of x, we've just

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.370
shown, is also equal to this, if
we write it in terms of base b.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.740
And we have our change
of base formula.
