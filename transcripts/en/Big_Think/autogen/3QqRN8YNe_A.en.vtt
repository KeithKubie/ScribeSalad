democracy in various places and then of
course the Bush administration took it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
course the Bush administration took it
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.439
course the Bush administration took it
to the next level with the invasion of

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449
to the next level with the invasion of
 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.049

tried to topple Muammar Gaddafi as well
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.669
tried to topple Muammar Gaddafi as well
so this is a bipartisan product of

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679
so this is a bipartisan product of
 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.689
so this is a bipartisan product of
democratic liberal internationalists and

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699
democratic liberal internationalists and
 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.340
democratic liberal internationalists and
republican neoconservatives and the

republican neoconservatives and the
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959
republican neoconservatives and the
basic idea is to try and spread

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
basic idea is to try and spread
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.360
basic idea is to try and spread
something like the american system in as

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
something like the american system in as
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209
something like the american system in as
many places around the world as we could

many places around the world as we could
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.399
many places around the world as we could
the problem is this doesn't work very

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409
the problem is this doesn't work very
 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.919
the problem is this doesn't work very
well it failed in Iraq it's failing in

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929
well it failed in Iraq it's failing in
 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.290

Afghanistan it failed in Yemen it failed
 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.230
Afghanistan it failed in Yemen it failed
in Libya and it's not looking

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
in Libya and it's not looking
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.959
in Libya and it's not looking
particularly good in places like Hungary

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969
particularly good in places like Hungary
 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.090
particularly good in places like Hungary
and Poland which are starting to show

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
and Poland which are starting to show
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679

certain liberal signs

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
certain liberal signs
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230
certain liberal signs
moreover the optimism people once had

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
moreover the optimism people once had
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.389
moreover the optimism people once had
about Russia becoming a member of the

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399
about Russia becoming a member of the
 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.190
about Russia becoming a member of the
Democratic family of Nations I think

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
Democratic family of Nations I think
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620
Democratic family of Nations I think
have been disappointed as well now why

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
have been disappointed as well now why
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.490
have been disappointed as well now why
does this fail

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
does this fail
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.090
does this fail
well first problem of course is that

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100
well first problem of course is that
 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.760
well first problem of course is that
spreading democracy into other countries

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
spreading democracy into other countries
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.080
spreading democracy into other countries
inevitably means regime change you've

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
inevitably means regime change you've
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520
inevitably means regime change you've
got to get rid of the existing

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
got to get rid of the existing
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.319
got to get rid of the existing
government and replace it with something

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
government and replace it with something
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.779
government and replace it with something
new but of course when you take apart an

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789
new but of course when you take apart an
 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.849
new but of course when you take apart an
existing order you can't be sure what

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859
existing order you can't be sure what
 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.950
existing order you can't be sure what
the new orders going to look like and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
the new orders going to look like and
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.779
the new orders going to look like and
you're gonna create a lot of angry

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789
you're gonna create a lot of angry
 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.120
you're gonna create a lot of angry
losers people who are resentful at their

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
losers people who are resentful at their
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639
losers people who are resentful at their
loss of power and status and in some

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
loss of power and status and in some
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.179
loss of power and status and in some
places like Iraq or Libya they're able

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
places like Iraq or Libya they're able
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.469
places like Iraq or Libya they're able
to take up arms to resist this effort so

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479
to take up arms to resist this effort so
 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.429
to take up arms to resist this effort so
simultaneously you create an incentive

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
simultaneously you create an incentive
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200
simultaneously you create an incentive
for resistance an incentive for

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
for resistance an incentive for
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569
for resistance an incentive for
insurgency and by destroying the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
insurgency and by destroying the
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.880
insurgency and by destroying the
existing order you could also create an

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
existing order you could also create an
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830
existing order you could also create an
open space where terrorists and other

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
open space where terrorists and other
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770
open space where terrorists and other
extremists can flourish so a big problem

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
extremists can flourish so a big problem
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420
extremists can flourish so a big problem
first is you're beginning by tearing

replace it that really is the second
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.450
replace it that really is the second
problem we don't know how to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
