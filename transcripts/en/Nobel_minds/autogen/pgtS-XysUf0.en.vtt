was that this is actually something

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260
was that this is actually something
 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.710
was that this is actually something
that's found only in bacteria we don't

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720
that's found only in bacteria we don't

repair they were first identified in
 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.200
repair they were first identified in
simple cells and then it turned out that

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210
simple cells and then it turned out that
 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.600

this knowledge was applicable also to
 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.290
this knowledge was applicable also to
our higher human cells and that we have

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300
our higher human cells and that we have
 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.050
our higher human cells and that we have
very similar systems that take care of

but the repair system is not enough we

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290
but the repair system is not enough we
 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.260
but the repair system is not enough we
still have diseases costs but by the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270
still have diseases costs but by the
 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.840
still have diseases costs but by the
damage of DNA how big part of the

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850
damage of DNA how big part of the
 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.220
damage of DNA how big part of the
diseases is you as it's their origin in

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230
diseases is you as it's their origin in
 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.520
diseases is you as it's their origin in
this process so one can say that Dean

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530
this process so one can say that Dean
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.510
this process so one can say that Dean
imitations how to put this I mean if you

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520
imitations how to put this I mean if you
 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.730
imitations how to put this I mean if you
think about cancer i would say that all

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740
think about cancer i would say that all
 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.810
think about cancer i would say that all
forms of cancers start with a mutation

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820
forms of cancers start with a mutation
 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.590
forms of cancers start with a mutation
or a DNA damage that's how they start we

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600
or a DNA damage that's how they start we
 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.820
or a DNA damage that's how they start we
know so I mean that's how important is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830
know so I mean that's how important is
 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.270
know so I mean that's how important is
this and if you don't have repair system

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280
this and if you don't have repair system
 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.450

what one thing one importantly to

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720
what one thing one importantly to
 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.620
what one thing one importantly to
radiation does is that it induces breaks

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630
radiation does is that it induces breaks
 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.500
radiation does is that it induces breaks
in DNA so it breaks down the DNA in

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510
in DNA so it breaks down the DNA in
 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.990
in DNA so it breaks down the DNA in
cancer cells and breaking down the DNA

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000
cancer cells and breaking down the DNA
 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.030
cancer cells and breaking down the DNA
means that we overwhelm the repair

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040
means that we overwhelm the repair
 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.860
means that we overwhelm the repair
system the repairs is there are so many

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870
system the repairs is there are so many
 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.500

there are also new drugs being developed

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.390
there are also new drugs being developed
 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.950
there are also new drugs being developed
where one tries to to utilize the effect

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960
where one tries to to utilize the effect

so by by inhibiting repair actually in

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520
so by by inhibiting repair actually in
 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.640
so by by inhibiting repair actually in
the cancer cells you might get something

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.650
the cancer cells you might get something
 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.380
the cancer cells you might get something
that we call synthetic lethality and

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.390
that we call synthetic lethality and
 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.420
that we call synthetic lethality and
that will sort of specifically kill the

that will sort of specifically kill the
 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.070
that will sort of specifically kill the
cancer cells this is a very interesting

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080
cancer cells this is a very interesting
 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.580
cancer cells this is a very interesting
concept has been

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.590

pharmaceutical industries that are
looking into this and I think there are

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.040
looking into this and I think there are
 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.890
looking into this and I think there are
one or two drugs that are actually

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:07.900
one or two drugs that are actually
 

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.870
one or two drugs that are actually
already available that builds on this

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:09.880
already available that builds on this
 

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.080
already available that builds on this
concept so this is a field that's very

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.090
concept so this is a field that's very
 

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.840
concept so this is a field that's very
active it's very active and if you think

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:15.850
active it's very active and if you think
 

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.990
active it's very active and if you think
about DNA damage I mean think about all

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000
about DNA damage I mean think about all
 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.700
about DNA damage I mean think about all
the things that we read about cigarette

the things that we read about cigarette
 

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.580
the things that we read about cigarette
smoke we read about avoiding sort of

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:23.590
smoke we read about avoiding sort of
 

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.390
smoke we read about avoiding sort of
sunlight or think about catastrophes

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400
sunlight or think about catastrophes
 

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.910
