00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.870
LAURA LING: So
Doctor Carson, this

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.215
is the historic
March on Washington,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:06.020
of which you were a part.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.480
Can we see you in here?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.890
CLAYBORNE CARSON: I was
probably right about there.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.730
LAURA LING: About 250,000
people marched on Washington

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.540
in August, 1963, including
civil rights activist Clayborne

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.340
Carson.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.750
It was one of many protests
against segregation

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.519
and other forms of legal
discrimination during that era.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.060
CLAYBORNE CARSON:
I was 19 years old.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.950
I didn't tell my
parents I was going .

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.397
For me, this was an event
that was long overdue.

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:29.980
LAURA LING: was that
sense of urgency.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.438
CLAYBORNE CARSON:
Definately, yeah.

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:34.746
And that's what King spoke
to, was the urgency of now.

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:37.770
There comes a time when
people get frustrated

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.209
at the slow pace of change.

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:42.250
LAURA LING: Today, more
than 50 years later there

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.770
seems to be a new
sense of urgency.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.230
Images and videos of Mike Brown,
Eric Garner, Sandra Bland,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.140
Freddie Gray, and
others sent shock waves

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.160
through communities
across the country

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.550
and inspired a new generation
of activists demanding justice.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.250
SAMUEL SINYANGWE: And one of
the moments that really hit home

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.982
for me was when Trayvon
Martin was killed

00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:05.440
and George Zimmerman
was acquitted.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.340
I saw myself in Trayvon Martin.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.560
I was the kid who,
every single day,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.760
would walk home, stop at
7-Eleven, buy some candy

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.765
and a sweet tea.

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.560
The reality that, at any moment,
somebody could have come up

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.674
attacked and killed me,
and the justice system

00:01:19.674 --> 00:01:20.840
wouldn't have done anything.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.540
It hit home.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.020
LAURA LING: 25-year-old
Sam Sinyangwe works

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.250
with a team called
We the Protesters

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.260
to organize activists and to use
social media to affect change.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.190
Sam, you tweeted,
Last year there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.860
were protests over 100 cities.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.570
That hasn't happened since 1965.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050
It's a new civil
rights movement, folks.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.230
What would you say is different
about today's civil rights

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.754
movement?

00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:47.420
SAMUEL SINYANGWE: One
big key difference

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.900
is the use of technology.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.490
How technology's
been an instrumental

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.970
tool in bringing folks together
and scaling the work at a pace

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.750
that really was
unheard of in the '60s.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.560
The year since Mike
Brown has been killed

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.800
has seen over three times
as many protests happening

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.530
as 1965.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.330
And so this is a
scale that really is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.805
unheard of in American history.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.770
LAURA LING: Can you talk
to me about organizing back

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.830
in the 1960s?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.412
How did people organize an
effective grassroots movement?

00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:17.995
CLAYBORNE CARSON:
Mainly face to face.

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:22.690
And the main electronics
we used were telephones.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.660
In fact, the Student Non-violent
of Coordinating Committee

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.405
developed what they
called the WATS Line.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:30.540
And all it really was
was a way of making

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780
inexpensive long-distance
telephone calls.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.680
LAURA LING: A WATS, or wide
area telephone service line,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.760
allowed civil rights workers
to report threats or violence

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.120
happening on the ground.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.810
Typed reports of
those calls would

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.460
be delivered to movement
leaders and the press.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.740
CLAYBORNE CARSON: That
was a major transformation

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.610
in the movement.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.350
Social movements always use
the technology of their day

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.920
to the maximum, because
social movements are all about

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.310
communicating to people.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.830
That's still happening today.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.090
The only thing that's different
is that it's much faster.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.010
LAURA LING: Sam is
also using public data

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.110
to track and map
instances of police

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.627
violence across the country.

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:08.210
SAMUEL SINYANGWE:
We've learned things

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.293
that communities have been
saying for a long time.

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:14.370
We've mapped 336 black people
killed by police in 2015,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.480
313 were killed
by police in 2014.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.010
Because of the Internet,
we're able to actually gather

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.114
this data in a way
that actually ended up

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.655
being much more comprehensive
than the federal government has

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:25.530
ever been able to do.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.080
LAURA LING: What do you
think Doctor King would

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.444
think about the Black Lives
Matter movement for example?

00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:37.860
CLAYBORNE CARSON:
I think he would

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.040
be very appreciative
of the fact whenever

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.450
young people are concerned about
things other than themselves.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.280
That's a positive sign.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.220
I think he would of thrived
in this kind of an age.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.140
He would have been very, very
open to using social media.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.600
He would have had millions
of followers on Twitter .

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.870
LAURA LING: Are you hopeful?

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.078
SAMUEL SINYANGWE: Absolutely.

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:02.860
We've seen over 1,000
protests take place.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.818
We seen hundreds of
thousands of people engage.

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:07.150
We've seen 24 states
signed legislation

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.680
to improve police
accountability.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.610
We've seen the President take
executive action in order

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.310
to address police brutality.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.290
All that work has happened in
space of a little over a year.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.410
This is a moment of
tremendous opportunity,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.060
but it is not something
that is preordained.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.230
It is something that
could all be taken away,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.490
and we could go backwards.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.916
And so we have to keep fighting.

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.540
LAURA LING: Has the
Internet encouraged

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.580
you to become more politically
engaged in the offline world?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.280
Tell us some in
the comments below,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.710
and check out this next video
about a superintendent who

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.410
transformed a school
district in a poor community

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.870
outside Saint Louis.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.520
SUBJECT: If all you can
do is make it to school,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.170
we'll take care of the rest.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.630
Food, clothes,
shoes, health care.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.180
LAURA LING: What
kind of changes did

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.970
you start to see
in your students

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.580
when you started to
remove those barriers?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.000
SUBJECT: So when kids
knew that we cared,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.390
there was almost like
this light bulb went off,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.172
this willingness to try.

00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:02.380
LAURA LING: Thanks for
watching, and please subscribe
