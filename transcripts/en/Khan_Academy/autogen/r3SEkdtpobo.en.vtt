00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 . 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.170
 In the last presentation, I have told you that if we have a quadratic equation 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:10.020
 In the form of ax ^ 2 + bx + c 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.770
 = 0, you can use the squared formula to find 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.800
 The solutions of this equation 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.590
 The quadratic formula was x 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.780
 The solutions are equal to + b or - 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.800
 Square root of b ^ 2 - 4ac, each 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.950
 That is divided by 2a 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.240
 We learned how to use them 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.040
 You only make up the values ​​of a place a, b place b 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.660
 And c where c, and then will give you two answers, because you have 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.830
 + Or - here 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.000
 What I want to do in this show is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.380
 Prove it to you 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.930
 To prove that using the use box, I can 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.540
 From moving from this to that 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.190
 If the first thing I want to do, even start 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.600
 Complete the box from here point, is 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.635
 - Let me write the equation here - if we have an ax 

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:08.340
 - Let me write it in a different color - I have ax ^ 2 + 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.920
 bx + c = 0 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 What I want to do first is to swear everything on a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.790
 I have 1 lab here 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.160
 So we divide everything on a, and get x ^ 2 + b 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.030
 / ax + c / a = 0 / a, ie 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 Still equal to 0 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.620
 Now we want to - well, let me move the words c / a to 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.880
 Right side, so let's ask c 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 / a from both parties 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.850
 And we get x ^ 2 + b / ax + - well, you will 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.950
 Leave a void here, because that will be gone now 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.250
 We have put it from both sides - = -c 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
 / a, I left a blank here so we can 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.740
 We complete the box 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.030
 As you see in the complete box view, you will 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.800
 You take half of the lab here 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 And you are squaring it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.990
 If the output of b / a 2 2? 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.800
 Or what is the output of 1/2 × b / a? 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.610
 Well, this is equal to b / 2a, of course will 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.110
 We square it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.520
 We take half of this and we square it 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.500
 This is what we do in the hopes square, in order 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.770
 We can turn this into a whole box of binary equation 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
 Now, of course we can add (b / 2a) ^ 2 to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.280
 Left side only 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.130
 We have to add them to both sides 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.750
 If we have (a + b / 2a) ^ 2 here as well 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 what is happening now? 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.040
 Well, that phrase is here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.250
 It equals (x + b / 2a) ^ 2 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.120
 If you do not believe me, you'll hit them 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.030
 That is (x + b / 2a) ^ 2 = (x + b / 2a x) x 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.830
 + b / 2a), x x x = x ^ 2 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.960
 x × b / 2a = positive b / 2ax 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.560
 We have b / 2a × x, and this is also equal to b / 2ax 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.580
 Then we have (b / 2a) (b / 2a), this is a positive value 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.660
 (b / 2a) ^ 2 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.180
 This and that are equal, because they are 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.910
 The two expressions in the middle, ie (b / 2a) + (b / 2a), are equivalent 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.200
 2b / 2ax, equivalent to b / ax 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.520
 If this simplifies to x ^ 2 + b / ax + b 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.960
 / 2a) ^ 2, which is exactly what we wrote 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.720
 There 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.580
 This was the purpose of adding this phrase to both 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.340
 The two parties, until it becomes a full square 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.970
 If the left side simplifies this 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 Perhaps the right side is not that simple 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.490
 Maybe we'll leave it on the way it is now 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.160
 In fact, let me simplify it a bit 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.339
 If we can rewrite the right side 

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.960
 It will equal - well, this 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.090
 It will become b ^ 2 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.220
 I'll type that phrase first, let me type it 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.340
 In green 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.250
 That phrase can be written as b ^ 2 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.210
 / 4a ^ 2 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.420
 What is that phrase? 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.270
 How will it become? 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.730
 It will become - for me we get 4a ^ 2 in 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.640
 Place, we have to hit the rugs and 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.280
 Located at 4a 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.590
 This phrase becomes 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.480
 4ac / 4a ^ 2 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.970
 You can check your own that this 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.550
 Equivalent to that 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.790
 I hit the rugs and 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.400
 Located at 4a 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400
 In fact, we delete the 4 and this is deleted 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.930
 And we have c / a 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.730
 If this and that are equal 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.460
 I've changed what I wrote first, and maybe you are, of course 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.980
 You see the beginnings of the quadratic formula here 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.700
 This I can rewrite 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.760
 This I can rewrite 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.220
 The right side here, I can rewrite it as b ^ 2 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.060
 - 4ac, all divided by 4a ^ 2 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.150
 It seems soon 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.800
 Note that b ^ 2-4ac is already visible 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.470
 We do not have to take the square root yet, but we did not take 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.720
 The square root of both ends of these 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.670
 Equation, so let's do it 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.720
 If you take the square root of both sides, the left side 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.260
 X + will become - let me down a little - 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.900
 x + b / 2a becomes positive 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.670
 Or minus the square root of this object 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.460
 The square root of this is the square root 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.360
 For the numerator / square root of the denominator 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.040
 The positive or negative quadratic root will be b ^ 2 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.690
 - 4ac / square root of 4a ^ 2 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.690
 Now, what is the square root of 4a ^ 2? 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.820
 It's 2a, is not it? 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.390
 2a ^ 2 = 4a ^ 2 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.580
 is not it? 2a ^ 2 = 4a ^ 2 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.530
 The square root of this is so 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.260
 Until we move from here to here, I take the square root 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.650
 For both ends of equation 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.860
 Now, it looks close to the quadratic formula 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.990
 We have b ^ 2 - 4ac / 2a, now 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.070
 We have to ask these b / 2a from both ends 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.740
 The equation is over 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.210
 Let's do it 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.640
 If we put b / 2a from both ends of this 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.980
 Equation, what do we get? 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.080
 We get x equal to -b / 2a + or - 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.000
 The square root of b ^ 2 - 4ac / 2a, that is 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.960
 The common denominator 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.640
 If this is equal to -b 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.500
 Let me do this with a new color 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.370
 The color orange 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.980
 -b + or - square root of b ^ 2 - 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.970
 4ac, all divided by 2a 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.370
 We're done! 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.630
 After completing the box with general parameters in front of 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.890
 a, b and c, we can derive 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.600
 Quadratic formula 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.360
 in this way 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.920
 I hope you found this fun
