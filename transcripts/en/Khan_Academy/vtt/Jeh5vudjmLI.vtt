00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.170
Plot 4 comma negative
1, and select

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.140
the quadrant in
which the point lies.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.700
So 4, the first
number in our ordered

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.130
pair, that's our x-coordinate.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.890
That says how far to move in the
horizontal or the x-direction.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.260
It's a positive 4.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.440
So I'm going to
go 4 to the right.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.030
And then the second
coordinate says,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.654
what do we do in the
vertical direction

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.110
or in the y-direction?

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.600
It's a negative 1.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480
Since it's negative,
we're going to go down.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.280
And it's a negative 1, so
we're going to go down 1.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.640
So that right over there is
the point 4 comma negative 1.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.260
So I've plotted
it, but now I have

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.860
to select which quadrant
the point lies in.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.810
And this is just a
naming convention.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.410
This is the first quadrant.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.940
This is the second quadrant.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.400
This is the third quadrant.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.330
And this is the fourth quadrant.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.560
So the point lies in the
fourth quadrant, quadrant IV.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.560
And I guess you have to
know your Roman numerals

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.280
a little bit to know that's
representing quadrant IV.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.930
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.200
Plot 8 comma negative
4, and select

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.490
the quadrant in
which the point lies.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.690
Well, my x-coordinate
is 8 so I go 8

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.690
in the positive x-direction.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.450
And then my y-coordinate is
negative 4, so I go 4 down.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.740
And this is sitting,
again, in not the first,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
not the second, not the third,
but the fourth quadrant,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.626
in quadrant IV.

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:23.750
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.470
Hopefully we get a
different quadrant.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.550
So we want to plot the
point negative 5 comma 5.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.530
So now my x-coordinate
is negative.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.650
It's negative 5.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.660
So I'm going to move to the
left in the x-direction.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.290
So I go to negative 5.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.760
And my y-coordinate
is positive so I go up

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.180
5, so negative 5 comma 5.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.170
And this is sitting not
in the first quadrant,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.380
but the second quadrant.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.380
And of course, this is
the third and the fourth.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190
So this is sitting in
the second quadrant.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.460
Check answer, and
we got it right.
