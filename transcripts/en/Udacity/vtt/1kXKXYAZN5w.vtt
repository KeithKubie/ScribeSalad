00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The moral of the story is this is tricky.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There are a lot of cases to deal with in getting this kind of search just right,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we made a couple mistakes along the way.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I sort of duplicated the history of the field.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There a couple tools we can get to avoid mistakes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One tool is to write lots of tests,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I just didn't do enough testing. I wanted to go fast.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I wanted to be able to show you some of the interesting ideas.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I put in a few tests, but I really need more to have confidence that I've got this right.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The second thing is to use, or better yet, reuse existing tools.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Every time I do a search, I don't want to be rewriting this search routine from scratch,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because it is tricky and I will make mistakes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Rather I want to write it once or have somebody else write it once

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and then reuse it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In order to do that, we're going to have to figure out how to generalize.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I've written a a function that's good only for solve the bridge problem through search.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I want to write a search function that can solve a wide variety of problems.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then I want to reuse that so that I'm not repeating mistakes,

00:01:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and I'm not introducing new errors.
