&gt;&gt; AHMED: Hi, my name is Ahmed. I’m an engineer
on the Android Framework team. I like to show

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.650
you a couple of reasons why I just love this
phone. Let’s say, you have a lot of contacts

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.320
and you need to find one in a hurry and you
have only one hand free. Instead of taking

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.779
in a long time to scroll through all of these,
you can grab the scroll thumb called the “Fast

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.220
Scroll” feature, jump down to the letter
of your choice, and then take it from there.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.950
The other feature that I really love when
I’m traveling is—-to a new place, bring

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.719
up the maps, choose “My Location” so I
know exactly where I am, and if I want to

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.679
get a bird’s-eye-view of the vicinity, I
bring up “Map Mode,” choose “Satellite

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.949
View.” I know where I am, I’m supposed
to meet someone at the volleyball court. Hey,

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.219
that looks like a sandpit, and I just walk
over to the sandpit, and I find my friend.
