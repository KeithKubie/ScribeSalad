00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.855
Lately, you've been engrossing yourself in studies

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.620
of human genetics and genealogies, and you're actually

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.600
pretty excited to start helping adopted individuals

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.048
find biological family members. An adopted individual contacts

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.786
you with their results from their 23andMe

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.486
report, showing that they actually have about 12.5%

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.224
identity by descent, IBD, with an unknown

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:25.532
person. That means they're genetically related to someone

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:28.603
at about 12.5%. So they want to know what this

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:33.378
means and how best to proceed. Now the adopted individual

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:36.744
doesn't understand this, and they've come to you because

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:40.870
they want to know what this 12.5% relatedness means. And

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.610
they also want to know how best to proceed if

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.330
they want to reach out and contact this person. So I

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.810
want you to tell me, what's the likely relationship that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.310
this adopted individual might share with this unknown person, and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.503
what advice are you going to give them to help them connect.
