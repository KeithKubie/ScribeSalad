00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:02.145
- [Voiceover] So let's introduce ourselves

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:06.277
to the Polynomial Remainder Theorem.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:07.436
And as we'll see a little,

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:09.315
you'll feel a little magical at first.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:11.415
But in future videos, we will
prove it and we will see,

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.063
well, like many things in Mathematics.

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.445
When you actually think it through,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.923
maybe it's not so much magic.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.469
So what is the Polynomial
Remainder Theorem?

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.569
Well it tells us that if we start

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:24.313
with some polynomial, f of x.

00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:27.793
So this right over here is a polynomial.

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.557
Polynomial.

00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:34.557
And we divide it

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:39.332
by x minus a.

00:00:39.332 --> 00:00:43.890
Then the remainder

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.103
from that essentially polynomial

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:49.916
long division is going to be f of a.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.040
It is going to be

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.887
f of a.

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:59.330
I know this might seem a
little bit abstract right now.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.727
I'm talking about f of
x's and x minus a's.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:05.409
Let's make it a little bit more concrete.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.409
So let's say that f of x is equal to,

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.737
I'm just gonna make up a,

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.302
let's say a second degree polynomial.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.176
This would be true for
any polynomial though.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:18.078
So three x squared minus

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.139
four x plus seven.

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:25.833
And let's say that a is,
I don't know, a is one.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:30.607
So we're gonna divide that by,

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:33.886
we're going to divide by

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:38.886
x minus one.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:44.006
So a, in this case, is equal to one.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.890
So let's just do the
polynomial long division.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.665
I encourage you to pause the video.

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:49.635
If you're unfamiliar with
polynomial long division,

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:51.815
I encourage you to watch that
before watching this video

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.327
because I will assume you know

00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:55.223
how to do a polynomial long division.

00:01:55.223 --> 00:01:57.983
So divide three x squared
minus four x plus seven.

00:01:57.983 --> 00:01:59.477
Divide it by x minus one.

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:01.036
See what you get as the remainder

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.877
and see if that remainder
really is f of one.

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:06.422
So assuming you had a go at it.

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:07.978
So let's work through it together.

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:12.978
So let's divide x minus one

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.379
into three x squared

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:22.364
minus four x plus seven.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.907
All right, little bit of
polynomial long division is

00:02:24.907 --> 00:02:26.745
never a bad way to start your morning.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:27.456
It's morning for me.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:29.172
I don't know what it is for you.

00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:33.238
All right, so I look at the x term here,

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:34.728
the highest degree term.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.585
And then I'll start with the
highest degree term here.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.453
So how many times does x
going to three x squared?

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:40.951
What was three x times?

00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.573
Three x times x is three x squared.

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:46.387
So I'll write three x over here.

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:47.920
I'll write it in the, I could say

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.700
the first degree place.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.750
Three x times x is three x squared.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.822
Three x times negative
one is negative three x.

00:02:57.822 --> 00:03:01.486
And now we want to subtract this thing.

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:04.454
It's just the way that you
do traditional long division.

00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:06.505
And so, what do we get?

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:09.488
Well, three x squared
minus three x squared.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.552
That's just going to be a zero.

00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:14.237
So this just add up to zero.

00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:16.584
And this negative four x,

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:18.332
this is going to be plus three x, right?

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:19.720
And negative of a negative.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.012
Negative four x plus three x

00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:25.367
is going to be negative x.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.504
I'm gonna do this in a new color.

00:03:27.504 --> 00:03:31.513
So it's going to be negative x.

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:35.705
And then we can bring down seven.

00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:38.346
Complete analogy to how you
first learned long division

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:40.713
in maybe, I don't know,
third or fourth grade.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:42.565
So all I did is I multiplied
three x times this.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.813
You get three x squared minus three x

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:46.801
and then I subtract to
that from three x squared

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:49.255
minus four x to get this right over here

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:52.518
or you could say I subtract
it from this whole polynomial

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:55.856
and then I got negative x plus seven.

00:03:55.856 --> 00:03:58.149
So now, how many times does x

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.598
minus one go to negative x plus seven?

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:02.098
Well x goes into negative x,

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:06.488
negative one times x

00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:08.816
is negative x.

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.662
Negative one times negative
one is positive one.

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:15.131
But then we're gonna
wanna subtract this thing.

00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:16.357
We're gonna wanna subtract this thing

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:18.660
and this is going to
give us our remainder.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.616
So negative x minus negative x.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:24.713
Just the same thing as negative x plus x.

00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:26.847
These are just going to add up to zero.

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:27.939
And then you have seven.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.104
This is going to be seven plus one.

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:30.188
Remember you have this negative out

00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:31.329
so if you distribute the negative,

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:33.144
this is going to be a negative one.

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:35.880
Seven minus one is six.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.709
So your remainder here is six.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:40.982
One way to think about it,

00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:45.442
you could say that, well (mumbles).

00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:46.797
I'll save that for a future video.

00:04:46.797 --> 00:04:50.612
This right over here is the remainder.

00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:52.128
And you know when you
got to the remainder,

00:04:52.128 --> 00:04:54.609
this is just all review of
polynomial long division,

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:57.128
is when you get something
that has a lower degree.

00:04:57.128 --> 00:04:58.676
This is, I guess you could call this

00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:01.058
a zero degree polynomial.

00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:04.225
This has a lower degree
than what you are actually

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:09.225
dividing into or than the x
minus one than your divisor.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.852
So this a lower degree
so this is the remainder.

00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:16.014
You can't take this
into this anymore times.

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:20.471
Now, by the Polynomial Remainder Theorem,

00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:23.538
if it's true and I just
picked a random example here.

00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:26.108
This is by no means a proof but just kinda

00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:29.308
a way to make it tangible of Polynomial

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:32.009
(laughs) Remainder Theorem is telling us.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.566
If the Polynomial
Remainder Theorem is true,

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:38.968
it's telling us that f
of a, in this case, one,

00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:42.727
f of one should be equal to six.

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:44.600
It should be equal to this remainder.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.555
Now let's verify that.

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:48.838
This is going to be equal
to three times one squared,

00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:51.860
which is going to be three,
minus four times one,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.717
so that's just going to
be minus four, plus seven.

00:05:55.717 --> 00:06:00.017
Three minus four is negative
one plus seven is indeed,

00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:01.635
we deserve a minor drumroll,

00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:04.606
is indeed equal to six.

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:07.604
So this is just kinda, at
least for this particular case,

00:06:07.604 --> 00:06:09.082
looks like okay, it
seems like the Polynomial

00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:10.415
Remainder Theorem worked.

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:12.365
But the utility of it is if someone said,

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:15.111
"Hey, what's the remainder
if I were to divide

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.986
"three x squared minus four x plus seven

00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:19.714
"by x minus one if all I
care about is the remainder?"

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:21.865
They don't care about the actual quotient.

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.903
All they care about is
the remainder, you could,

00:06:23.903 --> 00:06:27.299
"Hey, look, I can just take
that, in this case, a is one.

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:28.361
"I can throw that in.

00:06:28.361 --> 00:06:30.764
"I can evaluate f of one
and I'm gonna get six.

00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:32.068
"I don't have to do all of this business.

00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:34.104
"All I had, would have to do is this

00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:37.130
"to figure out the remainder
of three x squared."

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.820
Well you take three x
squared minus four plus seven

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.854
and divide by x minus one.
