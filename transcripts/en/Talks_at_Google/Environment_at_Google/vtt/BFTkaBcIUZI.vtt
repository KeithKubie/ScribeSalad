00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.150
SHERICE TORRES: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.820
Thank you so much for joining
us for today's talk at Google.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.650
I'm Sherice Torres.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.780
I'm a marketing
director working on

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.000
our corporate social
responsibility programs,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.420
including environment.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.170
So this is an issue that's
very near and dear to my heart.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.540
And I'm happy to be
here to introduce you

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.310
to Katharine Wilkinson.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.700
Katharine is the author
of "Project Drawdown",

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.890
and I have a feeling
most of you in the room

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.974
and on the live stream are
familiar with the book.

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:32.473
But for those of
you who aren't, let

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:34.230
me give you a little
bit of a synopsis,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.870
and then Katharine will walk
you through more details.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.290
So the drawdown is the
most comprehensive plan

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.560
ever proposed to
reverse global warming.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.630
It was released on April 18.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.140
It is the number one new
release in climatology on Amazon

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.960
and a Top 10 New York
Times Nonfiction list.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.190
And it's the most tactical plan
yet describing 100 real life

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.430
ways to address and
reverse climate change.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.396
But enough from me.

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.770
You didn't come
to hear me speak.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.311
I'm going to pass
it on to Katharine,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.440
and then we will go to
question and answer.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.523
Katharine, it's all yours.

00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:07.939
KATHARINE WILKINSON:
Thanks, yeah.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.610
Hi, all, in the room
and in the ether.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.840
Thank you so much, Sherice.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.180
I am excited to be
with you all today

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.060
to share a little bit
about our work at project.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.360
Drawdown.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.680
Obviously the 100 most
significant solutions

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.610
to climate change, we
won't cover all of them.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.810
But we'll go through
some good content

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.050
and then dive into questions.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.290
So there's a basic story
that we have been telling one

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.690
another about climate change
in recent decades, which

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690
is it's bad.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.480
It's going to get really bad.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.380
We are headed towards a
potentially unlivable planet

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.430
and ill-equipped as a
species to change course.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.980
Please change your light bulbs
and recycle your Coke cans,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.020
and also cross your
fingers that we'll

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.200
have some silver bullet
technology or policy

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.980
solution that'll save the day.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.970
There are reasons
for this story,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.270
but it tends to leave us
feeling overwhelmed, paralyzed,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.660
depressed, afraid,
hopeless, guilty.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.180
None of these things
are good foundations

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.330
for action, when, of course,
action is exactly what we

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.400
need to be engaged in.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.125
And the individual actions
that are sort of sent our way

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:35.650
as suggestions, changing light
bulbs and recycling Coke cans,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.680
feel just wildly out of
step with the magnitude

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.732
of the problem.

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:42.190
So it really does sort of feel
like, well, all you can do--

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.950
if you don't happen to be
a utility company or a car

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.390
manufacturer-- is cross
your fingers and hope.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.640
There's also an
underlying narrative,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.390
I think, here
about human beings,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.740
which is that we are terrible,
horrible, no good, very

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.670
bad, greedy, lazy, incompetent,
intransigent, and all the rest.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.390
Again, maybe there are some
reasons for that story,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.794
but it isn't the whole story.

00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:09.460
On the other side of
the story is really

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.500
what we try to bring to life
in this book, "Drawdown".

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.610
Drawdown is the product of a
nonprofit living, research,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.400
and communications project
on climate solutions

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.170
called Project Drawdown,
which is actually

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.140
just based in Sausalito.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.760
If you think about
global warming

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.890
as kind of the ultimate problem
statement, for many years

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.260
our founder and
executive director

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.710
and editor of the book,
Paul Hawken, really wrestled

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.230
with a set of
persistent questions

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.620
in the face of problem, problem,
problem, problem, which was,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.290
do we actually know what
we're supposed to be doing?

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.910
Do we have a list?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.420
Do we have a sense of
apples to apples comparison

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.140
of existing solutions,
technologies, and practices

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.860
that we already know work,
that are already proven?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.920
And then how much could
they each contribute?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.890
If we scaled them
vigorously but plausibly

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.830
between now and
mid-century, let's say,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.340
how much of the needle
can they each move

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.150
when it comes to
addressing global warming?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.000
So Paul being Paul, he
sort of pitched this notion

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.220
to lots of different
organizations and folks,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.000
all of whom said, a
list would be great.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.720
We're not in the
business of doing that.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.290
And eventually Project Drawdown
was born to do the math

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.990
and answer these
questions, and then

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.660
ultimately to bring
the answers to life,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.150
not in yet another dry and
impenetrable and wonky climate

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.920
report, but in a
way that we hope

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.460
is really accessible and
instructive and maybe

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.610
even inspiring for
anyone, and not

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.240
just for folks who think
of themselves as experts

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.140
on climate.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.430
Drawdown is very much
a global collaboration.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.120
These are photos of
research fellows.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.060
We had over 60 research
fellows from six continents who

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.890
worked on the project to date
under the leadership of Chad

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.270
Frischmann, our research
director, over 130

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.830
and growing advisors who
are just incredible leading

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.160
experts in various aspects of
climate and climate action,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.490
again, with global
representation,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.130
an absolutely wonderful
board, and then a very small

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.610
but we think mighty staff.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.550
So imagine this whole community
of folks behind this work.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.200
I promise this will be
the only chart-ish slide.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.250
This is purely an
illustration, but I

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.600
want to just talk about what's
behind this name drawdown.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.430
To state the obvious,
climate change

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.250
is caused by a rising
concentration of greenhouse

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.990
gases in the atmosphere.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.670
We hit 402 parts per million
of carbon dioxide last year

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.930
and rising.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.680
Last time concentrations of
carbon dioxide were this high,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.300
human beings weren't around.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.140
So we're very much living
in terra nova already.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.370
So for us, we use
the term drawdown

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.380
to refer to the point in time at
which greenhouse gases could--

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.110
hopefully will--
peak and then begin

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.570
to decline on a
year-to-year basis.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.300
So you hear a lot
in the climate space

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.290
about slowing emissions,
or stopping emissions,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.980
or stabilizing at
a particular level.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.920
And when Paul and our team
stepped back and said,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.160
OK, if we're already
living in terra nova

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.850
at 402 parts per million,
the idea of stabilizing there

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.150
seems a bit wacky.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.650
Maybe that's where we'll end up,
but let's actually put forward

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.940
a goal that is focused on
that tipping point where

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.130
we then head back
towards conditions

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.240
that are most conducive
for life on this planet.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.750
So that's what
drawdown is about.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.470
What we found as we
got into this work

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.280
is that actually, human
beings have been hard at work

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.680
developing a plan
to achieve drawdown.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.830
We just didn't realize that
that's what we were doing.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.550
So we've been out in backyards
and schools, fields, forests,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.230
laboratories, companies,
communities, testing, learning,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.390
refining, and then trying again.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.890
And along the way, as we've been
dabbling in climate solutions,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.850
there's been an incredible
body of data and peer reviewed

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.210
research that has been
built up about these various

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.710
technologies and practices.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.930
So our job at Project Drawdown
wasn't to take a whiteboard

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.520
and invent a plan.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.840
It was about going out and
codifying the collective wisdom

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.260
that already exists in
humanity, the things

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.160
that we already know how to
do and we understand why they

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.180
work, why they don't work,
what their economics are,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.240
et cetera, et cetera, and
then to codify and synthesize

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.910
that collective wisdom, and
then make projections using

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.320
that incredible body of material
to understand how much can

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:27.170
solution x, y, or z move the
needle between now and 2050.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.370
Just the littlest bit more
of kind of context setting.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.559
Solutions are
solutions because they

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.480
do one or both of two things.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.400
So they either avoid
sending greenhouse gases up

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.049
into the atmosphere,
whether that's

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.360
through energy
efficiency, replacing

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.210
fossil fuels, or other,
more polluting technologies

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.260
with clean alternatives,
reducing consumption,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.070
protecting land and
ecosystems, and/or

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.270
they bring carbon dioxide back
home to earth through, turns

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.940
out, the ultimate carbon
capture and sequestration

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.310
technology of photosynthesis--

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.220
the world has actually already
really figured this out--

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.960
and bringing carbon back home
and storing it in plants, soil,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.560
biomass.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.470
So we often tend to get
into this trap of talking

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.660
about carbon as bad, carbon as
evil, when actually carbon is

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.010
a fundamental and vital
building block of life.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.560
It's just a problem
of what we have

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.380
done with it, which is to
say, we've taken it from here

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.320
and we've sent too
much of it up there.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.784
So the issue really is
about is about balance

00:09:32.784 --> 00:09:33.575
more than anything.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.110
And then the solutions are
organized into sectors.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.650
So energy, food, women and
girls, buildings and cities,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.370
land use, transport,
and materials.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.780
There are 80 solutions that
fall into these sectors,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.320
and you can think of
them as trains that

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.710
have already left the station.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.720
So they're technologies
and practices

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.370
that we already see working.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.860
They're already growing,
they're already scaling,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.500
not everywhere, but
they are proven,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.160
and they have potential
to grow significantly

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.600
and at a reasonable cost
over the next 30 years.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600
And then we have 20
coming attractions.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.530
So these are
technologies or practices

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.930
that are nascent,
they're evolving,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.960
maybe they're still
very much in R&amp;D.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.560
And even if they are
being used effectively,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.050
we don't have the
sufficient data from which

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.580
to make the same
kind of projections

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.870
as we did for the other 80.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.290
So there's content in the book
about these coming attractions,

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.500
but no numbers tied to them.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.800
Nonetheless, we're likely to
get some help from at least some

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.140
of these coming attractions
in the coming decades.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.400
So if anyone is sort
of a betting type,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.950
this would be a good
moment to jot down maybe

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.790
what you think the
top three sectors are.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:02.370
If you have the book in your
hand in this room, no cheating.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.240
But this is an interesting one.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.030
We certainly have lots
of surprises on this.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.960
This is what a
solution looks like.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.480
This is number 69 of
80, electric bikes.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.680
This is a bicycle mechanic in
Berlin taking out his latest

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680
e-bike model for a spin.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.400
You can see that it combines
pedals and also a motor.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.350
This portrait, I just
think, is beautiful.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.510
This is a Daasanach woman, which
is an ethnic group in Sudan

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.950
and Ethiopia.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.260
She and other women
in her village

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.700
have started kind of gathering
bottle caps, SIM cards, sort

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.450
of the detritus of 21st
century human civilization,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.840
and making these beautiful
headdresses and jewelry out

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.190
of them.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.830
This is the photograph that we
used for household recycling,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.135
which comes in at number 55.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.450
Number nine is
probably something

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.180
that folks have not heard of.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.620
I had not.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.690
It's silvopasture, which comes
from the Latin words for forest

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.860
and grazing.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.110
So conventional wisdom
sort of tells us

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.800
that trees and cows don't mix.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.060
But actually, what we see
is that the integration

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.200
of livestock and trees can
create incredibly resilient

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.400
and symbiotic systems that
benefit farmers because they

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.910
have additional products
that are coming to market

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.260
at different timelines.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.010
They're better
insulated from risk

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.540
in the face of drought or
extreme weather events.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.570
When it comes to climate,
what's really powerful

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.290
is that if you compare a
pasture with trees to a pasture

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.230
without trees, the
pasture with trees

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.840
sequesters five to
10 times more carbon

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.240
than its treeless brethren.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.960
So trees are kind of
the secret sauce here.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.590
And this turns out to have
absolutely enormous potential.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.380
I'll just talk quickly
about the numbers

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.660
that you're seeing
on these slides.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.690
So in the upper right, you've
got the reduced CO2 emissions

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.770
if this solution is scaled
vigorously but plausibly

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.060
between 2020 and 2050.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.020
If there are solutions,
which there are,

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.020
that address other
greenhouse gases--

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.380
nitrous oxide,
methane, et cetera--

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.900
then those impacts
are translated

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.070
into their equivalent
in carbon dioxide.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.190
So we're able to have an
apples to apples comparison

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.236
and ranking of all of them.

00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:46.690
A gigaton-- probably this
is very evident at Google--

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.440
a gigaton is a billion tons.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.120
A cow weighs about a ton, so
this is a pretty good visual

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.810
for talking about this.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.030
So one gigaton is
about a billion cows

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.430
worth of carbon dioxide.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.640
For reference, we emitted
about 36 gigatons in 2016,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.700
so about 36 billion cows worth.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.250
So you can silvopasture
comes in just a bit

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.920
below an annual
year's emissions.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.180
That obviously
drives the ranking,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.890
in this case number
nine out of 80.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.770
And then in the
bottom left, you've

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.640
got the incremental cost
to implement the solution.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.820
So what's the additional
cost of purchasing

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.490
an electric vehicle as opposed
to a gasoline car, for example?

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.980
And in the bottom right,
the net operational savings,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.400
or, in a handful of
cases, cost over 30 years.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.280
So again, what do
you save from driving

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.910
an electric vehicle as opposed
to driving a gasoline car?

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.910
Or in the case of silvopasture,
what's the additional revenue

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.240
that a farmer gets from running
a silvopasture operation as

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.884
opposed to a regular
pasture operation?

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.880
This is the top 20.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.050
There are, I think, some
really interesting insights

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.220
and surprises, and some
things you would expect,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.170
and some really
unsung heroes that

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.030
end up landing in this list.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.420
So I thought we might
just talk through what

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.360
some of those things
are, and then we

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.630
can kind of come back to other
things if we don't cover them.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.360
The first thing that I think
is a really powerful ah-ha

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.620
from this work is that food is
eight of the top 20 solutions,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.530
and it's actually the largest
sector overall in terms

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.800
of its potential impact.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.270
Just a bit more than 320
gigatons of reduced carbon

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.760
dioxide by mid-century.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.350
And what we include
in that sector

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.710
is what we produce,
how we produce it,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.200
and then also reducing
waste so that we don't

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.800
have to produce so very much.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.710
And that's where I think
maybe we should start.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.710
Reduced food waste, I
think, is pretty compelling,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.560
coming in at number three of 80.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.260
So about 1/3 of the food that
we produce around the world,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.350
and about 40% in the
US, is not consumed.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:27.610
And that excess food that's
then wasted generates about 8%

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.570
of annual greenhouse
gas emissions.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.320
So it's really sizable
chunk of the pie.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.280
In regions of high
income, we have a tendency

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.920
to waste by choice.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.910
So we overbuy.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.170
Portions are huge.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.780
We forget about leftovers
in the back of the fridge.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.770
Consumers and retailers
reject ugly produce.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.780
We have best by, sell
by, consume by labels

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.090
that actually, by and
large, are totally

00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:01.090
disconnected from safety, so we
throw perfectly good food away.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.400
In regions of lower
income, it tends

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.740
to be a question of
infrastructure and markets.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.310
So waste happens earlier
in the food chain,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.609
if you will, and
it has a tendency

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:18.130
to be related to storage
or labor, et cetera.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.880
What you see here in this photo
are ugly potatoes and carrots

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.260
that have been sent to the
rubbish heap in England.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.270
We invest a lot of
resources into food,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.910
whether we eat it or not.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.850
This is sort of stating the
obvious, but seeds, water,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.750
energy, land, fertilizer,
labor, capital, on and on.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.560
We harvest it, we process
it, we ship it, we store it,

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:48.190
we consume it, or we cook it,
perhaps, don't consume it.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.490
Sometimes we end up
cutting down forest

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.620
to grow more food
that we don't eat.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.220
And then oftentimes
that food ends up

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.880
in a landfill, where it is
potentially generating methane

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.780
as it decomposes.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.600
So you've got all of
these different dynamics

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.150
of greenhouse gases
getting generated

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.410
through this kind of
partial life cycle of food.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.640
And that's what makes this
such a huge opportunity.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.122
In France, pretty simple.

00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:20.080
They simply say it's
illegal for grocery stores

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.610
to throw food away.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.200
So guess what?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.150
It ends up in the hands of
folks who need it and might not

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.100
otherwise have it, or it ends
up being shoveled into livestock

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.300
operations to feed livestock.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.050
So lots of ways in to
impacting the solution.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:44.110
But I think what's really
exciting about this one coming

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.020
in at number three is that
it's something we can all

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.010
have an impact on immediately
and at no cost, which

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.500
I think is pretty exciting.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.170
And the same is true, actually,
of solution number four.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.640
This is a painting
some may recognize

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.150
of Vertumnus, who was the
Roman god of seasons and plant

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.800
growth.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.430
This solution is also completely
free and in our control,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.150
and we can adopt it the second
we walk out of the room, which

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.280
is plant-rich diet.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.600
So coming in at
about 66 gigatons,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.600
this is essentially doing the
math on Michael Pollan's advice

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.040
to eat food, not too
much, mostly plants.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.270
Raising livestock
contributes about 1/5

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.610
of our global emissions.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.180
Ruminants-- cows, sheep--

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.730
are the most prolific offenders,
because they have a rumen.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.060
And They have a second stomach
in which cellulose ferments

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.200
and it creates methane, which
mostly comes out as burps,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.380
contrary to popular opinion.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.110
If cattle were their
own nation, they

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.980
would be the third largest
emitter after China and the US.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.670
So this is no small problem.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.010
Some have probably
seen in the last week

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.610
the article that came out in
"The Atlantic" and elsewhere

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:12.070
that if Americans were simply
to swap beans for beef,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.690
we could reach up to
3/4 of our targets

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.530
under the Paris
Agreement by 2020.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.120
No technology required.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.320
This is powerful stuff.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.150
Of course, dietary
change is hard.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.720
It's cultural and it's personal.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.970
I'm from the south, and nobody
wants to give up barbecue.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.960
So we did not model here
world becoming vegan.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.290
What we modeled here was animal
protein and calorie consumption

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:49.260
coming down in
places like the US,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.420
where it's much too
high, and actually,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.850
calories and protein going
up in parts of the world

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.840
where malnutrition is an issue.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.050
So this is more
about the whole world

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.200
coming into a healthier
diet that ends up also,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.100
of course, having the benefits
of lowering chronic disease

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.470
and health care
costs, et cetera.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.600
It also includes in
this number the impact

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.760
of avoided deforestation
that would otherwise

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.645
happen to grow more corn and
soybeans to feed more cows.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.580
Energy comes in with
five of the top 20.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.560
It's the second
largest sector overall.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.870
And what I think is really
fascinating here, and worth

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.900
pausing on, is that
energy has the tendency

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.570
to just dominate our
conversations about climate

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.620
change.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.440
In large part, that's because
energy has caused so very

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.560
much of the problem,
and it may continue

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.780
to do so if we don't get a
grip on fossil fuel emissions.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.990
So changing energy
sources and energy systems

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.520
is absolutely critical.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.670
But we would be remiss to
think that if we do that,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.130
we sort of have a hall
pass into the 22nd century.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.810
Even if we got to 100% renewable
energy, it cannot, by itself,

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.590
solve global warming.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.680
So I think that's really
important context.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.140
I love this photo so much.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.740
This is an Uru family that
lives on Lake Titicaca.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.810
You can see just
a little bit here.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.360
They live on a reed island.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.810
And they've just gotten
this solar panel, which

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.340
means that they'll
have electricity

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.710
at their home for
the first time,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.650
and the girls will not
have to do their homework

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.860
by kerosene lamp anymore.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.120
So you can imagine
kerosene lamps

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.340
in a reed house on a reed
island is not a great recipe.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.940
So this is rooftop
solar, which, of course,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.840
has incredible potential
in higher income

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.320
parts of the world.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.490
But as a form of
distributed energy,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.400
it has incredible potential
for the 1.1 billion people

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.950
that don't have
access to electricity

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.220
or an electric grid.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.510
So this is sort of one of
those great examples where

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.890
there are just layers and
layers of positive co-benefits

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:13.220
in these solutions, greenhouse
gases just being one of those.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.770
This one's also, I
think, really incredible.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.530
You see the potential
savings in home energy costs

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.130
over 30 years of
almost $3.5 trillion.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:26.720
So again, another great
example of where economics

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.100
are taking off and are
really going to push forward

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.750
the scaling of these solutions.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.020
Three of the top
20 solutions fall

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.330
into what we call land use,
so non-agricultural land use.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.160
And these are solutions
that are focused

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.450
on restoring, protecting,
and harnessing

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:54.490
the power of land and ecosystems
for carbon sequestration.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.150
We're really just going through
a lot of my personal favorites

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.910
from the book.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.930
Anyone have a guess
on what this might be?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.420
This is a harvested peatland.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.500
So peatlands are
wetland ecosystems.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.680
We also call them bonds, mires.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.880
They are just 3% of
the world's land area,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.460
but they're second only to
oceans in the amount of carbon

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.570
that they store.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.240
And they hold twice as much
as all of the worlds forests.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.400
So peatlands need
some love, you know?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.620
They are essentially
made of layers and layers

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.440
and layers and layers of
decomposing plant material.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.010
So that's where you
get all of the carbon.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.320
If you left peat alone for
long enough under the right

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.694
conditions, it
would become coal.

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:47.700
When we were working on
the book, it was like,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.490
how do we give peatllands
some sparkle and some magic?

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.130
It turns out that
the Irish poet Seamus

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.240
Heaney has written a bunch of--

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.340
wrote, I guess, in the 60s--
some really fabulous poems

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.760
about bog land in Ireland.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.860
And he describes, in
one of these poems,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.152
"the ground itself is kind black
butter", which sort of then,

00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:12.860
all of a sudden, tells
you everything you

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.260
need to know about peatlands.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.360
That kind black
butter makes them

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.600
under threat from farming
and forestry and fire.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.350
So what we've looked
at here is the impact

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.140
of expanding the acreage
of protected peatlands.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.100
Again, we're not talking about
a huge amount of land area,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.420
but it's a lot of bang for your
buck in terms of protection.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.370
And what's also on this
slide that you haven't

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.180
seen on others,
this 1,230 gigatons,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.120
that would be the
protected stock of carbon

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.800
that the world's peatlands would
then hold as of mid-century.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.040
So another important
piece of the puzzle.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:03.410
The number one solution
is refrigeration.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:07.080
Sort of deeply unsexy,
I'm sorry to say.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:13.920
It focuses on chemical
refrigerants in our AC systems,

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.740
our refrigerators,
our cold chains.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:22.500
Folks probably remember that
in 1987, the Montreal Protocol

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.290
began to phase out of
chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.200
which were, at that time, the
dominant chemical refrigerant

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.600
that we used.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.920
Their primary replacement
chemical, HFCs, great,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.740
on the one hand because they
have almost no negative impact

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.220
on the ozone layer.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.950
But they turn out to be 1,000
or more times as powerful

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.200
as carbon dioxide in terms of
their global warming potential.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.040
So solve one problem, end
up contributing to another.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.170
Last year, the world
came to an agreement

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.100
to amend the Montreal Protocol
so the phase-out of HFCs

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.310
is going to be coming first
in higher income countries,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.280
and then in a couple
of subsequent waves.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.260
Scientists think
that that move alone

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.450
could reduce global warming
by half a degree Celsius.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.657
So this is no small thing.

00:27:13.657 --> 00:27:15.240
And what we've looked
at in this model

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.350
is the potential to manage
the HFCs that are already

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.800
in circulation and that will
come into circulation even

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.950
as the world moves towards
and through phase-out.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.890
So basically addressing
leaks and managing

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.960
what you do with these chemicals
at the point of disposal,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.500
which is when about
90% of emissions occur.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.040
So really, really powerful.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.770
Again, because of that high
global warming potential

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.390
in terms of carbon
equivalent, this

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.070
comes in very high at almost 90
gigatons of avoided emissions.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.910
This is a section that has
surprised a lot of folks, women

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.060
and girls.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.960
Solutions number six and seven,
educating girls and family

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.890
planning.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.140
These are essentially
solutions that

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.860
focus on advancing women's
rights and opportunity

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.770
and well-being, and then
the positive ripple effects

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:13.540
that come out of that in terms
of the planet, of emissions,

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.560
but also lots of other
positive societal effects.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.230
So what we've looked
at here is the impact

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.220
of closing the gaps that
exist in the world on access

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.680
to education and access to
voluntary family planning.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.220
So this is really a solution
that begins and ends

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.160
with rights, and then
the emissions impacts

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.210
are side effects.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.690
This is just another, I
think, really beautiful photo.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.100
This is a young girl who
is in school in Kenya.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.240
But 130 million girls around the
world are not in school today,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.350
and that's especially a problem
in secondary classrooms.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.840
Of course, education
is an intrinsic right,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.700
and it feels very
obvious to say,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.710
but it lays an absolutely
vital foundation for our lives.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.290
So what we see with
more education is

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.080
that women have higher
wages and better

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.040
upward mobility, maternal
and infant mortality go down,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.480
rates of HIV, AIDS,
and malaria go down.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.900
Farms are more productive.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.970
They're less likely to
be forced into marriage.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.430
On and on and on and on and on.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:26.430
It also turns out that women
who have more years of education

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.800
choose to have fewer
children, more actively

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.680
engage in the use
of contraception,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.360
and their children
are healthier.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.840
So if you look at a woman
who has no years of schooling

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.280
compared to 12
years of schooling,

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.270
the difference is four to
five children per woman.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.670
I think it's really,
really important

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.261
to be clear that in the
poorest countries in the world,

00:29:48.261 --> 00:29:50.760
and in parts of the world where
girls are having the hardest

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.950
time getting
educated, per capita

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.770
greenhouse gas emissions
are very, very low.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.730
They are a fraction of
what they are in the US

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.860
and in parts of the world
that have done the most

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.720
to cause the problem
of global warming

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.280
and have the most work
to do to address it.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.620
So these absolutely have to
be seen in the context of all

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.810
of these other solutions.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.750
But still, when you're talking
about changes in fertility

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.880
rates, you're talking
about a difference

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.710
in the number of feet making
their carbon footprints

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.930
as of mid-century.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.014
And when you add that up, the
cumulative effect is powerful.

00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:28.930
So what we've looked at
here is the difference

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.500
between hitting the
UN's high population

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.190
projection as opposed to its
medium population projection.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.300
And that difference is
essentially all comes down

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.110
to family planning.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.500
Education and then
contraception or are

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:50.680
two components that really
add up to drive that impact.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.870
It also turns out
that education is

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.570
really powerful for shoring up
resilience to climate impacts.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.810
So this is another
one of the solutions

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.850
that has kind of many, many,
many layers of benefits.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:07.420
So for example, education
is the number one factor

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.000
for girls and women
surviving natural disasters.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.480
So more education,
you're less likely to be

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.430
injured or displaced or
killed when a storm hits.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.270
And that's obviously just
one of the many impacts

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.380
that's headed our way
with climate change,

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.300
even as we work to address it.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.990
So if you add up educating
girls and family planning,

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.390
it turns out that actually
empowering women and girls

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.430
is the number one solution
to global warming.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.310
Despite this being
the era of Buzzfeed,

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.230
it is not actually
about the number one

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.560
or the top five or the top 10.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.020
We need all of these
solutions, and we

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.640
have all of these solutions.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.200
So I just want to zip
through a few more photos

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.530
because they're just wonderful.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.160
We can grow the acreage
of protected forests

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.350
like the Great Bear Rainforest
in British Columbia,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.760
which is just an incredible
success story on this front.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.300
This is a lovely, hungry
Kermode bear eating salmon

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.620
in the Great Bear Rainforest.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.470
We can build more offshore
and onshore wind farms.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.530
This is the
Sheringham Shoal Wind

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.390
Farm, which is 88 turbines off
the coast of Norfolk, England.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.720
This is not photo-shopped.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.125
This is actually an
athlete in training.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.550
We can install more green
roofs and cool roofs.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.780
This one, I think, is
particularly lovely

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.900
overlooking Basel, Switzerland.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.610
This is the roof of
the hospital there.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:53.120
We can spread a set of
actually very simple practices

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.990
for growing rice in a way
that increases yields but also

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.710
reduces methane production
through the growing

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.180
cycle of rice.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.650
And then, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.990
we will have some help
from coming attractions.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.040
So this is one that we are
already getting help from.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.190
I think we'll see the
first high rise wood

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.200
building in Portland, Oregon.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.740
It's been permitted and I
think construction has started.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.530
I'm just think this
one is so fascinating.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:30.070
So there are now these high
performance wood products

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.690
that are as strong, and
even more fire resistant,

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:39.209
than steel and concrete, which
I found just wild and shocking.

00:33:39.209 --> 00:33:40.000
Go read about this.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.080
It really is quite amazing.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.500
And they have the double
benefit of sequestering carbon

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.390
in that wood.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.760
Dry wood is about 50% carbon.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.040
So if you've got
wood that's locked

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.710
into the structure
of a building that's

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.960
going to stand for a
long time, that carbon

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.760
is being held there.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.250
And also you're able
to avoid the emissions

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.580
of steel and concrete,
which are incredibly high.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.487
Combined, they're at least
10% of our annual emissions.

00:34:09.487 --> 00:34:10.570
So really, really amazing.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.139
This is just another--

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.540
now I'm just showing you
guys a couple cool ones

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.699
because I think they're fun.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.909
We might be able to use
marine permaculture arrays.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:26.719
So imagine sort of giant
lattice-like structures

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.110
from which we can grow
floating kelp forests that

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.380
have the benefit of
sequestering carbon really

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.909
quickly, but also creating
habitat for fish and sea life

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.100
in parts of the oceans
where basically they're

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.280
now sort of dead
zones, potentially

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.260
producing food and fuel.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.389
There's a lot of exciting
opportunity here.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.489
Maybe we will end up
pursuing the proposal

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.159
of a pair of father
son scientists

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:59.900
in Siberia who are
testing and advocating

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.610
for repopulating the
Arctic with herbivores,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.660
perhaps even
recreated mammoths--

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.710
there are folks also
working on this--

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.140
that could prevent
permafrost from melting.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.890
I'll let you read
about that in the book

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.070
because it's quite fun.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.680
I think you can look
at these 100 solutions

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:26.700
and think, oh my gosh,
we have so much to do.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.260
But you can also look at them,
I think, and see, oh my gosh,

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.000
there's so much we can do.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
There are literally so many
ways into having an impact

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.310
on this issue, so
many footholds,

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:42.050
and so many realms of agency
for literally everyone, which

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.270
I think is really,
really exciting.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.250
The toolbox that we have
is already so, so, so rich.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.320
We started with
this dominant story

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.822
arc of doom and
gloom, the one that

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:59.030
tells us that human beings
are terrible, horrible, no

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.250
good, very bad.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.280
When you come through
this lens of solutions,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.830
the other side of
the story, I think,

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:13.640
becomes really clear, which
is that human beings are also

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.350
creative and compassionate and
collaborative and committed,

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.490
and every now and again,
brilliant and pretty gutsy.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.700
And I think if we want
to stay courageous

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.950
and driven in the face
of climate change, which

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:31.220
we need to do, and if we
want to invite more people

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.440
into this work,
which we need to do,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.560
then I think we need to hear
and tell and own that story.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.100
The doom and gloom at higher
and higher volume and frequency

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.720
is not exactly a
great pickup line.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.380
And this is a true story.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.190
It's a story of what we are
already doing, what we can do,

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.834
and I think, also, about
who we are as human beings.

00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:56.750
The climate movement
basically has been giving

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:02.600
and I have a nightmare speech
for the last 30 or 40 years.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.670
It's a really easy
speech to give, actually,

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.490
when you look at the science of
the problem and the timelines

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.630
that we're on.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:14.390
Screaming "I have a nightmare",
really doable and reasonable.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:18.830
But it's not working
as a strategy.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.770
We need the clear and credible
vision that's actually worth

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.330
fighting for.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.810
What are we talking about
beyond inverting catastrophe?

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.530
What's the dream?

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.170
And I'm very, very
hopeful that drawdown

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.140
begins to help
articulate that vision,

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.530
makes a contribution
towards that vision.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.750
For me personally,
it's a vision that's

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.860
grounded in honoring
the sacredness of life,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.095
human and non-human
life, on this planet.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.110
The solutions for
reducing greenhouse gases

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:58.430
are also a means of building a
more resilient, more equitable,

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.520
more prosperous,
more vibrant world.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.530
And I think when we
get locked in talking

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.670
about just emissions, we lose
this bigger picture about what

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:12.620
the world that we're trying
to create actually looks like.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.830
We already have the technical
capacity to achieve drawdown.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:18.350
I think that's a really,
really important takeaway

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.740
from this book.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.250
So the question, then,
for all of us, I think,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.194
is how do we cultivate the
human capacity to get there?

00:38:25.194 --> 00:38:26.360
How do you stay in the work?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.820
How do you keep
making change happen?

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.090
We have at least 100
ways in, as this book

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:35.340
shows, to moving the
needle on global warming.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.960
So the question that I hope
it poses for all of you

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.870
is, which one will you pick?

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.790
Who might you work with?

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.950
What talents might you deploy?

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:50.390
There is such an incredible
opportunity for impact

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.730
and a role for everyone to play.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:57.410
The work to create this
book, and the ongoing work

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:02.510
of keeping these models living
and evolving and improving,

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.310
and keeping the
communication living

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.280
and evolving and
improving, is complex.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.320
But actually, I think
the moral of the story

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.380
is really, really simple,
which is that it's not game

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.430
over for climate change and
global warming and the planet.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.805
It's actually game on.

00:39:19.805 --> 00:39:22.259
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:23.800
SHERICE TORRES:
Thank you, Katharine.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.020
So we are going to move
into a Q&amp;A session.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.732
We have a couple of
prepared questions,

00:39:28.732 --> 00:39:31.190
and then we're going to go to
the Dory and to the audience.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.960
So if you give us
one second, we're

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.630
going to mosey on over here, and
we're going to move the camera.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.630
So I'm vamping a
little bit here.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.489
Work with me.

00:39:38.489 --> 00:39:40.280
KATHARINE WILKINSON:
And if anyone actually

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:46.070
did take the bet, you can see
how you did on the ranking.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.320
SHERICE TORRES: Oh, fantastic.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.660
So I want to make sure
to save a lot of time

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.360
for Dory questions-- oh, I'm
getting a little feedback--

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.070
for Dory questions and for
questions from the audience.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.310
So I'm just going
to ask a couple

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:01.010
from our prepared
questions here.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.630
We've heard the
science, and we've

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.317
heard the background and what
drew Project Drawdown together.

00:40:06.317 --> 00:40:08.900
We'd love to hear a little bit
more about your personal story.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.050
What drew you both to
Drawdown in particular,

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.640
but to climate
change in general?

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.990
KATHARINE WILKINSON: In general.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:20.180
So when I was 16, I lived
in the woods for four months

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.580
with 25 other high schoolers.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.950
We lived in one-room cabins
in the woods and chopped wood

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:30.110
to heat those cabins and
worked in the garden.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.950
And there was a
really heavy emphasis

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:37.190
in that program, called the
Outdoor Academy in Western

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.520
North Carolina,
on sustainability,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.930
on natural history and
environmental education.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.210
It was when I also
started reading

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.720
the work of important
authors in this space.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.070
Basically, I became
indoctrinated and kind of

00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:00.380
shifted from loving the outdoors
to wanting to live and work

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.760
in a way that helped us address
these challenges that we're

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.120
facing as a global community.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.840
I went on to pursue
that in undergrad.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.790
I worked for a big
nonprofit out of undergrad

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.910
and was really struck
by the way in which

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.700
the environmental movement,
sitting mostly, as it does,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.030
in New York and San Francisco,
sort of talks right past most

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.840
of America.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.850
So I was spending a
lot of time in kind

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:35.490
of stereotypically mega-church,
NASCAR, country music land.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:43.280
And that gap between the
environmental movement

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.410
and most of America,
and people who

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:52.010
really do care about land and
place, just really hit me.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:57.200
And so I really wanted to
grapple with other ways in.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.190
And it turned out that that
year, the Evangelical Climate

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.820
Initiative launched, which
was an effort by a large group

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.390
of more moderate
evangelical leaders

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:11.090
to mobilize their
community, which,

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.260
depending on how you do
the math, is 1/4 to 1/3

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.170
of US population, to
address global warming.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.010
I went on to do a PhD at Oxford,
trying to kind of understand

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.200
and unpack that phenomenon.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.950
Where did this come
from and how were they

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:32.540
framing the issue, and to what
degree was it resonating or not

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.910
with the church going public?

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.690
And after doing that
work, I was like,

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.740
I cannot work in climate change.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.570
This is really depressing.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.380
And finishing up grad
school kind of coincided

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.910
with what looked like our best
opportunity in a generation

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.330
to get federal climate
legislation passed in the US.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.580
Passed in the House. it
didn't get through the Senate.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.270
And then there were
sort of the dissolution

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.160
of global talks in Copenhagen.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.759
And I just was like,
this feels like banging

00:43:04.759 --> 00:43:06.800
one's head against a wall
when sort of everything

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:15.020
hinges on global agreements, or
what Washington can agree on.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.840
So I sort of stepped back
from it for a few years.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.480
And then, through a consulting
project, met Paul, our founder.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:29.060
And immediately the sort
of ethos and perspective

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.230
of Drawdown spoke to me, both
from my academic background

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.780
and my analysis
of what I thought

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.850
was missing in the
climate movement

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.720
and where it needed
to be stronger.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.300
But also personally.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.100
I had been really tugged at
a sense of responsibility

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.420
and possibility to
come back into making

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.980
an impact in this space.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.540
And so kind of the
combination of those two

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.160
really just sang to me.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.770
So it's been fun to be--

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.320
instead of sitting
in an academic seat

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.030
kind of analyzing
the stories that we

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:08.810
tell about the world and
our relationship to it--

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.230
to actually be embedded in
this really amazing team

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.700
that's doing the work
to shape those stories.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.730
SHERICE TORRES: Awesome.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.100
So you talked about a
key legislative moment

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.640
that was part of your journey.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.395
And I think everyone in here
is probably thinking about--

00:44:23.395 --> 00:44:24.770
and our live
stream-- is thinking

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.710
about our current political
climate and the impact

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.700
on the environmental
movement there,

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.490
for the fact that
the word climate

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.900
change is systematically
being removed from lots

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.090
of documents and papers.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.630
Would love to hear your
thoughts about climate change

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:43.250
in this current
political environment.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.810
KATHARINE WILKINSON: Yeah.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.740
It does not feel
good to be here.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:54.690
I mean, I think everyone's
hope was that the second Bush

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.690
Administration was going
to be the worst that we

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.590
saw on this front, and that
we had hit at a turning point.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.910
Obviously that was wrong.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.320
So I want to be honest
about the bad news, which

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.290
is that given the science
and given the timelines,

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.470
we need every single part of
society pulling its weight

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.050
to address this issue.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:21.320
We're not going to get
that from Washington.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:26.180
But the good news is that
actually, essentially all

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.360
of the progress that's been
made in this country on climate

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.090
has been done in the absence
of leadership in Washington.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.610
Even when you had the Obama
Administration pushing,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.260
they were getting
thwarted and blocked,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.660
and a lot of those
initiatives have just

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.980
been caught up in court.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:44.900
So actually the leaders on this,
cities, states, businesses,

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.062
communities, have been leading,
they've been having an impact,

00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:49.520
and they're going
to keep doing it.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.300
And what we saw with the
announcement about the plan

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.060
to pull out of the
Paris agreement

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:02.360
was a doubling down both
from leaders in the US

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.050
and also the rest of the world.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:05.300
And I think that was the fear.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.660
If the US pulls out,
does everything crumble?

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.330
And basically, everyone
said, yeah, no, we're in.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.760
And we're actually add
on to onto that bet.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.640
So I think that's
the great news.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.770
I think also we see
some really hopeful news

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.630
around the economics.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:27.560
So a report just
recently came out

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.930
that solar and wind
will be the cheapest

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.440
form of electricity generation
in the world within three

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.230
years.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.070
So they're already
at parity or cheaper

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:38.600
in some parts of the world.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.630
But the cost declines that have
come around solar and turbine

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.260
technology have happened so much
faster than anyone predicted.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.210
So I think we're
starting to see some

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:55.650
of these kind of wind at our
back, I guess, of economics.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.780
And even probably a sort
of half-baked businessman

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.430
in the White House
could figure out

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:02.861
that those economics make sense.

00:47:02.861 --> 00:47:04.610
SHERICE TORRES: So you
talked a little bit

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:08.480
about how climate
change has been

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.710
positioned for individuals.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:12.410
It's about recycling
and electric cars

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.900
or using an electric bike.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.630
Talk to us about the relative
importance and different roles

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:19.780
that individuals versus
collective action

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.140
have to play in this.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.210
KATHARINE WILKINSON: Yeah.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.480
I think it's been a real miss
of the environmental movement

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:33.120
to focus so much on
individual action.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.490
Look, individual action matters.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.540
I think it matters
more as a way to enact

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.990
your values as it does impact.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.060
So I've been vegetarian
since I was 16.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.670
But for me, that's
partially a mechanism

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:50.570
for reflecting on what
it is that I care about

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:56.130
and reflecting on my ethic
at least three meals a day.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.910
So I think these things matter,
but collective action is really

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.130
where the rubber hits the road.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.900
And that can be
collective action

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.750
in the form of movements.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.970
You see really
incredible work being

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:11.810
done by Bill McKibben and
350.org, which is focused more

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.750
on how do we keep fossil
fuels in the ground, which

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.240
is really important work.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.110
Citizens Climate Lobby has
built up a really incredible

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.260
grassroots effort
to try and cultivate

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.770
that political will in
every congressional district

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.520
in the country.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.070
So you know, if that's a
place that you feel called

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.420
to take action, I think
that's a really great way in,

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:42.260
but also through business, and
also through neighborhoods.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.620
But we're probably never
going to see more than 5%

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:50.930
or 10% of people really care and
really take voluntary action.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.260
So the question is, how
do you shift structures,

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:59.330
and how do you shift bigger
institutions and organizations

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.039
to make change?

00:49:00.039 --> 00:49:01.580
And what we see from
social movements

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.130
is it doesn't take that
many people to pull together

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.831
into a collective voice to
be able to move the needle.

00:49:07.831 --> 00:49:08.830
SHERICE TORRES: Awesome.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:12.020
So let's jump in to some
questions from the Dory.

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.110
So first question we
have is, corporations

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.650
have a big responsibility
for climate impact.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.300
Are there good examples
of corporations

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.790
that have taken steps
to align profitability

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.010
with protecting the planet
from climate change,

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.280
and what can consumers
and Google do

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.982
to apply additional influence
and pressure on that front?

00:49:31.982 --> 00:49:33.440
KATHARINE WILKINSON:
So I'm sort of

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.700
geeked out that this
would be an example I

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.800
wanted to talk to you about.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.500
And you have their
carpet in this room.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.240
This is a company
called Interface.

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:51.450
They're a public company,
but they're smallish.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:53.820
They're headquartered
in Georgia,

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.910
and they have been an
absolute vanguard and pioneer

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.910
in sustainability on business.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:04.590
Their late founder
and CEO actually read

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.070
one of Paul's earlier books,
"The Ecology of Commerce",

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.626
in the mid-90s and had
this sort of revelation of,

00:50:11.626 --> 00:50:13.500
we have been raping and
pillaging the planet,

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.240
and someday titans of industry
who have acted like me

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.980
are going to go to jail.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.112
And he set Interface
on a course-- they

00:50:22.112 --> 00:50:23.320
no idea how they would do it.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.610
It's a petrochemical-based
carpet manufacturing company--

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:31.372
to get to zero environmental
footprint by 2020.

00:50:31.372 --> 00:50:32.580
It's been an amazing journey.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.120
And now you see companies
like Unilever saying,

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.940
we're able to do what we're
doing because Interface

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:43.350
opened up the space to do this
and showed the example that you

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:46.800
can improve financial
performance at the same time

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.960
as you're dramatically shifting
your environmental performance.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.660
So 2020 aspiration of
zero, mission zero,

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.310
has been their focus.

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.270
And they now have
asked what does

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.270
it look like to go beyond
zero to actually net

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:06.810
good, net planetary
good as a company?

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.030
So they have
launched what they're

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:14.530
calling Climate Takeback as
their next corporate mission,

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.880
which is how do
we actually engage

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.570
in this process of
pulling carbon back down

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:22.620
out of the atmosphere?

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.840
How do we do drawdown
as a company, where

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.900
we're pulling more
greenhouse gases down

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.450
than we're sending up?

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.160
Again, it's a big
and bold mission,

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.880
and they don't know how
they will get there.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.730
Sequestering carbon in their
products is probably something.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.670
They're already working
with Janine Benyus

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.880
and brilliant biomimicry
team around how do you

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.730
design a factory like a forest
so that it actually exhales

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.220
net good into the world?

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.490
I think these are the kinds
of really big questions

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:54.690
we should ask.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.910
Lots of companies now
are doing good stuff

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.400
on efficient operations.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.180
But how do you really take
that next big, bold, pioneering

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.470
step, I think, is the question.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.220
So our next question
from the Dory--

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.340
and I'll go to the
audience in one minute--

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.170
talks about how you
gave lots of examples

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:16.200
of how to reduce the
acceleration of temperature

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.530
change around the world.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:20.430
The question is, are
there folks out there--

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.700
researchers,
nonprofits, grassroots

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.010
groups-- that are forming
strategies around this,

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.690
and how can Googlers contribute?

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.360
And I will interrupt
once so I can say,

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.730
one way Googlers can
contribute exactly

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.890
by donating to Project Drawdown.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:38.442
So if you're on the live
stream, you can actually go

00:52:38.442 --> 00:52:44.089
to go/drawdown-donate
to make a donation.

00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:45.630
And if you're in
the room here today,

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.700
when you go in the back of
the room to pick up your book,

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.199
we have a badge
reader where you can

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:52.280
make a donation right
from a payroll deduction,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.190
so it's super easy.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.190
And Project Drawdown is
the group behind this book,

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.080
so that's one way.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.220
Are there some other folks
you can point to around,

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.690
you know, they're doing
really great work here

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.840
and we should look into
doing more work with them?

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.570
KATHARINE WILKINSON: Yeah.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:04.680
So thank you for that.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.380
We are a very
small organization,

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:12.360
so donations really do
have a big impact for us.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.970
There are so many
organizations doing good work.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.670
I mean, that is the
really exciting thing.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.850
And obviously, we could
only include a smattering

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.400
of examples in this book.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.560
What I hope that people
will do is use the book as,

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.600
like, a choose
your own adventure.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.360
So clearly all of
these things have

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.670
impact, all of these
solutions have impact.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.140
The need is really clear.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.900
So then the question
is, what is it that

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.080
stokes a fire in your belly?

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.390
What's a way that you
want to contribute?

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.500
Is it with time,
talent, resources?

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.900
And kind of think about
that intersection.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.280
The theologian
Frederick Buechner

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.930
called it "where
your deep gladness

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.310
meets the world's deep need".

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.390
Or if you don't know, flip
through the pages and pick one.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:05.910
I mean, there are organizations
working on all these.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.380
That's why they're all
growing and scaling already.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.430
And so I think if
you focus on an area,

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.814
then it becomes OK,
well, yeah, I actually

00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:16.230
really care about
family planning.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.729
What are the organizations that
are doing good work on this?

00:54:18.729 --> 00:54:24.080
Or are there startups advancing
cool things in this area?

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:29.030
Is Community x doing
something really powerful

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.696
that we could replicate here?

00:54:30.696 --> 00:54:32.570
Those are the kinds of
questions I would ask.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.200
I hate to be too
prescriptive, but also

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.280
keep an eye on our website
because, as you can imagine,

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.900
since the book
came out, we've had

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.560
lots of folks flooding in
with desires for partnerships

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.720
and collaboration.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.330
I think actually there are some
conversations going on with x.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.940
And so we're sort
of putting together

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.450
what that architecture
of collective impact

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:59.810
and different working groups
across different areas

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:00.450
may look like.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.170
So tons of ways to plug in.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.281
SHERICE TORRES: Any
questions in the room today?

00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:05.780
Yeah.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.230
Say your question
and I can repeat it.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.820
Oh, we have a microphone.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.320
Even better.

00:55:10.867 --> 00:55:12.950
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you for coming here.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:15.330
This was very inspiring.

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.180
So one of the texts
about global warming

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.920
that I've read that
really concerns

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.324
me is Bill McKibben's "Three
Numbers for Global Warming".

00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:23.990
I don't know if you're
familiar with it,

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.027
but for people who
aren't, basically he

00:55:26.027 --> 00:55:27.110
talks about three numbers.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:30.140
The first one is two degrees
Celsius is the consensus

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.720
that scientists have agreed
that the temperature can rise

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.180
without horrific consequences.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.810
Then 500 and something
gigatons of carbon dioxide

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:42.260
is how much carbon dioxide
that equivalents to.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.220
And then the last number, which
is when I got really terrified,

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:52.700
is that, I think, 2,500, so
five times larger than the 500

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.710
that we can emit
for two Celsius.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:58.070
So 2,500 is how much is
already planned in the economy

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.860
to be emitted in I don't
know how many next years.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.900
So it's already in
companies' shares.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.770
It's already people
are going out and--

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.200
it's oil that's already being
pulled out from the ground.

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.020
So I guess coming
down to the question

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.570
is, what are your
thoughts on that?

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.380
And do you think we may
have reached a point where,

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.870
even if we start doing
a bunch of actions,

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.010
it might be too late?

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.940
KATHARINE WILKINSON: So I
don't have a crystal ball.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.120
So I don't know how
this is going to go.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.920
The way I think
about it is, we don't

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.740
have any option other
than to go really

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.240
hard at solving the problem.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.000
If you say, well,
game over, then what?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.800
You're going to just
give up on humanity?

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.660
What do you do with that?

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.710
And what I appreciate
from Bill McKibben

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:54.950
and his work is, what
this has done for Bill is,

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.220
he is on the front
lines of trying to keep

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.520
fossil fuels in the ground.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.740
For me if I only think
about those numbers of,

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.480
here's how much more we
can emit before we really

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.500
turn this planet
into a disaster zone,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.600
and here's how much we're
planning on emitting,

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.400
and even worse than
that, here's how much

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.760
we could emit if we really went
for all of these fossil fuel

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.900
resources--

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.920
that's terrifying.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:27.920
And for me, that place of
terror leaves me feeling

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.590
really frozen and paralyzed.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.560
And I think it's an
important part of the story

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.290
to understand.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.610
And if you only
read that chapter,

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.850
I think you miss
the bigger picture.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.359
Bill wrote a really great
article in "Rolling Stone"

00:57:46.359 --> 00:57:48.650
a few years ago called "Global
Warming's Terrifying New

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:54.830
Math", which is just
totally terrifying.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:58:00.620
And I think we need to
be honest with ourselves

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.310
about the potential
of what's ahead.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:11.030
But I think we have to be
really thoughtful about the rest

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.280
of the conversation that
we're building in with that.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.950
So there was also a very
doom-and-gloomy piece

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:19.430
just recently in
"New York" magazine,

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:22.010
which my feeling is, if you're
going to do doom and gloom,

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.850
do it like that.

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:26.480
Just rip the bandage off
and just tell people.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.420
It's like, this is
how bad it could be.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.720
But what I didn't
like about that piece

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.332
was at the end of
it, he says, yeah,

00:58:35.332 --> 00:58:37.040
but all these scientists
still have hope.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.340
And they have hope because
maybe there'll be a carbon tax

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.430
and maybe we'll have some
geoengineering solutions.

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:49.977
And to me, I don't have faith
in either of those, necessarily.

00:58:49.977 --> 00:58:51.560
I do have a lot of
faith in the things

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.393
we're already doing
that are already working

00:58:53.393 --> 00:58:56.210
and our ability to
scale those things.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:58.670
Maybe we'll get some
extra help, but I

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.800
don't think that's where
we should hang our hat.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.614
So these are my thoughts.

00:59:05.614 --> 00:59:07.530
We were talking about
this at lunch, actually.

00:59:07.530 --> 00:59:09.980
There's an amazing
Quaker thought

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.780
leader named Parker
Palmer who talks

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:15.650
about the tragic gap
and the work of staying

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.710
in the tragic gap, which is
the space between the world

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:22.920
as it is and the world as
it could be or should be.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.990
And it's really easy to flip out
into cynicism on the one side,

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.900
or it's really easy
to flip out into kind

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:35.250
of starry-eyed optimism,
like, gee whiz, you know,

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:37.680
everything's always
getting better,

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.400
and that there's work
to stay in the work.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.570
And I think that it's
different for different people.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.560
But if I only thought
about those numbers,

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.550
I would only stay in
tragedy and cynicism,

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.079
and I don't think I'd be
able to keep doing the work.

00:59:53.079 --> 00:59:55.620
SHERICE TORRES: And I think on
that point, we're at 2 o'clock

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.870
and it's a great place to end.

00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:01.020
So let's keep on in
that gap doing the work,

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.550
because through our actions--

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.540
and collective actions,
more importantly,

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.419
we can make a change.

01:00:05.419 --> 01:00:07.210
So Katharine, thank
you so much for coming.

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:10.260
Thank you all for
attending and dialing in.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.110
[APPLAUSE]
