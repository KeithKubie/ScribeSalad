SAM RAMJIL: One of the
most important things

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.650
in how we build developer
products is developers.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.810
Communities are
places where people

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.880
find meaning, where
they find support,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.322
where they find the real value
in using any kind of tools.

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.530
UTTAM KUMAR TRIPATHI: Our
development group community

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.238
program is a global
program through which

00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:24.020
like-minded communities can
come in and partner with Google.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.110
YUKI ANZAI: We decided
to start our community

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.615
to help women who are interested
in technology know each other.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.700
BRITT BARAK: Many people
are doing amazing things.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.990
And also have challenges.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.130
So having together more
people with the same agenda,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.160
it really helps feel
more confident about what

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.030
you're doing.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.330
When you figure out that
you're not alone in it,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.880
it gives you some
more drive to do it.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.410
NICK PARFENE: Every single time
I attend an event that we've

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.580
put together, I learn.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.580
I thrive from seeing
people come together, solve

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.060
their own problems.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
SERENA FERNANDES: You see
people that don't even

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.930
know each other,
they get together,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840
and they have, like,
the same passion,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.010
and they start a
friendship or new projects.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700
YONATAN LEVIN: Also, we tried
to combine different communities

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.830
together, like designers
and developers.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.100
Before that, no
one tried to teach

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.627
them to speak same language.

00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:20.210
DANIEL FRANC: We
partner with hundreds

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.730
of communities and organizers
all around the world.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.430
We look for simple ways
to enhance their meetups

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.405
or maybe make their
community more successful.

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:28.780
UTTAM KUMAR
TRIPATHI: The program

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.735
is currently active worldwide.

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:33.110
We have over 300 communities
who are part of the program.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.300
If you want to come in and
be part of the program,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.380
please show interest, and
we'll get you started.
