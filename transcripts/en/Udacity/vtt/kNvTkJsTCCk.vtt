00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the work that it's doing is it's going to do a series of swaps

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
possibly making it all the way to the bottom of the tree but never further than that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the comparison, it does a constant number of comparisons at each level.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It does a constant amount of work to do the swap

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it doesn't have to touch anything else on the tree other than the longest path

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the length of this path is the depth of the tree which is the log n.
