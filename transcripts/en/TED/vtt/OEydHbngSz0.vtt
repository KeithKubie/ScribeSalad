00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.706
One winter morning, a couple of years ago,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.705
I was driving to work
in Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:22.030
and noticed a haze hanging over the city.

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:24.990
I make that drive on most days,

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.887
so it was unusual
that I hadn't noticed this before.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.648
Johannesburg is known
for its distinctive skyline,

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:33.489
which I could barely see that morning.

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:38.843
It didn't take long for me to realize
that I was looking at an enormous cloud

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.065
of air pollution.

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:44.565
The contrast between
the scenic environment I knew

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.874
and this smog-covered skyline

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:48.501
stirred up something within me.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:54.568
I was appalled by the possibility
of this city of bright and vivid sunsets

00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:56.726
being overrun by a dull haze.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:01:01.262
At that moment, I felt an urge
to do something about it,

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:02.942
but I didn't know what.

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:06.983
All I knew was
I couldn't just stand idly by.

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:09.661
The main challenge was,

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.922
I didn't know much
about environmental science

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:15.471
air-quality management

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:16.918
or atmospheric chemistry.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:19.716
I am a computer engineer,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
and I was pretty sure I couldn't code
my way out of this air pollution problem.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.844
(Laughter)

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.400
Who was I to do anything about this issue?

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.432
I was but a citizen.

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:35.667
In the following years,
I learned a very important lesson,

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.849
a lesson we all need to take to heart
if we are to work towards a better future.

00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:44.412
Even if you're not an expert
in a particular domain,

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:47.199
your outside expertise may hold the key

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:49.818
to solving big problems
within that domain.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.073
Sometimes the unique perspective you have

00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:57.558
can result in unconventional thinking
that can move the needle,

00:01:57.582 --> 00:02:00.982
but you need to be bold enough to try.

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:03.934
That's the only way you'll ever know.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.435
What I knew back then

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.411
was that if I was even going
to try to make a difference,

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:13.459
I had to get smart
about air pollution first,

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:16.578
and so I became a student again.

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:19.628
I did a bit of basic research

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:21.652
and soon learned that air pollution

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.810
is the world's biggest
environmental health risk.

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:28.190
Data from the World Health Organization

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:33.356
shows that almost 14 percent
of all deaths worldwide in 2012

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.064
were attributable to household
and ambient air pollution,

00:02:37.088 --> 00:02:40.547
with most occurring
in low- and middle-income countries.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:45.180
Ambient air pollution alone
causes more deaths each year

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:47.520
than malaria and HIV/AIDS.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:52.188
In Africa, premature deaths
from unsafe sanitation

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:53.951
or childhood malnutrition

00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:57.515
pale in comparison
to deaths due to air pollution,

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.245
and it comes at a huge economic cost:

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.402
over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013,

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:09.418
according to a study by the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development.

00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:12.974
Now, in my work,

00:03:12.998 --> 00:03:17.184
I explore new frontiers
for artificial intelligence,

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:20.645
where the symbiotic relationship
between man and machine

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.581
can find a beneficial footing
and help us to make better decisions.

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.313
As I thought about
the air pollution problem,

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:32.283
it became clear that we needed
to find a way to make better decisions

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:34.940
about how we manage air pollution,

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.947
and given the scale of the problem,

00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.486
it was necessary to do it
in a collaborative way.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.500
So I decided I'd better get to know
some people working within the field.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.922
I started to speak to officials
from the City of Johannesburg

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:50.573
and other surrounding cities,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.556
and I engaged the local
scientific community,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.770
and I also made a few cold calls.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:59.569
The process of engagement I embarked upon

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:02.866
helped me to develop
a deeper understanding of the problem.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.856
It also helped me to avoid the trap

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.304
people in my profession sometimes
fall into when trying to innovate,

00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:11.655
where we are quick to apply a technology

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.473
before we've firmly grasped
the problem at hand.

00:04:15.534 --> 00:04:17.672
I began to develop an idea

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:20.164
about what I could do
to improve the situation.

00:04:20.742 --> 00:04:23.158
I started by simply asking myself

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:25.880
how I could bring together
in some meaningful way

00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:29.772
my skills in software engineering
and artificial intelligence

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:32.438
and the expertise of the people
I'd reached out to.

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:37.068
I wanted to create an online
air-quality management platform

00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:39.173
that would uncover trends in pollution

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:41.123
and project into the future

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.546
to determine what outcomes
can be expected.

00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:49.850
I was determined to see my idea
translate into a practical solution,

00:04:49.874 --> 00:04:52.702
but I faced uncertainty

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.627
and had no guarantee of success.

00:04:55.576 --> 00:05:00.894
What I had was a very particular set
of engineering skills,

00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:03.354
skills I'd acquired over my career

00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:04.623
(Laughter)

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:08.109
that were new to people who had
been working on the air pollution problem

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:09.651
for so many years.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:14.644
What I have come to realize is that
sometimes just one fresh perspective,

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:15.961
one new skill set,

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:19.406
can make the conditions right
for something remarkable to happen.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:23.757
Our willpower and imagination
are a guiding light,

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.518
enabling us to chart new paths
and navigate through obstacles.

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.899
Armed with a firmer understanding
of the air pollution problem,

00:05:31.923 --> 00:05:35.285
and having managed to source
over a decade's worth of data

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.761
on air pollutant levels

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:41.259
and the meteorological conditions
for in and around Johannesburg,

00:05:41.283 --> 00:05:45.395
my colleagues from South Africa
and China and myself

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.156
created an air-quality
decision support system

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.530
that lives in the cloud.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.281
This software system
analyzes historical and real-time data

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.973
to uncover the spatial-temporal
trends in pollution.

00:05:57.695 --> 00:06:00.550
We then used new
machine learning technology

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:03.213
to predict future levels of pollution

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:06.134
for several different pollutants
days in advance.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.307
This means that citizens
can make better decisions

00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:12.046
about their daily movements

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.085
and about where to settle their families.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:18.059
We can predict adverse
pollution events ahead of time,

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:19.884
identify heavy polluters,

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:22.431
and they can be ordered
by the relevant authorities

00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:24.463
to scale back their operations.

00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:27.830
Through assisted scenario planning,

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.552
city planners can also make
better decisions

00:06:30.576 --> 00:06:32.581
about how to extend infrastructure,

00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:35.392
such as human settlements
or industrial zones.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.905
We completed a pilot of our technology

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:42.257
that was run over a period of 120 days,

00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.456
covering all of South Africa.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:47.195
Our results were confirmed

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.782
when we demonstrated a tight correlation

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:52.203
between the forecasting data

00:06:52.227 --> 00:06:54.822
and the data we were getting
on the ground.

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.301
Through our leadership,

00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:01.174
we have brought cutting-edge,
world-leading assets

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:03.864
that can perform air-quality forecasting

00:07:03.888 --> 00:07:08.008
at an unprecedented
resolution and accuracy,

00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:14.881
benefiting the city that I drove into
one winter morning not very long ago,

00:07:14.905 --> 00:07:16.436
and thought to myself,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.309
"Something is wrong here.
I wonder what can be done?"

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.904
So here is the point:

00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:27.752
What if I'd not investigated
the problem of air pollution further?

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:32.874
What if I'd not shown some concern
for the state of the environment

00:07:32.898 --> 00:07:36.874
and just hoped that someone,
somewhere, was taking care of the matter?

00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:39.303
What I have learned is that,

00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:41.471
when embarking on a challenging endeavor

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:44.133
that advances a cause
that we firmly believe in,

00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:47.642
it is important to focus
on the possibility of success

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.712
and consider the consequence
of not acting.

00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:55.331
We should not get distracted
by resistance and opposition,

00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:57.752
but this should motivate us further.

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:02.912
So wherever you are in the world,

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:04.375
the next time you find

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.593
that there's some
natural curiosity you have

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.217
that is being piqued,

00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:10.296
and it's about something you care about,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.105
and you have some crazy or bold ideas,

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.793
and perhaps it's outside
the realm of your expertise,

00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:18.055
ask yourself this:

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:20.515
Why not?

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:24.866
Why not just go ahead
and tackle the problem

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.691
as best as you can, in your own way?

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.969
You may be pleasantly surprised.

00:08:31.064 --> 00:08:32.215
Thank you.

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:35.888
(Applause)
