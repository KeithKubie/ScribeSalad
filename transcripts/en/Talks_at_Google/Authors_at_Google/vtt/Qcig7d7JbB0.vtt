00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Here's the deal with Roy's hot
sauce.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.970
My dad lived to be 95 years old, passed away
two years ago, grew up in Eagle Pass Texas,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.630
spoke Spanish before English, his name was
Roy, he was 6'5"; I have no idea what happened.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.359
So they've called me Royito all my life; little
Roy.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.570
If you go to my hometown in Brownwood I'm
still Royito.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.099
He taught me three things; be kind to everybody
you meet cause everyone's fightin' some kind

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.180
of battle.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.649
Simplify your life; I screwed that up so bad,
we'll talk about that but I did and don't

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.060
do mild in anything.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.210
So the purpose on my jar is to encourage the
young and the young at heart to don't do mild

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
in life.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.940
Follow your dreams, follow your passion, follow
your purpose.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.609
And we're gonna talk a little bit about that
today because the miracle of this country

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.680
is entrepreneurship.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.700
And your founders are entrepreneurs and we
gotta make sure we rebirth that whole energy

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.860
in your part of this movement.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.400
And we need to not occupy anything; we need
to get preoccupied with getting the young

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.200
and young at heart to go start businesses
again.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.020
We'll talk a little bit more about that.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.540
I love what your founders said, by the way,
about the, I hope I don't have a Rick Perry

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.830
moment here but I have to remember 10 things
he only had to remember 3 come on.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.830
3?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.290
I wanna cut the secretary of state, cut the
secretary, whatever!

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.979
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I love him.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.610
I love you, don't ever change, don't, and
don't get elected.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: But its okay, I'm not afraid

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.680
to shit; you know what I'm saying?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.810
I'm just not.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.770
If he wants to retaliate, go, come on, they
know where I live, I know where he lives.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.400
Hi, love you.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.180
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: So when your founders talked

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.800
about the 10 things they know to be true,
that's pretty bold when you're 8 years old,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.650
to say that you know the 10 things that you
know to be true.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.400
But, I went through them all.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.440
Number one, if you serve the user everything
else will follow.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.040
Sam Walton taught me, Sam loved me cause his
dog was named old Roy.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.800
It's true.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.970
And Sam Walton used to say it this way; give
the customer what they want not what you want

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.780
them to want and they'll beat the path to
your door.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.340
At GSD&amp;M this is the way we say it; we'll
do whatever it takes to build our clients

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.129
business cause when they build their, when
we build their business they'll build ours.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.709
What you know to be the truth, and it's number
one on that list, is that you focus on the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.110
user and everything else will follow.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.940
Secondly they say it's really, really, really
better to focus on one thing and be really,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.680
really, really good at it.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.350
I don't know if you read Jim Collins's book
but he talks about the difference between

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.340
a little bit less hedgehog and a fox.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.360
A hedgehog you just stayed focused and you
go do it and us foxes, I'm not going by the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.920
way I look but as foxes we just go running
around and shit, you know, doing stuff except

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.780
Thomas actually said I was a hedgehog cause
all the running around I do doesn't seem like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.080
it makes any sense, really, but I found out
a long time ago that my purpose is to help

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.120
others fulfill theirs.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.689
So it's running Clinton for president or working
the state department or doing BMW, I run around

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.099
trying to help people fulfill their purpose.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.510
I do have ADD and I bought a t-shirt in Aspen
two weeks ago and it says "I don't have ADD,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.200
oh is that a bunny running?"

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: You know what I'm talking about?

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.579
I got it.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:19.811
So, focus on the user, do one thing really,
really, really good, I love this one, fast

00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.770
is better than slow.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.880
I think about what a truth; fast is better
than slow.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.070
At the University of Texas we used to say
winning was better than losing.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.830
I had to explain it to the Aggies but it's
a long road to go down that road to figure

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.890
that out.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.250
It is.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.200
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Fast is better than slow.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:59.690
And then I love the idea that you don't have
to be at your desk to need an answer.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.000
It's a brilliant truth.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.690
In fact, I wear a pedometer.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.110
I do at least 12,000 steps a day.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.850
It's my curiosity meter, literally.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.860
I know that you all have a lot of stuff to
do and you gotta do it but if you don't do

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.290
at least 10,000 to 12,000 steps a day you're
not out there enough.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.680
So every day, this is weird and, again, nobody
knows this but you, and won't tell anybody,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.100
you just run Google, anyway.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.990
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I send an email to myself every

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.160
morning at 4 in the morning and it says, "I
wonder what the world has in store for me

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.570
today.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.260
I think I'll go find out."

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.270
I wonder what the world has in store for me
today.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.580
I think I'll go find out.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.930
You don't have to be at your desk to need
an answer.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:01.410
I love the idea, another truth that democracy
works on the web.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.620
And working at the state department the last
couple years and seeing what's happened around

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.020
the world, democracy works on the web.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:20.840
And before Al Gore and I invented it there
was a way to keep things secret and there's

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.590
not a way anymore.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.680
And democracy, my mom taught Civics for 35
years, taught me too, from a small town, I

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.760
did really well on her tests since I graded
them when I was 7, 8, 9 and 10.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.080
And she told me two things, don't call me
mom in class and don't sell the tests to your

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.400
friends.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.670
So I did both.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.670
Anyway,
[Laughter]

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.180
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I'm an entrepreneur, you got
to-- my mother said no matter how bad it gets

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.600
in politics, politics is the business of freedom.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.430
No matter how rough it gets and how nasty
it gets, always remember politics is the business

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.690
of freedom.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.070
Another truth that your founder said was that
"There's always more information out there."And

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:14.700
George Carver Washington, who's really one
of my heroes, you probably don't know much

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:23.040
about him but he was born in 1864, son of
a slave family and invented the idea of rotating

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.560
crops which is revolutionary coming from a
small town, a farming town.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.520
You rotate the crops to keep the nutrients
in.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:40.050
He said this, he said that, "Education and
knowledge are the golden keys to freedom."

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.670
That's not bad.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.980
In fact, I don't think ya'll are in the tech
business I think you're in the freedom business,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.680
we'll talk more about that.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:08:01.820
Another truth that your founders say that
"The need for information crosses all borders"

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.350
another truth and I know that first hand when
we helped create, with Bill Clinton, the Clinton

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.130
Global Initiative.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.740
I was at the White House the last night that
Bill was president.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740
He kept saying, "Don't leave.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740
Don't leave.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.740
Come down."

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.450
It's 2 in the morning, puts his arm and says,
"What do I do next?"

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.530
I said, "Well, first of all, you can't stay
here."

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.120
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: We worked through that for about

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:32.409
3 or 4 hours and I said, "Arkansas had you
for 16 years, America had you for 8, now the

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.849
world needs you."

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:38.909
And he talks about this whole idea of information
with no borders.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:44.510
He says this, "We can't create a better future
for America unless we help others create a

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.890
better future for them."

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:54.270
At some point we're all in this together,
and he believes a lot because of what ya'll

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.880
are doing, that in the end there will be no
them it'll only be us.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.690
I wrote that line, it's a good line isn't
it?

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.650
There is no them it's only us.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.670
This is one of my favorite truths; you can
be serious and not wear a tie or a suit.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.700
What people don't know, I know why we had
the economic meltdown, it wasn't AIG, it wasn't

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.250
Fannie Mae, it wasn't Bush administration,
it was white guys in ties.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:26.030
Now here's what, it's true, Harvard did a
study, Harvard did a study, 20 year study

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.400
of people who wore ties 5 days a week and
people who didn't, guys.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.430
They found out after 20 years that ties cut
off 21 percent of the circulation of oxygen

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.660
to your brain and 28 percent to your heart.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.820
I just made that shit up.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.240
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: No, I did.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.910
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: And people, no I did, I just

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.650
made it up.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: And people, I do this and people

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.520
start un tightening their tie, but it's true.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.610
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: You can use it, just make it

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.960
up.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.060
People don't know.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.400
Well, I guess that's not in the spirit of
transparency but you can be serious and not

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.560
wear a suit.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.020
Thank you.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Next to the last one is so great

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:25.030
and it says something like, you know, "Great
isn't good enough."

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:34.940
And Emerson, my favorite poet besides Frost,
said it this way, "What lies behind you and

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:44.630
what lies in front of you is tiny compared
with what lies inside you."

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:50.900
And the idea that great isn't good enough
is at, not just your company, but if you want

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:57.070
to really put that search engine that you
have for everybody to your own self, what

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.860
lies inside of you is what really will decide
whether you're happy or not.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.960
And the final one is don't do evil.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.760
And that's really important when you have
access to so much.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.740
And that's really what I wanna talk about
today, if you don't mind, just a little bit

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:21.110
about the power of purpose and the fact that
you can make money by making a difference.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:26.910
And you can make money by doing no evil.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:33.660
And by the way, if we don't do that as a business
community, you'll see what happens to businesses.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.350
So I'm hopeful but if we all become purpose
inspired organizations full of purpose inspired

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:45.170
people, you can make a lot of money but make
a difference and you don't have to do evil.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.880
It's a fine line in your business, by the
way, cause sometimes you don't mean to do

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.650
evil and it gets done and then you just gotta
fess up when you mess up.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.140
So, here's my journey.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:06.860
Went to the University of Texas, I met my
four partners in 1970, school sucked, really,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.590
I wanted to go out there and do something
else.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.870
So, it was the age of Marshall McLuhan, you
don't know who he is but, well now you do

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.240
cause you got all those music rooms, but he
used to say, "The medium's the message."

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.550
Now how relevant is that today when you think
of Google?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.390
So we did multimedia shows and our company
was called Media 70.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.680
And I learned, we did multimedia shows and
passed out brownies, you know what I'm talking

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.680
about.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680
So, and everybody paid, everybody paid us.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.360
It was awesome.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.660
So, uh, cut that out.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.180
[Laughter]
[Pause]

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:49.410
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: And I learned my first marketing
lesson.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.620
Everything was great with Media 70 until January
1st, 1971.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.680
Don't name your company after a year, just
don't do it.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.480
Brazil 66 or whatever.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:09.680
So we graduated from college, one of my partners
sold the G in GSD&amp;M, sold ads at the Daily

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.660
Texan.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.430
So why don't we start an ad agency?

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.840
I said, "Well, great.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840
What is one?"

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.660
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Gives our clients a lot of confidence.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.900
So we decided to start an ad agency.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.210
I went down to the bank, had a brand new tie
dyed t-shirt and my pony tail was lookin'

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.210
awesome.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.040
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I went into, the loan officer's

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.060
name was John Oliver, and I said, "John, you
don't know me, I don't know you but you need

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.930
to loan me $5,000 dollars for my business."

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.660
He was one of those guys [inaudible].

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:48.010
And he said, "What's your business?" and I
said, "Making money, what's yours?"

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.560
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: And he loaned us the money and

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.070
we paid it back a couple weeks ago.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:14:02.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: But, my first lesson besides

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.890
my mom, my dad and my sister on purpose was
about 10 years ago we went to a reception

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.890
in Austin.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:14.860
A guy walks up to me and he said, "See that
older gentleman over there with a cane?

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.580
Do you know who he is?"

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.700
I went, "Yeah, he was my mentor in college.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.310
He could tell I needed one pretty bad.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.160
His name is Robert Sneed."

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.100
He said, "You remember that loan that you
got 25 years ago?"

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.880
I said, "Like it was yesterday."

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.620
And he said, "You know that he cosigned that
note and never told you cause he wanted you

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.630
to believe that you got it on your own?"

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:47.780
That first little lesson, all you young people,
somebody helps you, you gotta help somebody

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.780
else.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.030
That's the way it works.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.010
This world would be a lot better, just that
chain reaction.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.200
Everybody has to have a helping hand every
now and then.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.220
But you just store that back and when somebody
else needs it you give too and the only thing

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.830
you ask them to do is pass that on.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.470
And then I met Herb Keller, I was 28 years
old, he had 28 airplanes.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:19.680
He took a chance on us and he taught me so
much; how to drink and smoke on the job.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.029
I introduced him into the National Hall of
Fame dinner the other night in New York; he

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:32.630
was the first CEO to ever get elected into
the advertising hall of fame that had no advertising.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.279
And I told him that I didn't know he drank
until one day he came into a meeting sober.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:40.120
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: But, I'll tell you what he taught

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.720
me and it's important for Google; take the
competition seriously but not yourself.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.770
Take some yeast, lighten up.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.839
I don't think I have to tell ya'll that but
this is about having fun.

00:15:56.839 --> 00:16:00.170
Do no evil and have fun.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.820
And by the way, he was a fierce competitor.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.800
And then Sam Walton came into my life because
he was in the rural areas, loved what we were

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.600
doing for Southwest, picked up the phone,
he called me, "Roy will you come to Bentonville?"

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:22.080
I got on a plane, flew from here to Dallas,
changed planes, flew to Fort Smith, then flew

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:29.050
to Fayetteville and then rented a car, went
through hogeye and honkey town and got to

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:34.390
Bentonville and I thought I'd gone to heaven
cause my dad was a sales person.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:39.700
So I sit in a room and there were 8 people
and Sam was sitting there and he said, "So,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:46.230
lil Roy, where's the rest of your staff?"And
they were staring at me just like you are

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:53.850
right now and I said, "Well there's an old
Texas saying, one riot, one ranger.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.730
What problem you got?"

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.550
Didn't even blink, I didn't blink.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.430
"So, what's your problem?"

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.620
So they hired me before I got out the door.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.829
I tell you what, I traveled with Sam Walton
and he taught me one great lesson; curiosity

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:14.720
does not kill the cat, it kills the competition.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720
Curiosity meter.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.380
He used to make us go into Kmart and find
something better that they did than we did,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.429
it was hard.

00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:27.030
It was really hard.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.530
And he would always start his meetings, he'd
get down on one knee and he'd say, "I know

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.540
what I know, I wanna know what you know."

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.380
And then he had a little yellow tablet, he
didn't know about the computer thing, and

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.380
he'd write it down.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.770
You go to Bentonville and there's a little
museum, all of his yellow tablets, he kept

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.530
them all, 40 years.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.300
I know what I know I wanna know what you know.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.240
And then one of the great lessons I learned
at the University of Texas, I actually did

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:59.110
go to a class when I was a senior, you know,
wrote down a few things, and so I had a final

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.600
and an essay, cause, you know, multiple choices
you have to know stuff.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600
You know what I'm saying?

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.060
So I would always opt out.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.410
I'd go find a class where you could write
bullshit, basically.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:16.750
So, anyway, I went to the test, did the little
bluebook thing, wrote it down, aced it, turned

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.090
it in.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.980
Two weeks later I got it back and I got a
C on it.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.002
You would know who I'm talking about if I
gave you the name of the professor.

00:18:26.002 --> 00:18:29.040
I went to the professor and I said, "You don't
understand

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.600
[Clears throat]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: there's no way I could make

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.350
a C. I took your lecture down word for word."

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:42.740
And he said, "Well, I guess I just gave a
C lecture."

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.580
I guess I just gave a C lecture.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.900
Here's the point.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.630
Just when you think you've got it knocked
and you're at the top of the hill and you've

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.630
aced it, there's gonna be something that hits
Google, hits you in your life, so you gotta,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:02.290
as Hakeem Olajuwon used to say in Houston,
"You gotta stay humble and stay hungry."

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:08.480
Mainly stay humble because tomorrow morning
you don't know what's gonna happen.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.600
Stay humble, stay thankful, stay hungry.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.040
And then I had all these other mentors in
my life, it was just amazing, you know, from

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:22.950
Charles Schwab to the Clinton's and all this
journey but I'll tell you a quick story before

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.840
we get to the real meat of this.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.840
I've been married 34 years; I promised my
wife that if we ever had children I'd never

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.610
miss one of their birthdays.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.641
Now you would say, well of course you're not
gonna miss one of their birthdays but we have

00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:38.650
no clients in Austin.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:43.210
It's sad that the people that know us the
best don't hire us but that's another thing

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.210
I'm working through.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.309
[Clears throat]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: But PGA tour, DreamWorks, United

00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:51.710
States Air Force, so they don't call up and
say, "Hey Roy can you come see me?"

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.710
"Yes, sir General."

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.700
"By the way is tomorrow one of your kid's
birthdays?"

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.300
So I did great with my two girls and then
my son turned 15 and I get the emergency call.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:16.630
So I'm in this, in this thing and I realize,
by that way I never wear a watch, but I wasn't

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.870
gonna make it home for my son's birthday.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.890
So I asked these two guys if they would do
something for my son.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:32.300
So I'm gonna play this video, if you would
and then I'm gonna tell you why I played it.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:39.050
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I got home at 2 to midnight

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:47.270
and Jay was 15, he had a bunch of girlfriends
over and just a little bit of envy but not

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.880
much.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.160
These two guys hadn't talked to each other
in about 5 years and that tsunami hit 2000

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.210
miles away.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:03.011
Bill had just had quadruple bypass surgery
and we went to Little Rock Arkansas and these

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:10.870
two people put purpose above politics and
they put purpose above pettiness and we raised

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:16.670
2 billion dollars in 5 days.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.770
American people need to see more of this.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.800
We think we're in the political business but
we're not, we're in the purpose business and

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.610
America's got to get back to its purpose.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.080
Politicians need to understand they're not
in the reelection business anymore; they have

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.970
to be in the make a difference business.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:38.720
So when Katrina hit I got them together again
and they formed that fund for Katrina.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.840
When Ike hit Houston President Bush called
Bill Clinton, we filmed them.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.630
When Haiti, a horrible earth-- I just got
back from Haiti, the earthquake hit, I got

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.300
W and Clinton together, that was an interesting
shoot.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.900
I feel like I'm the frickin' eHarmony
[Laughter]

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.990
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: for politicians.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:08.900
But the truth is that I know that politics
has to go on but sooner or later you have

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:15.341
to put the purpose of this country ahead of
the politics of the party.

00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:18.390
And the American people are waiting for this.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.530
By the way, when I was filming the first one,
Bill Clinton looked at me and the tsunami

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:27.950
and he said, "You know the animals left before
the tsunami hit."

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.620
They left.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:38.470
The American people have left and we're sitting
there going who's gonna step up and tell us

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.470
where we should go fighting?

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.380
But what are we fighting for?

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.030
Instead of fighting, in a democracy, by the
way, if you don't have something to fight

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.970
for you fight against each other.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.320
So I play that because that's the purpose
at work.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.030
So we're gonna cover some quick ground.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.120
Talk about the economy just for a little bit.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.690
I wanna talk about what purpose is, why do
you need it?

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.810
What does it look like, sound like?

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.060
And why Robert Frost was writing?

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.820
Quickly, we're not in a recession, we're not
in a depression; we're in a generational winter.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.049
There's a book called The Fourth Turning by
Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, they're the ones

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:20.760
that wrote the generations book, they're the
ones who named the millennials, I don't know

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.090
if you like them or not but they're generational
experts.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:31.260
And the premise of the book documented is
that every generation goes through a spring,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.840
summer, fall and winter.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:41.130
The last winter America had was World War
Two in the Great Depression.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.320
That was my parent's winter.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.150
The winter before that was the Civil War.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.630
The winter before that was the American Revolution.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.350
And they've tracked it all throughout Europe.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.460
So we're in an economic winter and that, in
fact, they wrote the book The Fourth Turning

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.860
in 1998 and they predicted our winter would
hit in 2008.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.560
Let me repeat what I just said.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.299
They wrote it in 1998 and they predicted our
winter would hit in 2008.

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:14.700
I know you all haven't suffered through the
winter like a lot of other organizations,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.500
good job.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.260
In every other winter we've had, I said it
before; the American people knew what we were

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.330
fighting for.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:28.309
In World War Two it was freedom itself.

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:32.310
In the Civil War which was the worst war we
were ever in, we were fighting to see whether

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.580
or not we had the courage to keep this thing
together.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.080
And the American Revolution we were fighting
to create the birth of new democracy.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:47.280
The reason we're in a stalemate right now
is that we don't know what we're fighting

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.850
for.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:57.230
And it's not cap and trade and it's not fighting
for healthcare and it's not-- those are tactics.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.990
If you hear from Washington, here are the
solutions; either spin and stimulate or cut

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.490
and stay, those are the solutions.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.490
You what we have to do?

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.850
We have to create our way outta this business.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:14.710
Between 1985 and 2005, America created 41
million jobs.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:24.630
85 to 2005, 92 percent with companies less
than 5 years old.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.910
The miracle of America is entrepreneurship.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.340
So in this winter here's what happened.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:37.470
Before the winter the world economy was propped
up by the American consumer spending more

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.950
than we had on things we didn't need, made
some place else.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.180
Let me go through again.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:50.390
The whole world economy was based upon the
American consumer spending more than we had

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.740
on things we didn't need made some place else.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:58.090
We bought so much stuff we had to get off
sight storage to go visit it.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.820
We were spending, by the way I have duct tape
on my wallet that's another story, but we

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.390
were spending 144 dollars a day.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.500
That's not mortgage that's discretionary income.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.490
And when the winter hit it went down to 44
dollars, let's see.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:21.309
And outside of this spending right now in
this Christmas holidays it's averaging out

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:22.370
63 dollars.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:28.230
So 144 to 63, the American people have said
I think I'm not gonna do more with less I

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.820
think I'm gonna do better with less.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.580
Here's the good news for Google.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:43.730
If a business is not in the business of improving
people's lives they're not gonna be in business.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.400
And they're gonna find out, that's why my
book, best seller, what, it's not what you

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.380
sell it's what you stand for.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.830
Because everyone's selling the same kind of
stuff and what you stand for is gonna be just

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:56.830
as important.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:01.530
So if you're in the life improvement business
and with your folks here and the enterprise

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.880
group, I don't think you're in the consulting
business, I don't think you're in the selling

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.841
of high tech stuff, I think you're in the
business to improve your clients life so they

00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:13.120
can improve the life of their business , so
they can improve the life of their employees

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.980
and whether it's, you know, earth builder
or earth pro or that mapping thing that, what

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.310
is it that you find where crime is and shit?

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.310
It's unbelievable.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.630
No, I was blown away.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.890
I didn't want my address on your Google map
but anyway, what you're doing everyday is

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:34.990
empowering people to be free and do good things
for their company.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.280
And if you're from the offers, anyone from
the offers segment?

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.650
Okay, two things real quick.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:47.390
I know you know this but we don't see this
much in Austin but we're still the consumers

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.160
are in deep, deep trouble.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.770
If you do not get your offers out to them
you're cheating them out of the opportunity

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.480
of leading a good life for less.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.039
It's not just selling coupons and discounts,
you're selling what counts.

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.919
Is that right?

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:08.130
And by the way, what you're doing to help
small businesses is the miracle of America,

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.130
we gotta have a rebirth.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.660
So all the time when you're walking, talking
about small businesses and mom and pops, we

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.620
need to create a million new businesses a
year in America to get this country going

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.620
again.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.620
A million.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.480
And all of them need mentors.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.750
So I'm gonna do a TV show, I'm selling it
right now called Dream it, Build it, I'm the

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.030
host.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.610
And we go find a dreamer.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.299
Google ought to do this shit, we ought to
put it up, seriously, I've got Howard Schultz,

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:38.350
I've got Herb Keller, I've got the woman that
built the company Build a Bear, I've got Chris

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:42.900
Gardner who you, he was the original guy in
the Pursuit of Happiness, I have every mentor

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.870
already lined up.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.760
And we're gonna go out and find dreamers in
every category.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.360
I wanna open a restaurant, I wanna be a farmer
and we're gonna have the American people vote

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.700
on it, not like you have to sing and shit.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:29:00.731
It's gonna be literally, you know, another
little whatever, and then at the end, so I

00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:08.880
introduce the dreamer, I partner them with
a mentor and at the end of the show just like

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.210
that Robert Sneed who lent me the 5,000 dollars,
everybody who's built a business said somebody

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.000
helped them and so at that moment in time
they're gonna have a pass it forward moment

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.289
to that dreamer.

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:24.840
And the only requirement is the dreamer has
to report in every month on our website, dreamitbuildi.biz

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.210
how they're doing.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.000
We're gonna every night when the call to action
is, there are 40 million in America, by the

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.990
way, I didn't make this up like the Harvard
stuff, there are 40 million people, but you

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.450
don't know the difference so what the hell?

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:42.590
There's 40 million people in this country
who basically go home at night and dream about

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.590
opening up their own business.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:52.242
I saw some of you look at yourselves, watch
out they may leave, but anyway, we need, I

00:29:52.242 --> 00:30:00.770
need to get Google involved with this because
this is gonna be a movement that literally

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.610
saves the republic.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:12.770
And we represent AARP although I'm not a member
and we're gonna launch a campaign next year

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.730
called Relaunch Your Life.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:22.539
People, the young and the young at heart,
so what you're doing with offers and what

00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:27.610
you're doing with enterprise, all of you can
do the big stuff at some point, I know you

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:32.880
do this, make sure, make sure, you might pick
5 businesses and you're in Austin Texas and

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.030
help them grow.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.260
You might find dreamers of your own and pick
them.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:43.500
Let them come up here and find out, I don't
do mild award with the Rise Group and I give

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:49.050
part of the proceeds of Royito to the entrepreneur.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.070
But this is something I know ya'll are involved
with but the more you can be involved with

00:30:54.070 --> 00:31:01.159
rebirthing and reigniting the American dream,
that'll keep you humble.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.630
We gotta stand tall for small.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.500
So, what is purpose?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.830
Aristotle said it the best, and by the way
I'm talking to you about your own life too

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.270
if you don't mind, not just about Google.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:24.830
Aristotle said, "Purpose is where your talent
and the needs of the world intersect.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.620
Therein lies your vocation."

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.630
Where your talents and the needs of the world
intersect, therein lies your purpose.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.929
You ever heard the Peter's principal?

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:37.520
People get burned out?

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.520
When I was in the 8th grade I turned in a
paper on Emerson and I had 29 misspelled words

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.320
and I got a C. C's were not acceptable in
our household.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.770
The next year we did Emerson again with another
teacher and I told my mom I'm not turning

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.929
this paper in.

00:31:55.929 --> 00:31:57.880
I was scared to death.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.030
She said, "No, go ahead."

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.320
I had 32 misspelled words and got an A+.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.350
So I brought both the papers home and I said,
"I don't get this."

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.850
And my mom said, "You can't spell."

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.140
Hire one.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:19.660
But there was a point she said, "You can write
your ass off."

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:25.220
Purpose is about not spending your life trying
to become average at what you're bad at.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.600
Purpose is spending your life becoming great
at what you're good at.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.860
I always tell my kids, and they're all doing
it, you can make a living doing what you love

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.280
to do.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.909
I'm not saying you'll get rich but there's
a lot of definitions of rich.

00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:41.700
You can make a living at what you love to
do.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.080
So purpose is that definitive statement of
the difference you're trying to make in the

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.130
world.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.740
We've been blessed with a purpose institute
which our separate company from GSD&amp;M now

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.590
but we did all the way in our business.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.650
Southwest Airline purpose, we're not in the
airline business.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:03.789
Our purpose is real simple; we give people
the freedom to fly.

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:06.750
By the way, ya'll give people the freedom
to thrive.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:12.690
I think that's copyrightable, cut that out,
you gotta pay me for this shit I'm not giving

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.970
it away.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:19.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Okay, and ya'll have money,

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.730
fine Southwest Airlines purpose, we give people
the freedom to fly.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.700
Wal-Mart, our purpose is save people money.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.400
By the way, I always say when we're at our
best, cause sometimes you're not always at

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.460
your best as a company, we save people money
so they can live better.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.830
United States Air Force, by the way, thank
them, when we're at our best we protect you

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:43.090
from attacks from air space and cyber space
and maybe you all can work with them, I'm

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.730
sure you do here.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.789
John Mackey and whole foods, our purpose,
when we're at our best we nourish the body

00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:53.224
and the mind and the soul and the community
and the planet.

00:33:53.224 --> 00:34:00.360
In Disney when we're at our best we use our
imagination to bring happiness to millions.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:09.190
Apple when we're at our best we create beautiful
things for the mind that enhances human kind.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:13.579
When I talk about Google, all this a little
bit, it's not exactly your words, here's what

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:17.249
I say, people go crazy you can use it if you
want to, I said, "Google's purpose is, when

00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:20.300
they're at their best, they organize all the
information there ever was and there ever

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:26.389
will be and make it accessible and useful
to all people for all time."

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:27.389
That's called a [inaudible].

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.889
People go, "I wanna do that."

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:29.889
I said, "Don't.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:30.889
They're already doing it."

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.440
But in a sense that's what you do.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:40.739
You organize all the information there ever
was, ever will be and make it useful and accessible

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.230
to all people for all time.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:51.289
You democratize knowledge every day.

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:57.670
The GE aviation, I was talking to 7,000 scientists,
they were really inspired by me but finally

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:02.170
about half through the deal I said, "Ya'll
aren't really paying attention but it's either

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.819
my fault or yours, so I've got the mic and
I'm saying it's yours, so there."

00:35:06.819 --> 00:35:08.440
I did, it was funny.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:14.670
Cause I don't give a shit, so I said, "Do
you know what your founders said about your

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.670
company?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.499
You know what your founders said about GE?

00:35:17.499 --> 00:35:19.520
And by the way, it wasn't Jack Welch."

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.369
They went, "Really?"

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:24.329
"It's a guy named Thomas Edison.

00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:26.520
And you know what he said?

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:34.319
I never perfect an invention that I don't
think about the impact on the greater good."

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:39.720
So we went through this whole purpose project
with GE aviation, people that build the jet

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720
engines.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.420
At the end, by the way you can't make up purpose;
it's got to be authentic.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:51.249
In the end we presented it to all the staff,
what we found out, and here's their purpose,

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:57.280
we don't build jet engines we invent the future
of flight.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.740
It lifts people up and brings them home safely.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.329
That company's now on fire.

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.920
I don't like to use that word with jet engines.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.240
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: I don't even know why I said

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.670
that but it is so excited about the fact that
we're not just in the jet engine business

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:20.690
we invent the future of flight.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:27.140
So every day that you wake up go back and
look at your statement about that user and

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.039
organizing all the information there ever
will be and make it accessible and available

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:33.190
and useful to all people for all time.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.700
And in sense what you do, you give them the
freedom to thrive.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.469
That's what you do.

00:36:39.469 --> 00:36:43.450
That's a pretty good business to be in.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.719
So why do you need it?

00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:52.079
It drives every decision, it helps you don't
do evil.

00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:56.630
The Southwest Airlines, let's put up a little
slide here or you can go anywhere if you want

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.630
to.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.630
Anyway
[Laughs]

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:05.509
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: Southwest Airlines, there was
2 monkeys in a bar and so, here, okay here's

00:37:05.509 --> 00:37:11.009
the story, 10 months ago, they paid me to
do this shit, this is not hard.

00:37:11.009 --> 00:37:14.529
No it really isn't but I make it really hard
and whatever, so

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:18.849
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: the consultants walk in and

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:25.359
they said, "You're losing and leaving 350
million dollars on the table not charging

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.450
for bags.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.460
Now, American Airlines just went bankrupt
today.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.440
[Makes crying noise]
[Laughter]

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.229
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: So, and you know why they go
bankrupt?

00:37:38.229 --> 00:37:40.710
So they can keep their cost down so they can
compete with us.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.119
We've never been bank, you know that Southwest
Airlines is the most unionized airline in

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:45.589
America, did you know that?

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:48.539
We've never had a strike, we've never had
a furlough, we've never went, we've never

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:52.460
had a prob, a quarter we hadn't made money
and we haven't gone bankrupt so we get our

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.990
costs down on the backs of our vendors.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:59.170
I'm not pissed off about it, but anyway, here's
the point, they said, "You're leaving 350

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.049
million dollars, everybody's doing it.

00:38:01.049 --> 00:38:04.589
Everybody's charging for bags."

00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:08.680
So another consultant walked in, I said, "Do
whatever you want.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:13.369
You charge for bags, you violate the purpose
of the company, your call.

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:16.000
It's that simple.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.660
We're in the business to give people the freedom
to fly but we do it by keeping our cost down

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.229
so we can keep our fares down so we can give
people the freedom to fly.

00:38:22.229 --> 00:38:26.319
We see a time where everyone can go and see
and do things they only dreamed of.

00:38:26.319 --> 00:38:28.619
So you charge for bags there's gonna be a
lot of people that can't go to Disney.

00:38:28.619 --> 00:38:29.619
It's your call."

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:31.900
Hurt the little children.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:39.259
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Roy Spence: When Gary Kelly stood up and

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:44.219
said, "We're not gonna charge for bags, you
go find the money."

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:53.249
So we launched this campaign, I'll play the
commercial and I'll tell you what happened.

00:38:53.249 --> 00:38:59.960
About 3 months ago the CFO comes into the
meeting and sits down with everyone and he

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.799
said, "I was wrong."

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:03.630
I said, "Excuse me?"

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.710
Did you see King's Speech?

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.140
One of the greatest movies ever, I'm serious.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.680
He said, "I was wrong."

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.710
"Oh, what'd ya say?

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:13.710
You were wrong?"

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.200
"I was wrong!"

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:27.739
In 12 months we generated 1.2 billion dollars
in sales charging for free because we stood

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:29.319
firm on our purpose.

00:39:29.319 --> 00:39:33.460
And you know what happens when you stand firm
on your purpose?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.829
Consumers can smell it.

00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:36.910
I wanna hang around you guys.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:43.650
There are two type of companies; there are
vinegar companies and there are honey companies.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:44.849
Some you just don't wanna be around.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.839
By the way, there's two kind of people.

00:39:46.839 --> 00:39:49.140
There are takers and there are givers.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.809
I like givers.

00:39:50.809 --> 00:39:52.730
I like honey.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.729
A great brand is always a honey brand.

00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:59.960
People say I wanna hang out with you because
I agree with what you stand for.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.040
I wanna hang out with you instead of, "Oh
God."

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.430
And play like you're on the phone, he's coming.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.259
I wanna hang out with you cause I like what
you stand for.

00:40:11.259 --> 00:40:13.269
So what does purpose look like?

00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:18.690
I'm gonna play 3 or 4 spots and these are
probono.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:24.920
If we have a lot of time at our agency we
try to do the right thing, the first spot,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.549
this is what purpose looks like.

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:33.630
The first spot I wanna tell a little story,
we were in Annapolis when 9/11 happened.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:39.140
We had 2 clients involved, the United States
Air Force and Southwest Airlines.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:46.769
And by the way, we had just got the Air Force
and their theme line was nobody comes close.

00:40:46.769 --> 00:40:47.940
Oops.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.140
They bombed the Pentagon.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.459
So we were going home, driving home, trying
to get home and I kept saying, "What can we

00:40:56.459 --> 00:40:57.459
do?

00:40:57.459 --> 00:40:58.459
What can we do?"

00:40:58.459 --> 00:41:03.069
So I called every director in America and
said, "I want ya'll to go out and film people

00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:08.349
of every race, every religion, every color
saying one thing, I'm an American."

00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:13.759
Because I was worried in the process of striking
back our enemies we might strike one of our

00:41:13.759 --> 00:41:15.219
own because they look different.

00:41:15.219 --> 00:41:20.719
So this first spot aired more times than any
other PSA in history and then it just went

00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:22.470
again on the 10th anniversary.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:29.109
So this is what purpose looks like.

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:34.369
Purpose doesn't have to be heavy; you just
have to have one.

00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:39.779
83 percent of all responders are trained at
community colleges and we're about to cut

00:41:39.779 --> 00:41:41.459
community college's budget in half around
this country.

00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:51.039
So, by the way if you can learn to drink coffee
without a cigarette you can learn to do anything.

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:55.630
We have a whole series them, um, you got a
smoke?

00:41:55.630 --> 00:42:02.901
But, uh, I wanna play 4 other spots, these
are like paying clients and then, everyone

00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:07.790
that we represent has a purpose beyond making
money or we don't represent them.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.940
They might not know it but we help them understand
what their core purpose is.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.859
So let's just play these spots.

00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:24.640
The real thrill when you have purpose on your
side is that you get people to smile or laugh

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:30.029
or think or cry and not just sit there.

00:42:30.029 --> 00:42:38.400
Cause if it just sits there, that spot or
whatever runs on any of the media, if it just

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.410
sits there it doesn't activate somebody's
emotion, it's not worth it.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.979
Real quick story and we're gonna wrap up pretty
soon.

00:42:47.979 --> 00:42:53.239
I get a call from one of my colleagues from
Wal-Mart who's a pharmacist and ended up being

00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:59.959
head of merchandise worldwide for the largest
company in the world and he retired about

00:42:59.959 --> 00:43:08.200
3 years ago and he retired, he's young but,
and he said he needed to have tractor time.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:15.900
So John Deere's our client so, anyway, so
he called me up and he said, "I wanna repay

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:23.690
a favor that you gave me when I was at Wal-Mart"
and I said, "Well, I didn't do anything."

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:29.819
He said, "No, I used to think in black and
white and you helped me think in color.

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:36.099
So I'm gonna send you a video cause this is
what purpose sounds like.

00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:39.059
I know what it looks like I wanna teach you
what it sounds like.

00:43:39.059 --> 00:43:44.489
And when you get done hearing the video I
want you to call me the next morning and I'll

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:47.239
tell you why this is what purpose sounds like."

00:43:47.239 --> 00:43:54.720
So I wanna play you this and then I'll tell
you what he said.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:01.690
I called him up the next day, by the way,
I watch that every morning, but I said, "So,

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.109
it's awesome but tell me why this is what
purpose sounds like."

00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:14.380
And he said, "Well, first of all everybody's
gotta know the words to the song.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:19.999
Secondly, you gotta listen to one another.

00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:25.680
Third, you gotta step up when it's your turn.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:33.180
Fourth, it sounds awesome when you sing together.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:38.549
And fifth, it helps to have a good song to
sing."

00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:43.959
So, if you work in an organization that has
a good song to sing, by the way America has

00:44:43.959 --> 00:44:48.819
a good song to sing we just don't know the
words to the song anymore and we don't listen

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:53.049
to one another anymore and we don't step up
when it's our turn anymore and that's gotta

00:44:53.049 --> 00:44:54.049
change.

00:44:54.049 --> 00:44:59.490
If you work for an awesome company you gotta
know the words to the song, you gotta listen

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:04.029
to one another, you gotta step up when it's
your turn and by the way, when you sing together

00:45:04.029 --> 00:45:05.029
it's pretty awesome.

00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:07.289
You guys have a good song to sing.

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:12.019
And final, why Robert Frost was writing, you
thought I'd forget that one.

00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:19.319
But, I was in New York about 3 years ago and
it was late night and I was flipping through

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:25.619
there and flipping through the kid channels
and kept going to the channel company that

00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:33.229
Nancy Grace, that everybody's bad, every aunt
kills their nephew, every dog kills their

00:45:33.229 --> 00:45:37.940
priest, every, whatever and I was just going,
I went, "Oh my God."

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.690
And I said, I remember what that great philosopher,
French philosopher said, "America will cease

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.989
to be great if we cease to be good.

00:45:45.989 --> 00:45:52.420
So this is not the America I know so I decided,
you'll get the logic, to walk across America.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:58.280
Where, you know, so, it's hard, you have the
same look as when I told my wife.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.849
She said, "Whatever."

00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:08.369
So, I got on Google Maps with my assistant
and I stated in Cobham New Hampshire and walked

00:46:08.369 --> 00:46:13.680
through seven states on my first leg with
a backpack and two American flags.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.170
And I had a pedometer that beeped every mile
and the theory was, and it worked out that

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.569
I was gonna take a picture of something good
every mile.

00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:29.559
And I was run off the road, I was in mud,
even though when it beeped I had to find something

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:32.849
good and take a picture.

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:37.089
And this is why Robert Frost was writing,
"There are two roads diverged in a yellow

00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:39.969
wood in life.

00:46:39.969 --> 00:46:44.500
And sorry, I can't travel both and be one
traveler."

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.999
I didn't know what that meant when my mom
used to read it to me.

00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:53.489
Two roads diverged and I cannot travel both
and be one traveler.

00:46:53.489 --> 00:46:59.839
So I found on this first leg of the journey,
thank you Google Maps, that you become what

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:02.979
you look for in life.

00:47:02.979 --> 00:47:07.299
If you look for enemies you'll find them.

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:12.479
If you look for hate it'll live in your heart.

00:47:12.479 --> 00:47:17.599
If you look for gossip it'll consume you.

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:20.309
If you look for fear it'll follow you.

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:25.089
But on that other road, if you look for friends
you'll be befriended.

00:47:25.089 --> 00:47:31.309
And if you look for love it'll lift you up.

00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:37.499
And if you look for the truth it'll set you
free.

00:47:37.499 --> 00:47:41.099
And if you look for hope it'll take you to
higher ground.

00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:44.019
That's the road I'm on.

00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:48.630
And I wish I'd of known that road a long,
long time ago but instinctively I think I've

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.082
been on that road all along.

00:47:50.082 --> 00:47:53.559
So you look for friends and you look for love
and you look for the truth and you look for

00:47:53.559 --> 00:48:00.130
hope and in the process in business you'll
make money but you'll make a difference and

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:04.029
just perhaps you'll make a little bit of history.

00:48:04.029 --> 00:48:05.529
That's not a bad way to live your life in
business.

00:48:05.529 --> 00:48:12.230
So I thank you for inviting me, Patrick, and
thank you for being in Austin.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:17.140
I wish you a purpose inspired life and 'Hook
'em.'

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.000
[Applause]
