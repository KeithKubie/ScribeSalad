Often acquiring data to do analysis doesn't require

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.900
any particularly fancy methodology. It's just a matter of

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.810
finding the right file somewhere on the internet

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.010
and downloading it. A lot of the data that

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.320
exists out there, particularly on government websites, is

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.280
stored in text files. For example, let's say we

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.650
wanted to get a database of all major league baseball statistics. I kind find

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.910
this data at http://www.SeanLahman.com/baseballarchives/statistics.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.930
If I visit this website, I can see that

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.870
the data I want is available in a variety

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
of formats. A comma delimited or CSV version, but

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.020
also a Microsoft Access version, and a SQL version.
