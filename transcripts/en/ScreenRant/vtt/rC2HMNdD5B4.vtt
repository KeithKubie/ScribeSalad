00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.290
Disney movies are some of the most paused
movies out there - usually because eagle-eyed

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.000
Easter egg hunters are keen to spot fun intentional
inclusions by Disney's animators, such as

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.820
characters from other movies making cameos
in the background.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.840
However, quite often, pausing Disney movies
at just the right time can result in an image

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.530
Disney might not be so keen for you to see.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.560
Whether it's a character looking a little
less attractive than they usually do, a situation

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.800
being made to look inappropriate when taken
out of context, or otherwise, there are some

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.440
Disney movie screenshots that weren't meant
to be seen when paused.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.530
This video will take a look at some entertaining
examples of that.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.630
We hope you enjoy it - and make sure you subscribe
to ScreenRant's YouTube channel to enjoy more

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.070
like it in the future!

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.610
Here are ten paused Disney moments they don't
want you to know about.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.219
The Little Mermaid
In 1989's The Little Mermaid, the second time

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.250
Ariel and Eric meet, it is when Eric discovers
Ariel on a beach, after she'd lost her voice.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.439
The first time they'd met, Ariel saved Eric
from drowning and disappeared just as he regained

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.439
conscious.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.679
So, in this second meeting, Eric only vaguely
recognised her.

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.079
Ariel's desperate attempts to communicate
with Eric without her voice resulted in some

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.889
very exaggerated hand gestures - which Eric
seemed to join in with.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:24.460
If you pause the movie at just the right time,
they don't look like Disney characters at

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.390
all - the pair actually look more like members
of The Sopranos!

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.150
The Princess and the Frog
Charlotte La Bouff from 2009's The Princess

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
and the Frog was a very attractive character
- or at least she was meant to be!

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.100
Disney's intentions were obviously for the
Southern belle to be physically beautiful

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.079
at all times - but a paused moment from one
particular scene in her movie spoils that

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.079
notion somewhat!

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.899
It comes in the scene when Charlotte puts
Tiana's tiara on her head in the bedroom.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.719
As Charlotte adjusts her top, her face - for
a mere moment - looks absolutely ghastly and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.719
almost pig-like!

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.919
Yikes!

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:04.590
Toy Story 2

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.120
1999's Toy Story 2 saw the introduction of
some new talking toys that weren't in the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:17.450
first movie - one of them being the excitable
Jessie.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
Buzz Lightyear immediately found himself attracted
to the cowgirl and introduced himself to her

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.450
in bumbling fashion.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.390
Jessie seemed impressed and immediately grabbed
Buzz to tell him how sweet she thought he

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.390
was.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.220
But if you pause that scene at a very specific
moment, it looks as though she's drunk as

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.140
hell, with Buzz looking on concerned and unimpressed
at her unladylike behaviour!

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.220
The Fox and the Hound

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.310
1981's The Fox and the Hound follows the exploits
of the titular young red fox - Tod - as he

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.870
grows into adulthood and tries to make a life
for himself in the forest.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.910
At one point, he encounters the female fox
Vixey for the first time and, soon after meeting

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.560
her - which was initially disastrous after
he failed to catch a fish to impress her - she

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.140
begins to show him affection, which includes
rubbing herself against him.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.010
Feeling the physical affection of a female
for the first time seems to be too much for

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.460
Tod and, if you pause the movie at just the
right moment, it looks as though he's reached

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.330
a point of pleasure unsuitable for young viewers!

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.330
Hercules

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.000
Hercules is, of course, one of the most macho
characters in fiction - that's kind of his

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.070
schtick, after all.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.360
In his titular 1997 movie, he meets Meg after
saving her from the giant centaur known as

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.390
Nessus, by defeating the beast with his phenomenal
strength - but a few moments later he doesn't

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.640
look so macho.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.010
When he goes to see how Meg is, as she's cleaning
her hair in some nearby water, he takes a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.450
hit to the face from her soaking locks when
she turns around.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.620
Pause the scene at the right moment, and you'll
see Herc looking more like the sassiest diva

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.120
in town than a super-strong heroic warrior.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
Cinderella

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.750
1950's Cinderella is one of the sweetest,
most innocent and quintessentially Disney

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.810
movies that the company has ever produced.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.450
Nobody could ever take any scenes out of context
from such a family-friendly Disney classic,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.450
right?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.450
Wrong!

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.319
In the scene in which the Grand Duke and the
palace footman are peering over the balcony,

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.950
pausing it at a certain point looks as though
the pair are indulging in some male-on-male

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.190
intimacy that is very unsuitable for children's
eyes!

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.819
With the Duke positioned behind, he certainly
appears to be enjoying it.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.999
The footman, however... not so much!

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.999
Aladdin

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:28.419
There are a lot of scenes in 1992's Aladdin
in which the titular character is in motion

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.310
and, when paused, performing some anatomically
impossible poses - but this one takes the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.310
cake!

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.639
The thief and street urchin-turned-hero is
having one of his typical altercations with

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.150
the palace guards when one of the guards loses
his pants - it's the scene in which he uses

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.430
a fish as a makeshift pair of pants.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.749
Aladdin stretches whilst running and the shape
of his body basically looks like he's broken

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.400
every bone he's got!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.509
Seriously, nobody can make their body stretch
and twist like that!

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.550
The Emperor's New Groove

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.469
The Emperor's New Groove was a 2000 movie
about the titular 18-year-old, selfish, spoiled

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.870
and sarcastic titular Emperor Kuzco.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.560
The whole movie's plot is based around him
learning to become a better person after being

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.969
turned into a llama - and it's that scene
we're referring to here.

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.301
As Kuzco's transformation takes place while
he's sat at a table with Yzma and Kronk, if

00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.800
you pause the movie at a certain point, mid-transformation,
you'll find that he looks like some animated

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.360
characters from a completely different (and
far more adult) franchise - a certain Beavis

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.219
and Butt-Head!

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.449
Beauty and the Beast

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.849
There may be a fantastic live action remake
of Beauty and the Beast coming out this year,

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.289
but nobody can forget the wonderful 1991 animated
version of the classic tale.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.710
As with all interpretations of the story,
it featured the vain hunter Gaston and his

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.419
loyal, yet often-abused sidekick, LeFou.

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.779
There's a scene in which LeFou serenades Gaston
with a song about how great he is - and it

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.219
includes a moment in which LeFou wraps a man's
belt around Gaston's neck to demonstrate how

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.530
thick and muscular it is.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.999
Unfortunately, when paused, there's a moment
in which Gaston looks as though he's experimenting

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.669
with a little BDSM!

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.669
Frozen

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.740
When Anna and Hans first meet in 2013's Frozen,
Hans and his horse inadvertently knock Anna

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.770
into a boat.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.960
Their subsequent interactions are extremely
awkward - both physically and verbally - and

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.289
this results in a scene that looks a little...
non-PG, let's say... when it's paused.

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.400
Anna falls on top of Hans and, if you pause
it at just the right ... or wrong... frame,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.199
depending on how you look at it, it looks
like Anna is lost in a moment of physical

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.569
ecstasy, while Hans looks as though he's embarrassed
that his participation in the encounter has

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.129
just come to a premature end.

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.030
