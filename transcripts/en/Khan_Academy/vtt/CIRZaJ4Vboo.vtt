00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.302
- [Voiceover] "Which of
the following is equivalent

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:05.182
"to the complex number shown above?"

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:07.189
And then we got this big, hairy mess here.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.662
Where we wanna take
the rational expression

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:13.239
one plus i over one minus i,

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:17.278
and then add that to one over one plus i.

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:19.542
Well when you had two fractions like this

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:22.618
what you might wanna do is
find a common denominator.

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:24.656
And the easiest way to
find a common denominator

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:28.280
is to take the product
of both of these things.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.497
So let me just rewrite everything.

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.207
So we wanna take one plus i

00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:34.494
over one minus i,

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.319
and then add that, and
let me switch some colors

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:37.991
so we can keep track of things.

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:41.717
And then add that to one plus...

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:44.795
Or one over one plus i.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.336
And actually, let me give
myself some space here.

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.298
So, plus...

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:51.771
Plus one over

00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:54.174
one plus i.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:56.613
Well we're able to add
two fractions if we have

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:58.017
the same denominator.

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:00.853
And we can have the same
denominator if we multiply

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.396
both the numerator and
the denominator here

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.533
by this denominator by one plus i,

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.251
and if we multiply both
the numerator and the

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.166
denominator here by this denominator,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.607
and this is the way
that you've always added

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:11.335
fractions with unlike denominators,

00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:13.007
we're just finding a
least common multiple,

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:14.505
and that least common multiple the easiest

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.210
one is just multiplying the denominators.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.974
So let's do that, so let's
multiply the numerator

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:20.891
and denominator here.

00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.071
Put the parenthesis time one plus i.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:25.533
And let's

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.984
multiply the denominator here times

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.808
one plus i.

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:30.827
So notice one plus i over
one plus i that's just

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:32.604
going to be one,

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:34.287
so we aren't changing its
value, we're just going to

00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:36.248
find another way of expressing it.

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:39.326
And this one over here
we wanna multiply the

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:42.507
numerator and the denominator...

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:44.224
And the denominator

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:45.351
by this denominator,

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:47.126
by one minus i.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:50.343
One minus i, so we're
gonna multiply times...

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.583
We're gonna take this and
multiply one minus i...

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:55.238
Multiply by one minus i over one minus i,

00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:57.469
and once again, this thing
right over here is just one

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.516
so we're not changing its
value, we're just finding a good

00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:01.142
way to rewrite it so
that we're going to have

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:02.441
the same denominator.

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.223
Notice, both of these denominators are

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:06.872
now going to be the same
thing, they're gonna be

00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:09.089
one plus i times one minus i.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.936
Let's figure out what this is.

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:14.116
So this first one

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:16.659
right over here.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.494
So the numerator...

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.256
So let's see, we're
gonna have one times one.

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:22.998
Let me do this in different
colors, this way we can

00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:25.110
keep track of everything.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.257
So we have this numerator right over here.

00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:30.497
One times one is one.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:34.119
One times i is i.

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.417
I times one is i.

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:40.388
And then i times i is

00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:42.291
negative one.

00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:43.918
Is negative one.

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:47.551
And then this denominator over here

00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.291
is going to be, so we're
gonna have divided by

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.670
one times one, and you
could say that this is

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.911
a difference of squares right over here.

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.768
Let me just multiply it
out, we'll see that it's a

00:02:56.768 --> 00:02:57.709
difference of squares.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.610
So one times one is one.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.534
One times plus i is plus i.

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:07.936
Negative i times one is minus i.

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:12.092
And then negative i times positive i.

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.891
Well, i times i would be negative one,

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:15.506
but then we have this
negative so it's just

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:17.490
going to be plus one.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.149
And so, what does this simplify to?

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.135
Let's see, you're gonna have

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.213
one minus one.

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:25.768
So those cancel out.

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:28.206
And then you're gonna have this i minus i,

00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:29.726
that's just gonna be zero.

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.095
So this simplifies in the numerator,

00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.753
you have two times i.

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:36.645
And then in the denominator...

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.932
In the denominator you have one plus one

00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:40.546
is equal to two.

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.252
And I could simplify
this, but my goal isn't to

00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:45.132
simplify this, my goal
is to have the same...

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:47.128
Is to have like denominators,
so I'm just gonna leave

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:49.538
this like this, just like that right now.

00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:51.453
And now let's move on to this one.

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:54.635
Let's move on to this
one, so the numerator...

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.480
The numerator here is
pretty straight forward,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.417
one times one minus i,
that's just gonna be one

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:00.695
minus i.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:02.714
And then the denominator
here, one plus i times

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:04.572
one minus i, we just figure that out.

00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:06.954
That simplifies to two.

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:09.450
So that simplifies to two.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.808
So this has now become

00:04:11.808 --> 00:04:13.989
two i over two, plus

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.056
one minus i

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.646
over two.

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:19.190
Well what's that going to mean?

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.735
Well...

00:04:20.735 --> 00:04:22.208
Our denominator's going to be two.

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.137
You could say that we have two i halves

00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:26.538
plus one minus i half, so how many halves

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:27.674
is that going to be?

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:29.359
Well, we wanna add...

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:32.330
This has no real part, so you wanna add

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.595
the imaginary parts.

00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:36.079
So we're gonna have the one.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.171
This one.

00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:38.913
And then we could add...

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:41.815
Take two i and then subtract i from that,

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.310
two i minus i is going to be i.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.310
So it's going to be

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.038
one plus i over two.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.952
And the don't have exactly that,

00:04:49.952 --> 00:04:52.438
but if we then if we just...

00:04:52.438 --> 00:04:55.350
Instead of writing it like
this, if we viewed this as...

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.255
If we viewed this as

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.250
one half times one plus i,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.536
which this is the same thing,
or if we viewed this as

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.437
one half, if we distribute the one half.

00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:08.888
One half plus

00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:10.896
one half i, or plus...

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:12.288
Let me just write it.

00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:14.053
One half plus one half i.

00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:15.968
And when we write it that way...

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:18.708
When we write it that
way, we see this choice

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.357
is exactly that.

00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:22.766
And we are done.
