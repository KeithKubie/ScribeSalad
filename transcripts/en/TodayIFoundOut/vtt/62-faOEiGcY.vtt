00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.630
Counting is one of life’s most basic skills
and something most humans are quite adept

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.630
at.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.400
Despite most of us being experts on the subject,
theoretically capable of counting infinitely

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.570
high with the ceiling bounded only by available
time and how good we are at staving off psychosis,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.070
few can accurately guess how long it would
take to count to a million, let alone a billion.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.660
This is largely owing to the fact that our
brains have an amazing amount of difficulty

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.480
conceptualizing such large numbers.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.140
This all brings us to the question of the
hour- just how long would it take to count

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.600
to a million or a billion?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.470
Let’s start with a million.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.120
The most commonly put forward time it would
take to count from one to a million out loud

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
is about 23 days.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.510
This time frame is cited in a number of textbooks
we consulted and seems to have originated,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.510
as far as we can tell, in a children’s book
suitably called, How Much is a Million by

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.799
David Schwartz, which uses various examples
to put into perspective how amazingly big

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.890
numbers like a million really are.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.930
Given the figure being cited in many a textbook
and first appearing in a book literally titled

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.390
How Much is a Million, you might assume it’s
reasonably close to correct.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.510
This is not the case, however; this number
significantly underestimates the actual time

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
needed.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.390
You see, Mr. Schwartz wasn’t trying to come
up with a real world figure here, just a simple

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.540
exercise to blow kid’s minds without bogging
them down in the details.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.670
As such, there are a couple assumptions being
made in the “23 days” figure that turn

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.800
out to make it completely useless as a real
world estimate of how long it would take to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.850
count to a million.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.550
The first assumption is that the person counting
would be able to do so 24 hours a day non-stop.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.280
The second assumption is not quite so absurd
on the surface: assuming that it would take

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.840
only about 2 seconds on average to say each
number.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.820
However, while certainly some of the lowest
numbers can easily be said much faster than

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.500
that and with little time needed for thinking,
the majority of the numbers for an average

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.940
speed speaker would take slightly longer.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.479
For example, just consider how long it would
take you to say out loud “one hundred ninety-five

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.360
thousand five hundred sixty-five”.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.000
Granted, when speed speaking, one can easily
hit the 2 second mark, or even less.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.190
But when actually counting aloud for many
hours on end, there is a certain level of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.310
physical and mental fatigue that goes along
with it that makes it so speed speaking isn’t

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.950
really viable long-term.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.630
This is a marathon, not a sprint.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.840
So just how long would it actually take someone
to count to a million?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.090
Thanks to the efforts of one Jeremy Harper,
we know the real world answer is somewhere

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.420
in the vicinity of 89 days.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.400
How did Mr. Harper figure this out?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.480
Well, he did it from June 18 to September
14, 2007 and live-streamed the entire thing

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.300
online for everyone to watch.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.420
Harper, a software engineer whose boss gave
him time off to do this, neither left his

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.940
apartment nor shaved during the event; he
recited numbers aloud (read off a computer

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.959
monitor) for about an average of 16 hours
every 24 hour period for 89 straight days.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.840
This is about 3.9 times longer than the oft’
quoted 23 day estimate.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.580
To be clear, we’re not saying this all couldn’t
be realistically done faster.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.750
Harper did take the occasional mini-break
to break out in dance and things of this nature-

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.000
he wasn’t trying to set a speed record to
count to a million.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.160
However, given his overall pacing when counting
was reasonably quick, he dedicated the vast

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.480
majority of his waking hours to the task at
hand, and the large sample size of counting

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.080
time we’re dealing with here, this seems
a pretty good ballpark figure to go with on

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.849
the “How long does it take to count to a
million?” front.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.410
As for why Harper did it, he was looking to
raise money for Push America (now The Ability

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.099
Experience), a charity that helps disabled
people.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.959
Along with raising about $12,000 for the charity
directly (and getting them a lot of free publicity),

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.050
Harper’s achievement was recognised by no
less of an authority than the Guinness Book

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.250
of Records for being the highest number ever
counted to by a human.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.020
As you might imagine, the reality of spending
nearly every waking moment for just shy of

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.410
three months doing nothing but counting aloud
was extremely mentally taxing according to

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.410
Harper.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.110
As he noted, “The cameras that were on the
whole time, I think, are really what kept

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.769
me sane through the whole thing.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.140
If I would have been locked in my apartment
and counted to a million and nobody was watching,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.319
I would certainly have lost my mind.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.850
I would be like, you know, just out of it.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.850
”

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.880
Naturally, after hitting 1,000,000, he did
what anyone would do after such a momentous

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.190
achievement- the chicken dance.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.949
As for the feeling of finishing counting higher
than any person before, according to Harper:

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.590
at that moment, I lost – I just kind of
lost all control, and then, you know, I said

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.590
the number.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.789
And then, it was just like a big bubble – it’s
kind of – just popping on me.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.039
At one time, I just said it and went with
it.

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.849
You know, there’s a weird emotion.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.400
Now, within those 89 days, it took Harper
about 1,424 waking hours, or about 5.13 million

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.330
seconds to count to a million doing almost
nothing but counting.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.430
This would mean the real world average time
to speak each number is roughly 5.13 seconds

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.550
or about 2.6 times slower than Mr. Schwartz’s
2 second assumption.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.229
Granted, when we timed Harper saying some
of the largest numbers here and averaged it

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.879
out, the two second mark wasn’t that far
off, ending up around 2.6 seconds each.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.309
But in between time was needed to, you know,
breathe, give the tongue, jaws, etc. a quick

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.360
rest, and take time to think about the next
number on the screen before saying it, to

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.960
avoid messing up.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.780
So what about a billion?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.650
As no one has ever counted that high (and
no individual human ever will unless we solve

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.279
that whole mortality thing), it’s difficult
to get quite as accurate of a general ballpark

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.279
figure.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.789
Seemingly the best way to do this would be
to gather, say, 10,000 people and have them

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.060
all take 100,000 number long segments out
of the 1 billion number line and begin counting.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.380
We’d then simply need to add up the total
time and get a good rough estimate.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.610
But as we don’t know 10,000 people willing
to volunteer a couple weeks of their lives

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.559
to such a task (unfortunately), we’ll give
it our best college try at an estimate using

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:49.169
Harper’s numbers as a reference point.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.379
On that note, as a sort of baseline, if we
assume that the average time to say each number

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.589
was the same as around what it is to count
to one million, and assume the same very reasonable

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:06.819
criteria as Mr. Harper used (counting roughly
16 hours per day with small breaks here and

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.389
there to eat, drink, etc.), that would be
a whopping 5,126,400,000 seconds or 1,424,000

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.029
hours of actual counting time.

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.590
After adding in the other eight hours of the
day, this comes out to 89,000 days or roughly

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.199
244 years.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.680
(And if you’re curious about the whole “no
need to do anything else but count” scenario,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.050
that would be roughly 59,333 days or about
163 years.)

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.639
But, of course, the time to say each number
would actually go up slightly as one ascended

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.649
the number ladder.

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.569
But how much?

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.960
Considerably based on a few practice runs
we attempted on some of the larger numbers.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.539
Beyond it being much harder than you might
expect keeping the large number in your head

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.139
to increment appropriately (an issue that
could be avoided via reading the numbers off

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.550
a screen as Harper did), the actual average
time to say something like “three hundred

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.311
twenty two million four hundred fifty two
thousand seven hundred ninety nine” for

00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:57.789
us was around 4 seconds at a normal speaking
pace.

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.389
Given Mr. Harper averaged an additional roughly
2.5 seconds in between each number, we’re

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:07.029
looking at a slightly more realistic number
(though still with a large error bar) of around

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.020
6.5 seconds average for those larger figures.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.360
The lower digits, of course, would be closer
to Mr. Harper’s 5.13 total seconds, but,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.399
as with counting to a million, the upper end
would come to dominate pretty quickly.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:23.659
So just for an exceptionally rough ballpark
figure, we’ll go with a more realistic 6

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:33.159
seconds per number average, giving us around
1,666,667 hours or 104,167 days (counting

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:38.830
16 hours per day) or roughly 285 years, assuming
one had the benefit to get to read the numbers

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.830
off a screen.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.900
(Without this, we’re quite certain given
our little practice runs with counting such

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.069
large figures, that it would take much, much
longer due to added interim seconds needed

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.939
for focusing/thinking in order to keep the
number in one’s head… and stave off a

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:53.469
mental breakdown as the years go on.)

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:56.550
So how long would it take to count to a billion?

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:03.259
We’ll go with somewhere between 244-285
years counting for about 16 hours per day.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.089
If you happen to know 10,000 people who want
to dedicate a couple weeks to counting, maybe

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:10.939
we can come up with a more accurate figure.

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:15.059
Now that’s all counting to a billion with
normal speaking pace.

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:18.729
Just for fun, we were curious what the fastest
speaker in the world could do assuming the

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:22.469
unrealistic scenario of being able to motor-mouth
all day.

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:25.899
According to the Guinness Book of Records,
the fastest talkers in the world can speak

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:29.830
over 600 words per minute, such as Sean Shannon
and Steven Woodmore.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.750
This is about four times faster than a normal
speaking pace, meaning Shannon or Woodmore

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.990
could count from 1 to a billion in about 71
years given the previous stipulations… you

00:08:37.990 --> 00:09:04.910
know, if they had nothing better 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:14.210
to do.
