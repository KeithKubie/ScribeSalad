LIV WU: Hi everyone, welcome.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm Liv Wu on the Mountain
View Food Program team,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.260
and welcome to you, Nancy.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.718
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Thank you.

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:14.120
LIV WU: Thank you for
being meeting at Google.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.080
Nancy is actually a native
of Palo Alto-- Atherton.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.760
She was born here.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.390
But 25 years ago, she decided
to go explore sushi in Japan

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.600
with just a list of
things she wanted

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.610
to taste-- very primitive.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.080
And just made her way
into restaurants and chefs

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.640
and tried to learn about them.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.900
And on her way to
doing that, she

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.350
met a handsome, gangly,
tall Japanese farmer

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.110
and fell in love
and married him.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.950
And he said, do you
want to live on a farm?

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.068
And she said yes.

00:00:53.068 --> 00:00:54.651
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: I said maybe.

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:55.151
Actually--

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:56.597
LIV WU: Actually, you did.

00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:57.180
And the rest--

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.870
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
--Let me think about it.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.970
LIV WU: --Is history.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.680
So, I was at the
farm, as I said.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.722
It's a farm that
produces organic eggs.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:09.430
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Free-range eggs.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.280
LIV WU: Free-range eggs.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.275
And

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.400
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
And then food that we eat.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.160
LIV WU: And everything that
they eat on the farm is eaten,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
and Nancy has become
the person who

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.020
translates this tradition
for us in this book.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.030
But really she's a heroine
among the Japanese, whom

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.660
like most rapidly
industrialized countries

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.170
are losing their
roots, their food

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.750
roots, their cultural
roots, and really

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.910
some incredibly delicious,
simple, and very helpful foods.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.760
So, she is on
television in Japan

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.370
teaching the Japanese about
their food traditions.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.910
It's this wonderful thing about
being the insider-outsider that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.450
makes some of us the
translators of traditions.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440
Because we see the outside,
and we see the inside.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.120
And she's taken that position.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.780
And she's been the
premier supporter

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.600
of the artisanal organic
movement in Japan

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.780
and is their spokesperson.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.934
Her book, "Japanese Farm
Food" won the IACP award--

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.850
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
No, it was nominated.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.840
Did not win, no.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.280
LIV WU: I wanted you to win.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.100
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: Sorry!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.410
LIV WU: International
Association--

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.280
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
The French translation

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370
is up for a Gourmand
of the world.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.060
It has won the Gourmand award.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.870
LIV WU: So highly regarded,
highly regarded book.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.060
I think it's a really
wonderful book.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.770
And Nancy, I leaf through
this, and there's really

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.030
almost no recipe with more
than five ingredients.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.739
And you look at--

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.779
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Farmers are busy people.

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.160
LIV WU: And you look at
the table of contents,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.640
and it's small bites, pickles,
soybeans, noodles and rice,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.450
vegetables, and seafood
is the last one.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.360
Not a sexy list.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.430
But this is real
food, good food.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.540
And incredibly
delicious food if it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.860
seasoned with the soy
sauces and the misos

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.600
that are made artisanally
and still contain

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.340
all the probiotics in them.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.940
So, she's really
the cook's cook.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.940
The cook's author
and also really

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.970
the author of Japanese cooking.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.920
The comeback of traditional
Japanese cooking.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.326
What made you do
this unsexy thing?

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:38.910
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: Well,
this is just the food we eat.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.190
My husband was the
Japanese cook in the house.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.490
And I did everything else,
because he's a great cook,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.540
and so why would I just
jump into the kitchen

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.670
when we're busy?

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.920
I mean, jump into the
kitchen and do his food.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800
And we are busy.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.810
We have small
businesses, and then we

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.580
started having children.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.130
But I always had in mind I
was going to write cookbooks.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.930
I thought first I was going
to do my food in Japan.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.700
And then also I had
the title of the book

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.840
was going to be "When
Japanese Men Cook."

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.270
Because this has
actually been sort

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.910
of a compilation of
his food and my food

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.810
and-- because I like
salads and things.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.232
But his approach to
food is really direct.

00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:23.440
He actually learned to cook
from his grandmother, not

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.340
his mother.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.305
And then later after college, he
went back to take over the farm

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:29.960
and work with his father.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.100
And he don't like the
way his mom cooked,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.450
and so he cooked
food every night.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.230
He didn't like sugar in the
food, and he didn't like MSG.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.530
And so he sort of
renewed the family food.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.110
But then I started-- my
friends, my blogging friends,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.650
David Lebovitz in
Paris, he said,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.550
if you live on a
Japanese farm, you

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.340
should write a book about
the 100 easiest Japanese food

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.840
recipes.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.825
And so I was like, OK, everyone
wants me to write this book,

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.000
so I'm going to write it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.210
And then it became
more and more my food.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.330
And I came to love it even
more, because it was my taste.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.970
It's the same food, but
like every cook has--

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.620
it's lighter than
my husband's food.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.220
There's less salt, less soy
sauce or miso, and more green.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.760
Because that's how I like to
eat, and I'm not a farmer.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.310
Anyway, that's the story.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.900
LIV WU: I find it's so out
there for you to-- it's

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.700
quite courageous,
it's unbelievable.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.690
But the food, when you taste it,
using the artisanal ingredients

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.310
that she uses, is absolutely,
stunningly delicious.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.340
It's crack an egg over rice,
pour soy sauce over it.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.687
Really simple things.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.270
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Well, there's

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.520
this idea that Japanese food
is so specific and so codified

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.070
and so hard to approach.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.550
But that's really not
how people eat every day.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.690
Now, truly people eat
convenience store food

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.390
commonly.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.240
That's a real big crisis.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.940
And rice consumption's way down.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.540
Tea, sake, all those
things are way down.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.800
The Western diet is on the
rise, which is a problem.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.490
60% of the people prefer
powdered dashi to making

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.020
their own with
katsuobushi kombu,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.090
which is like the most
no-brainer stock to make,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.740
and so--

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.200
LIV WU: Say what katsuobushi--

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.450
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Kombu and katsuobushi-- kombu

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.370
is kelp.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:55.957
And then katsuobushi is
simmered, smoked, dried bonito.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:56.540
Skipjack tuna.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.600
LIV WU: Skipjack
tuna that's dried.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.670
And it dries almost
to the consistency

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.770
of a piece of wood, and--

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.940
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Yeah, you inoculate it,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.910
I mean most of the katsuobushi
is actually not inoculated,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.140
it's the cheaper stuff that's--
but you inoculate it with some

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.812
spores and then it's dried
and fermented and dried

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:15.395
and fermented.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.505
LIV WU: Absolute umami,
absolute flavor, right.

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:21.130
It's wonderful.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.588
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: It's
a very, very, very easy stock

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:24.110
to make.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.843
It's not like making
stock from chicken bones,

00:07:25.843 --> 00:07:27.134
you know, it takes a few hours.

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:30.680
You can do it in 15
minutes, 16 minutes.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.870
So, ridiculous to use powdered.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.100
LIV WU: So, this is a lady
who is into mold and spores.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.860
At her house there
are jars of miso

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.310
being made, persimmon
vinegar in urns,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.700
soy sauce made from scratch.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.430
And she's totally into koji.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.904
You want to explain
what koji is?

00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:51.320
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Yeah, I'm

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.819
writing a book now
about preserving.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.400
As a community, people used
to make natto together.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.960
Not everybody, but there
were those communities

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.350
that were making natto together.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.360
It's really hard to make these
big projects all by yourself,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.930
because either you need
a really big family

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.150
or a local community.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.210
And so, I got involved with
a miso making community

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.490
through one of my friends.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.140
And he grows the soybeans.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.990
And he actually steams them
up and he makes the koji.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.705
And then another group
was making soy sauce,

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.350
and I jumped into that.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.210
Along the way, there's
this koji, koji, koji.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.980
This mysterious koji.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.880
And koji-- and I've been
researching it and going

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.420
to the koji maker, and the koji
spore maker and the koji maker.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.640
And the thing that's tricky is
that koji is the element that

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.540
makes fermentation
possible-- soy sauce amazake,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.680
all of the saucy su say
so's, except for salt.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:05.000
Miso, soy sauce, shochu-- all
of the Japanese key ingredients.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.200
Katsuobushi is
slightly different,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.750
but it's a koji relative.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.860
And it's actually the spores
that used to live in the air.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:21.520
And people would just capture
this wild spore fermentation.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.590
And they would make koji.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.590
So, koji is the
spore, and it's also--

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.630
confusingly also rice koji
is commonly called koji.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.850
But it's actually called
rice koji in Japanese.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.680
So, it's a little bit confusing.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.700
That was why I didn't
quite understand it.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.740
But there are these
spores that now it's

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.690
like a spore capturing
laboratory-- holds them in.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.695
So sake people will
buy the spores.

00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:50.070
Or the miso people will buy
the spores from their people,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.000
from their spore
producing place.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.670
But about five years ago,
this woman who had-- she's

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:05.240
like the seventh generation
of a koji producing shop.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.240
And they were actually
buying the spores

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.520
and they were
inoculating the rice.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.290
And then selling that inoculated
rice, which is kome-koji.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.840
She discovered in
an Edo period book--

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.070
so we're talking more than
200 years ago-- this reference

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.990
to shio koji zuke.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.870
So, there's this
huge boom in Japan

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.410
about using koji but
specifically shio-koji.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.650
It just means you take
this rice-koji, which

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.120
you can buy from South
River for instance,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.130
the miso place in Massachusetts.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.282
And you add some
water, add some salt.

00:10:44.282 --> 00:10:45.990
And every day you stir
it on your counter

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.530
for a week or 10 days.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.570
And then it's this incredible
fermentation agent,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.240
or it's good for meats, or
drizzle on the vegetables

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.487
or it's like a quick pickle.

00:10:57.487 --> 00:10:59.570
And so there's this huge
boom in Japan about this,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.028
just because of
this woman-- I just

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:03.520
went to visit her recently.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.540
So koji was a
completely dying kind

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:14.620
of culture only used by the
specific, specific sake makers

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.770
or soy sauce makers.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.340
And then now it's coming up.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.170
And it's coming to America too.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.950
I think you can find
if here and there.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.470
Some of it's larger companies.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.047
I don't know what's-- has
anybody ever bought it?

00:11:29.047 --> 00:11:30.130
I don't know what's in it.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.046
I haven't had a chance
to check the packaging.

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:35.170
But it should be
just-- the same thing.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.600
You can make the same
mixture with soy sauce.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.170
It's 300 grams of the
rice-koji to 200 cc of liquid.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.896
And if it's salt water, you're
going to put 50 grams of salt

00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:49.395
it.

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:53.630
But it's incredibly, incredibly,
delicious and easy to use.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.370
A little non-sequitur.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.670
LIV WU: Any reason-- common
universality between the West

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:08.160
rediscovering making sauerkraut,
making your kombucha,

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.170
making your own cheese-- why is
this mold culture coming back

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.930
to these--

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.555
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Well, this one

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:19.110
is because shio-koji-- the
salt koji or soy sauce koji,

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.750
shoyu-koji-- is so easy.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.800
It's not even
fermentation in some way.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.930
I mean it is fermentation, but
it's like the most no-brainer--

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.600
and it stays for a year
in your refrigerator.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.680
And so it's not
like sauerkraut, you

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.100
got to eat it really quickly.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.960
And pickles and
things like that.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.270
So, any old anybody can have
it in their refrigerator

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.350
for a year.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.830
And just like dollop
it on something,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.861
or you marinate some meat in
it for a day and it's-- So,

00:12:48.861 --> 00:12:52.360
it's the absolute
dead easiness of it.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.230
And it's also very healthy
for the flora in your body.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.730
But it's just she
discovered this really,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.235
really, really easy great thing.

00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:01.610
And so I think
that's what it is.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.730
Because not everybody
can make pickles.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.260
I am making a lot
of pickles more,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.810
because my next
book's about that.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:14.070
But realistically, I've got
a big, big wooden barrel

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:19.250
full of takuan-- daikon pickle--
and I left and I'm not sure

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.130
how it's going to
be when I come back

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.490
because it's going to warm up.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.495
I'm only gone for a couple
of weeks, but still.

00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:26.870
You got to deal
with all of this.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:32.355
LIV WU: What was it like
teaching the Japanese how to--

00:13:32.355 --> 00:13:33.980
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: I don't really

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.809
want to say-- I
don't like to say

00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:37.100
that I'm teaching the Japanese.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.010
I don't really-- I think
that through this-- I'm

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.660
filming with Fuji
Television-- it's

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.380
like going to the
katsuobushi guy

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.170
and they were really
excited about that segment.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.330
Going to his place
and what is so damn,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.630
cool about it and
it's so delicious

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.650
and this bowl of freshly
shaved katsuobushi

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.560
and dollop some miso
on some organic tea

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.790
and it's just so, so, so
easy and so, so, so great.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.760
And 60% of the people don't
use katsuobushi, and then

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:20.870
the other, like, 39.999%
don't use the good stuff.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.260
And so there's this
katsuobushi, and I shave it up.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.380
I'm really bad at it.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.540
My husband's really
good, of course.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.264
Sometimes I can get
it right and then

00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:32.180
I give it to the little
students in my school.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.790
And then I say, who
wants katsuobushi?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.670
Me!

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.170
Me!

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.170
And they're like, more!

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.360
More!

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.820
It's like you're
offering chocolate.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.270
So that is what I'm really
excited about saying.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.970
This is so great stuff.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.870
Why don't we just use it?

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:54.300
Or we're going to the vinegar
maker and, by the way, 99.9%,

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.366
or maybe it's 80% of that one.

00:14:56.366 --> 00:15:00.350
80%, 85% of the people
use this vinegar

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.050
that's on the supermarket shelf
that's made from ethyl alcohol.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.200
And a little bit of
rice, by the way.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.920
How delicious is that?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.760
I mean I don't want to eat,
drink, or eat ethyl alcohol.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.010
And so, these other vinegars
are actually made from sake.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.190
Like organic sake, and they've
been doing it for 140 years.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.360
So how cool is that?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.390
And it's just people don't know.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.030
So it's like saying,
hey, hey, hey!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.160
You've got all these cool,
great things in Japan,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.430
and there are 1,000
year old food traditions

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.980
that are being lost.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.787
It's gone down to
this many people

00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:38.870
are using the real stuff,
and that many people are

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.482
using the fake stuff.

00:15:42.482 --> 00:15:44.440
It's not about-- I mean,
you can make a choice.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.880
Like, if you want to buy the
cheaper one I don't care.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.050
But at least know what's in it.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.420
Like, if you go to buy a
big company's soy sauce

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.430
that's made from the
refuse from making

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.417
oil instead of real
soybeans, or you're

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:01.875
going to buy the
one with soybeans.

00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:04.690
You know, I'd rather have
soybeans in my soy sauce.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.120
But make the choice
with some knowledge.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.880
But most people don't even know.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.890
They just think, really?

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.990
That's what it's made from?

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.400
No idea.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.070
LIV WU: You referenced
your school.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.410
Just describe that for us.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.910
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: I have
a little immersion preschool

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.080
that I sort of modeled
after Peninsula School

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.384
in unincorporated Menlo Park.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.550
I grew up near there and
it's kind of like a little-

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.680
it was in the day, I grew up in
the '60s-- like a free school.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.520
It's still sort
of a free school.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.195
I used to visit there
with my students.

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:42.550
And they cook for them, do
a lot of art and science,

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.854
like really hands-on stuff.

00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:46.354
And they play
outside, and there are

00:16:46.354 --> 00:16:49.290
tree houses and trees to climb.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.930
And they're little preschoolers.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.050
They start at two to
six, and then there's

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.150
elementary school kids.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:17:00.200
And they speak only English.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.280
LIV WU: So you started
it in your town?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.988
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
In my old house.

00:17:03.988 --> 00:17:05.670
Yeah, we moved out,
and we renovated

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.210
my parents in-law's farmhouse.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.200
And since it seemed
wasteful that I

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.403
had a little English
school and it just

00:17:12.403 --> 00:17:14.569
seemed to make more sense
to have kids come everyday

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.210
and actually learn English,
rather than forgetting it

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.349
every week and coming
back to relearn, "do you

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:22.380
like," "can you,"
you know, those--

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.209
But the kids are really,
really, really into food.

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:26.750
And so every day
when they come in it

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.630
was like, "What's for
lunch today, Nancy?"

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.190
They're totally,
totally darling.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.370
About that.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.110
LIV WU: Most of us here
love Japanese food,

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.910
love to go to
Japanese restaurants,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.390
or even maybe make
some of it at home.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.350
How do we do what you're
saying we should do?

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.090
And how do we reproduce this?

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.298
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: I
think that the first thing

00:17:48.298 --> 00:17:53.250
is that you have to have
good building blocks.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.730
So, I think the best
sourcing for Japanese food

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.690
is macrobiotic sites.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.960
I use a place called Goldmine.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.910
This nama shoyu that you can
buy at high end supermarkets

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.500
is our local soy
sauce, actually.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.100
I know the people.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.540
There's some in the
back that you can taste.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.300
The misos, unfortunately, are
a little bit oxidized here.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.920
So they're darker
than-- that's why

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.810
I brought some Japanese miso.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.466
LIV WU: She's the ultimate mom
and the ultimate farmer's life.

00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:23.675
She brought us miso to taste.

00:18:23.675 --> 00:18:25.215
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: I would have

00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:26.950
brought more if I'd had time.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.840
My suitcases were heavy.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.870
One was full of food.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.890
LIV WU: So please,
please taste them.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.520
You'll be amazed
at the difference

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.629
between the commercial--

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:36.920
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: And
our friends grow for them,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.090
and it's organic.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.980
So, I think that
getting good soy sauce,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.780
good miso, good salt-- I
think that the Trapani salt is

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.220
a good substitute for-- I
use Noto salt from Japan.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.750
Trapani salt is really similar.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.730
And it's clear, kind of briny.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.840
And then good fish,
good vegetables.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.780
I mean the easiest thing is
like this steamed and sake fish.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.040
You can't overcook it.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.320
And the vegetables,
the vegetables,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.870
go to the farmer's market,
fish market, and you're done.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.140
But I wouldn't
start with-- I can't

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.240
say the name of the
company-- I wouldn't start

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.610
with large company
type of ingredients.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:22.420
Because like the vinegars will
be way, way, way too vinegary.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.020
And the soy sauce won't have
that taste that you need.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.670
LIV WU: The soy sauce
back there is amazing.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.730
It's made by artisanal methods.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.500
It's live, organic--

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.140
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: And you saw it.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.180
LIV WU: --Not pasteurized.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.700
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Two years in the barrel.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.241
LIV WU: Yeah.

00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:40.800
And it's really wonderful.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.730
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
So, the interesting thing

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.700
is since I've been making my
own soy sauce with my friends--

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.230
and I have a barrel at my house.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:52.190
They're fermenting it in poly
barrels, polyurethane I think.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.530
Is that the word?

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.167
When you make it at
home it's a lot thinner

00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:58.250
than commercial soy sauce.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.490
Even this.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.730
And so I think that as time
went on-- in farm families

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.774
you just put soy sauce
on the vegetables.

00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:07.190
Like, if you boil
some vegetables,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.410
you put some soy sauce
on and katsuobushi.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.680
Sometimes dashi to thin it out.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.180
But I think the
town people do more

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.440
of adding the stock to--
the dashi to the soy sauce

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.030
because it was too overpowering.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.740
Because it's commercial.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.020
That's my new theory.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.850
LIV WU: And dashi is stock.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:35.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES] What's
a meal we can make out

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.470
of some recipes in this book?

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.261
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Well, like I said,

00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:43.230
I think that the easiest
things are the steamed fishes.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.902
I'm partial to raw fish, but you
have to be careful and get it--

00:20:47.902 --> 00:20:50.110
you have to ask the fishmonger
if you can eat it raw.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:58.890
Not necessarily eaten
raw-- you put kombu on it

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.560
and a little salt to suck
out some of the moisture.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.920
Or salt and vinegar.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.730
There's various treatments,
it's pretty common.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.130
And nabe, the hot spot.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.750
Hot pot is really a misnomer.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.710
It used to be called
"one pot," and then

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.860
it changed vogue to be hot pot.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.440
But really nabe is such
an easy word to say.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.360
I'm trying to get that
into the vernacular.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.100
But nabes are--
you just put a pot

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.650
with some kombu and some water.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.950
And then you start adding
vegetables and tofu

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.376
if you have it and some sort of
protein if you're into protein.

00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:40.250
LIV WU: It's kind of
a-- [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.930
fondue pot.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.130
Do your kids, do your
sons eat dad's food

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.717
more or mom's food more?

00:21:52.717 --> 00:21:54.175
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Well, they

00:21:54.175 --> 00:21:57.580
eat whatever is on the
table, I'll tell you that.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:03.780
Recently, they're 22, 19, 17
so they like more hearty food.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.560
And so they like
my Mexican food,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:12.590
but then they like his
curry rice, whatever.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.870
And they all cook, but if
you gave them their druthers

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.990
they'd have me or
my husband cook.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.900
They all worked at Soba
restaurant, a friend's place

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.350
when they were 13 to 16.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.840
We home-schooled.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.820
LIV WU: And I take it
you eat with the seasons,

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.300
if you're eating on the farm.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.925
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:36.300
LIV WU: What's the
most nostalgic season?

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.340
What's the most
abundant season for you?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.932
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: Summer.

00:22:40.932 --> 00:22:42.640
LIV WU: And what are
you harvesting then?

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.389
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Summer-- tomatoes

00:22:44.389 --> 00:22:46.810
don't grow so well
because of the humidity.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.380
But we have tomatoes,
cherry tomatoes do better.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.590
Tomatoes and peppers and
hot peppers and eggplant,

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.090
cucumbers.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.910
Lettuce doesn't grow
well in the summer.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.160
Neither does cilantro, so
that's sort of spring stuff.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.920
And then we also
buy from friends.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.486
Because we have
parties or need more.

00:23:13.486 --> 00:23:14.860
And that's also
the busiest time,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.940
because the weeds grow
about a foot a day.

00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:21.990
Maybe it's a foot a week.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.880
LIV WU: I guess we're not going
to see those beautiful slides,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.000
but tell us about some of them.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.340
As if they were up there.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.490
Are the slides about
making soy sauce?

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:37.940
What are important images for
us to look for in the book?

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.690
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Oh, in the book--

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.820
because soy sauce is after,
soy sauce is for the next book.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.230
In the book what I
tried to portray,

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:51.520
or what I wanted to write
about, what that Japan is not

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.840
this inaccessible, mysterious,
hard to understand place.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.540
That the relationships are
very direct and normal.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.830
And you can hug
somebody if you want.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.340
And Japanese people are
just the same as you and I.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:13.950
And that it was just
this place full of-- I'm

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.570
really into antiques
and farm stuff.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.929
So it's just this place with so
much-- there's so much fabric.

00:24:20.929 --> 00:24:22.470
I mean, not just
this kind of fabric,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:27.190
it's the fabric of
life-- of farm life--

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:31.297
is so rich and
interesting and direct.

00:24:31.297 --> 00:24:34.700
And it's not a way
of life that will---

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.450
Foreigners or Tokyoites are
kind of in the same boat.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.620
They don't really know
much about this life.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.260
And I have a lot of Tokyo
people come out for filming

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.800
or whatever.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.790
And it's like the
first time maybe

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.110
they've been in a farmhouse.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.310
LIV WU: So the revival
is happening in Japan.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.670
People are rediscovering
authentic, traditional cuisine?

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.420
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Yeah, some people

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.990
are going back to
the-- and leaving.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.480
I forget what they
call it, U-turn or no--

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.060
there's all these
words, these slogans.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.190
But people are leaving
the city to come back.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.650
Not in droves, but
come to mountain towns

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.130
and have a little bit
better way of life.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.472
Less money, but maybe better
place to raise up your kids.

00:25:28.472 --> 00:25:29.930
What's happening
actually in Japan,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.590
which is more interesting is
that the Japanese government

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.140
is working to brand Japan.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.700
And so there's a
lot of-- and so it's

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.570
going to be a really
good time to go visit

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.540
Japan in the next
couple of years

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.490
because they're
identifying local areas--

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.013
and I'm involved in
several projects with this.

00:25:50.013 --> 00:25:54.230
They're disseminating
money for projects

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:59.800
to identify local areas that
have cool things happening.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.730
And like food, or
artisanal, arts,

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.490
crafts, all sorts of things.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.860
It's not just about food.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.100
And it will be
something like, do they

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.730
want to send that stuff
abroad or to Tokyo?

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.880
Or they want to get people
to come to visit that area.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.760
And also because
of the-- and that's

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.960
one arm-- but another thing has
changed in Japan the last 10

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.260
years.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.440
10 years ago, people did not
have computers in their house.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440
Did not.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.950
And so from 10 years
ago, people started

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.370
having-- I mean
they had phones that

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.180
worked on the internet
sooner than they

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.840
had computers in their house.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.500
And so nowadays, I'd say
most people have computers.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.560
But not everybody.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.046
Like my friend--
restaurant friend--

00:26:52.046 --> 00:26:53.920
he doesn't have a website
and he doesn't even

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.836
know how to use email.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.520
The farmers-- again, not all,
but somebody in their family

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.540
is going to know how
to use the computer,

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.670
and somehow they can Google it
and they can find this place.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.810
And so all of a sudden now,
all those outlying areas

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.780
are connected somehow
with internet access.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.730
Like, even if they don't have
a page you can Google them

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.689
and you can find somebody's
written about them.

00:27:26.689 --> 00:27:29.229
And then there's a phone number
there, and you can call them.

00:27:29.229 --> 00:27:30.550
And you can order their stuff.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.120
Or you can go visit them.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.770
So that's what's really changed.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.090
That's something I
really-- So, that's why

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.500
I like-- somebody was talking
about the market in San

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.670
Francisco, Nijiya.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.740
They're finding more artisanal
products, food products,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.620
in Japan that used to
be just so remote you

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.010
couldn't find their information.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:58.520
So now they can find them
and get them and actually

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.710
get them on the shelves here.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.960
And same thing in Japan,
because we have this delivery

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.270
system that you could
order something,

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.600
send it off 6 o'clock
one night, and you

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.810
can get it the next morning,
because it goes all night.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:18.050
So I was kind of pessimistic
at the end of this book.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.870
But I'm very optimistic now.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.212
It's changing.

00:28:22.212 --> 00:28:23.040
LIV WU: Great.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.700
And the reception in
the West to this book

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.860
has been unbelievable.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.070
Did you expect that?

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.090
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Um, I guess I hoped.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.640
I thought it would.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.872
The publishers
did not expect it.

00:28:37.872 --> 00:28:38.830
LIV WU: It's beautiful.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.060
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: But
the one thing I did not expect

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.830
was how much the book spoke
to Japanese-Americans.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.811
I had not anticipated that.

00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:51.060
I have people come up to me
and say that I bought five

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.060
for my family, and this
was how our family used

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.400
to live before my family
came in the teens,

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.830
and we've lost all
these food traditions

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.730
because there was no
history of writing down

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.310
recipes in Japanese families.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:12.430
So that has been maybe
the most impactful for me.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.360
But it also has had a
big effect on Japanese.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.110
It's just it's a
difficult book to publish

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:21.102
in Japan, because cookbooks
are like $10 throwaways.

00:29:21.102 --> 00:29:23.880
It's unheard of to
have a book like that.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.540
So, we'll see.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.940
It's been published in French.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.761
Maybe Dutch.

00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:30.760
LIV WU: Congratulations.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.800
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Thank you.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.383
LIV WU: Anything
else you want to add?

00:29:33.383 --> 00:29:36.145
And then I'm going to throw
it to the floor for questions.

00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:37.770
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: The only thing

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:43.560
is that I really
can't emphasize enough

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.160
how I would recommend
sourcing the ingredients

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.560
from macrobiotic sites.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.640
Because I visited a bunch of the
supermarkets in the area and I

00:29:53.640 --> 00:30:01.940
found that the amount of
good ingredients was so slim.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:08.150
And so much of the
ingredients have MSG in it.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.600
And all of the preferred
pickles are all full of MSG,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.430
as they are in Japan.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.120
So if you don't mind
MSG that's fine.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.675
But it speaks to lack
of flavor otherwise.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.480
And salt pickles and things
like that are so easy to make.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.755
Or soy sauce.

00:30:27.755 --> 00:30:29.270
LIV WU: And I will
add a question

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.190
on to that, which is
there's this American love

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.010
affair with sushi and sashimi,
which is where you began.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.704
How do you nudge
yourself off that?

00:30:37.704 --> 00:30:39.120
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: The thing

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.370
is, though, I have to say
that sushi is a culture.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:49.550
And so, it's actually like
a rich man's drinking spot.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:55.570
And nowadays, most people have
never been to a real sushiya.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:02.280
And we have sushi-- we do
handheld sushi dinners at home,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.300
getting fish from
the fish market.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.250
But the whole feeling of going
to a really good sushi shop

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.120
and having the master who
spent years and years and years

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.420
and years learning
his craft-- I'm

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.870
friends with Jiro-san's
editor, and so I've

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.670
had the opportunity of
coming four times, which

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.230
is very lucky, never paying.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:30.880
And just that experience of
being in that-- it's not just

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.650
the food, it's the whole thing.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.450
And that's why I went to Japan.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.569
It's that feeling of sitting
down that's like (EXHALES).

00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:39.110
And then you get
this beautiful food.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.370
It's not just about sushi
in the round for me.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:45.520
So it's a really complicated
type of relationship.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.900
But it's also--
real sushi in Japan

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.722
is very expensive--
can be very expensive.

00:31:50.722 --> 00:31:52.180
LIV WU: Somebody
at our lunch table

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:58.010
was saying her grandmother
used to tell her mother

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.990
ikura-- salmon roe--
is bad for you.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.365
And later on she learned it
was because it was expensive.

00:32:03.365 --> 00:32:05.115
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
It's because it's

00:32:05.115 --> 00:32:07.367
really hard to get
it out of the sacs.

00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:07.950
It takes time.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.908
LIV WU: She told her kid
there was bad for them

00:32:09.908 --> 00:32:13.860
so she wouldn't have
to buy it for them.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.550
So, with that, are you
OK if we open it up

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.030
to questions from the floor?

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.430
I think we'd probably get
more interesting discussion.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.440
AUDIENCE: You briefly
mentioned about koji.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.730
It keeps for one year.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.540
What happens after one year.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.370
And then, you know,
do you discard it,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.867
or do you keep adding to it?

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.700
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.340
It's not koji.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.180
Shio koji or shoyu koji.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.680
OK?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:51.320
So, you could probably
use it for marinating

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.160
meat or something.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.430
But I don't know the
scientific part of it,

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.970
so I can find out from my pal.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:03.800
But after a year it's probably
going to lose its fermentation

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.229
properties or some of the--

00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:06.770
AUDIENCE: If it does
ferment anymore,

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.590
that means the food is
going to start going bad.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.120
If it doesn't
ferment anymore, that

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.370
means the food is going to
start going bad at that point.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:15.740
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Oh, I wouldn't

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.531
say it's going to go
bad, because you still

00:33:17.531 --> 00:33:18.780
have salt or soy sauce in it.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.290
Because salt alone or
soy sauce alone is-- it's

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.650
not like you leave them on.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.620
Meat's the only thing
that you marinate

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:29.180
for more than-- I mean a
vegetable is like 10 minutes.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.790
Like for zucchini, half
an hour or something.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.250
It's not a really long-- we're
not talking long ferments.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.930
It's a quick pickling thing.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.710
Or for me it's
like if you salt it

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.310
or if you soak it in soy sauce.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.760
If you do it for half a
day, it takes up more.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.690
But as it soaks it has
more tenderizing properties

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.010
and more healthful properties.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.964
You don't add to
it because you're

00:33:55.964 --> 00:33:58.760
going to use it more than
a year, that's for sure.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.080
AUDIENCE: Because I was
associating with miso.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.640
And miso has koji in it.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.131
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Yeah, but miso never goes bad.

00:34:05.131 --> 00:34:06.630
AUDIENCE: But then
white miso is not

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.760
suppose to keep as long
as it-- white miso?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.949
Doesn't keep as long as
the other kind of miso.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.270
So I was wondering why.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.833
And then I do have
some miso in the fridge

00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:17.124
that I brought back from Japan.

00:34:17.124 --> 00:34:19.339
I was wondering if I
should throw it away.

00:34:19.339 --> 00:34:21.300
I heard that I can freeze it.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.720
But then if you freeze
it, what happens to koji?

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.969
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: The
koji dies in the freezer.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.159
There's no more good
qualities for koji.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.590
It doesn't mean it's bad.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:40.330
But the white miso
shouldn't go bad.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.880
I mean, white miso
is white because it

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.810
has a lot more
koji in it, and it

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.030
has a really short
fermentation period.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.429
So it can be done
really quickly,

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:51.650
because it's a higher
concentration of koji

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.284
to soybeans.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.370
But miso will never go bad.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.420
I'm not sure about--
depends on the miso.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.556
The white miso, I don't use it.

00:35:03.556 --> 00:35:09.410
It just gets darker, or you
scrape off the darkened place.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.020
But I'm not American.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.126
We keep things.

00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:14.500
My husband makes me sift the
flour and take the bugs out,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.444
so you know.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.820
I was horrified,
but you know-- more

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.290
horrified about him getting mad.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.460
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of illegal activities.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.340
In Japan it's illegal
to brew anything

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.710
with more than 1% alcohol.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.150
And are there things that
you can create in the States

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.630
because we don't have that law?

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.630
Any traditional foods that
involve some amount of alcohol

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.000
that you can't create in Japan?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.340
And where did you get
the brewer's yeast?

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.180
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Brewer's yeast.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.220
Oh, not brewer's yeast.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.320
You mean koji?

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.820
AUDIENCE: No, because
first you have

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.084
to convert it to
sugar with koji,

00:35:49.084 --> 00:35:51.500
and then ferment it to alcohol
with brewer's yeast, right?

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.054
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:54.054 --> 00:35:55.220
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: No.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.180
I only know from-- well I
visited the vinegar people

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.060
making sake.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.750
There's no brewer's
yeast in sake.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:10.224
But they don't add yeast--
let me find out from the book.

00:36:10.224 --> 00:36:10.890
I have a minute.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.806
But my husband makes doboroku.

00:36:13.806 --> 00:36:15.180
That's what you're
talking about.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.380
And that's koji
plus rice and water.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.840
And I am going to put
it in the next book.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.110
But basically, I think
you can find that recipe.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.700
And you half steam the rice.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.170
You can't cook it all the way.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:37.810
And then all the rice has to
cool down before you add koji.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.747
And you want a pot.

00:36:40.747 --> 00:36:43.080
AUDIENCE: That would be a fun
thing to put in your book,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.200
then.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.000
You could put a
disclaimer, you can only

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.974
make this outside of Japan.

00:36:46.974 --> 00:36:48.390
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: I know, I

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.760
have to be careful
when I talk on TV too.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.450
I mentioned it in
the last book too.

00:36:57.104 --> 00:36:58.520
AUDIENCE: I've
always been curious

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.950
about the possibility
of making miso at home,

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.770
and I was wondering
if you could comment

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.120
on the ease or difficulty
of what's involved.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.620
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Super easy.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.500
Really, really easy.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.700
I mean actually, this woman,
the koji lady, she-- Hi Claire.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.140
I didn't see you.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.740
--she made miso.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.310
It wasn't fermented at
all, but she made miso

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:26.600
on the studio set with
a pressure cooker.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:31.770
We steam the soybeans, you
know, with a pressure cooker.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.690
And then she added
the koji and salt.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:39.640
And basically, it's a
super simple operation.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.790
And the Shurtleff's
book, "The Book of Miso,"

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.750
it's really long.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.155
I mean it's really good thing.

00:37:47.155 --> 00:37:49.030
I felt like it was a
little bit intimidating,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.080
but I only leafed through it.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.080
But doing it, it's
basically steamed soybeans

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.110
that you smash up.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.310
I grind them.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.910
Some people have a
grinding machine.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.790
And then you add in salt.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.750
You can make the rice koji from
the great South River people.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:17.310
And then a little
bit of miso that's

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:22.100
been softened with water, like
a really super, super, thin miso

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.720
soup as a inoculation.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.490
And then you just
pack it in a pot

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:30.822
and as the summer
goes hotter you

00:38:30.822 --> 00:38:32.030
stir it every once in awhile.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.989
But really, it's
as simple as that.

00:38:33.989 --> 00:38:35.780
So that's why I'm trying
to get my book out

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.654
by February at least.

00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:39.156
So people still make it.

00:38:39.156 --> 00:38:41.780
AUDIENCE: I was also wondering--
today is the third anniversary

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.090
of the typhoon and Fukushima--
if you had any thoughts on food

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.080
safety, concerns--

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.580
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Food safety

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.760
I would not worry about
because, I mean especially

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.290
if you live here, because the
Japanese government does not

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.470
want to have any trouble
with the US government.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:05.040
And in fact, they told
the outlying governments

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.610
a lot sooner than they
told their own people

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.700
that there was a big emission.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.850
As for the nuclear
situation, nothing's changed

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.750
and there's massive,
massive, massive amounts

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.830
of water-- nuclear
waste water-- that's

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.170
going into the groundwater
into the Pacific Ocean.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.940
And they're no closer
to finding a-- I mean,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.530
I don't know if a
solution exists,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.780
but it's pretty horrible.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.150
And we just--
we're fairly close.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.740
167 miles.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.202
I think they'll just keep
flushing it for an eternity.

00:39:43.202 --> 00:39:44.910
I can't imagine what
they're going to do.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.850
The news people
talk about that too.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.675
They're just like, oh yeah.

00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:50.800
What's the point of talking
about it kind of thing.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.420
But food, there's
another ocean over there.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.250
The Japanese Sea is
where we get our fish.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.950
It's really a sad
situation, heartbreaking.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:02.690
AUDIENCE: Because I
think a lot of them

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.190
are grown in
hydroponic conditions--

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.870
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Yeah, that's a big thing now.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.661
AUDIENCE: So they are very
pretty, and they're very sweet.

00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:09.160
They just don't
have depth of flavor

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.940
that we have here in
the States, actually.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.360
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Tokyo has bad vegetables.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.693
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I found the
vegetables better in the US.

00:40:14.693 --> 00:40:16.280
Even though they
don't look as nice.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.090
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: I think
the chef's really concentrate

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.130
on-- they're very
good about fish.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.410
So you can get good fish
pretty much anywhere,

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.680
but it's really hard for
me to eat in Tokyo now,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.840
because I'm really
into vegetables,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.962
and it's like a
zero on the plate.

00:40:29.962 --> 00:40:30.850
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.826
How difficult is the soy sauce
process, or making soy sauce?

00:40:33.826 --> 00:40:35.534
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Yeah, soy sauce.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.740
We so far have a small
soy sauce place in Nagano

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.090
who takes my friend
who grows the beans,

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:51.290
and he grows the wheat.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:57.169
And then they inoculate it
with-- they put the koji in,

00:40:57.169 --> 00:40:59.210
and then we rush up with
air, we put the salt on.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:05.810
But basically, you mix
in steamed soybeans

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.460
with wheat that's been
inoculated with koji,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.940
and you add salt and water.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:18.870
And you stick it in a
barrel of some kind,

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.850
and let it sit for
a year to two years.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:24.940
I'm making fish sauce now.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.440
We'll see.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.270
It will take a year and a half.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.630
Put the salt-- 17%
salt-- with mashed up,

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.930
chopped up fish in a pot.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.800
Wait a year and a half.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.430
We'll see.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.930
That Japanese fish sauce, you
should start looking for that.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.090
It's really hard to find here,
but it is really, really,

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:44.960
really good.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.310
You tasted some at
my house, right?

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:51.770
I have some macro fish sauce
from the Stubborn Mother

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.030
in the Wajima market.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.950
No label, it's a
[? pet ?] bottle.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:59.320
And it is just so good.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.610
But she puts not just
guts and heads in.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.290
She puts in the meat
of the fish too.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:09.060
Helps it be sweeter.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.260
But it kicks ass on
all other fish sauces.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.670
Totally.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.360
LIV WU: Yes, Peter.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.776
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU: Um,
there's three names actually.

00:42:17.776 --> 00:42:21.000
The northern place,
Akita, calls it Shottsuru,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.570
and it's usually
made from sandfish

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.790
or sometimes squid or sardines.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:31.510
And then the
Ishikawa prefecture,

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.290
which is where the
Noto Peninsula is,

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.050
they call it Ishiri or Ishiru.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.470
And they have-- I mean, the
whole culture down there

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.470
is all about that.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.730
And that's what really
was fascinating for me.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.980
My husband had used it before.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.280
I always had it at home,
and I used it sometimes.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.738
And I put a little
bit in the book.

00:42:50.738 --> 00:42:53.510
But once I went to the
maker, and I talked to them,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.360
and all these different
ways to use it.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.600
They call it [? kakshaji, ?]
just a little

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.780
bit it of hidden taste.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.770
So I put it in, just choo.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.030
You don't want to
taste it so much.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.390
It's really good with
like a thin pickly thing.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:11.090
And I put it in
Western daubes or stew.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:17.180
Or I put it in fried rice,
just choo, a little bit.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.390
LIV WU: The secret umami hit.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.420
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
So it's a hidden taste.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.320
All these areas are big
on the hidden taste.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.944
Like, Katsubishi area, they
put katsuobushi on everything.

00:43:27.944 --> 00:43:28.860
It's not hidden taste.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.550
It's like every single thing.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.990
They put it on the raw
egg on rice and soy sauce,

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.750
katsuobushi too.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:40.240
The vinegar people, they
put it in everything.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.186
Just as a choo.

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.810
LIV WU: So I'm coming
to the conclusion

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:49.730
that one of the foundational
secrets of cooking

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:53.820
and controlling flavor is
dealing with fermentation.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.430
Or, if you want to
put it another way,

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.310
is controlling rot.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.980
And that really is.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.730
NANCY SINGLETON HACHISU:
Sandor Katz said,

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.510
don't be afraid of the mold.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.486
So sometimes with my pickles I
got something going on on them,

00:44:06.486 --> 00:44:08.410
and I just take it off.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.990
Same thing when I do
sauerkraut-- and also,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.890
not being afraid of
getting rid of the plastic.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.650
So I always made my
sauerkraut in a plastic bag.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.860
We have pickling bags, they're
food-grade pickling bags.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.830
But I'm moving on
to all of my-- I

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.770
have this cabbage ready
to go before I left,

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.020
and I didn't have time to do
it, so I stick it in the fridge.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:29.715
Hopefully, I can try it.

00:44:29.715 --> 00:44:31.450
But I'm going to try the
sauerkraut without the pickling

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.020
bag.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.000
But just put it in
a wooden barrel,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.400
and put some muslin on top.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.430
And I think the
plastic promotes mold.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.165
I'm very unscientific
about my pickling.

00:44:47.955 --> 00:44:49.810
AUDIENCE: What's the
deal about natto?

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.268
NANCY SINGLETON
HACHISU: Oh, natto?

00:44:51.268 --> 00:44:52.780
Good natto is really good.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.880
I've made it-- I
had an experiment,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:03.040
and I made it-- natto naturally
ferments in the rice straw.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.490
And I tried it
within the rice straw

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:12.120
or inoculating it with the
natto-kin, the natto powder

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:12.630
spores.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:18.310
Or you can take some natto
slime and add some warm water

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.970
and harvest.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.620
So, I got it from the Yamaki--
my people, got some very natto

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.682
and I made a little solution,
inoculated the beans with that.

00:45:28.682 --> 00:45:30.140
They all tasted
good, but the thing

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:33.930
is I should have been
more scientific about it.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.440
I should have put it in a
controlled heat environment.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.010
It was a very cool few
days in the summer.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.960
And so I decided I'd
put it in the car.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.060
And then one day I
woke up in the morning.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.490
It was like the heat
arc had gone way up.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.400
But it was delicious.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.230
The best one was the
one in the straw.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.340
They weren't slimy,
but they tasted good.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.350
And so, I still have
to get back into it.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.475
But there's a method where
you put it in a big hole

00:45:58.475 --> 00:46:01.214
in the ground and
you put it in straw

00:46:01.214 --> 00:46:03.630
in a big hole in the ground,
and you pour hot water on it.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.796
Then you pack it with earth.

00:46:04.796 --> 00:46:06.230
I'm going to do that next.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:09.340
My friend described it.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.770
Yeah, good natto is really good.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.020
But it should be good natto.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.590
Can't find good natto very
much in Japan anymore.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.230
It's all-- none of it's
organic, except for our friends.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.500
Not much of it.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.260
LIV WU: So, please
taste the misos
