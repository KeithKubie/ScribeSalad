00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.468
- Chris is rockin'
some cool kicks.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.636
- That is interesting
that I do have cool shoes.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.238
- It's good, that
is interesting.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.472
Yeah, that's a good ending.
- I think that's probably

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.306
a really good place
to leave the season.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.240
(funky electronic music)

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.510
- Hey everybody, welcome
to The Other Show.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.444
I'm Sarah.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.311
- And I'm Chris.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.780
- And we're here
talking about the finale

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.616
of The Other Two with
Case, Helene, and Drew.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.583
Hi you guys.
- Whoo!

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.118
- Hello!
(clapping)

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.319
- [Chris] The season's over.
- [Sarah] We made it.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:21.521
- The season's over.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.722
- A whole season,
I can't believe it.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.590
- You said this was
gonna be more subtle!

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.192
- I did, and it is!

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.728
- He is wearing a literal
birdcage full of birds.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.396
- But not real birds!

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.365
- It was actually really
fun to come to work

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.100
and see what you were gonna
be wearing every episode.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.368
- Yeah, you were like,
"I'm excited for it."

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.070
- 'Cause you had some
amazing wardrobe.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.071
- Yeah, it was cool.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.806
A couple days before we
did all the costumes,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.808
they bring all the
costumes to my house

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.742
and I tried 'em all on.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.210
And I'm like, "Okay."

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.611
- Yeah, Jill Bream
did the costumes.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.747
And is incredible, and
does costumes at SNL, too.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.382
And then sometimes she
would show us something,

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.217
and we were like, "I
don't know what..."

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.418
And she was like, "Trust me,

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.753
"when it's on him,
it'll be correct."

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.221
And it always was.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.689
- My favorite was
the Versace look,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:57.890
with all the gold chains.
- Oh, yeah!

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.126
- Episode eight, and like the
crazy jacket on the plane.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.227
- At the club, yeah, yeah.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.762
The birdcage outfit
was funny, too.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.197
I didn't know what
to expect for that.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.864
They were like, "You're
gonna wear a birdcage."

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.466
And I'm like, "What?!"

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.502
- And now, performing live
for the first time ever,

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.105
give it up for Chase Dreams.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.241
- Whoever does that
VMA VO is like--

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.442
- The actual--

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.777
- Yeah, the woman
who does the...

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.744
- Yeah, it's like--
- The actual woman did it?

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:19.445
- It's like, "And now..."

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:23.116
Was so good, it feels very real.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.584
- Yeah, she was great.
- Yeah, we did it with her,

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.385
and she did a couple, and
she was like, "Any notes?"

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.653
And we were like, "No,
that's what it is!"

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:28.754
- [Case, Helene,
Drew, Sarah] Yeah!

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:32.525
♪ Dancin' 'til we stink 

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.527
♪ Ain't a party 'til you reek 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.798
♪ So dance until you stink 

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.801
- This episode was
Chase's big performance.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.202
- Yep, yep.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.403
- We went to the
studio with Case,

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.806
and recorded that song,
and then tweaked it.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.407
- Yep, and then we
tweaked it a little bit.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.642
(Sarah and Case laughing)

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:50.643
- I know it was very
weird to be like,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.413
"We need you to sound
bad, but not comedy bad.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.615
"Believable bad."

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.549
So you had to--
- Yeah, can't be like

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:57.917
a goofy bad, it can't be like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.285
it's obvious you're
missing notes.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:00.553
It has to be natural,
a little bit.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.521
- Yeah, so we had to record it,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.189
and have you kind of miss notes.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:03.823
- Yeah, kinda miss notes.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:05.024
- And then try some

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.359
where you'd sing it well,
- [Case] Push it a little bit.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.326
- And then we would mess it up.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.261
- [Case] Yep.
- [Sarah] Yeah.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.228
- Was that bizarre to do?

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.496
- It was, when I went in there,

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:11.831
I didn't really
know what to expect.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.332
But I was like,
"Okay, I kinda..."

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:16.202
'Cause I've seen
people in real life,

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.503
you know, mess up
on awards shows.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:18.437
- [Sarah, Chris] Yeah.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.839
And it's like, it's still good,

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.474
but it's like, "Nah,
that wasn't right."

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.709
It wasn't, in my opinion
when I was in there,

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.378
I was like, "Oh, it's
not that hard to do."

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.846
But it was weird to do.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.414
It wasn't hard, it was
just weird, you know?

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:29.815
- Yeah, we wanted it to be just,

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.552
almost imperceptibly off.
- Subtle.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.554
I feel like if Chris or
I performed on a show.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.589
(Case, Helene laughing)
- No way, I'd be way worse!

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:37.924
- Are you kidding?

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:38.891
- You could do it.
I don't even have anything

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:39.825
to start with.
(Sarah laughing)

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:40.693
- What is Twitter saying?

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:41.527
- Um, that we're (beep).

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.895
Every Tweet is bad.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:45.231
The Burger King account is,
like, ripping him apart.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.632
- My son is a good singer, okay?

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.201
He just doesn't have
an ear for music.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.435
So what?!

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:50.903
- Have either of you
guys biffed it so hard

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:51.971
live, or anything?
(Sarah laughing)

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.372
- I have.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.575
I did Wicked on the
road, and a couple times

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.211
went up on my line in
front of barn houses

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.445
with like 4,000 people.
- Well that's especially crazy

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:00.713
because then you've done
that show 1,000 times,

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.681
and you're like, "How
can I randomly..."

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.749
- Well, if you've done
a show 1,000 times,

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.252
you start to like,
while you're doing it,

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.221
your brain can go so
many different places.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:08.988
- [Chris] Yeah.
- 'Cause you've said

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:10.790
those words so many times

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.225
that you're thinking
about something else,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:12.926
and then you're
like, "Oh my God,

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.493
"I forgot about Helene on Earth.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.462
"She needs to remember what's
coming out of her face."

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:17.663
- [Sarah] Whoa, that's trippy.

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:18.631
- And then if you
start to be like,

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:19.599
"I've done this so many times,

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.000
"I wonder what would
happen if I forgot it.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.368
"What would happen
if I forgot it?

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.336
"What would happen
if I forgot it?"

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.503
And then you're like, gah!

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:27.373
- I haven't really
acted since college,

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.008
like every gay person.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.409
(Sarah chuckling)
But I still have dreams

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.677
to this day of like,
going up on a line.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.812
Have you biffed it hard?

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.647
- Yes, yes.
(Case, Helene laughing)

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.748
- And that's the
end of that answer?

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:36.682
- That's it.
(Chris, Helene laughing)

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.251
Many times, still happening.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.919
All of my YouTube
videos are biffs.

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:40.920
(Case, Helene laughing)

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.822
- Oh, what do you think
mom's career news was?

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:43.823
- Who knows.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:47.026
(dramatic instrumental music)

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.294
(twinkle)

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:49.695
- We were trying to figure out

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.964
how to end this season for
a while, and we were curious

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:54.800
about how to keep the
premise of The Other Two,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.636
you feeling like the others.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.837
So we came up with the idea

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.741
that Molly would be famous
now, that Pat, the mom would...

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.908
You kind of slowly but surely,

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.142
you see, like, "Oh,
it makes sense,

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.279
"she has been taking advantage
of all these opportunities."

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.213
- I loved that
teaser at the end.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:08.681
I would watch Pat.
(Sarah, Chris laughing)

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:09.649
Especially 'cause it's like

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.783
Molly just being Molly.
- I would too, yeah.

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:11.951
I do think this looks real.

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:13.286
- I was like, "Yeah,
I'd watch that."

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.819
- Yeah, that's good.
- Molly Shannon

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:14.820
on a talk show?

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.689
- And I was like, "Why
isn't this a real thing?

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:17.923
"Let's make this a real thing."

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.558
(Drew chuckling)
- [Sarah] Yeah, let's do this.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.493
- I'm glad you're all here,
because I've been thinking,

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.528
and I have a big announcement.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:24.830
All this singing stuff
has been really cool.

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:27.533
But this fall, I'm gonna go...

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.602
To college.

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:31.771
- What?

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.439
- In this episode, you two

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:35.908
become even more
connected to Chase.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.944
And you hold their
future in your hands,

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:39.945
and you don't know it.

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:41.447
- Yeah, you don't know
that she's your manager,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.715
and that he's your co-star.

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:43.816
- Well, I'm so innocent.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:44.784
I'm like, "What's goin' on?

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.819
"Oh, their whole lives
are depending on me?

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:47.953
"What?!"

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:48.888
Yeah.
- We think it's interesting

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:49.889
moving forward if he has said

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:50.890
he doesn't wanna
do this anymore.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.725
And if the family makes him,

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.328
- Yeah.
- Or doesn't make him, or,

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.562
you guys all need
him in a way, now.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:57.563
Where that is tricky.
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:58.998
- Where it's like, that
was never your intention

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.533
going into it.
- [Case] Yeah.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.634
- I dunno, that kinda
stuff would be interesting,

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:02.802
- [Sarah] Yeah.
- [Chris] Of like--

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.003
- And then I don't
wanna do this stuff,

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.371
but they're kind like,
"No, you have do.

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:06.539
"Please just do this
one thing for us."

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.473
- Yeah, that you're
the breadwinner,

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:08.674
you are the reason that everyone

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:09.675
has the things they
have accidentally.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.410
- Yeah, that's one of
the reasons we have you

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.045
be like, "Brooke and I
will always listen to you."

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.680
'Cause it does set
up this premise

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:15.915
that he's your little brother,

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.016
and you guys will listen to him.

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:17.950
- Yeah.
- And then immediately,

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:19.352
that's tested.
- Yeah.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.486
- I wonder if they'll
rise to the occas'.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.087
- We'll see!

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.355
- Or be garbage people.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.424
