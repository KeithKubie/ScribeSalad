one of the things young said about the

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800
one of the things young said about the
 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.880
one of the things young said about the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
shadow and this is I would say one of
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.499
shadow and this is I would say one of
the primary impediments to enlightenment

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
the primary impediments to enlightenment
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.200
the primary impediments to enlightenment
is that if you start looking at your

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
is that if you start looking at your
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.799
is that if you start looking at your
motives for for misbehaving and and I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
motives for for misbehaving and and I
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.780
motives for for misbehaving and and I
mean by that something very specific I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
mean by that something very specific I
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.369
mean by that something very specific I
mean I don't mean that you're

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
mean I don't mean that you're
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.349
mean I don't mean that you're
misbehaving by someone else's standards

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
misbehaving by someone else's standards
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.769
misbehaving by someone else's standards
I don't mean that I mean when you know

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
I don't mean that I mean when you know
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.450
I don't mean that I mean when you know
by your own standards that you're doing

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
by your own standards that you're doing
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.189
by your own standards that you're doing
something that's devious or malevolent

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
something that's devious or malevolent
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349
something that's devious or malevolent
or underhanded you know it and you still

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
or underhanded you know it and you still
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870
or underhanded you know it and you still
do it so it's your own judgment you're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
do it so it's your own judgment you're
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299
do it so it's your own judgment you're
bringing to bear on yourself if you look

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
bringing to bear on yourself if you look
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.450
bringing to bear on yourself if you look
at why you're doing that the longer you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
at why you're doing that the longer you
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940
at why you're doing that the longer you
look at it the deeper a hole you dig and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
look at it the deeper a hole you dig and
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.119
look at it the deeper a hole you dig and
so this is that motif of Dante's Inferno

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
so this is that motif of Dante's Inferno
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.700
so this is that motif of Dante's Inferno
fundamentally so Dante's Inferno is a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
fundamentally so Dante's Inferno is a
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.340
fundamentally so Dante's Inferno is a
story about I can't remember his name

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
story about I can't remember his name
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.660
story about I can't remember his name
unfortunately might be Dante in fact

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
unfortunately might be Dante in fact
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.799
unfortunately might be Dante in fact
although I don't remember

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
although I don't remember
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560
although I don't remember
he's led into hell by Virgil who's an

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
he's led into hell by Virgil who's an
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.770
he's led into hell by Virgil who's an
ancient who is an ancient philosopher

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
ancient who is an ancient philosopher
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.670
ancient who is an ancient philosopher
thinker and he'll has levels and so the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
thinker and he'll has levels and so the
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130
thinker and he'll has levels and so the
outer level is it is the Christianized

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
outer level is it is the Christianized
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.920
outer level is it is the Christianized
version of hell because there's hell's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
version of hell because there's hell's
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570
version of hell because there's hell's
of all sorts but this is a Christianized

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
of all sorts but this is a Christianized
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030
of all sorts but this is a Christianized
version and so the on the outermost

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
version and so the on the outermost
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.210
version and so the on the outermost
levels of Hell which is sort of like

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220
levels of Hell which is sort of like
 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.100
levels of Hell which is sort of like
normal life are the ancient philosophers

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
normal life are the ancient philosophers
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990
normal life are the ancient philosophers
and they're still in hell because they

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
and they're still in hell because they
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060
and they're still in hell because they
weren't Christian but it's kind of like

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
weren't Christian but it's kind of like
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.690
weren't Christian but it's kind of like
it's like cheap motel hell instead of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
it's like cheap motel hell instead of
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.740
it's like cheap motel hell instead of
the full pit thing you know and so then

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750
the full pit thing you know and so then
 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.140
the full pit thing you know and so then
Dante goes deeper and deeper into Hell

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
Dante goes deeper and deeper into Hell
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789
Dante goes deeper and deeper into Hell
until it gets right to the bottom of it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
until it gets right to the bottom of it
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830
until it gets right to the bottom of it
and it's been a while since I read it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
and it's been a while since I read it
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330
and it's been a while since I read it
but if I remember correctly Satan

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
but if I remember correctly Satan
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760
but if I remember correctly Satan
himself is encased in ice at the bottom

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
himself is encased in ice at the bottom
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.100
himself is encased in ice at the bottom
of Hell surrounded by people who betray

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
of Hell surrounded by people who betray
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530
of Hell surrounded by people who betray
others and so Dante's notion was that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
others and so Dante's notion was that
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.249
others and so Dante's notion was that
the worst of all possible violations of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
the worst of all possible violations of
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710
the worst of all possible violations of
moral behavior was betrayal and that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
moral behavior was betrayal and that
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539
moral behavior was betrayal and that
they're in the deepest levels of Hell

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
they're in the deepest levels of Hell
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609
they're in the deepest levels of Hell
and I really like that idea I think it's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
and I really like that idea I think it's
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.969
and I really like that idea I think it's
true because if you trust me then you're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
true because if you trust me then you're
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980
true because if you trust me then you're
manifesting the necessary courage that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
manifesting the necessary courage that
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690
manifesting the necessary courage that
puts someone through life you know if

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
puts someone through life you know if
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429
puts someone through life you know if
you're smart you don't trust because

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
you're smart you don't trust because
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649
you're smart you don't trust because
you're naive you trust me knowing that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
you're naive you trust me knowing that
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.380
you're naive you trust me knowing that
I've full of snakes and so are you but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
I've full of snakes and so are you but
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.930
I've full of snakes and so are you but
maybe we could cooperate and move things

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
maybe we could cooperate and move things
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.210
maybe we could cooperate and move things
along nicely you know and we could

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
along nicely you know and we could
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.370
along nicely you know and we could
reduce each other to the word to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
reduce each other to the word to
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.620
reduce each other to the word to
word and we could cooperate but you're

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
word and we could cooperate but you're
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170
word and we could cooperate but you're
awake you know and then I betray that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
awake you know and then I betray that
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.200
awake you know and then I betray that
then I'm undermining your necessary

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210
then I'm undermining your necessary
 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.130
then I'm undermining your necessary
faith in life and humanity and you can

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
faith in life and humanity and you can
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140
faith in life and humanity and you can
really hurt someone that way like the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150
really hurt someone that way like the
 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.020
really hurt someone that way like the
sometimes it's self betrayal but you can

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
sometimes it's self betrayal but you can
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670
sometimes it's self betrayal but you can
really do someone in that we can really

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
really do someone in that we can really
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500
really do someone in that we can really
traumatize them they can so that they

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
traumatize them they can so that they
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.450
traumatize them they can so that they
can't recover and so it's a really

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460
can't recover and so it's a really
 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.040
can't recover and so it's a really
terrible thing to do to someone and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
terrible thing to do to someone and
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.660
terrible thing to do to someone and
maybe it's the worst thing and that was

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
maybe it's the worst thing and that was
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.260
maybe it's the worst thing and that was
Dante's idea and it's tied in that makes

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270
Dante's idea and it's tied in that makes
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.970
Dante's idea and it's tied in that makes
very interesting reading if you read it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
very interesting reading if you read it
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.320
very interesting reading if you read it
at the same time as Milton's Paradise

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
at the same time as Milton's Paradise
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.690
at the same time as Milton's Paradise
Lost because those are metaphysical

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
Lost because those are metaphysical
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300
Lost because those are metaphysical
explorations this is what they are their

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310
explorations this is what they are their
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.920
explorations this is what they are their
metaphysical explorations of the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
metaphysical explorations of the
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.830
metaphysical explorations of the
terrible places you can end up and that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
terrible places you can end up and that
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.560
terrible places you can end up and that
people do end up and also a metaphysical

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570
people do end up and also a metaphysical
 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.140
people do end up and also a metaphysical
explanation of what spirit takes you

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
explanation of what spirit takes you
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.350
explanation of what spirit takes you
there so because you might ask well why

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
there so because you might ask well why
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.620
there so because you might ask well why
do you betray someone and that is a deep

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
do you betray someone and that is a deep
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.720
do you betray someone and that is a deep
question and so you'll have your

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
question and so you'll have your
 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610
question and so you'll have your
specific reasons but under that there'll

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
specific reasons but under that there'll
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.960
specific reasons but under that there'll
be some other reasons and under that

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
be some other reasons and under that
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.460
be some other reasons and under that
there'll be some other reasons and under

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
there'll be some other reasons and under
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.050
there'll be some other reasons and under
that there'll be some other reasons and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
that there'll be some other reasons and
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060
that there'll be some other reasons and
if you go all the way to the bottom you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070
if you go all the way to the bottom you
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.650
if you go all the way to the bottom you
come up with the ultimate reasons why

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660
come up with the ultimate reasons why
 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.630
come up with the ultimate reasons why
you betrayed someone and when you look

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640
you betrayed someone and when you look
 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.270
you betrayed someone and when you look
at that that will not be pretty that's

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
at that that will not be pretty that's
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.700
at that that will not be pretty that's
when your proclivity for evil let's say

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710
when your proclivity for evil let's say
 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.460
when your proclivity for evil let's say
unites with the general human proclivity

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
unites with the general human proclivity
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.070
unites with the general human proclivity
for evil and you discover just exactly

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080
for evil and you discover just exactly
 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.830
for evil and you discover just exactly
what you're capable of and so Jung's

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
what you're capable of and so Jung's
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.630
what you're capable of and so Jung's
notion was that well that was a full

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
notion was that well that was a full
 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280
notion was that well that was a full
encounter with the shadow which is I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
encounter with the shadow which is I
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.780
encounter with the shadow which is I
suppose partly what this course is about

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
suppose partly what this course is about
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.390
suppose partly what this course is about
because one of the things that I believe

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
because one of the things that I believe
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.920

I told you at the beginning was that I

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
I told you at the beginning was that I

I told you at the beginning was that I
was going to try to help you understand

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
was going to try to help you understand
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.230
was going to try to help you understand
how it might be that you could be an

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240
how it might be that you could be an
 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.560
how it might be that you could be an
arse wits guard and to really understand

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570
arse wits guard and to really understand
 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.060
arse wits guard and to really understand
that that's a horrifying thing to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070
that that's a horrifying thing to
 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.120
that that's a horrifying thing to
understand but I'll tell you if you want

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130
understand but I'll tell you if you want
 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.790
understand but I'll tell you if you want
to grow some teeth that's a really good

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
to grow some teeth that's a really good
 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.250
to grow some teeth that's a really good
thing to understand so we were talking

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
thing to understand so we were talking
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.990
thing to understand so we were talking
about your capacity to negotiate before

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
about your capacity to negotiate before
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.310
about your capacity to negotiate before
like if you aren't a monster you cannot

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320
like if you aren't a monster you cannot
 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.670
like if you aren't a monster you cannot
negotiate but if you if you got that

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
negotiate but if you if you got that
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.210
negotiate but if you if you got that
under control then you don't have to be

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
under control then you don't have to be
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.940
under control then you don't have to be
a monster it's really paradoxical so if

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
a monster it's really paradoxical so if
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.729
a monster it's really paradoxical so if
you're just naive well you end up in

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
you're just naive well you end up in
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.330
you're just naive well you end up in
jail and a marionette master has control

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
jail and a marionette master has control
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580
jail and a marionette master has control
over you that's not helpful so that's

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
over you that's not helpful so that's
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.170
over you that's not helpful so that's
not good that just means you're

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
not good that just means you're
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.450
not good that just means you're
useless and you can be manipulating go

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460
useless and you can be manipulating go
 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.920
useless and you can be manipulating go
out of your way to be malevolent but

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930
out of your way to be malevolent but
 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.210
out of your way to be malevolent but
it's mostly because you just don't have

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
it's mostly because you just don't have
 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.060
it's mostly because you just don't have
the skills the organizational skills or

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
the skills the organizational skills or
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.430
the skills the organizational skills or
or even the depth to do that you know

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440
or even the depth to do that you know
 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.560
or even the depth to do that you know
you're good because you're harmless

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570
you're good because you're harmless
 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.020
you're good because you're harmless
that's that's not good that's easily

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
that's that's not good that's easily
 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.659
that's that's not good that's easily
manipulated and so you think well how do

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669
manipulated and so you think well how do
 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.760
manipulated and so you think well how do
you get out of that well partly you

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770
you get out of that well partly you
 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.680
you get out of that well partly you
watch people it because you know what

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690
watch people it because you know what
 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.999
watch people it because you know what
they're like because you know what

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009
they're like because you know what
 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.700
they're like because you know what
you're like and that but you also know

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710
you're like and that but you also know
 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.770
you're like and that but you also know
what you could do and would do if you

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780
what you could do and would do if you
 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.600
what you could do and would do if you
were pushed and so you don't have to

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610
were pushed and so you don't have to
 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.740
were pushed and so you don't have to
show much of that when you're

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750
show much of that when you're
 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.779
show much of that when you're
negotiating with someone for them to

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789
negotiating with someone for them to
 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.200
negotiating with someone for them to
take you really seriously so it's a

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210
take you really seriously so it's a
 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.939
take you really seriously so it's a
strange thing you know but one of the

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949
strange thing you know but one of the
 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.670
strange thing you know but one of the
things you pointed out too was that what

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680
things you pointed out too was that what
 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.589
things you pointed out too was that what
you most need to know will be found

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599
you most need to know will be found
 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.960
you most need to know will be found
where you least want to look and that's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970
where you least want to look and that's
 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.339
where you least want to look and that's
because you haven't already looked there

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349
because you haven't already looked there
 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.620
because you haven't already looked there
and so it's a little different for

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630
and so it's a little different for
 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.689
and so it's a little different for
everyone right because your particular

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
everyone right because your particular
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.189
everyone right because your particular
place you don't want to look isn't going

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199
place you don't want to look isn't going
 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.200
place you don't want to look isn't going
to be the same as your place but you're

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
to be the same as your place but you're
 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.610
to be the same as your place but you're
going to have a place you don't want to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620
going to have a place you don't want to
 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.499
going to have a place you don't want to
look and what you haven't discovered

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509
look and what you haven't discovered
 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.200
look and what you haven't discovered
that's where it is and so that's all

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210
that's where it is and so that's all
 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.839
that's where it is and so that's all
partly going to be discovered by you

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849
partly going to be discovered by you
 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.279
partly going to be discovered by you
looking at what you're capable of what

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289
looking at what you're capable of what
 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.340
looking at what you're capable of what
you're truly capable of
