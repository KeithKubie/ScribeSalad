[Chanting] Cancer, asthma. No, no, no.
Toxic gases. No, no, no.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.100
What do we want?  Shut it down.
When do we want it? Now.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.860
We will not stand for environmental
racism because it has become clear to us

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.280
that poor people and people of color
continue to be disproportionately

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.100
affected by the challenges posed by
these neighborhood drilling sites

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.440
that continue to go on.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.840
So, STAND-LA came to us at the beginning
of the school year

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.460
and they were specifically interested in
the community of Wilmington.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.680
They had a couple locations where they felt as though these very specific oil companies

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.080
were not following rules properly

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300
and that was negatively affecting
the actual community itself.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.140
(health survey)

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.060
I didn't know before coming to college that
fracking was even a thing or oil-drilling was a thing.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.140
and they were so prevalent.
But, just after investigating it more

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.020
you realize how close they are to residents.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.400
(health survey)

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.460
So, we want our research to be the beginning
of talking about it.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.120
She had also throat infections, she has had bronchitis.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.920
We do see some pretty bold differences.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.080
For example, throat infections themselves just in the 50
people that we surveyed,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.780
14 of them in Wilmington versus five in West Pico
versus six in Pacoima.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.060
It raises an eyebrow.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.680
Well for me, since the beginning this was very personal because I come from south central Los Angeles.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.620
Its a low-income people of color community.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.620
So I could relate a lot to the people from Wilmington.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.380
Just being part of this research project has been great because I feel like I'm

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.260
making a difference using my education
which is something that I wanted to do.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.120
Through this project, it really empowered
me the same way that it does just being

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.510
in environmental science. It's changed my
entire senior year in the way that I

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.330
actually am going to end up finishing
UCLA is like so much brighter than it

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.540
would have been without it.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.260
Point the people who are going to start doing actual investigation in the right direction.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.320
And hopefully get that moving towards real results
where this community doesn't have to

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.500
rely on, you know, am I going to be
sick tomorrow or can I go to work.
