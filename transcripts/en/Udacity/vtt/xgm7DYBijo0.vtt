00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.770
Great.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.412
So, now that we've learned the differences between author-driven and

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:06.810
viewer-driven visualizations, let's go through an exercise.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.930
In this exercise, we're going to be analyzing the narrative structure of

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.820
different visualizations.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.560
We provided some examples for you, and we want you to

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.560
ask four simple questions and write your answers in the discussion form.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.600
First, we want to know what is the narrative structure of

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390
the visualization that you've chosen?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.070
Secondly, how does the visualization lead you through the data?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.180
Third question is,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.690
what is the story being told with this particular visualization?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.200
And last, how could this have been improved?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100
Please pick a visualization from the examples provided, and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.145
answer these four questions in a discussion form.
