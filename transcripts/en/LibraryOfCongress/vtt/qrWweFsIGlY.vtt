00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.700
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good morning
and thank you for joining us.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.950
I'm Karen Lloyd, Director
of the Army's --

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.880
the Library's Veterans
History Project.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.110
&gt;&gt; We'll take it.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.320
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Today we
are in for a real treat.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.320
With a nod to our upcoming exhibit
which opens on April 4th, 2017,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.320
our American's entry into World
War I, appropriately named "Echoes

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.480
of the Great War, America's
Experiences of World War I,"

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.550 position:56%
this interview with a current leader

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.590
of our military team
seems a good fit.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.640
Today Colleen Shogan will have a
fireside chat with Eric Fanning,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.010
the Secretary of the Army.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.440
Since 2015 Colleen Shogan
has served as Deputy Director

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.060
of the Library's National
and International Outreach.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.790
She joined the Library's
Congressional Research Service

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.440 position:56%
in 2008 and served as the CRS Deputy
Director from 2012 until 2015.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.940
Prior to joining CRS she worked for
two years on the Legislative Staff

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.740
of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.720
She is also a published
author with three books

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.430
and many academic authors
to her credit.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.910
Our special guest,
Secretary Eric Fanning,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.580
has had an extraordinary career.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.030
Secretary Fanning knows his way
around the Pentagon having served

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.020
in jobs as diverse as Chief of
Staff to the Secretary of Defense,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.850
Acting Secretary of the Air Force,
Undersecretary of the Air Force

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.230
and Chief Management Officer,
Deputy Undersecretary of the Navy,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.300
Deputy Chief Management Officer
acting under the Secretary

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.450
of the Army and Chief
Management Officer.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.890
The enduring theme of
his assignments relate

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.140
to business transformation
and governance

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.580
to improve enterprise-wide
efficiencies.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.140
He also spent time
in a Defense Agency

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.390 position:56%
so he has first-hand experience in a
variety of aspects of the Department

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.350
of Defense that provide him
a [inaudible] of knowledge

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.040 position:56%
that is rare and extremely valuable.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.400
Secretary Fanning has also spent
time with a variety of Washington,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.470
D.C. think tanks and
as a Research Assistant

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.390
with the House Armed
Services Committee.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.030
It is understatement to say
we are fortunate to have

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.080
such a defense expert with us today

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.790
to help us better understand
the importance of diversity,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.890
budget stability, and innovation.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.690
Let's welcome them both with
a big round of applause.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.290
[ Applause ]

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.590
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Thanks, Karen.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.890
Good morning.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.660
And to our, all of our guests,
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.160
We've very privileged
and honored this morning

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.740
to host Secretary Fanning
here at the Library.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.680
And the format for this morning --

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.020
We have about 45 minutes
for the conversation.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.040
If there is time left over then
Secretary Fanning will take

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040
questions from the audience.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.770
Mr. Secretary, you've had,
just really as Karen said,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.770
a tremendous career in the
Pentagon, largely in public service

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.020
in the public sector, but also
in the private sector as well.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.130
Can you tell us when you first
became interested in defense policy

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.940
and when you knew that would
be the focus of your career?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.260
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Well
I think my interest was

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.660
in government and politics first.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.380
I went to school in New Hampshire

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.180
and I actually arrived
as an Art Major.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.480
I wanted to be an architect.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.110
But when you go to school in New
Hampshire you're going to be there

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.990
for a presidential primary at
some point during your time.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.810
And it's not a big state, not
a lot of places for them to go,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.290
and they're there for a long time.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.800
So you get to see the
process up close.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.130
And I knew I wanted to come back.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.550
I wanted to come to Washington.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.790
So I -- an art major the first year
but come to Washington the summer

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.370
after my freshman year and then
hooked on politics, on the Congress

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.610
in particular, and was
sort of drawn to Defense

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.940
and Foreign Policy for
a number of reasons.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.620 position:56%
I have a pretty big military family.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.530
My father grew up at West Point.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.840
Two of his brothers,
brother-in-law went there.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.610
And it all kind of
clicked because I got a job

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.330
in the House Armed
Services Committee.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.140
And that just sort
of took off quickly

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.950
because within 16 months the
Chairman of the Committee

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.560
for whom I was working
became Secretary of Defense.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.780
And so that was the -- the
path was set at an early point.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.080
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.380
This is the Library of Congress.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.510
We're very interested in
people who have had --

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.990
worked in the Legislative Branch.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.650
So I'm going to ask a
little bit more about that.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.380
You started your career at House
Armed Services and then, of course,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.100 position:56%
went on to have a very distinguished
career in the Executive Branch.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.720
From the positions that you've held
in the Pentagon, when you look back

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.080
at your time in Congress, was
that very helpful to have had

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.830
that experience working
in the Legislative Branch,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.640
and can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.940
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: It's very helpful.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.240
It's also very fun.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.030
I usually -- when I'm
advising younger people, I say,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.270
go to the Hill early because
it's a relatively structure.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.400
You can get a lot of
responsibility very quickly

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.610
and also tire of it very quickly.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.350
But it's been helpful to me
in every job that I've had.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.950
So much of what we do is
interacting with Congress,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.470 position:56%
our Board of Directors, essentially.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.900
And there's so little
understanding outside of Congress

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.590
of how it actually functions and
how people think, how they operate,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.000
and so -- I had one meeting before
coming over here this morning

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.450
and it was all about
Congressional issue and how

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.290
to move things through
our committees.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.590
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Mm-hmm.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.300
I have one more Congress-related
question for you.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.010
The National Defense Authorization
Act, the NDAA, has been enacted,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.770
I think, 55 years in
a row without fail.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.310 position:56%
And, as you know, in this time of
withering authorizations on the Hill

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.620
where it's very infrequent to see
authorizations, and certainly not

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.440
on a routinized scheduled,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.970
can you share with us why you
think the NDAA has had its record

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.440
of continued passage and whether
you think that even this time

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.180
of extreme polarization and
partisanship on the Hill,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.420
whether defense still
remains a bipartisan

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.960
or an even nonpartisan
issue with Congress?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.710
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Everything
is political

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.640
and partisan one way or another.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.110
But it is a bastion of
across-the-aisle efforts,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.410
the Armed Services Committee.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.340
I think that the bipartisan
approach that we've taken

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.980
for national security for
decades and a point of pride

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.730
for those committees is what
drives in NDAA every year.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.010
It is remarkably bipartisan
how those committees approach

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.800
their work.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.860
I mean just my confirmation
process which was really --

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.700
the whole thing took place
on the Republican side --

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.010
the debate, the issues,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.470
my supporters were on
the Republican side.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.040
We make an effort to work
together across the aisle

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.020
to keep communication
open as much as possible.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.160 position:56%
And what I found -- it hit me really
in an unexpected way at the start

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.240
of the Obama Administration.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.430
I was -- I worked in
the Clinton Pentagon,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.650
was returning to the Iran Pentagon,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.020
and it's a lot of the
same characters.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.030
A lot of the people who I work
with in the Obama Pentagon I worked

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.840 position:56%
with at an early point in all of
our careers in the Clinton Pentagon.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.900
And a lot of names -- people on
the Hill, members in particular,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.610
are people that were
around back then as well.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.960
And so those relationships
survive and just evolve over time.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.260
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.560
That's interesting.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.660
It's been years since I've
worked with Defense Policy

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.600
and worked in Armed Services.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.570
But when I went back to prepare
for this interview I was surprised

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.350
at how many of the issues actually
had remained very consistent

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.650
and the same.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.720
So you sat in many different
seats in the Pentagon.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.020
You've worked in the Navy.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.320
You've worked in the Air Force.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.130 position:56%
You've worked in the Sec-Def Office.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.680
We're going to focus
today on the Army

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.500
because that's your
current position.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.290
You talked a little bit
about your confirmation,

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.950
your confirmation hearing,
in particular.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.160
You said that you were concerned
about decreasing Army end-strength.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.250
But you also said that the Army
is more than just a number.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.140
So I'd like to ask you about
what the future of the Army looks

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.640 position:56%
like with a reduced force structure.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.920
Is the Army going to continue to
be a conventional fighting force

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.390 position:56%
or does it have to prepare for other
endeavors and other challenges?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.060
And what does that mean for
the training of our soldiers?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.810
Will they continue to be
trained as war fighters

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.110 position:56%
or will they need additional skills?

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.070
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So there's
about 12 questions in that.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.370
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Yeah, there's a lot.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.460
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: I could pull
that one apart a little bit.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.840
My confirmation hearing
I was more --

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.940
I was focused on making sure

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.930
that we were getting the
most combat capability

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.570
out of the force structure we have.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.490
Maybe too nuanced.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.090
But my own background in really
focusing on how we're organized,

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.040
how we're run, what the
processes are, to get as agile

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.340
and as efficient as possible,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.010
so that whatever force
structure we're given,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.650
whatever resource we're allotted,

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.080
that we're getting the most
bang for the buck out of it.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.400
It was interpreted as me saying
we're cutting the Army too far

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.110
which caused me immediate
problems with my boss.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.180
But we worked through that.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.750
The Army is run hard.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.300
The Military is run hard.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:55.800
When we targeted this just
over 980,000 total Army --

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.780
the Active, the Guard, and the
Reserve -- Russia wasn't doing --

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.600
wasn't being as provocative
as it is now.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.980
China wasn't flexing in
the way that it is now.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.640
ISLE didn't exist as it does today.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.030 position:56%
And yet we're -- now we have all
those new requirements levied on top

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.410
of the force structure that
we were aiming towards.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.030
What I would say -- two
things about force structure.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.320
A raw number doesn't necessarily
tell you what an army is,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.520
what capabilities an
army brings to a fight.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.670
And it's very important
that we think

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.660
in terms of a balanced program.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.200
It's not just people.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.090
It's people that are
trained and equipped.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:42.910
And if we're asked to keep more
force structure without an increase

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.910
in the budget in some way
then we have more people

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.180
with less training
and less equipment.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.550 position:56%
And that could easily quickly become
a larger army that's less effective

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.280
and less capable than the one
that we're trying to build now.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.260
So the balance is important.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.970
It's not just the number
of people that you have.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.600
It's how they're organized,
how they're trained,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.900
and how they're equipped.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.240
As far as the future.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.070
You now I think that the
broad requirements levied

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.350
on the Army now --
counter-insurgency,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.160
counter-terrorism -- as well
as preparing for a larger fight

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.450
with a near-peer adversary, are
going to remain into the future.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.960
The issue is how technology
changes, how the adversary changes,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.120 position:56%
and where you imagine the
environment you might be fighting is

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.500
changing or evolving, because
we know that we're on a trend

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.460 position:56%
to increased urbanization and
mega-cities, which creates all sorts

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.560
of vulnerabilities for people
when they're clustered together

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.110
like that, which could
create something

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.400
on the back end of this trend.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.410
But we've got to think about being
able to fight, increasingly fight,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.230
in dense, urban environments
where the adversary is mixed

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.080
in with large civilian populations.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.380
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.900 position:56%
The most recent QDR, the Quadrennial
Defense Review, had a discussion

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.480
of risk based upon some
of the aging weapon --

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.310
major weapon systems in the Army,

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.170
the idea that we are still
technically advanced beyond

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.470
our adversaries.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.670
But the gap between
the United States

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.170
and our adversaries is actually
decreasing, hence the risk.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.700
I wonder if you could talk
a little bit about problems,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.790
and everybody reads
about them in the news,

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.090 position:56%
concerning the acquisitions process,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.200
cost over-runs, delayed
deliverables.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.510
What is the crux of the development
process, particularly in the Army?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.560
And if you had more time as
Secretary, how would you fix it?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.690
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So I
think there are two things

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.690
when we're talking about that risk.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.020
One is investment.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.860
And the Army, with the nature of
the fights in the last 15 years,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.800
has really been drawn into the day,
day after day after day after day,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.050
and, as it should, making sure
that we have the size army we need

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.070
and that it is ready
for today's fight,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.100
and that is men leveraging
the future in some ways.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.540
And substantially cutting just in
the last eight years by upwards

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.230 position:56%
of a third our modernization budget.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.530
And so that's one part
of the growing risk

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.750
because we're not maybe
investing in modernization

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.050
in the way we should be, to think

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.350
about the future --
10, 15, 20 years out.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.120
The second, of course,
is just the process,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.960 position:56%
the acquisition procurement process.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.190
And the Army a decade
or so ago was grappling

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.160
with some very serious problems
across its portfolio programs

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.970
that were suffering from pretty
substantial cost overruns

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.270
and time delays.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.510
It's easier now to say that
we have a better handle

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.560 position:56%
on our acquisition programs
because we have a lot fewer of them,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.120
and so they're easier to oversee.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.070
But we've made a lot of changes
to the acquisition process.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.600
If I had more time that
would be a primary focus

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.900
to keep working on that.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.280
And a bit part of it's not just
changing what we do internally.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.400
It is changing how we interact
with, and collaborate with,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.250
work with those outside
the Department of Defense.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:18.000
Technology is -- companies
and academic centers --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.990
that they develop technology is a
different way than they used to.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.850
It's very iterative now and we
aren't generally agile enough

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.650 position:56%
to even keep up with that iteration.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.950
I mean we all now have --

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.150
we're probably the last
people institutionally to hold

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.590
on to BlackBerrys because Apple
didn't want to work with us.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.410
They said, you know, we put -- the
product is just one part of it.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.980
The software, the updates, it all
is a package that goes together,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.980
and you are not equipped
to receive our technology

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.510
and we just can't be bothered.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.190
And so I think that's
a cautionary tale

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.590
for how we build, acquire things.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.440
I think there's more we can
be getting off the shelf

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.220
and getting a [inaudible] faster.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.210
But also about how we build
and acquire larger things.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I'd like to give
you an opportunity to talk about one

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.460
of your major achievements as
Secretary which is standing

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.250
up the Rapid Capabilities
Office in the Army.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.510
Can you tell everybody what
that is, what the structure is,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.840
what goals you're hoping to achieve
with it, and why it's so important

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.040
to create -- give the
Army the ability

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.500
to create disruptive technologies
in the short amount of time?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.880
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So
there are a lot of --

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.390
you know, I say is there's
actually a lot of creativity

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.380
and innovation inside the
Department of Defense --

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.920
in uniform, in civilian workforce,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.150
among our traditional
industrial base.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.390
There's a lot of creativity
despite the barriers we've put

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.560
up in their -- in place of them.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.350
So the Rapid Capabilities
Office really was --

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.370
in my job in the Air Force as
the Air Force Undersecretary,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.790
which is the Number
Two, a lot of work

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.730
with the Air Force Rapid
Capabilities Office,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.540
which is an enormous
organization because of all

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.580
of the black world programs
that are parked in the Air Force

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.240
and moved through this office.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.400
The Army's version is
different and really was built

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:05.520
on what we were seeing, really
what we were seeing the Russians do

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.190 position:56%
with Ukraine and realizing that they
had been watching us more closely

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.450
than maybe we'd been watching them,
that they had turned into a more

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.070
of a learning organization than
they had been during the Cold War,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.680
and that the decisive edge we won

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.810
in capability maybe wasn't
what we had tracked it to be.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.770
And so the way I describe our
Rapid Capabilities Office,

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.010
and nobody's allowed
to call it the RCO --

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.880
we're drawing a line at Acronyms

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.130
with the Rapid Capabilities Office
-- is that it fills a gap in time.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.510
And I use a helicopter
as an example.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.420 position:56%
We're not going to enlarge the Rapid
Capabilities Office to something

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.580 position:56%
that can build an entire helicopter.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.650
But there might be some capability
on that helicopter that we need

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.360
to pull out and accelerate
to field it faster

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.240
for the existing fleet
that we've got.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.810 position:56%
And so we're really looking at a one

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.180
to five year time horizon
to plug gaps.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.780
And I don't know -- in some cases
they're gaps and some places it's

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.000
to get that decisive
edge back in capability.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.300
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.600
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: And if
it's aligned right --

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.900
it's not meant to be a workaround

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.610
to the big existing
acquisition process.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.030
We still need to keep
working on that.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.740
But if these things are aligned
right, then the technology

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.220
and capability we can get out in
the Rapid Capabilities Office will

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.390
inform the more strategic
modernization that's taking place

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.690
over a longer term.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.400
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So it's a
building block in other words.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.330
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: It's
a building block, yeah.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:35.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Due to frequent
deployments and repeated deployments

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.090 position:56%
because of the global war on terror,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.220
many service members
have come back obviously

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.070
with severe physical injuries,
but also have returned

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.950
with what is sometimes
called "invisible injuries,"

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.240
post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.090
The Army has endured for the
past several years an elevated

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.650
suicide rate.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.950
Can you talk about that?

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.140 position:56%
And what are the things that are
being put in place right now in Army

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.590
to try to solve that problem?

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.920
And are they addressing
the underlying problems

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.570
of culture and stigma?

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.120
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So there's --

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.310
you know, I think there's a lot
of work being doing in this area.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.880
There's a lot of focus on it.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.180
There's a lot of attention on it.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.950
There's a great deal
more to be done.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.590
There's a lot of research
taking place.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.020
The Army's partnering with a lot
of academic/medical communities

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.080
because we want to
understand this better.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.410
And I think that the
stigma is changing.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.430
But the more I think about this --

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.580
we've been focused on trying to get
behavioral health, behavioral care,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.880
further out into operational
units so it's more accessible.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.360
Someone doesn't have
to walk to the corner

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.550
of an installation to get help.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.740
But it's just there.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.470
But I think we need to further
radically shape the paradigm

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.470
which is not -- we're going to
provide care if you need it,

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.060
but you're going to need
care when you come back.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.560
What we ask soldiers to
do on a regular basis,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.330
deployment after deployment,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.340
goes against how we're hardwired
biologically as human beings.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.290
And so it shouldn't be it's there
if you need it, and we're going

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.590
to make it easy for you to find it.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.930
It should be you're going
to need it and you're going

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.320
to get it when you come back.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.600
It should just be a part
of the cycle we have,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.680
much like how we maintain
tanks, for example.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.500
If we run them hard, we bring
them back, we strip them down,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.480
we put them back together.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.420
The Special Operations Command
has actually done a lot of work

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.890
in this that's very interesting.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.170
But I think in 10/15/20 years we're
going to look back on this time

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.970
and say wow, we really
missed a lot of things,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.270
got a lot of things wrong.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.080
And hopefully we'll have an
entire different way of looking

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.690
at behavior health that --

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.000
I would be frightened
to think we had an army

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.860
of people doing what we ask of them

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.110
and they're not impacted
by that mission.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.200
I don't even want to know
what that would look like.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.570
I wouldn't want to let that
loose on an adversary someplace,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.450
particularly its environments
we're talking about.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.150
And so I think we need to --

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.860
I think we're in the process
of looking at this differently.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.270
But a lot more work has to be done.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.780
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I want
to ask you a few questions,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.120
two questions about
women in the Army.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.420
Can you give us an update?

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.110
Where are we with the expansion
of women into all roles

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.490
in the Army including combat roles?

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.290
And where do you see the
challenges in that transformation

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.220
and that change for the Army?

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.610
And then, secondly, an issue that's
gotten a lot of attention her

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.490
on Capitol Hill in
the past several years

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.910
which is sexual assault
in the military.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.560
What steps have been taken under
your watch as Secretary of the Army

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.400
to try to solve that problem?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.650
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So on the
first, women in combat --

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.850
I think things are going very well.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.720
You know I always brag on the Army
on this one because I can do it

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.820
without -- because it's -- a lot
of great work was done before I got

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.570
to the Army to really analyze
what requirements are necessary

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.720
to do all the jobs across the Army.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.740
And they are independent of
any qualifier of who you are.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.280
They're real requirements based
on the equipment, the mission.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.700
And then opening it up [inaudible]
to meet those requirements.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.310
We made a decision in the Army to
build the leadership cadre first,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:35.470
so to get new young lieutenants
in, to get enlisted, to re-branch,

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.800
you know, who have had
some experience so that

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.740
when we get brand new junior
soldiers in we've got leadership

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.270
in place to help make the
transition as smooth as possible.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.260
And so the challenge, if you even
use that word "challenge" is just

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.850
that it was going to
take a little bit of time

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.750
to get some critical
mass going in there.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.000
But I think it's going very well.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.770
We see -- the women that I see,
they're at the vanguard of this,

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.690
would be the people I'd
want fighting with me

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.740
if I were wearing a uniform
in the army right now.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.210
They are impressive.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.900
They're dedicated.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.490
And they, more than anybody
else, want to make sure

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.260
that the requirements are set and
that they meet the requirements.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.560
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Mm-hmm.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: And sexual assault?

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.030
Yeah, I think -- you know,
there were a lot of titles

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.630
that were mentioned
in my introductions.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.090
Some of them were at the same time,

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.890
but I've had nine different
jobs in this Administration.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.860
And so I've seen this from every
single corner of the Pentagon.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.550
And I do think it's been a --
it's been something we'll spend --

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.260
I wouldn't say it's
been a priority of mine.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.920
It's been a priority of ours to
focus on this and get this right.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.860
It's critical that we get
at this and that we --

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.000
you know, we are held to a higher
standard, and we should be.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.580
And we need to meet
that higher standard.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.530
And I think where my focus has been
in the last year with the Army,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.700
the last year plus, has been --

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.460
we have done a lot on
the response aspect,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.150
making sure that lawyers are
changed, judges are changed.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.290
We have victims' advocates.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:09.190
But we need to make that
whole aspect irrelevant

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.550
by getting at the prevention part.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.700
And that's been really my focus
the last 18 months as I've moved

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.690
through the Army jobs as investing
in that part of our organization,

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.240
pushing the team on the
research and on programs to get

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.200
at the prevention part
which is harder.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.330
But I think we're making
some progress there.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.630
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Terrific.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.850
Well, if you hadn't
noticed, in the past couple

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.640
of weeks we had a Presidential
Election and I --

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.930
you know, I think it was a very
divisive Presidential Election.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.340
And one of the, I think,
good results out of it is

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.700
that people are trying
to stay positive

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.100
in their personal interactions
with each other and also online

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.500
and social media, so I want to ask
a very positive question of you.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.370
I've been asking you a
lot of hard questions.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.340
We're going to celebrate
Thanksgiving in two days,

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.580
so what are you most
thankful for this year?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.900
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Well,
my [inaudible] --

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.120
my answer to that is
the traditional one.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.780
But I felt it acutely over the
course of the last couple of years

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.460
with confirmation processes and
movements and what have you.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.400 position:56%
And that's my friends and my family.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.030
I had -- you know, two years
ago now I was Undersecretary

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.330
of the Air Force.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.860
The Secretary of the Air
Force is one of my oldest,

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.450
closest, dearest friends.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:26.110
She worked on the House
Armed Services Committee

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.690
with me, and just loving life.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.310
And Ash Carter, who I've known
for 25 years, came knocking

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.260
and sets off a 12-month period
where I'm in five different jobs

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.360
as I moved from the Air Force to
him to the Number Two in the Army

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.110
to the Acting Secretary of the
Army, then back to his office

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.160
because of the vagaries of
the confirmation process.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.560
And if I didn't have that sort
of stability in those touchpoints

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.260
in my personal life it would have
been a much different 12 months.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.620
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Well, you
have just a tremendous resume.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.190
You've sat in all these very
impressive seats in the Pentagon.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.760
Can I ask you, what's
next in your career?

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.290
What are the next steps?

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:12.450 position:56%
And where do you think your skills
will be best utilized in the future?

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.220
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Well, I,
you know, I think I have one

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.710
of the greatest jobs in the world

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.430
that very few people
really understand the role

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.030
of the Service Secretary which
is one of the reasons it's

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.610
such a great job, because
they kind of leave you alone.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.880
Generally, if you get a call,
it's -- something bad has happened

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.180
and you got to deal with it.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.770
But the autonomy that you get
as Service Secretary is great.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.300
And the way I describe it is
being the CEO of a business unit.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.280
I mean, I'm the CEO of the Army.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.380
The Army is a unbelievably
lethal war-fighting machine

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.920
and a tool of national power.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.240
The Department of the Army is a
business unit that creates it.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.790 position:56%
And it's -- and so when I -- and the
confirmation process now having gone

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:59.580
through it twice -- it takes a lot
out of people who go through it.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.100
And I had it relatively easy
compared to a lot of people.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.420
And so I said when I get through
this and get into this job

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.730
that I love so much, I'm
going to focus on that job

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.920
until they drag me
out of the building.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.350
And then I'm going to take a long
break someplace warm and then think

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.140
about what it is I want to do next.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.290
I didn't want to waste any --

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.370
there's so much you want to do in
organization of 1.4 million people

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.760
that -- in 150 countries in
the world, that I didn't want

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.310
to take a lot of time thinking
about what's next and then --

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.960
and any two conversation you have
you got to report to the lawyers

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.770
and then life gets
complicated for you.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:41.560
So, you know, my plan is to
do this as long as I'm needed

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.540
and then go catch my breath.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.600
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Thank
you for your service.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.500
Now's the time in the program
that, if we have questions

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.920
from the audience, we'd
be happy to take them.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.770
Yes. Up front.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.450
&gt;&gt; How many Army [inaudible]
services?

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.520
How should we [inaudible]?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.980
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Well, I'm
Secretary of the Army so, no,

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.070 position:56%
it shouldn't be that way [laughter].

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.980
Well, you know, the -- it's,
it's not really a third.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.730
It is substantially less than
the Navy and the Air Force.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.160
Now they're building
these enormous platforms.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.000
The Army doesn't have aircraft
carriers or nuclear bombers

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.590
or joint strike fighters.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.440
Those programs cost more money.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.900
But I do think that the
Army's -- and, you know what?

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.280
I've worked through
all those departments.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.880
See, they're struggling as well.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.780
And if you think we're
out of balance now,

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.690
look 10 years into the future
for the military budget.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.100
The entire nuclear apparatus
needs to be modernized

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.980
or capitalized at the
exact same time.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.130
Usually you want that
phased a little bit.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.110
New bombers are going to be
coming on line, new warheads,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:57.860 position:56%
entirely new missile system for the
Air Force, new ballistic submarines.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.310
That's not -- there isn't a
plan on how to pay for that yet.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.780
So those services have
their own balance,

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.290
programmatic balance issues.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.210 position:56%
The Army is by far the best balance,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.760
and that just means you've got risk
evenly applied across your budget.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.490
But I would argue that we need to
increase the modernization budget

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.630
for the Army because when I look --

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:22.340
the current plan is to
modernize existing platforms,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.030
but in a timeframe that exceeds
how long we'd ever plan on keeping

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.700
and holding on some
of these platforms.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.450
So I don't look at it
as how it's balanced

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.240
in the pie with the other services.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.400
I just think about the pie itself

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.390
for the entire Department
of Defense.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.950
I mean one of the things I do, as
I've moved through these jobs --

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.160
it is never going to win an
argument if the Army starts

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.560
out by comparing itself to
the Air Force, the Navy,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.720
and some way that they're
hoping makes them look better.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.550
It just never catches water
on the Hill or with OSD.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.340
But we do have some bills
we've pushed into the future,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.810
and it's not just modernization.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.580
It's installations, too.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.350
We're under-investing
year after year after year

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.240
in installations and, you know,
it's a certain amount of money

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.870
to maintain a building, a
certain amount to repair it,

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.030
and then a lot more to replace it,
which is what's starting to happen.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Up front.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:28.370
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:40.210
&gt;&gt; -- on climate change,
a national security issue.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.880
And, of course, the President
has [inaudible] directives

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.180
on that, on that [inaudible].

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.270
Do you think that that is
the thing that is now baked

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.240
into [inaudible] department
[inaudible] or do you think

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.260
that will [inaudible]
next administration?

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.860
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: I don't know
what the next administration

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.250
because I'm not a part
of those conversations.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.790
But I do think it's baked
into the Department of Defense

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.090
in a way that's enduring,
and for two reasons.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.460
We are already seeing it impact
our installations, you know.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.790
Where are Navy bases?

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.090
They're on shores.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.480
And so we're already seeing
issue in the Army, in the Navy,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.310
in the Marine Corps, in the Air
Force, with our installations.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.730 position:56%
But, you know, anybody who looks at
the threatened environment of the --

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.890
or the geopolitical environment
of the future has got to see

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.380
that the other -- the effects
of climate change also are going

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.960
to create all sorts of instability

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.260
that we're going to
have to deal with.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.460
So I do think it feels pretty
baked in for me and it's not just

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.790
on the political side
in this Administration.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.630
It's in numerous strategy documents

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.270
that we've been creating
over the last few years.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.570
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yes, mm-hmm.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.310
&gt;&gt; Excuse me.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.610
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Mm-hmm.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.910
&gt;&gt; Hi [inaudible].

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:47.290 position:56%
What are your top priorities for the
last couple of months of your term?

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.590
And do you have any concerns

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.550
about how an Administration
change might change the direction

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.080
that the Army's headed?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.380
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: My priorities

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.650
for the end are the Rapid
Capabilities Office.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.120
In the next couple of weeks we
will finalize the first round

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.380
of actual investments
for that office.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.700
That is a priority.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.320
I want to keep talking
about behavioral health

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.850
and see what more I can do to
keep moving in that direction,

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.630
the paradigm shift
that I talked about.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:21.040
And then I'm very proud of the
different ways that we have opened

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.590
up service to those who've been
denied the opportunity in the past,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.830
and continuing to make sure

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.410
that that's going smoothly
will be an important part

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.620
of whatever time that I have left.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:42.060
And, you know, I think, you know,
the dramatic changes that I've seen

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.590
in my career with the Department
of Defense is, you know,

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.960
when I said I'm the CEO of business
unit, again, I create a product.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.730
Other people decide how
to use that product.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.320
I'm way oversimplifying, of course.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.040
But that's where you get dramatic
changes from one government

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.340
to another which is how you're
the military in the context

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.220
of foreign policy and all the
tools you've got in the toolbox.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:10.160
It's a complex world out there
with lots of threats swirling.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.370
And so, you know, I'm not sure what
the new Administration will decide

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.970
and how they want to tackle
some of those problems.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.900
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
In back [inaudible].

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.530
&gt;&gt; Hi. Scott Moucione
with Federal News Radio.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.420 position:56%
Talent management has been something

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.660
that Ash Carter's really
been focusing on.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.500
And I think he's been bringing up
some of the promotion board issues.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.950
The Army was in the news
with promotion boards

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.820
because Lieutenant Riley, who was
a Rhodes Scholar, was almost passed

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:46.390
over for his promotion board until
Chief of Staff Milley got involved.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.070
I was just wondering, you know,
one, do you think that the next --

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.520
whoever's going to be in charge
of the Army next will be able

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.800
to recognize that problem since
the Force of the Future has had

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.050
such problems with Republicans.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.120
And, two, what more do you
plan to do in the realm

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.110
of talent management
in your final days?

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.370
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: I think there
are certain issues we're working

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.460
on that -- some might
choose a different approach.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.290
But I feel like there's
a shared recognition

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.800
that the issues are important.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.520
Force of the Future -- the Force

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:23.090
of the Future initiatives
I think are important at --

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.550
you know Secretary Carter's
imagining what a workforce is going

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.480
to look like in 20 years,
and doesn't necessarily see

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.840
that the Department of Defense is
going to be an attractive place

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:39.720
as it exists now for people to work
at, to work for, and I think some

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.020
of these changes are important.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.360
But it's broader than just changing
-- you know, our uniform workforce

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.160
and our career civilian workforce,
I think we have to think very --

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.460
we have to think much
more creatively

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.960
about what a workforce
is and how we access it.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.720
And it might be temporary.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.650
It's how we interact with
industry differently,

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.020
with academia differently.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.130
I think we've got to get much more
creative at breaking down barriers

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.390
which is really what
he's focused on.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.070
General Milley and I have talked
a lot about talent management

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:10.880 position:56%
on the uniform side, and I think
there are some relatively easy fixes

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.850 position:56%
to get at some of these things so
that a lieutenant who's got a degree

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.710
from Oxford, is a Rhodes
Scholar, doesn't get passed over.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.800
And part of that is just maybe
allowing a little bit more time

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.100
in the process.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.080 position:56%
The Army is massive and these boards
move through names very quickly

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.050
and so some of that
nuance can be lost.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.280
And Secretary Carter's
been focused on trying

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.410
to give people opportunities,
development,

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:41.120
career development opportunities,
broadening opportunities.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.130
But we still have these poll years
and it could be hard for people

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:49.350
in uniform to take a year or two
years and actually believe that --

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.420
they may come back onto the
track they're not going to be --

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.970
their career advance is
not going to be hindered.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:58.930
And so we're looking at ways
to make sure that those --

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.630
that people who take advantage
of those opportunities, that,

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.780
that it impacts in a
positive way their career

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.320
and their career trajectory.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.630
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: A question.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.930
Mark, mm-hmm.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.730
&gt;&gt; Secretary, you spoke about --

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:17.180
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.980
How do you see the role --

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.160
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.970
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: So I --
you know, it's interesting.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.090 position:56%
I start in the date -- it's probably
the Navy which has to two services.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.970
And as one Admiral described them,
yes, they're sister services,

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.270
the Navy and Marine Corps,

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.730
but they're orphan children
adopted in separate families.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.090
And then I go to the Air Force and
think, okay, now I've got it easy.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.390
It's one service.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.640
And then I run into the
politics of the Guard.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.700
Then I think I have it all
figured out and I go to the Army

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.000
and we have the Corps of Engineers

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.580
which is then a whole
other political grab-bag.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.450
But first is we cannot do
what we're asked to do.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.820
The Army cannot do what it's
asked to do if it doesn't think

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.950
as a total force and
work as efficiently

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.640
and effectively as a total force.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.810 position:56%
The act of [inaudible] just couldn't
do everything that's being of it.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.620
Second of all, people join the
Guard for different reasons today

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.220
than they did 15 years ago.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.560
One thing I keep reminding -- a lot
of these issues that we focus on,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.280
we do with -- are really
generational.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.560
And 911 was a call to
service for a lot of people.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.130
People who join the Guard want
to be operational in a way

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.780
that I don't think was necessarily
the same case 40 years ago.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.390
And so a [inaudible] formed
leadership may be remembered

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.280
as an older Guard.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.390
The, you know, colonels now,
like my colonels in the back,

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.850
they know the new Guard,
because you go downrange now.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.170
You go out into the field, you
can't tell whether someone's Guard,

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.940
Reserve, or Active unless you ask.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.440
And then the more junior officers,
on a lot of issues, this being one

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.770
of them, just look at me like I'm
crazy for even asking the question,

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.070
like we're already doing it.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:58.710
And so the future of the
Guard is integral to the Army.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.350
And I think we're getting much
better at all of the different --

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:07.650
it can be very political because
the governors have an agenda

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.950 position:56%
for the Guard, we have an agenda
for the Guard, the Adjutant Generals

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.270
of the Guard -- you know, there's
the Guard Bureau, there's the Hill.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.880
Someone once described the active
Army as the President's Army

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.890
and the Guard is Congress's Army.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.530 position:56%
But we've set up a lot of mechanisms

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.290
to increase communication
and collaboration.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.880
And, you know, it got so bad
that the Air Force was asked --

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.430
that the Congress stood
up a commission

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.730
on the future of the Air Force.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.370
And I was in the Air Force and
got to live through that and moved

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:35.740
over to the Army just
in time to deal

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.750
with the Army's Commission
on the Future.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.050
But one of the things
that came out of

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.930
that is this thing called
the Council of Governors.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.030
And it's been a very effective
mechanism with about 10 governors

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.070 position:56%
and Department of Defense leadership
and DHS leadership to work

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.160
through these issues because, going
back to what I said at the start,

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.460
we cannot do what we're
asked to do if we don't think

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.290
of ourselves as a total force.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:01.110
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I think we
have time for one more question.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.160
Right up here, mm-hmm.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.570
&gt;&gt; So if you look at the
[inaudible] going back

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.960
over the last quarter century,

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.530
it looks like there's
a pretty clear pattern.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.900
And if you read budget documents
published at very institutions

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.980
around town, you'd see
the same pattern which is

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:19.140
that pretty much any given force
structure the United States has

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.970 position:56%
seems to somehow require annual real
increases in defense spending of 2-

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.720
or 3% to sustain it, no matter
what, year-in, year-out.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.480
So, given how much management
experience you've had,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.730 position:56%
what's the story on this because I
can't really find a consistent story

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.170
on why this appears to be the case.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.310
&gt;&gt; Eric Fanning: Well,
a couple of things.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.660
If I just broaden that
a little bit and say --

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.000
I think there's a few
reasons for that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.760
One is we don't manage that way.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.060
We don't manage -- if --
you know, in my experience

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.410
in the last eight years we haven't
even managed with annual budgets.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.850
Wonder [inaudible]
resolution right now.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.950
We've started every single year
with a continuing resolution

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:04.470
which is a very disruptive and
expensive way to govern, to manage.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:09.520
If we really took a 25-year
period, snapped the chalk line,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.400
and then went 2- to 3% by year,
you'd get more out of your budget,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.250
out of your program, I think,
than the way we manage now

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.860
where there's no predictability,

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.440
there's no reliability
to the budget.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.400
You can't manage the
Department of Defense

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.570
on a series of 12-month cycles.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.330 position:56%
You certainly -- you know, it's very
difficult to manage in our series

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.240
of three-month and
then nine-month cycles.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.860
And now we're going to get
a continuing resolution

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.530
that takes us in, you know,
probably into six months.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.440
That costs a lot of
money to govern that way.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.820
And people don't understand
the impacts.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.650
This will be the first
administrative transition

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.810
under a continuing resolution.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.920
And what a -- and people --
my predecessor, John McHugh,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.530
was a Member of Congress
for many years.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.900
And he said he thought
a CR was a good thing

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.380
because it kept the spigot open.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.720
Well, all it does is let you
spend what you spent last year.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.890
So if you've got any new
program in your budget,

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.480
you're not authorized
to spend on it.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.780
What does that do to your people?

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.080
What does it do to contracts?

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.380
What does it do to
the industrial brace.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.580
It adds costs year after
year after year to operate

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.510
in such fiscal confusion.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.450
And I -- to me, that's
a big part of it.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:27.320
Now, the 25-year period,
the Berlin Wall falls,

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.730
we took a knee a little bit
because you decide, okay,

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.980
the world is stable enough that
I can take a little bit of risk

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.060
and invest in something different.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.000
We haven't been able to do
that these last 15 or 20 years.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.960
We haven't had -- we haven't been
able to take that balance where,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.360
okay, we've got a little
bit less risk geopolitically

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.960
so we can take some risks
in being ready in order

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.050
to invest in modernization.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.500
And you kind of balance
that out over these curves

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.380
in a 25-or-longer-year period.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.140
So we haven't had that.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.780
And we've had -- we start --

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.760
we end every fiscal year
preparing for a shutdown.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.830
A very inefficient
operation environment

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.270
for the military the
last eight years.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Mr. Secretary, on

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.690
Thanks very much.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:24.430
