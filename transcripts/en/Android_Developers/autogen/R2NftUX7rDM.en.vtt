00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.640
 
good afternoon thanks for coming my name

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
good afternoon thanks for coming my name
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.060
good afternoon thanks for coming my name
is Phil I'm here with Casey and Casa and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070

we want to talk to you about making

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
we want to talk to you about making
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.290
we want to talk to you about making
accessibility easy on Android thanks so

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
accessibility easy on Android thanks so
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.310
accessibility easy on Android thanks so
first a bit about what accessibility

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
first a bit about what accessibility
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.939
first a bit about what accessibility
does and ultimately a lot of engineering

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
does and ultimately a lot of engineering
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769
does and ultimately a lot of engineering
ends up being about assumptions right we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
ends up being about assumptions right we
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050
ends up being about assumptions right we
find that you know usually when we find

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
find that you know usually when we find
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.279
find that you know usually when we find
that we've made a Mis when we made an

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
that we've made a Mis when we made an
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.510
that we've made a Mis when we made an
assumption we eventually discover it

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
assumption we eventually discover it
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.770
assumption we eventually discover it
when we realize it's not right

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
when we realize it's not right
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840
when we realize it's not right
and that happens a lot with

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
and that happens a lot with
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580
and that happens a lot with
accessibility it's really easy to make

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
accessibility it's really easy to make
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139
accessibility it's really easy to make
assumptions about what people

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
assumptions about what people
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610
assumptions about what people
particularly people with disabilities

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
particularly people with disabilities
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.000
particularly people with disabilities
can and can't do if you meet somebody

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
can and can't do if you meet somebody
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.160
can and can't do if you meet somebody
who uses a power wheelchair you might

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
who uses a power wheelchair you might
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869
who uses a power wheelchair you might
make an assumption that they probably

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
make an assumption that they probably
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.740
make an assumption that they probably
don't play soccer and this on the face

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
don't play soccer and this on the face
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.549
don't play soccer and this on the face
of it might sound like a pretty

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
of it might sound like a pretty
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.639
of it might sound like a pretty
plausible assumption but then you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
plausible assumption but then you
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.340
plausible assumption but then you
haven't seen my son's power soccer team

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350
haven't seen my son's power soccer team
 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.810
haven't seen my son's power soccer team
there was a World Cup of power

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
there was a World Cup of power
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.529
there was a World Cup of power
wheelchair soccer so whatever and there

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
wheelchair soccer so whatever and there
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.140
wheelchair soccer so whatever and there
if you like if you meet somebody who's

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150
if you like if you meet somebody who's
 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.490
if you like if you meet somebody who's
who's blind I've heard people who were

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
who's blind I've heard people who were
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710
who's blind I've heard people who were
like for example using photo carousels

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
like for example using photo carousels
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300
like for example using photo carousels
thinking well baby blind people wouldn't

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
thinking well baby blind people wouldn't
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.600
thinking well baby blind people wouldn't
be interested in keeping track of photos

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610
be interested in keeping track of photos
 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.700
be interested in keeping track of photos
no we now have technology to let blind

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
no we now have technology to let blind
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260
no we now have technology to let blind
people take pictures of things and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
people take pictures of things and
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330
people take pictures of things and
they're very interested it turns out in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
they're very interested it turns out in
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.730
they're very interested it turns out in
sharing them with people and then

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
sharing them with people and then
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590
sharing them with people and then
there's sort of the simplest one which

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
there's sort of the simplest one which
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120
there's sort of the simplest one which
is making the assumption that somebody

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
is making the assumption that somebody
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.590
is making the assumption that somebody
who's not able to move their mouth can't

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
who's not able to move their mouth can't
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.609
who's not able to move their mouth can't
speak but of course we Stephen Hawking

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
speak but of course we Stephen Hawking
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350
speak but of course we Stephen Hawking
demonstrated that that assumption is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
demonstrated that that assumption is
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.649
demonstrated that that assumption is
wrong long long ago and thank goodness

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
wrong long long ago and thank goodness
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.399
wrong long long ago and thank goodness
he did so on Android we make a lot of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
he did so on Android we make a lot of
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319
he did so on Android we make a lot of
assumptions sort of I think it seems

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
assumptions sort of I think it seems
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.340
assumptions sort of I think it seems
like a lot of assumptions sort of built

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
like a lot of assumptions sort of built
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380
like a lot of assumptions sort of built
into our devices you take a touchscreen

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
into our devices you take a touchscreen
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.990
into our devices you take a touchscreen
device touchscreen you might assume that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
device touchscreen you might assume that
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700
device touchscreen you might assume that
people can all the users are able to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
people can all the users are able to
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.249
people can all the users are able to
touch the device or that they can all

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
touch the device or that they can all
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.670
touch the device or that they can all
see what's on the screen but of course

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
see what's on the screen but of course
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.850
see what's on the screen but of course
that turns out not to be true and so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
that turns out not to be true and so
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.560
that turns out not to be true and so
these assumptions we have to learn to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
these assumptions we have to learn to
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.190
these assumptions we have to learn to
kind of question them so otherwise they

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
kind of question them so otherwise they
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020
kind of question them so otherwise they
become obstacles and so a lot of what

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
become obstacles and so a lot of what
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059
become obstacles and so a lot of what
accessibility really is is about helping

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
accessibility really is is about helping
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.260
accessibility really is is about helping
people with disabilities overcome

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
people with disabilities overcome
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.470
people with disabilities overcome
obstacles and we want to really the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
obstacles and we want to really the
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.700
obstacles and we want to really the
first thing is just to make sure

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
first thing is just to make sure
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.780
first thing is just to make sure
the obstacles we're helping them

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
the obstacles we're helping them
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.190
the obstacles we're helping them
overcome are the ones inherent in their

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
overcome are the ones inherent in their
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.810
overcome are the ones inherent in their
disability not the ones that we've

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820
disability not the ones that we've
 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.760
disability not the ones that we've
created by making additional assumptions

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770
created by making additional assumptions
 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.200
created by making additional assumptions
about what they're interested in what

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210
about what they're interested in what
 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.760
about what they're interested in what
they're actually able to do so the way

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
they're actually able to do so the way
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160
they're actually able to do so the way
Android does accessibility is really it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
Android does accessibility is really it
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.370
Android does accessibility is really it
depends on the entire ecosystem so we

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
depends on the entire ecosystem so we
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.030
depends on the entire ecosystem so we
who work directly on Android we're all

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
who work directly on Android we're all
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.800
who work directly on Android we're all
we build a lot of the core of it but we

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
we build a lot of the core of it but we
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420
we build a lot of the core of it but we
really depend on the entire ecosystem to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
really depend on the entire ecosystem to
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.260
really depend on the entire ecosystem to
make this work

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270
make this work
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.140
make this work
so the accessibility framework is gonna

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
so the accessibility framework is gonna
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.760
so the accessibility framework is gonna
handle a lot of low-level features

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
handle a lot of low-level features
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.180
handle a lot of low-level features
things like magnification as a developer

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
things like magnification as a developer
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.200
things like magnification as a developer
you're not going to build a

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
you're not going to build a
 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.000
you're not going to build a
magnification experience into your app

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
magnification experience into your app
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920
magnification experience into your app
in order to help ever so that if we try

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
in order to help ever so that if we try
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.270
in order to help ever so that if we try
to do that into every single app on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
to do that into every single app on
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.560
to do that into every single app on
Android we're gonna end up with just a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570
Android we're gonna end up with just a
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.480
Android we're gonna end up with just a
nightmare experience and also it's

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490
nightmare experience and also it's
 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.710
nightmare experience and also it's
something that's really best handled

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
something that's really best handled
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.900
something that's really best handled
down close to the graphics level we want

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
down close to the graphics level we want
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.110
down close to the graphics level we want
to just magnify things accessibility

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
to just magnify things accessibility
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970
to just magnify things accessibility
developers people who work on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
developers people who work on
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.070
developers people who work on
accessibility services like talkback

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
accessibility services like talkback
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.230
accessibility services like talkback
switch access voice access select to

speak they build these plugin services
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.390
speak they build these plugin services
and the ideas that they will generally

have a particular type of user in mind
 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.000
have a particular type of user in mind
and they'll go through and really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
and they'll go through and really
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.580
and they'll go through and really
understand what those users need what

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
understand what those users need what
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.140
understand what those users need what
their challenges are and try to build

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
their challenges are and try to build
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.440
their challenges are and try to build
something that works for them but they

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
something that works for them but they
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.930
something that works for them but they
of course can't do everything on their

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
of course can't do everything on their
 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.640
of course can't do everything on their
own they need to get information from

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
own they need to get information from
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.590
own they need to get information from
like if somebody is blind you need to be

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600
like if somebody is blind you need to be
 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600
like if somebody is blind you need to be
able to speak what's on the screen we

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610
able to speak what's on the screen we
 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.100
able to speak what's on the screen we
need to find that out from the apps

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110
need to find that out from the apps
 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.200
need to find that out from the apps
what's actually going on in the UI and

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210
what's actually going on in the UI and
 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.850
what's actually going on in the UI and
that's where we really need the help of

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860
that's where we really need the help of
 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.950
that's where we really need the help of
the entire ecosystem and all developers

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960
 
 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.490
 
so this general model is that we have

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
so this general model is that we have
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.230
so this general model is that we have
these these plugin services so in this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240
these these plugin services so in this
 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.120
these these plugin services so in this
case switch access voice access in

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
case switch access voice access in
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.170

you want to perform this gesture and do
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.400
you want to perform this gesture and do
it on their behalf but we really need

it on their behalf but we really need
 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.830
it on their behalf but we really need
the apps to provide the right semantics

possible we can automate the process of

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240
possible we can automate the process of
 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.850
possible we can automate the process of
making sure you make your handling these

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860
making sure you make your handling these
 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.080
making sure you make your handling these
things correctly so I just explained a

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090
things correctly so I just explained a
 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.670
things correctly so I just explained a
whole bunch of stuff about all the

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680
whole bunch of stuff about all the
 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.470
whole bunch of stuff about all the
complexities of users and all these

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480
complexities of users and all these
 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.880
complexities of users and all these
different things you can do so you could

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890
different things you can do so you could
 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.410
different things you can do so you could
be forgiven for wondering why we said

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420
be forgiven for wondering why we said
 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.930
be forgiven for wondering why we said
making accessibility easy but I did say

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940
making accessibility easy but I did say
 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.130
making accessibility easy but I did say
making not that we already made but in

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140
making not that we already made but in
 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.720
making not that we already made but in
general what we want is we really want

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730
general what we want is we really want
 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.340
general what we want is we really want
this to be easy I think we want that to

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350
this to be easy I think we want that to
 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.950
this to be easy I think we want that to
be um we want to make sure that we're

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960
be um we want to make sure that we're
 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.210
be um we want to make sure that we're
doing that and for not please let us

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220
doing that and for not please let us
 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.010
doing that and for not please let us
know but if you're using standard

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020
know but if you're using standard
 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.840
know but if you're using standard
components and standard ways it really

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850
components and standard ways it really
 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.280
components and standard ways it really
should be as simple as what I've already

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290
should be as simple as what I've already
 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.320

in Moorestown standard ways it is gonna

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020
in Moorestown standard ways it is gonna
 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.690
in Moorestown standard ways it is gonna
get less easy but what we want is to

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.700
get less easy but what we want is to
 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.940
get less easy but what we want is to
make sure that the incremental work that

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950
make sure that the incremental work that
 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.250
make sure that the incremental work that
you do for accessibility so it grows

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:55.260
you do for accessibility so it grows
 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.750
you do for accessibility so it grows
more slowly than the work you need to do

to think about the development process

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.260

Android accessibility team so let's get

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.040
Android accessibility team so let's get
 

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.120
Android accessibility team so let's get
right into it now if you really think

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.130
right into it now if you really think
 

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.220
right into it now if you really think
about it there are two ways that your

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.230
about it there are two ways that your
 

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.920
about it there are two ways that your
user can interact with your application

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:23.930
user can interact with your application
 

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.100
user can interact with your application
right the first is consuming information

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.110
right the first is consuming information
 

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.780
right the first is consuming information
now this can be content that your user

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:29.790
now this can be content that your user
 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.180
now this can be content that your user
wants or it could be indications on how

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.190
wants or it could be indications on how
 

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.520
wants or it could be indications on how
to use your UI and the way we consume

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:34.530
to use your UI and the way we consume
 

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.170
to use your UI and the way we consume
information varies dramatically from

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180
information varies dramatically from
 

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.810
information varies dramatically from
user to user so for example I consume

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820
user to user so for example I consume
 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.190
user to user so for example I consume
information by looking at what's on

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200
information by looking at what's on
 

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.320
information by looking at what's on
screen and consuming and processing it

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.330
screen and consuming and processing it
 

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.570
screen and consuming and processing it
in that way a talkback user on the other

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580
in that way a talkback user on the other
 

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.310
in that way a talkback user on the other
hand will hear a description of what's

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320
hand will hear a description of what's
 

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.840
hand will hear a description of what's
on screen from the device's speech

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:47.850
on screen from the device's speech

synthesizer right now once the user is

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:51.780

consumed and understood that information

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:53.280
consumed and understood that information
 

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.800
consumed and understood that information
and if combined with the information

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:54.810
and if combined with the information
 

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.470
and if combined with the information
the real-world they can then act on your

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480
the real-world they can then act on your
 

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.230
the real-world they can then act on your
application to make it do things and

00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240
application to make it do things and
 

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.460
application to make it do things and
just like consuming information this

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:01.470
just like consuming information this
 

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.830
just like consuming information this
varies dramatically from user to user

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:03.840
varies dramatically from user to user
 

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.100
varies dramatically from user to user
and from circumstances circumstance now

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.110
and from circumstances circumstance now
 

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.570
and from circumstances circumstance now
these actions can be something like a

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580
these actions can be something like a
 

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.170
these actions can be something like a
tap a swipe a scroll it can be speaking

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180
tap a swipe a scroll it can be speaking
 

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.360
tap a swipe a scroll it can be speaking
into the device some switch users even

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.370
into the device some switch users even
 

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.800
into the device some switch users even
drive the whole device with a single

drive the whole device with a single
 

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.900
drive the whole device with a single
button now once you combine these two

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:20.910
button now once you combine these two
 

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.760
button now once you combine these two
modes of interaction we see this cycle

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:22.770
modes of interaction we see this cycle
 

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.850
modes of interaction we see this cycle
of action and information right and we

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860
of action and information right and we
 

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.350
of action and information right and we
can see that if any part of this is

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360
can see that if any part of this is
 

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.510
can see that if any part of this is
subtly broken for a user or applications

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:29.520
subtly broken for a user or applications
 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.500
subtly broken for a user or applications
become fundamentally useless so our goal

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:33.510
become fundamentally useless so our goal
 

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.910
become fundamentally useless so our goal
becomes how do you make sure that this

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920
becomes how do you make sure that this
 

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.090
becomes how do you make sure that this
is complete for every single user now

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100
is complete for every single user now
 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.829
is complete for every single user now
that seems like a daunting task because

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839
that seems like a daunting task because
 

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.810
that seems like a daunting task because
like we've mentioned before the ways of

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820
like we've mentioned before the ways of
 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.920
like we've mentioned before the ways of
the users interact with our devices

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:42.930
the users interact with our devices
 

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.560
the users interact with our devices
actually varies quite a lot and trying

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:45.570
actually varies quite a lot and trying
 

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.730
actually varies quite a lot and trying
to understand those users is quite a

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740
to understand those users is quite a
 

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.000
to understand those users is quite a
complicated task but if you don't try to

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.010
complicated task but if you don't try to
 

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.680
complicated task but if you don't try to
do anything too non-standard and you

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:51.690
do anything too non-standard and you
 

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.110
do anything too non-standard and you
trust us and use our api's then this is

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120
trust us and use our api's then this is
 

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.670
trust us and use our api's then this is
actually a pretty easy task

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680
actually a pretty easy task
 

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.500
actually a pretty easy task
so I'm gonna show you some trivial

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.510

things you can do which are fundamental
and also put your accessibility to be

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620
and also put your accessibility to be
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.930
and also put your accessibility to be
much better than it otherwise would have

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940
much better than it otherwise would have
 

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.660
much better than it otherwise would have

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.050
very slightly like lighter shade of grey
and that's gonna be difficult for people

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060
and that's gonna be difficult for people
 

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.570
and that's gonna be difficult for people
who that's gonna be difficult for a lot

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580
who that's gonna be difficult for a lot
 

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.730
who that's gonna be difficult for a lot
of people to see because that's a very

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740
of people to see because that's a very
 

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.230
of people to see because that's a very
low contrast ratio it's gonna be

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
low contrast ratio it's gonna be
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.790
low contrast ratio it's gonna be
frustrating and downright impossible for

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800
frustrating and downright impossible for
 

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.920
frustrating and downright impossible for
others so what we should do is we should

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:36.930
others so what we should do is we should
 

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.500
others so what we should do is we should
darken it up and just like that many

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:39.510
darken it up and just like that many
 

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.090
darken it up and just like that many
more people are able to use our

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100
more people are able to use our
 

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.550
more people are able to use our
application the goal here is make sure

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560
application the goal here is make sure
 

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.170
application the goal here is make sure
all of your information is visible in

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180
all of your information is visible in
 

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.540
all of your information is visible in
terms of size and contrast and if you

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:47.550
terms of size and contrast and if you
 

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.250
terms of size and contrast and if you
want concrete guidelines on this you can

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260
want concrete guidelines on this you can
 

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.019
want concrete guidelines on this you can
go to the material website and we can

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:51.029
go to the material website and we can
 

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:52.940
go to the material website and we can
give you contrast ratios and different

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:52.950
give you contrast ratios and different
 

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.530
give you contrast ratios and different
circumstances and also hard numbers in

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540
circumstances and also hard numbers in
 

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.990
circumstances and also hard numbers in
terms of size like the 48 by 48 now that

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000
terms of size like the 48 by 48 now that
 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.370
terms of size like the 48 by 48 now that
was kind of straightforward but there

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380
was kind of straightforward but there
 

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.230
was kind of straightforward but there
are clearly some dramatic variations and

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240
are clearly some dramatic variations and
 

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.510
are clearly some dramatic variations and
how we consume information and for those

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:05.520
how we consume information and for those
 

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.960
how we consume information and for those
situations

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:07.970
situations
 

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.280
situations
what we want you to do is we want you to

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.290
what we want you to do is we want you to
 

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.600
what we want you to do is we want you to
fill in the blanks for our frameworks

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:10.610
fill in the blanks for our frameworks
 

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.040
fill in the blanks for our frameworks
what I mean by that is our framework can

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.050
what I mean by that is our framework can
 

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.079
what I mean by that is our framework can
infer a lot from your view hierarchy

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:14.089
infer a lot from your view hierarchy
 

00:11:14.089 --> 00:11:15.129
infer a lot from your view hierarchy
from the code that you've already

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:15.139
from the code that you've already
 

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:17.079
from the code that you've already
written but there's some situations

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:17.089
written but there's some situations
 

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.319
written but there's some situations
where we need your help let me show you

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:19.329
where we need your help let me show you
 

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:21.519
where we need your help let me show you
let's just say that I'm a talkback user

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:21.529
let's just say that I'm a talkback user
 

00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:23.619
let's just say that I'm a talkback user
and I'm placing my finger on screen to

00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:23.629
and I'm placing my finger on screen to
 

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:25.090
and I'm placing my finger on screen to
hear a description of whatever is under

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.100
hear a description of whatever is under
 

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.480
hear a description of whatever is under
my finger and I place my finger on the

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.490
my finger and I place my finger on the
 

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.340
my finger and I place my finger on the
magnifier icon now I want to hear what

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.350
magnifier icon now I want to hear what
 

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.319
magnifier icon now I want to hear what
that is but unfortunately there's no way

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:32.329
that is but unfortunately there's no way
 

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:33.850
that is but unfortunately there's no way
for our frameworks to figure out what

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
for our frameworks to figure out what
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.460
for our frameworks to figure out what
that means because there is no text

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:36.470
that means because there is no text
 

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.990
that means because there is no text
associated with that I mean it's

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000
associated with that I mean it's
 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.420
associated with that I mean it's
essentially an arrangement of pixels on

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.430
essentially an arrangement of pixels on
 

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.369
essentially an arrangement of pixels on
screen so you guys have to fill in the

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:42.379
screen so you guys have to fill in the
 

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:44.319
screen so you guys have to fill in the
blanks as app developers and you can do

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:44.329
blanks as app developers and you can do
 

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.869
blanks as app developers and you can do
that by adding a label so in this case I

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:46.879
that by adding a label so in this case I
 

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:49.480
that by adding a label so in this case I
decided to label it search make sure you

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:49.490
decided to label it search make sure you
 

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.460
decided to label it search make sure you
keep your labels concise and to the

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
keep your labels concise and to the
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.079
keep your labels concise and to the
point if it's something that indicates

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:53.089
point if it's something that indicates
 

00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:55.720
point if it's something that indicates
an action then make it a simple action

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:55.730
an action then make it a simple action
 

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.689
an action then make it a simple action
verb this is actually pretty easy in

00:11:58.689 --> 00:11:58.699
verb this is actually pretty easy in
 

00:11:58.699 --> 00:12:00.220
verb this is actually pretty easy in
this situation all you do is you set the

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.230
this situation all you do is you set the
 

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.170
this situation all you do is you set the
content description make sure your

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.180
content description make sure your
 

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.910
content description make sure your
string is localized because it's a user

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920
string is localized because it's a user
 

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.769
string is localized because it's a user
facing string and accessibility users

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:05.779
facing string and accessibility users
 

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:10.030
facing string and accessibility users
don't only exist in America now that our

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040
don't only exist in America now that our
 

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.379
don't only exist in America now that our
user can generally understand what's

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:11.389
user can generally understand what's
 

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:13.749
user can generally understand what's
happening on screen let's make sure we

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:13.759
happening on screen let's make sure we
 

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.549
happening on screen let's make sure we
don't let's make sure we allow them to

00:12:15.549 --> 00:12:15.559
don't let's make sure we allow them to
 

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.019
don't let's make sure we allow them to
act on our device appropriately or act

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:17.029
act on our device appropriately or act
 

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:20.439
act on our device appropriately or act
on our application appropriately so I

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:20.449
on our application appropriately so I
 

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:22.329
on our application appropriately so I
decided to add a new feature it's a

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:22.339
decided to add a new feature it's a
 

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.549
decided to add a new feature it's a
clear text button so you can easily

00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:24.559
clear text button so you can easily
 

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:26.019
clear text button so you can easily
instead of having to backspace you can

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.029
instead of having to backspace you can
 

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:28.869
instead of having to backspace you can
easily reset and start typing again but

00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:28.879
easily reset and start typing again but
 

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:30.999
easily reset and start typing again but
that's a really tiny button you know I'm

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:31.009
that's a really tiny button you know I'm
 

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:32.290
that's a really tiny button you know I'm
gonna have trouble tapping that and

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:32.300
gonna have trouble tapping that and
 

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.699
gonna have trouble tapping that and
someone who has some sort of fine motor

00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:33.709
someone who has some sort of fine motor
 

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:34.780
someone who has some sort of fine motor
disabilities gonna have a lot more

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:34.790
disabilities gonna have a lot more
 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:35.949
disabilities gonna have a lot more
trouble typing that it might just be

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959
trouble typing that it might just be
 

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:39.059
trouble typing that it might just be
impossible for them let's make it bigger

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:39.069
impossible for them let's make it bigger
 

00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:42.189
impossible for them let's make it bigger
and now again this works for many more

00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199
and now again this works for many more
 

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:44.650
and now again this works for many more
users like Phil mentioned earlier make

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:44.660
users like Phil mentioned earlier make
 

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.030
users like Phil mentioned earlier make
sure your controls are simple and

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040
sure your controls are simple and
 

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.530
sure your controls are simple and
they're large so I decided to add

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:50.540
they're large so I decided to add
 

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.840
they're large so I decided to add
another feature I decided to add a

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:52.850
another feature I decided to add a
 

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.090
another feature I decided to add a
history feature here you can tap any of

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100
history feature here you can tap any of
 

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.470
history feature here you can tap any of
the queries and see the results of the

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480
the queries and see the results of the
 

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.009
the queries and see the results of the
query again now what do you if you end

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:00.019
query again now what do you if you end
 

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:02.040
query again now what do you if you end
up swiping on that any of these items

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.050
up swiping on that any of these items
 

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.179
up swiping on that any of these items
you'll end up seeing a trash icon

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:04.189
you'll end up seeing a trash icon
 

00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:05.499
you'll end up seeing a trash icon
indicating that this item can remove

00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:05.509
indicating that this item can remove
 

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:08.490
indicating that this item can remove
some history and if you continue swiping

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:08.500
some history and if you continue swiping
 

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.189
some history and if you continue swiping
that item will be removed from history

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199
that item will be removed from history
 

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:14.619
that item will be removed from history
so this is great at all but this is a

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:14.629
so this is great at all but this is a
 

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:16.419
so this is great at all but this is a
pretty custom built gesture over loaded

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:16.429
pretty custom built gesture over loaded
 

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.579
pretty custom built gesture over loaded
onto an item with over load onto an item

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:18.589
onto an item with over load onto an item
 

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:20.110
onto an item with over load onto an item
and it's gonna be hard for our

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120
and it's gonna be hard for our
 

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.290
and it's gonna be hard for our
frameworks to detect

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300
frameworks to detect
 

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.880
frameworks to detect
so again you guys are gonna have to fill

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:22.890
so again you guys are gonna have to fill
 

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.290
so again you guys are gonna have to fill
in the blanks for our framework sent for

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300
in the blanks for our framework sent for
 

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.870
in the blanks for our framework sent for
accessibility uses now you can do that

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880
accessibility uses now you can do that
 

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.760
accessibility uses now you can do that
by adding an action or an accessibility

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:28.770
by adding an action or an accessibility
 

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.970
by adding an action or an accessibility
action and all you have to do here is

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980
action and all you have to do here is
 

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.550
action and all you have to do here is
specify a user facing label or

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560
specify a user facing label or
 

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.990
specify a user facing label or
description of that action again a

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
description of that action again a
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.150
description of that action again a
simple verb and the bit of code that

performed currently you can do that with
 

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.930
performed currently you can do that with
the accessibility action API but we are

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940
the accessibility action API but we are
 

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.610

actually adding something to the Android

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620
actually adding something to the Android
 

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.800
actually adding something to the Android
X library which allows you to do this in

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:48.810
X library which allows you to do this in
 

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.660
X library which allows you to do this in
a single line call with a lambda and a

of thinking about accessibility issues

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940
of thinking about accessibility issues
 

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.340
of thinking about accessibility issues
and how to address them but you still

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.350
and how to address them but you still
 

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.560
and how to address them but you still
need to know how to find these issues

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:00.570
need to know how to find these issues
 

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.790
need to know how to find these issues
and how to verify that you've actually

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800
and how to verify that you've actually
 

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.010

semantics hey guys I'm back so let's
 

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.270
semantics hey guys I'm back so let's
just say that you've adopted the api's

just say that you've adopted the api's
 

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.470
