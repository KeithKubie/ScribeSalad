00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.770
[music playing]

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.830
NARRATOR: At the Hawk homestead
in the remote Ozark Mountains,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.300
tradition runs deep.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.770
OK, what do you think?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.570
NARRATOR: And with
every new generation

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.200
comes a new responsibility to
carry on a sacred way of life.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.970
Having a new little
one in the family,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.270
it's an incredible thing.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.070
But it's a lot of
different pressure.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.430
My primary work partner, she's
got a full time job right now.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.030
Now that mom is taking
care of the baby,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.030
River's been searching
to see that she's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.630
still accepted, wanted, needed.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.130
All right, River, you go
hurry up and finish up.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.500
We've got to get going.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.630
So I'm taking River out to
start showing her and teaching

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.900
her my knowledge
of the land here,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.030
which is really neat, because
it's an opportunity for us

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.600
to start really building
our relationship even more

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.570
just as a father and daughter.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.970
OK.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.600
NARRATOR: Today,
nine-year-old River embarks

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
on a mountain rite of passage.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.630
JASON: I'm taking her out with
me for her first hunting trip

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.670
so she understands the basic of
butchering, of how to clothe,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.300
feed, shelter herself.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.130
These are basic needs of human
beings living on this planet

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.130
that 90% of the people
out there don't even know.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730
Love you.
- Let me kiss the little rabbit.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.000
Be good, Maddie.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.530
RIVER: Can I kiss
the little rabbit?

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.430
NARRATOR: training begins
with the basic tools.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.700
JASON: Set everything
down for a minute.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.030
OK.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.870
Well, when you start hunting,
usually your hunting gear

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.000
is given to you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.030
And in our family, a lot
of it's made for you.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.200
So I made you a
little hunting hood.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.600
Wow, dad, that's so cool.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.430
You'll be
camouflaged, invisible.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.100
OK, and there's one more thing.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.800
Every hunter needs
their own tools.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.530
NARRATOR: River's never
operated a crossbow before.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.530
But Jason chose it
for her because it's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.970
easier to use than
a traditional bow

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.030
and doesn't kick like a rifle.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.130
JASON: Gently.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.300
Get that finger
up on the trigger.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.470
You can set up a kid and
up their chances of success

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.700
with a crossbow.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.330
So I think it's a great
tool to get kids celebrating

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
and getting them excited.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.400
Are you ready?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.200
RIVER: Uh-huh.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
JASON: You got it?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.970
RIVER: Got it.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.930
Squeeze the trigger.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.770
Pretty good.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.600
JASON: Her first
shot off the bat,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.170
she's pretty far
from the target.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.000
She's got some work to do.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700
But it's a good start.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.300
You're in line with that target.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.130
But you're really
shot it a lot high.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.570
The reason we want
to be a good shot,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.170
we do not want to
make the deer suffer.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.230
If you hit the
deer in the heart,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.830
the deer dies really quick.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.600
So it's our
responsibility to make

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.630
sure that we're good shots.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.630
You want to take another shot?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.630
Sure.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.000
All right, you want
to take a deep breath,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.070
breathe, and halfway
through your breath,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.630
squeeze the trigger.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.530
RIVER: I have it
right on the bullseye.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.870
Nice.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.330
Super close.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.470
All right, look at that.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.500
That was a good shot.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.630
RIVER: Yeah.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.630
I was two fingers and a
pinky away from the bullseye.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.830
Good deal, huh.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.630
I'll tell you what,
I think that's close

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.270
enough that you
have earned being

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.530
able to go out hunting with me.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.470
Let's gather up our things.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.300
You look like you're ready.
