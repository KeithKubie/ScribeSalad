1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,430
That's the rat with a pizza. I've seen
that. Oh yeah, the pizza rat. That's,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,860
he's famous. Rats are disgusting
too. Yeah, they're pretty gross.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,140
Have you ever seen that Netflix
documentary on rats? Yeah. No. Oh.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,790
Oh No. Really? Oh Dude. Really? Yeah.
You need to watch it because it's,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,110
um, it's educational. It's not
just gross and it's really gross.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,850
But when you realize how many of them
that really are in major cities. Yeah.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,290
The bio mass of them. Yeah.
It's a fuck stunning. Really.

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,370
York's all rat. Just
rats. This is many rat.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,380
It's more or somewhere in the neighborhood
of as many rats as there are people

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,161
really.

11
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:46,161
And there's 8 million people and there's
how many more as or more she's just,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,260
I mean, you see them nonstop walking
around. I'm just guessing. Yeah.

13
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,500
Obviously most of them are subterranean.
Most of them are living in houses.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,380
And most of them, I mean, they burrow
their way into tiny little holes.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,950
How long does the rat live to question?
How long does the rat live?

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,870
Because they're born,
there's a lot of them,

17
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,740
but do they stick around for like 20
years to the documentary showed how they

18
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,520
send young rats to try out
poison. Oh really? Yeah.

19
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,910
The old suicide rats, they send them out
there cause they don't know any better.

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,770
They let them die. They're just assholes.
Wow. Yeah. They, here's a little tip,

21
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:23,280
if they're ever doing construction
in New York in front of a restaurant,

22
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,040
you don't eat it. You don't
need on that street. Why?

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,570
Because they're digging it up.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,140
Whatever their little ecosystem
is and they're just cool. Yeah.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,050
So if they're digging up the street,
they're dying somewhere else.

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,440
I would imagine in New York and must be
so hard to keep them out of a restaurant.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, it's gotta be so hard. I guess maybe
leave some in the dumpster for him.

28
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,450
Like you give a leg to a
monsters. Just the head. Yeah.

29
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,160
Like when they used to tie the
girl into the, the stakes for Kong.

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,850
So you'd leave everybody else alone.
I did a little shish Kebab stick.

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,770
It's like your last job too.
When you're closing down the restaurant,

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,970
you pull the gates down.
Are Our friend put the skulls out?

33
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,650
Well, what is interesting? What
are those various sizes of them?

34
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,360
They mostly go up to about
two pounds in New York City.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,730
He doesn't think there's any that are
three because they'd be too big to be able

36
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,000
to move around. Right. Like a physical
or physiological limit to their size.

37
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,060
Does it say how long they
live? Average? About two years.

38
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:24,780
One to two years in the wild, up to four.
If you have it as a pet, a wow. That's,

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,140
it could have hamsters.
I like that.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,040
My wife had rats for pets when
she was a kid. Was she Goff now?

41
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,570
She was just like Jersey kid.

42
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,110
Just loved animals and she would just
ride her bike around in this rat would

43
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:40,800
just be like on her shoulders.
Jesus Christ. Drat lady. Weird.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah. It's weird. I get it
if it's here, but it was,

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,860
but she said they were super
smart and super affectionate.

46
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,490
If you had his whole life and you
raise it right? Yeah. Why not? Yeah.

47
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,091
It's not dirty.

48
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:54,420
It's not like going through the sewers
and eating poo and climate in your hand.

49
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,000
Right. But it would,
if you just let it go,

50
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,170
maybe 100% she like had
it out with her go rat.

51
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,590
Like if you just let it let it loose in
the wild. How long would it take for?

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,770
How long would it take for a domesticated
rat to adapt to living in like a New

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,320
York City sewer? 40 seconds.
What do you think they were?

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,330
Do they just get their crazy fucking
Disney movie from the suburbs when he'd

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,500
been living in a house? Yeah,
with like multicolored rats.

56
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,830
They have like all these little
different colors on them. Oh,

57
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,810
you so clean with your pink hair.
Oh, you can different colors. Look,

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,480
hey Joe, get a load of this
one. He's not even Greg. Hey,

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,550
how come you ain't Greg? Look at
you. You're white. You're brown.

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,480
You're like a fucking dog over there.
Thank you. Better than us, don't ya? Hey,

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,890
get over here. I guess you don't
know how to get into the restaurant.

62
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,710
What do you got money on you?
You give us some money,

63
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:01,600
we'll show you where you get all the
good food. Yeah. You ever been a little,

64
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,280
literally wait til I show
you what? It's a show.

65
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,480
Rolling dice. Getting born. A rap.
Being born a rat. Oh. Oh, ugh.

66
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,130
The worst.
Terrible.
