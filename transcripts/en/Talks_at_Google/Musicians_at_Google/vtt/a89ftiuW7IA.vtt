00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon
everyone at the lunchbox.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.100
Welcome to another exciting
Musicians@Google event.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.200
We are very very pleased
today to have the, umm,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.367
premier at Google of
a band 16 Frames.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:19.100
They are here on, uh, talking
about their new debut album,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.767
was called "Where It Ends."

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:24.100
The main song featured on that
is the single "Back Again"

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.233
which came out yesterday.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.533
So we're very lucky to have the
live demo here at the Lunchbox.

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.066
So, the band has received much
critical acclamation as well.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.433
They've received attention
and had many of their songs

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.734
featured on various shows
from MTV's "The Hills"

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.400
to ABC's "Private Practice"

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
and their singles are also
a huge hit on YouTube

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.800
and on Myspace.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.700
So what I thought I'd do first
is give a brief introduction

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.200
to the band while I take a few
general questions and answers

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.533
and then we'll let them launch
into their show,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.633
and afterwards we'll
have some time for

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.166
some Q and A from the audience.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.333
So first, gentlemen, would you,
like to go ahead

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.767
and introduce yourselves?

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:01.600
Daniel: Hello.
I'm Daniel.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.533
Nice to meet all of you.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.433
Steve: Hello.
I'm Steve.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:06.700
Nice to meet all of you.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.600
Josh: I'm Josh.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.100
Steve: And, actually, Dylan,
our bass player, is not here.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900
He's in L.A. right now so--

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.467
so you just get
three out of the four.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.834
You get 12 Frames.
[laughing]

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:20.066
&gt;&gt; So, tell me how you all
got started.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:24.066
Steve: Umm, I wrote a group
of songs

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.400
and I started recording --

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.900
I started recording the record
on my own, and then I met Josh

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
and Josh came in on the project.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.500
As we worked together,
uh, we brought Daniel.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.467
We brought Daniel, so kind
of sort of kinda like a

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.333
"Field of Dreams"if you build it into a concert they will come.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.967
So the band was sort of built
around the making of the record.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:50.300
So by the time the album was
done, 16 Frames performed.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.967
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Awesome.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.066
So, how would you describe
your musical influences

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.266
and have they changed since
you're forming the band

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.166
and recording the album?

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.967
Steve: Uh, why don't you
talk a little bit about that?

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:01.200
Josh: I don't know
if they've changed.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.066
I've been listening to Verve,
and Travis, and Coldplay,

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.734
and Oasis.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.266
I could go on
forever -- Beatles.

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:12.033
For quite a long time,
I think it just continues.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.667
The band I end up liking
adding all new

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.667
and also effect that kind of things.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:17.567
Carolina Liar.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.500
Listened to them today.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.967
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:20.900
How about you, Daniel?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.200
Daniel: You took the words
right out of my mouth.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.800
Travis, U2, Coldplay, uh --

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.633
Steve: Actually --
Daniel: -- Beatles.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:33.533
Steve: See, my first influence
was Elvis Presley

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.767
and Elvis Presley introduced
me to music

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:37.400
and then there's the Beatles.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.200
The Beatles sort of made me
look at song writing

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
and really helped me get interested in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.433
being a song writer,
not just enjoying music,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.100
and bands like The Laws, U2,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.300
those bands sort of showed me about emotion

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.633
and how you could really put
all that together.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:58.133
So those four different bands
or artists really

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.967
sort of formed who I am as a --
as a writer and an artist.

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:02.133
&gt;&gt; All right.
Very cool.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.500
And speaking of things that are
in force, we got, you know,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.567
16 Frames is the name
of your band as well.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.667
How'd you come up with the name?

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:13.667
Steve: Uh, 16 frames
is a film term.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.667
When I write songs I --
I can see the -- the --

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.033
like, I can see the guitar lines,

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.800
I can see the lyric.
It's like a weird thing.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.166
So it's very visual to me.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.834
So, you know, whenever I'm
writing a song I'm trying to --

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:26.834
trying to put it together

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:29.233
and finding that moment where everything makes sense.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:30.834
Sort of like that moment
of epiphany,

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:33.066
getting the moment that
it all flows,

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:37.967
and, uh, 16 frames per second
approximately is that moment

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.900
where the image to
the naked eye becomes

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.200
sort of the most choppy
in terms of fluid motion.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.967
So to me that sort of represents
that moment

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:46.433
where everything makes sense

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:51.500
and me, uh, approach
the music that way,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.600
we approach working
on a live show.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.400
Everything sort of --
we sort of --

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.467
that's sort of our approach
to everything.

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:00.200
Making a record, writing a
song, working on a live set.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.400
It's finding that place where
everything makes sense

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400
from beginning to end.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.700
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool. Well, tell me more about making the record.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.567
How'd you bring everything
together

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.467
and any fun stories
from recording?

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.333
Steve: Fun stories?

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.166
&gt;&gt; Or touring.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.233
Steve: Or touring?
We have fun touring stories.

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:20.233
But we probably don't wanna
talk about those. [laughing]

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:21.300
Steve: No.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.200
Daniel: You gotta be
politically correct.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.100
Steve: That's right.
We're trying to get fans,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.100
not lose them.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.533
Now, uh, making the record
there was --

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:31.200
it's the process is really about
writing the songs for the record

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.166
and, uh, that's where
it all started.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.633
I wrote a song called
"Back Again" and that sort of

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:39.800
was that moment for me
where I realized

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.400
that's where I wanted
to be as a song writer,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.900
that's where I wanted the vibe
of the songs to be

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.734
and at least sort
of built around that.

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.700
And, uh, I would get up
every morning at 10:00 a.m.,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.433
I'd write 'til noon, have lunch,
write 'til dinner time,

00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:57.367
uh, eat dinner, and then write
till, like, one in the morning.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.500
I did it every day and then, umm,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.133
then when I was finished
at the end of the day

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:05.133
I would watch DVDs, and I would
watch "No Direction Home",

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.700
it's a Dylan documentary,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.900
uh, great Dylan documentary.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.900
There's one I think it's called
"Wings for Wheels"

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.133
I don't know if I have
the name right

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.734
but it was about the making
of Warren Robins

00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:15.567
and Bruce Springsteen
documentary

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.500
and, uh, I watch old Dick Cavett shows on DVD,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.467
so I would see, like,
Janice Joplin, George Harrison,

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:23.333
Paul Simon, and you'd watch
all these performances,

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.900
Sly and the Family Stone,
so I would do that every night.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.633
And so I'd work all day --
write all day --

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.033
and then I'd watch the stuff
at night as kinda like fuel

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:33.500
to get up the next day
and sort of inspiration.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.233
Not that any of the
music sounds like Dylan.

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:37.800
I wish -- I wish I could write
lyrics like Dylan, but-

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.934
but I think it's one
of those things

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:40.900
you draw inspiration from your heroes.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.567
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
Awesome.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:44.000
And, uh, and you -- of course,
your video is very popular

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.767
on your MySpace
and YouTube sites.

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:47.500
Tell me a little bit about, umm,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.667
filming the video
with the 16 Frames.

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.467
Steve: Filming the video?

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:53.567
Daniel: Umm, David Gelb
directed it,

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:55.667
a really talented young director.

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:59.266
Umm, we got to shoot it
in downtown Los Angeles

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:01.233
at this, uh, what was it?
Like,

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:02.934
a woodcutting shop
or something--

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.033
Steve: Some kinda warehouse.

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:05.400
Daniel: A lot of sawdust
on the ground.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400
Really cool.
Like, they had these --

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.033
the whole side of the building
was, like, wood slats.

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.700
So, uh, like, literally when
we came in we got in at,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.667
like, six in the morning,
the sun was coming through.

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.900
So when you watch the video
and you see, like, the cool,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.767
they literally had, like,
the sawdust, like

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:22.200
everything in the air
you can see the sun

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.500
coming through the side.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.266
And just really beautiful video,
cool -- really cool video.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.700
Steve: Yeah. So about 6:30 in the morning we're performing.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.633
In order to get all the
natural light in there.

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:32.834
It looks amazing but --

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.033
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good time. Steve: Yeah. 6:30.

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:36.834
We're normally up
at five or six.

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.467
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what I expected.

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:40.900
Steve: But that was
a great experience.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.133
It was a great -- we
had a great director.

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:43.233
Daniel: Really talented
director.

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:45.166
Steve: Yeah. And he did a great job editing it

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:46.734
and putting it all together,

00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:49.800
and we were really happy
with the end result.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.367
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:52.533
So I know right now we got
our concert going on

00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:53.900
at the Lunchbox here at Google

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.133
but what's next for 16 Frames after this awesome show?

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:01.400
Steve: Later today we're gonna
have some lunch here

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.934
and then we're gonna go for
a drive down the coast.

00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:05.767
Now, you know, we're putting
together a tour

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:08.600
so we'll be coming back around
spring/summer.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.467
We're working out the
details for that now.

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:12.400
We're doing promotional
stuff right now.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.800
You know, our album
came out yesterday.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.433
We're really, really
excited about it.

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:17.734
We're a new band on
Verve Universal

00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:19.834
and we're really happy that Google --

00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:22.367
that you guys are having us
come here and play for your --

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.600
your lunch.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.967
Steve: And this --

a little bit about ourselves

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:55.600

why don't we play some songs?

the first song on the --

on the album and, uh,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.000
it's, uh, it pretty much sets
the tone for the record which -

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.800
[strum strum]
Steve: -- is a breakup record

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.967
and every song sort of deals
with it at different angles.

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:14.700
This one is, uh,
called "Close Range"

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.367

called me up one night.

His girlfriend was just,

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:27.000
for whatever reason
she's just, like,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.934
not in a good mood
and she's like nothing's wrong.

Nothing's wrong.

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:32.166
And she just went to bed
and he just called me up

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:33.700
and he's freaking out
'cause he was really suspicious.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.333
He had no idea why.

00:08:35.333 --> 00:08:37.433
And, uh, I really didn't know
what to say to him but

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:40.100
when I got off the phone I wrote
this song and I thought it was a
