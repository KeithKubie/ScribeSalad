00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
So I'm back in England now,
safe and sound as you can clearly see, 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.060
which means now I get to tell you about
the second half of my trip to Tanzania. 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.650
So still in the region of Tanga,
we went to visit Bombo Hospital

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.460
where we got to see some of the really
great work that's being done there 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.180
to try and deal
with malnutrition. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.120
Firstly, me and my mum went to a
maternity class where they talked about 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.300
the importance of breast feeding
and making sure the mother 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.180
has enough nutrients because obviously
that feeds through into the child 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.930
and, I mean I'm sure they talked
about a lot of other very interesting stuff, 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.710
but the whole thing was in Swahili,
so I didn't quite grasp all of it. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.510
And then we went to
the maternity ward 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.080
where we saw these
teeny tiny little babies that 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.130
had been born prematurely
and already malnourished 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.880
because they just didn't
have enough nutrition 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.500
while they will still
inside their mums. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.900
Now my little sister, Bridie,
was born prematurely 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.990
and so when she popped out,
the doctors put her 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.950
in a little heated glass box called an
incubator to regulate her temperature, 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.300
but in Bombo Hospital because
they just don't have the money 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.310
to buy decent incubators,
they've had to improvise 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.660
and so they've turned an entire room into a
giant incubator just using heated light bulbs 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.030
because that's the best that they
could do with what they have. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.620
But after the giant
incubator stage, 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.240
provided that the
babies stabilize, 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.000
they're introduced
to Kangaroo Care, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.630
which is run by
Sister Josephine and is just, 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.490
it's just make do with what
you have at it's absolute finest 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.510
and it just warmed the
cockles of my heart. 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.570
Here, the tiny little babies are
placed onto their mothers' skin 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.320
and because the human
body is incredible, 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.050
it recognizes the presence of the
babies and turns the mothers  

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.950
into living incubators that regulate
the temperature of the little kids.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.780
The program, by the way, is funded
directly by Save the Children, 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770
and it has, appropriately,
saved a lot of children. 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.610
It's saved the lives of 6,000 babies just over the
course of the last year. It's freaking incredible. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.770
Next, we got on yet
another tiny little plane 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620
and I got to sit in the
copilot's seat this time, 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.410
which made me
incredibly happy, 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.480
and we arrived on the island of Zanzibar
to visit some schools in the area. 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.090
Now my mum is a primary school teacher,
and a really good one too, 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.320
and so this is really where
she came into her element 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.000
and got to teach a
couple classes. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.930
She showed them a video
of her class back home

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.020
and gave them drawings that her kids had
done for them, writing greetings in Swahili, 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.680
and then she encouraged them to think
and talk about food, what they eat.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.440
And just as I was starting to
come to expect from this trip, 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
not everybody in the class got
to have three meals a day. 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.680
In fact, one kid in particular, Adam,
only got to have one meal a day, 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.910
which was just some
rice and that's it, 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.550
and he particularly touched my mum's
heart as well when he said 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.550
that he wanted to become
a teacher like her. 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.320
It's the kind of example,
really, of an instance 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.610
where you just want to
take little Adam home

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.160
and give him all of the
food that he wants 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.370
because it's these kind
of personal stories

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.070
that really do hit home, especially
when you see them in person, 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.540
but it's important to remember that Adam
is an example of a much bigger problem, 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.230
and that is what the
IF campaign is about. 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.410
I hope that you can see that this issue is one
that has become very important to me, 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.070
and so if you would like to help out, the most
important thing we can do, honestly, 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.200
is just make it clear to the people
who have the power to change this 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.250
that this is something
that we care about. 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.480
I'll put a link down here to a
petition that you can sign, 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.320
but just as good is just
talking about this publicly, 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.310
here on YouTube or on any
of the other websites. 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.760
Just whatever way
you can think of. 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.230
Thank you. I really hope you
can get involved in this. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.630
I also want to say thank you to
Rosie and Daldy at Save the Children 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.820
for making this
trip happen  

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.660
and to Frank, as well,
for letting me be your friend. 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.090
Very nice of you.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.400
That's all.
Good bye! 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.330
FRANK: Join Charlie to
ending hunger. Thank you. 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.410
CHARLIE VOICE: That's perfect.
Thanks, Frank.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.730

imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,
