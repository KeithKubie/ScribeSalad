the Arabic script one of the
 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.940
the Arabic script one of the
peculiarities of it is that it has no

peculiarities of it is that it has no
 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.230
peculiarities of it is that it has no
capital letters and therefore you can't

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
capital letters and therefore you can't
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.350
capital letters and therefore you can't
tell what a name is if you're relying

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360
tell what a name is if you're relying
 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.550

words that are not would not have been
 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.880
words that are not would not have been
known to Turks in general so the safe

known to Turks in general so the safe
 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.730
known to Turks in general so the safe
thing was to give someone a name that

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
thing was to give someone a name that
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.490
thing was to give someone a name that
looked like a name so that when you ran

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500
looked like a name so that when you ran
 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.250
looked like a name so that when you ran

in roman letters instead of arabic
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.570
in roman letters instead of arabic
letters you had an explosion of new

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:27.910
therefore you had a completely new name
so that you had names like arrow for all

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920
 
 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.080
 
things that never occurred in Turkish

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090
things that never occurred in Turkish
 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.490
things that never occurred in Turkish
before and this became characteristic of

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500
before and this became characteristic of
 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.160
before and this became characteristic of
Turkey because that Turks have names now

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170
Turkey because that Turks have names now
 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.070
Turkey because that Turks have names now
that are dramatically different from the

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080
that are dramatically different from the
 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.020
that are dramatically different from the
names in the Arab world or the names of

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030
names in the Arab world or the names of
 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.560
names in the Arab world or the names of
Iran

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570
Iran
 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.570
Iran
whereas at one time they had names that

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580
whereas at one time they had names that
 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.110
whereas at one time they had names that
were almost indistinguishable from from

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120
were almost indistinguishable from from
 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.190
were almost indistinguishable from from
Iranian names or Arabic names and of

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200
Iranian names or Arabic names and of
 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.420
Iranian names or Arabic names and of
course one of the results is that Turks

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430
 
 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.640
 
using a Roman script that is used in

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650
using a Roman script that is used in
 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.530
using a Roman script that is used in
Europe that contributes to a feeling of

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540
Europe that contributes to a feeling of
 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.870
Europe that contributes to a feeling of
affinity with Europe that has become

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880
affinity with Europe that has become
 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.010
affinity with Europe that has become
politically important in the quest of

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020
politically important in the quest of
 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.900
politically important in the quest of
Turkey to become part of the European

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910
Turkey to become part of the European
 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.870
Turkey to become part of the European
Union when you change the technology on

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880
Union when you change the technology on
 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.830
Union when you change the technology on
the one hand you cut people off from a

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840
 
 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.920
 
from a previous technology because they

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930
from a previous technology because they
 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.000
from a previous technology because they
become dependent on only those segments

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010
become dependent on only those segments
 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.190
become dependent on only those segments
of that technology that make it across a

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.200
of that technology that make it across a
 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.720
of that technology that make it across a
barrier of technological change but you

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:39.730
barrier of technological change but you
 

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.420
barrier of technological change but you
also open up new possibilities because

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430
also open up new possibilities because
 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.690
also open up new possibilities because
the new technology may may create a

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700
the new technology may may create a
 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.620
the new technology may may create a
linkage in some direction that was not

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630
linkage in some direction that was not
 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:56.940
linkage in some direction that was not
previously apparent so that now you know

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:56.950
previously apparent so that now you know
 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.969
previously apparent so that now you know
you have a striking difference if you go

00:07:59.969 --> 00:07:59.979
you have a striking difference if you go
 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.460
you have a striking difference if you go
to Turkey and you look around all signs

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.470
to Turkey and you look around all signs
 

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.090
to Turkey and you look around all signs
are in Roman script and you go to the

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.100
are in Roman script and you go to the
 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.950
are in Roman script and you go to the
older buildings and the old graveyards

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960
older buildings and the old graveyards
 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.379
older buildings and the old graveyards
and you see the old Arabic script and

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:10.389
and you see the old Arabic script and
 

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:15.710
and you see the old Arabic script and
you realize that's you know what a huge

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720
 
 

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.670
 
what a huge step that was

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680
what a huge step that was
 

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.950
what a huge step that was
and I think much a much bigger step than

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960
and I think much a much bigger step than
 

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.290
and I think much a much bigger step than
was anticipated at the time the great

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300
was anticipated at the time the great
 

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.360

question that we have now of course is

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:29.370
question that we have now of course is
 

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:35.740
question that we have now of course is
whether the internet will be a

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:35.750
whether the internet will be a
 

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.680
whether the internet will be a
transition point of that sort as people

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:39.690
transition point of that sort as people
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.850
transition point of that sort as people
stop actually going and reading books

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860
stop actually going and reading books
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.780
stop actually going and reading books
and indeed as libraries stop buying

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:47.790
and indeed as libraries stop buying
 

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:54.050
and indeed as libraries stop buying
books and as books being published will

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060
books and as books being published will
 

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.300
books and as books being published will
books become

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.310
 
 

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:04.320
 
irrelevant except insofar as they get

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.330
 
 

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.260
 
converted get digitized so they're

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.270
converted get digitized so they're
 

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.920
converted get digitized so they're
available online and of course you look

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:11.930
available online and of course you look
 

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.470
available online and of course you look
at projects like the one that Google is

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480
at projects like the one that Google is
 

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.360
at projects like the one that Google is
a set and put books online and you

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.370
a set and put books online and you
 

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.530
a set and put books online and you
realize well those books are

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.540
realize well those books are
 

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.530
realize well those books are
english-language they aren't necessarily

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.540
english-language they aren't necessarily
 

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.340
english-language they aren't necessarily
in a variety of European languages and

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.350
in a variety of European languages and
 

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.190
in a variety of European languages and
you wonder will the technologies that

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200
you wonder will the technologies that
 

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.850
you wonder will the technologies that
are made available to us now

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:38.860
are made available to us now
 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:45.850
are made available to us now
end up cutting off our ability to have

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:45.860
end up cutting off our ability to have
 

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:52.960
end up cutting off our ability to have
access to earlier culture even now most

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:52.970
access to earlier culture even now most
 

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.940
access to earlier culture even now most
people would avoid reading old

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:56.950
people would avoid reading old
 

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.360
people would avoid reading old
handwriting's like from two or three

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.370
handwriting's like from two or three
 

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.030
handwriting's like from two or three
hundred years ago as long as handwriting

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040
hundred years ago as long as handwriting
 

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.480
hundred years ago as long as handwriting
really was a universally taught skill

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:10.490
really was a universally taught skill
 

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.380
really was a universally taught skill
and that people were quite schooled in

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:13.390
and that people were quite schooled in
 

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.210
and that people were quite schooled in
both in the writing and the reading of

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.220
both in the writing and the reading of
 

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.840
both in the writing and the reading of
handwriting the idea of going to the

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:21.850
handwriting the idea of going to the
 

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.460
handwriting the idea of going to the
correspondence or the commercial records

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:24.470
correspondence or the commercial records
 

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:30.310
correspondence or the commercial records
of several hundred years ago was not

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320
of several hundred years ago was not
 

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.740
of several hundred years ago was not
that daunting nowadays and has become

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:32.750
that daunting nowadays and has become
 

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.740
that daunting nowadays and has become
more and more daunting we always think

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:35.750
more and more daunting we always think
 

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.380
more and more daunting we always think
of course that we invented the printing

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.390
of course that we invented the printing
 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.420
of course that we invented the printing
press changed everything

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.430
press changed everything
 

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.250
press changed everything
but of course would only changed those

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.260
but of course would only changed those
 

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.370
but of course would only changed those
things that were printed and almost all

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:45.380
things that were printed and almost all
 

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.350
things that were printed and almost all
right it continued to be done by hand

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360
right it continued to be done by hand
 

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.640
right it continued to be done by hand
down until the 20th century it's just

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:54.650
down until the 20th century it's just
 

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.180
down until the 20th century it's just
that those things were printed as books

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.190
that those things were printed as books
 

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.860
that those things were printed as books
or pamphlets newspapers were the ones

00:10:59.860 --> 00:10:59.870
or pamphlets newspapers were the ones
 

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.940
or pamphlets newspapers were the ones
that were using the new technology and

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:03.950
that were using the new technology and
 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.520
that were using the new technology and
that's another point that I want to make

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:06.530
that's another point that I want to make
 

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.370
that's another point that I want to make
here and that is that the change in

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:09.380
here and that is that the change in
 

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.310
here and that is that the change in
technology may seem to have a certain

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320
technology may seem to have a certain
 

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.120
technology may seem to have a certain
critical point

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.130
critical point
 

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.510
critical point
you say well Gutenberg invented the

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:19.520
you say well Gutenberg invented the
 

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.300
you say well Gutenberg invented the
printing press with Google type at a

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:22.310
printing press with Google type at a
 

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.000
printing press with Google type at a
certain point therefore that is when we

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.010
certain point therefore that is when we
 

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.370
certain point therefore that is when we
begin talking about the print era

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:29.380
begin talking about the print era
 

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.139
begin talking about the print era
but you can also make an argument that

00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:32.149
but you can also make an argument that
 

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:37.509
but you can also make an argument that
the print era came in very very very

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519
the print era came in very very very
 

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:44.259
the print era came in very very very
slowly and that most of the of the

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:44.269
slowly and that most of the of the
 

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:49.730
slowly and that most of the of the
communication and most of the cultural

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:49.740
 
 

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.360
 
contributions for another one to 300

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.370
contributions for another one to 300
 

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.050
contributions for another one to 300
years that were made without benefit of

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.060
years that were made without benefit of
 

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.300
years that were made without benefit of
the printing press so we tend to on the

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.310
the printing press so we tend to on the
 

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.030
the printing press so we tend to on the
one hand I think over een specific dates

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040
one hand I think over een specific dates
 

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.240
one hand I think over een specific dates
and say give them more emphasis than

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.250
and say give them more emphasis than
 

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.740
and say give them more emphasis than
they than they deserve and we tend to

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:13.750
they than they deserve and we tend to
 

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.449
they than they deserve and we tend to
under state the importance of the

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:18.459
under state the importance of the
 

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.569
under state the importance of the
changes that we have a difficult time in

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:21.579
changes that we have a difficult time in
 

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:30.000
changes that we have a difficult time in
dating the there were two writings that

Egypt you have a writing system of
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.019

in 323 the kunio the hieroglyphic system
 

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.850
in 323 the kunio the hieroglyphic system
becomes supplanted so that the written

gradual to be sure but the disappearance
 

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.530

written in those technologies a little
 

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.869

bit like those you know those Turks who

00:15:49.379 --> 00:15:56.769
 
the third technology was the alphabet

you could argue supplanted both of the
 

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:10.599
you could argue supplanted both of the
earlier technologies but this of course

00:16:10.599 --> 00:16:10.609
earlier technologies but this of course
 

00:16:10.609 --> 00:16:12.859
earlier technologies but this of course
you know requires that you understand

series of letters that were short vowels
 

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.000
series of letters that were short vowels
so that you could express you could

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.010
so that you could express you could
 

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.850
so that you could express you could
write down both the short vowel and the

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:14.860
write down both the short vowel and the
 

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.060
write down both the short vowel and the
long vowel and that made it supposedly

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.070
long vowel and that made it supposedly
 

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.350
long vowel and that made it supposedly
more complete although if you text

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360
more complete although if you text
