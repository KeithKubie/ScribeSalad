00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.740
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.400
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.050
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Welcome to the
2018 Commemoration of Law Day.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.550
My name is Jane Sanchez and
I have the honor of serving

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.810
as the 25th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.670
Before we get started, I would

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.310
like to recognize
Elissa Lichtenstein

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.200
of the American Bar
Association for her work

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.930
in making today's event happen
and for her 38 years of service

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
to the ABA Standing
Committee on the Law Library.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.570
Congratulations.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.260
[ Applause ]

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.440
So, here is the good part;
Elissa retired yesterday,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.680
but apropos of her work ethic,
she is here today to make sure

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.170
that everything goes smoothly.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.190
Thank you Elissa.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.050
You have been a great friend
and a great colleague on behalf

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.240
of the entire Law Library
of Congress and we want

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990
to thank you for your
work and dedication.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.510
Thank you very much.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.110
[ Applause ]

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.110
So, now on to the
business of this afternoon;

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.570
Law Day is a national day
to celebrate the rule of law

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.080
and its contributions to the
freedoms Americans enjoy.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.290
Law Day had its origin in 1957.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810
There's going to be
a quiz afterwards,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.470
so just keep this in mind.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.370
Law Day had its origin in 1957

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.420
when American Bar Association
President Charles S. Rhyne

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.320
envisioned a special day for
celebrating our legal system.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.600
On February 3rd,
1958, again remember,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.200
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
proclaimed May 1st as Law Day.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.720
In his proclamation, President
Eisenhower urged "The people

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.900
of the United States to
observe the designated day

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.470
with appropriate
ceremonies and activities"

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.690
which brings us to
today's event.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.890
Today, we are so pleased to
have with us Hilarie Bass.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.310
The current President of the
American Bar Association,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.630
the world's largest voluntary
professional organization

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.050
with more than 400,000 members.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.060
So, just a little bit about
Hilarie; as Co-President

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.900
of International Law
from Greenberg, Traurig

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.740
and a prolific trial attorney

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.950
with a highly successful 30-plus
year career, Hilarie Bass is one

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.440
of the most recognized woman
attorneys in the United States.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.760
She currently serves

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.920
on the Greenberg Traurig's
Executive Committee

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.300
and previously served an
8-year term as National Chair

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.110
of its 600-member
litigation department.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.500
Hilarie is also the
founder and former chair

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.160
of the firm's Women's
Initiative.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.170
Pretty cool, huh?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.100
So, Hilarie can you tell
us about your career

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.140
and how did you become;
how did you decide

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.850
to become an attorney?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.200
We're starting with
a softball question.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.820
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Okay.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.850
So, I always enjoyed government.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.440
I was always very politically
active and so when I went

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.690
to undergrad at George
Washington University,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.460
I studied political science.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.760
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.830
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: And really
enjoyed political philosophy,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.820
but I graduated when
I was 20 and decided

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.520
that was a little too
early to go to law school.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.690
So, I went to New York for
3 years and was an actress

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.460
which was the other passion.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.760
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.060
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: That I had
throughout the time I was

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.020
in high school, and had this bit
part on a soap and when the soap

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.730
on NBC went off the air,
I said "that's a sign,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.350
time to go to law school."

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.800
So, went to law school and
started at my current firm

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.040
as a summer associate between
my second and third year.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.340
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.590
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Accepted
the job on the spot

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.850
when it was offered at the end
of the summer and never left.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.890
Obviously, I can't find
another job or something.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.600
So, that's been,
yes, a while ago.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.610
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So,
what was the soap?

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.140
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: It
was called "Summerset."

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.980
It was a spinoff
of "Another World."

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.120
It was on the air for
7 years, and as I say,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.640
if it hadn't gone off the air, I
don't know if I would have gone

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760
to law school after
all, I don't know.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.770
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Well, maybe
you have a second career?

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.070
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Right.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.370
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.260
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So, what
obstacles did you face

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.700
in your legal career if any?

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.920
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: I don't think
I would say they were obstacles

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.220
in my legal career.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.880
I've enjoyed every minute of it.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.450
There are always challenges in
any career, things you do well;

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.760
things you don't do as well
they have to work harder at.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.510
I think for women and
diverse attorneys,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.140
there are unique challenges
in the law practice

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.880
as there are in many
other fields.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.380
We continue to make progress,
but they're still there and one

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.680
of my initiatives

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.260
as ABA President is securing
long-term careers for women

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.610
which is really focused on why
it is that women start off 50%

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.580
of law school classes and we
get our first jobs in about

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.150
that ratio and by the
time we're age 50,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.890
half of us have left
the profession.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.190
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.060
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So,
we're doing along,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.790
yearlong longitudinal
study to try

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.120
and evaluate why women choose to
stay, why women choose to leave,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.920
and we're doing a separate
cohort on women of color,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.830
because the statistics are
even worse for women of color

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.230
and the hope is to
come out of this study

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.620
with some recommendations

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.790
as to what legal
employers can do differently

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.150
to make the profession
hospitable,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.310
more hospitable to
diverse lawyers.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.460
Because we're putting
all of this focus

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.040
on getting diverse undergrads
to get into law school

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.080
and then all fighting over
hiring them and then we seem

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.260
to drop the ball and don't
create the support system

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.740
to make them feel really welcome
and a member of the team,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.820
and for various reasons,
they're choosing to leave

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.250
and that's not a healthy
thing for our profession.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.550
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Very good.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.390
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So,
hopefully more about that soon.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.690
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.990
Excellent.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.080
So, this year's ABA Law Day
theme is Separation of Powers;

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.430
Framework for Freedom
and that reflects

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.700
on our distinctive
system of government

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.010
with its built-in
checks and balances.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.530
Why is it important
today to discuss

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.360
and examine our constitutional
democracy

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.830
and what does Framework
for Freedom mean to you?

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.880
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So, I came
up with the theme as one

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.140
of the things that the president
gets to do, is about 15 months

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.230
in advance to pick the
focus of your Law Day

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.610
and given what was going on
in our democratic system,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.510
I couldn't think of something
that was more appropriate

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.930
than going back to the concept
of 3 separate but equal branches

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.730
of government, because
it seems to me

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.910
that there is a certain
level of ignorance

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.360
about what the Constitution
really says and what it had

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.230
in mind when it talks
about checks and bal;

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.920
or it doesn't talk about
checks and balances,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.030
but a system was designed to
ensure checks and balances

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.190
and I read a study recently
that I'm sure many people

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.420
in this room are familiar with
that indicated that only 26%

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.070
of our American citizens can
even identify our 3 branches

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.370
of government.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.670
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Oh, boy.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.970
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So,
that's a scary thought,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.230
because when you look at
the challenges that we face

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.660
as do many other
democracies around the world,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.560
one of the most important things
to ensure the future protection

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.990
of our democracy is for people

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.170
to understand the way
it's supposed to work.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.960
And I fear that the
lack of focus

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.360
on civics education is
leading to a real ignorance

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.410
about our Constitution, about
the concept of 3 separate

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:55.060
but equal branches, and even at
the highest levels there seems

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.170
to be a lack of clarity.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.050
So, one of the statements I made
earlier in the year was directed

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.970
at some criticism
of our judiciary

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.540
when our President suggested

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.740
that our judiciary was not
giving appropriate deference

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.630
to the Executive Branch, and
in my statement, I simply said

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.980
that actually our
Federal Judges were oath

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.230
to the Constitution not to a
particular branch of government,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.740
but it's sort of a
reflection of that.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.190
A lack of understanding that an
independent judiciary is there

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.250
to act as a check and balances
on the other 2 branches

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.120
of government and
that's a healthy thing

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.680
and that's the way the
system was designed.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.880
And I fear that ignorance

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.330
about what was contemplated
will be a challenge for us

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.270
in the future, and so,
anything we can do to focus

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.220
on greater civics education
I think is a positive.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.800
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So, what do
you think we can do about that,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.100
because I agree with you?

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.810
I think civics education
is not something

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.630
that is emphasized now.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.170
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: I would suggest
that that's one of these things

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.930
that civic activism
can make a difference.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.030
I mean, as we've seen across
the country in the last month,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.820
people are really unhappy
about the lack of funding

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.860
for our public education system.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.500
You saw it in West Virginia,
in Kentucky, in Arizona,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.180
in Colorado, and I think
it's making a difference

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.780
and I suspect at that level of
civic activism about something

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.850
like civics education
would also be appropriate.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.350
How can you hope to
maintain a democracy when 74%

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:49.360
of your citizens cannot identify
3 branches of government?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.420
How can we hope that they're
going to make educated decisions

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.480
when they go into the
ballot box to vote

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.650
if they don't even understand
the way the system is supposed

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.950
to work?

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.200
So, I think it behooves all of
us to get behind the movements

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.860
that say, we can't just
be teaching to tests

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.670
that teach math,
science, and reading.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.580
That civics education is a
fundamental underlying part

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.000
of any American citizen's
education and anything we can do

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.100
to support that I think
is a very important thing.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.400
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: You
know, one of the things

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.730
that has been happening this
year and I actually participated

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:31.980
in a small march for our lives,
is that it would appear to me

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.830
that some of our
younger members,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.050
younger citizens are
much more engaged

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.280
and much more thinking
about voting.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.640
What do you think about that?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.850
Do you think it has
a lasting impact?

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.610
Or I hope it's not
a fly-by-night.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.240
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: I hope
it's a lasting impact

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.380
and there's no reason
to assume it won't be.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.490
I mean, I live about
50 miles from Parkland

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.510
and I can't tell you,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.360
particularly given how critical
we are of public education,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.460
to see these high school
students come up with a focused

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.500
and really dedicated
commitment to changing the law

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.870
in this particular area of
gun control, and as an aside,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.980
I happen to be friends with a
lawyer whose grandson is one

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.880
of the 5 of leaders of
the effort for the March

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.200
for Our Lives on
March 24th, and so,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.840
I reached out to his grandfather
and I said, "I just want you

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.140
to know that the American Bar
Association has a real depth

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.240
of policy in the
area of gun control,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.700
so to the extent you would like
a representative of the ABA

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.670
to appear on March 24th and
to talk about what the lawyers

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.360
of this country believe is
appropriate gun control that's

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.330
consistent with the
Second Amendment;

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.190
I'd be happy to do so."

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.000
So, he spoke to his grandson
and he came back and he said,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.970
"Hillarie, they love the fact
that you're so interested,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.560
but they decided that
they're not going

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.280
to have anyone over
the age of 21."

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.140
I said, "Well, I clearly
cannot meet that requirement."

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.140
But I, it was so refreshing,
and in fact, you know,

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.210
when I watched it on television,
it was the right call,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.900
because they really did
speak with a unique voice

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.330
that we are the next generation.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.770
We are the new voters and
we don't understand why

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.590
for years people have said
well we just can't do anything

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.890
about this.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.800
So, I look forward to
this new generation

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.230
and how they view some of the
challenges of our democracy.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.040
It's interesting,
Bob and I spoke

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.890
at a Close-up Seminar this
morning on the same issue,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.580
separation of powers and at
the end, the question was asked

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.850
of the students first, when
how many of you do vote?

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.360
Can vote? And how many

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.190
of you will be voting
either by November or 2020?

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.610
And of course, by the
time we got to 2020,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.770
every hand was raised,
but we asked the question,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.870
"How many of you
have an affiliation

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.990
with a particular
political party?"

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.960
Five hands went up out of
more than a 125 students.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.630
I thought it was so interesting.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.190
Also, when we asked them

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.460
about whether they thought
political parties were a

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.840
positive or negative, the
reaction was all negative,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.360
that they thought that they
were the cause of this sort

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.330
of recalcitrance, this
inability to meet in the middle

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.510
on issues before
Congress and the like.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.630
I just thought it
was very interesting.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.110
I don't know whether
it's reflective

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.510
of this young generation's view
of the cause of the stalemate

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.360
in Congress, but clearly they
have a very unique perspective

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.340
on things and I suspect
we will see some changes

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.920
when they begin to vote.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.520
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Well, and
that was one of the things

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.200
that I was so impressed by.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.760
I watched footage of the
march here in Washington,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.970
D.C. and I was actually in
St. Petersburg on that day

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.970
and it was very clear to me

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.190
that there is a strong sense
among these young people

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.120
that they will vote.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.740
They are going to change;

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.070
they're going to
change the tide.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.370
They're going to vote.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.700
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: I
hope that's true.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.000
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: I hope so too.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.860
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: And not just
on this issue, but I just think

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.460
as a matter of civic
engagement, a higher percentage

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.640
of voters is always
a positive thing.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.760
It means a higher percentage
of your citizens care

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.500
about the way government
is going to operate and one

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.830
of the things that I think has
been very apparent as a result

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.790
of this recent administration
coming in,

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.590
is that people I think
are more focused perhaps

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.050
than in the past,
that voting matters

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.980
and there are consequences of
your decision not to bother

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.760
to vote, and if you're unhappy
with the current system,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.610
you do have the ability
to change it,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.530
but it requires you make the
effort to vote on Election Day

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.310
and I hope this new generation
looks at it differently.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.410
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So, what do you
think separation of powers means

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.620
to the legal profession
writ large?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.080
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Well, I guess
for the legal profession,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.340
the most important thing that
we do is support the concept

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.580
of an independent judiciary,
because I think when you look

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:27.040
across the globe whether it's
in Turkey or Hungary, or Poland,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.970
whenever anyone is in
power and they want

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:34.970
to minimize the ability for
descent to percolate up,

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.970
the first thing they
do is attack the judges

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.170
and the next thing they
do is attack the lawyers,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.500
and I think you see that
over and over again.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.170
And so, for the legal
profession, first and foremost,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.140
is speaking out on the
independence of the judiciary.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.020
We have some unique
challenges in that regard

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.650
and we see it every week.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.320
Just last week, we
saw that, as you know,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.150
the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court made certain decisions

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:11.090
about the Congressional maps and
it went up to the Supreme Court

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:14.040
to try and reverse it and
twice the court said, "No,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.250
we're going to leave it with
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.510
And then there were these
news reports that the Republic

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.120
and Legislatures were
going to start a campaign

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.850
to impeach the Democratic
members of the Supreme Court

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.950
of the State of Pennsylvania.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.850
It's a perfect example of the
ignorance about the concept

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.320
of separation of powers.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.790
No, no you don't, you
don't impeach a judge,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.130
because you don't
like their decision.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.820
That's not what our concept of
checks and balances is supposed

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:51.720
to mean, but the ABA spoke
out about it and I think a lot

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.910
of other organized groups did
and the latest I've heard is

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.400
that this effort is going by
the wayside, but it's something

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.230
that requires tremendous
vigilance.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.640
It's one thing to be unhappy
with the legal opinion,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.110
any judge can get it wrong on
any particular day and even

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.050
if many people think that he
has, or he or she has it right,

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.170
it's our right under the
First Amendment to be critical

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.990
of a judicial opinion,
but that's very different

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.580
than criticizing the
individual judge either

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.840
because of their ethnicity
or because you want

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.480
to call them an inappropriate
name,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.200
that is not what our judiciary
stands for in the country

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.990
and that's certainly not what's
contemplated with the concept

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.900
of separation of powers.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.680
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: What
do you think separation

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.840
of powers means to
American citizens?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.900
I know we, you've
touched on that already.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.600
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Well, I fear
that it doesn't mean enough,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.120
because I don't think
most people understand it.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.940
This idea that the reason

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.130
that the constitutional framers
gave lifetime appointments

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:02.920
to judges was to insulate them
from the politics of the day;

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.210
was to say we're going
to give you the authority

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.560
to consider what the executive
does, what the legislature does

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.550
and the way we're going to
protect you from the politics

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.560
of the day and from being swayed
as to what the interpretation

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.200
of constitution should be, is to
give you lifetime appointments.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.020
And so, this constant
criticism of,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.660
well if you don't vote my
way, you know, let's get you

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.390
out of office is a real
reflection of ignorance

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.070
about what the framers
contemplated, so again,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.610
I comeback to civics education.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.180
We have to immerse
people in the idea

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.170
of what our constitutional
framers intended in coming

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.030
up with these separate but equal
branches of government each

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.690
of which serves as a check
and a balance on the others.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.990
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Can
you talk a little bit

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:59.200
about your term as
ABA President?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.760
What do you hope your legacy
will be to practicing lawyers,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.290
future lawyers, and to society?

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.330
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So,
that's a broad category.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.430
But I can tell you the
things that I'm focused on.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.540
One of them as I
mentioned was this issue

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.100
about the diversifying the
profession and to not just focus

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.040
on getting the pipeline,
but ensuring

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.490
that our profession really is
hospitable to diverse lawyers

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.390
and that they don't
perceive that they're held

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.400
to some higher standard than
the other white male colleagues.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.300
We've also been spending
a lot of time focusing

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.750
on this commission on the
future of legal education,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.220
because most practicing lawyers
understand the transformative

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.150
change that's going on
in the practice of law.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.720
Some people suggest
that the next 20 years

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.940
of the law practice is going
to be more transformative

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.030
than the last 200, and
yet we're still educating

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:03.040
and testing our lawyers as if
they're practicing in 1950.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.520
And so, this commission on the
future of legal ED is trying

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.860
to find some alignment
between what we're teaching

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.380
in law school, how we're
testing our law grads,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.890
and what legal employers expect
them to be capable of knowing

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.030
when they get out of law school.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.700
So, you know, you've heard a lot
of people talk about the issue

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.430
of whether law school should
be 2 years or 3 years,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.020
it's just one example of
many, but many people think

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.330
that if you had a
2-year law school program

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.520
with a mandatory
internship of 1 or 2 years,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.710
so that by the time
law grads came out,

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:45.170
they actually had been solving
client problems for a year or 2;

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.920
most people think they would
be much more client-ready,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.190
much more capable of solving
client problems at that point

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.880
than just sitting in a substance
class for another year.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.960
It would also potentially
minimize their debt

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.860
which is another major issue
for law students by coming

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.660
out with a press of debt at
a time when many of the wages

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.270
for lawyers are going down.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:15.490
So, right now, we
continue to test lawyers

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.910
as if they're all
general practitioners.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.360
Most lawyers today
specialize and

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.660
yet we give them
a 3-day Bar Exam

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.180
or some states 2-day Bar Exam, 3
years after the basic coursework

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.480
that we're testing them on.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.270
I mean, would anybody
design a system like that?

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.690
Would anybody design a
system where if you mess

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.520
up on criminal evidence,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.300
you have to take the
entire test again?

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.020
I mean, we know from
the accounting example,

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.830
from the med school example,
there are alternatives.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.050
You could give a test after the
first year on, oh my goodness,

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.780
the first year courses.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.310
So, you're tested right
after you take the classes

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.550
and then you take a secondary
test at the end of law school

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.660
about some of those other
issues, and oh by the way,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.250
if you don't pass the
criminal evidence portion,

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.320
like the accountants, we
only make you retake the test

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.560
on criminal evidence.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.770
So, I mean, there's so many
things that seem obvious.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.200
The whole issue of what the
legal skills are for people

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.790
who will be practicing in 2050,
many people say that it's going

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.240
to be critically
important for every law grad

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.900
to know basic understanding
of technology,

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.090
to understand how AI works

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.590
and how it can make them
more efficient as lawyers.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.830
Most law schools are not
teaching any of that now.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.410
So, on the legal education
front, there's much we need

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.270
to do to sort of push
forward to make sure

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.800
that our legal education
reflects what our practitioners

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.740
are actually doing.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.650
One of the other things
that we've been working

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.040
on since I became president,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.510
is something called ABA Legal
Fact Check which is every week

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.340
or 2, we take an issue that's
in the public discourse

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.280
and we post online what
the law actually says,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.600
it's really a response to
this concept of "fake news"

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.410
which is an oxymoron in and
of itself, but you know,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.780
so when our president says
for example, and I don't mean

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.670
to pick on him, but
it's just an example,

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.860
when he was a candidate,
he suggested that anybody

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.740
who burned an American
flag should have their

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.040
citizenship revoked.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.220
So, ABA Legal Fact Check, in
a completely nonpartisan way,

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.810
because the ABA is a
nonpartisan organization,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.980
we said well actually in
1978 in the case of Texas

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.740
versus Johnson, the Supreme
Court held that the burning

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.880
of an American flag was a right

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.630
of First Amendment
self-expression

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.510
for which there could not
be a criminal penalty.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.860
So, any issue that's
in the public discourse

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.590
where there's apparent
uncertainty

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.880
as to what the law really
says, we're addressing it

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.180
and putting it online.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.750
So, over the course
of the last 10 months,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.900
we have put in an ABA Legal
Fact Check on such issues

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.370
as the scope of affirmative
action;

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.480
what types of gun control had
been found to be consistent

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.910
with the Second Amendment; the
scope of executive pardons,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.270
whether or not a naturalized
citizen can have their

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.100
citizenship revoked
and on what grounds?

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.970
Whether or not an NFL
owner can fire a player

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.300
for taking the knee
during the National Anthem?

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.890
Anything that it's in,
this week we're doing one

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.260
on what is the scope of
attorney-client privilege?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.750
And is it what the client thinks

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.260
or what it is it what
the attorney thinks?

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.560
Any legal issue that's the
subject of public discourse

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.330
where there's a lot of debate

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.840
when we actually know
what the law says,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.510
we're positing online
what the law is

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:53.530
and we've gotten well an
excess of 10s of 1000s of hits

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:57.710
and it's becoming a source
for law students, but citizens

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.930
in general, as well
as, the media.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.330
When there's a legal issue
and they want to find

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.700
out the definitive fact as
to what the law really says

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.370
about a particular issue,
they can go and look

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.380
at ABA Legal Fact Check.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.910
So, that's just an
example of some

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.310
of the things that,
that I'm focused on.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.610
I could go on for an hour.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.910
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: That's great.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.210
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: But I won't.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.510
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: That's great.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.250
I understand that at some
point in your career,

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.400
you were very involved
in adoption.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.810
Can you tell us about that?

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.110
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Sure.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.790
So, one of the cases about which
I'm most proud is a pro bono

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.640
case where I represented
2 foster children,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.960
and Florida for about 25 years
had a statute on the books

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.990
that categorically band
gays from adopting.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.900
You could be a felon, you could
be a domestic violence victim,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.850
you could be all these other
categories of problematic things

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.570
and you, there were statutory
basis that you could prove

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.120
that you would be a good parent

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.910
and you would be
allowed to adopt.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.040
The only categorical
band was as to gays

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.830
and lesbians being
able to adopt.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.230
The case had come up twice; once
to the Eleventh Circuit and once

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.230
to the Florida Supreme Court
and had been upheld both times.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.930
Both times it had been filed
or challenged on the basis

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.870
of the adoptive parent saying
they had a constitutional right

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.760
to adopt and they were not
being treated appropriately.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.030
I had the opportunity

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.770
to represent these
2 foster children

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.790
and the foster children had
been adopted by a gay couple.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:40.860
It's interesting, this gay
couple had been foster parents

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.920
for 13 different
sets of children

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.660
and they had decided they were
not going to do it anymore,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.630
because it was too
emotionally wrenching.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.620
They really wanted a
family of their own.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.910
They had decided they were
going to move to Georgia

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.710
so that they could legally
adopt, and they got a knock

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.610
on the door the first week in
December from our Department

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.860
of Children and Families saying,
we have these 2 children.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.330
We had to take them out
of their mother's home

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.740
because their mother
was a drug addict

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.820
and she was going
in for treatment.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:17.430
Grandma took the other 3 and she
promises she'll take these too,

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.090
but we know that you'll
give them a great Christmas.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.470
So, would you just
take them for 2 weeks?

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:27.000
So, they of course opened
their home for these 2 kids;

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.120
2 little boys, a
4-month-old and a 4-year-old.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.280
The 4-month-old had
been [inaudible].

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.690
He literally, his
diaper was being changed

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.210
by his 4-year-old older brother.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.440
The 4-year-old had
stopped speaking.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.600
I don't know what kind of
trauma there was in the house,

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.180
but it obviously had had a
tremendous emotional impact

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.520
on them.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.240
And needless to say, grandma
decided she just couldn't take

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.540
them and so, these children
were there with them for 2 years

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.740
and they finally decided
whatever it took they were going

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.300
to seek to get this
law overturned.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.140
I was appointed by
a juvenile judge

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.160
to represent the 2 children,
and I'll fast-forward,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.180
but after a weeklong trial,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.570
the judge found the
statute unconstitutional

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.990
and it was upheld by
the Appellate Court.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.330
We thought it was going to end
up in the Florida Supreme Court

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.930
and DCF I guess saw the
handwriting on the wall

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.740
and decided that day after the
Appellate Court opinion was

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.380
issued, that they would
no longer ask questions

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.470
about sexual orientation
on their adoption petition.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.130
But, what made the case

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.660
so interesting is the reason
we were successful was

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.960
because we made the argument

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.400
from the perspective
of the children.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.550
It was an equal protection
argument

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.550
that once the state
took these children away

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.300
from their natural parents and
made the decision to place them

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.580
with a foster parent
that happened to be gay,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.250
the emotional connection
was such that we,

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.510
I brought in psychologists
to serve as expert witnesses

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.210
to talk about the
devastating effect

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.560
of wrenching these children away
from what had become a family.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.360
I mean, these kids in my closing
argument, it still brings tears

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.370
to my eyes to talk about
it, I showed pictures

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.980
of the day they came to
this home and 3 years later.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.280
They were in school.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.320
They went to church together
as a family on Sunday.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.140
They were just doing
phenomenally well and the idea

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.030
of taking these children
away from their parents

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:35.340
because some statute on the
books 28 years ago decided

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.630
that these people
were not appropriate

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.770
to be adoptive parents
was just absurd,

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.730
so in any event,
the statute is gone.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.660
It took a couple of years after
the actual opinion for somebody

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.270
in the legislature to have
the bravery to say, alright,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.960
it's already been upheld,
been held to unconstitutional.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.260
Let's get rid of it.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.360
But, I love what I do in the
commercial business space,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.940
but clearly it's my
most important case.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.240
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Very good.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.540
Excellent.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.350
Thank you.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.970
So, there has been a great deal
of discussion about the future

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.200
of the legal profession and
you've touched on that already.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.120
What do you think law practice

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.570
and the legal profession
will look like in 10 years?

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.670
This is where you get
to put your little.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.640
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Very different
from what it looks like today.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.940
I guess I would say,
first and foremost,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.270
we continue to have an enormous
justice gap in our country;

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:40.610
80% of American citizens
cannot afford a lawyer.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.680
So, we can put whatever
regulations on the book we want,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.740
but I was just speaking
at Stanford 2 weeks ago

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.170
at a CodeX conference where
there were 300 legal tech people

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.320
with 10s of millions of
dollars of capital behind them,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.640
and I promise you they are
the going to figure out ways

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.860
to solve this problem.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.710
With 80% of the American
people not being able

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.030
to access legal services whether
it's providing online forms

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:15.630
for free or whether or not
it's, I mean LegalZoom,

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.640
and Rocket Lawyer, and
Novo those are just the tip

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.920
of the iceberg and I do get a
lot of pushback from lawyers

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.550
who say "we've got to
get out in front of this.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.670
We've got to stop this."

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:32.710
And I think about the
Uber and Lyft example.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.910
I know in South Florida where
I live, Uber and Lyft came

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.690
in to the marketplace.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.930
They must of violated 10
different regulations,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.720
because of course, the
regulations all applied to taxis

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.900
and they didn't meet the
standards and they didn't,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.500
you know, have the insurance
requirements and it was a mess.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.880
But what happened?

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.600
They were providing a
service that people wanted.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.410
By the time the county
commission got its act together,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.540
3-4 months down the road
to say "This is outrageous.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.040
You can't do this.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.440
We're going to regulate all
of you out of existence."

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.570
And literally threw everybody
out, through threw both out for

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.910
about 60 days and what happened?

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.430
The public went crazy,
because the public said,

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.000
"What are you doing?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.500
They're providing a
service that we want.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.610
We don't care what your
stupid regulations say.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.180
We want Uber and Lyft.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.600
We want to pay less.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.230
We want the updated cars",

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.240
whatever it was were the reason
why people found this a better

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.770
alternative than having to
call a taxi and wait 45 minutes

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:39.480
for somebody to show up,
maybe, and what happened?

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.690
The county commission had
to back down and, of course,

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.840
Uber and Lyft are now
actively competing with taxis.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.830
I use it as an example of
what I think is inevitable

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.910
in the legal profession.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.810
If we have this enormous justice
gap, it is absurd to think

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.090
that a small group of lawyers
is going to be successful

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.550
in saying, "Oh you can't
practice law over the Internet.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.330
You can't provide free forms.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.550
You can't do this because
you're competing with us."

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.480
Well, what we know is many of
those people are never going

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.870
to hire me and they're never
going to hire most lawyers.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.340
What they're looking for
is inexpensive self-help,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.760
and so I believe
first and foremost,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.900
the biggest change is the
Internet will become a source

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.410
of information, forms,
support for people

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.360
who want basic information to
solve their legal problems,

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.290
because we can't prevent
that from happening.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.650
It's a huge need
that is going unmet,

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.740
so somebody out there is going
to figure out a way to meet

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.880
that need and to monetize it.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:46.800
In the law practice, the other
portion of probably what most

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.630
of our members our ABA
members are practicing in,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.710
I think there are going to be
significant changes as well,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.010
because what we know is

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.750
that technology can make
us much more efficient

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.190
and that our clients, as they
become more sophisticated,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.480
are going to demand
that efficiency.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.630
So, when I look back at
my years and an associate

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.510
in the legal practice,
much of the work

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.860
that I did is not
being outsourced.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:17.030
I can't justify having my
Harvard law review person review

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.190
documents for a document
production when I know

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:25.530
that there is an outsourcing
service 3 blocks away from me

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.560
in downtown Miami where JDs
will review the same documents

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.150
for 40 dollars an hour.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.860
Similarly, my clients now
demand when I get a matter,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.640
I say yes okay this is the
new case and you're going

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.810
to do the legal work, but
you're going to use this firm

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.730
to review the documents, you're
going to use this other firm

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.980
to do any due diligence, you're
going to use this third firm

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.580
for translations,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.620
My point is, that there are
ways to be much more efficient

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.180
than the way lawyers have
practiced historically

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.570
and as our clients have
become more sophisticated,

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.280
they're going to insist that
we break apart how we handle a

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.580
particular matter to
ensure that each piece

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.350
of the matter is handled
by the most efficient group

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:17.060
and that's going to be a very
big challenge for lawyers,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.010
because we are going to have
to figure out how to ensure

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.430
that we're able to
provide our best use

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:29.250
in an economically efficient
way and that's a big challenge.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.550
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: So,

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.780
how different do you think
the legal profession will be?

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.360
You've already touched on
that, but what, if any,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.440
new or different attributes will
future lawyers need to have?

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.830
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Well, I
certainly think knowledge

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.120
of technology is right up there.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.380
There are a lot of
things like, for example,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.410
nowadays you would go into
court for a 5 minute hearing,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.640
and you might be in line with
20 other lawyers, and you sit

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.390
and wait for your
case to be called,

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.630
and you get your 5 minutes
in front of the judge,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.870
and then you drive half-an-hour
back to your office.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.190
Well, why can't all that done,
be done with some form of video?

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.720
I mean, it used to be a big
deal to have video conference.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.400
Now you go to GoToMeeting
or Skype

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.950
and you can put your
PowerPoint up there.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.890
I mean, there's just no reason
for lawyers to be wasting time

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.510
to get into a car and to
dive across town to show

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.690
up for a 5 minute hearing where
they're charging their client

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.230
for 3 hours of their time

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.930
when it's only really
taking 5 minutes.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.540
That's just one example
of many that we have

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.060
to get much more efficient.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.460
I mean, I don't think
lawyers will be unhappy

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.220
about those changes, but it
does require sort of getting

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.060
with the program and
figuring out well

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.340
that means I have a whole lot
more hours of my day to fill,

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.540
which creates some interesting
challenges, but certainly,

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.920
technological savvy is going

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.850
to be an important capability
of any future lawyer.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.150
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:03.210
Any questions from
our colleagues

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.680
and we do have a
couple microphones?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.560
So, please this is
your opportunity.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:17.910
Hilarie's with us for another
20 minutes, so please anyone?

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.870
Come on Elissa, you can
think of a question.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.680
&gt;&gt; No, I have a comment though.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.160
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: We'll get a,
we've got a microphone coming.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.460
There you go.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.760
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.060
I have a. Wow.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.360
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.660
&gt;&gt; A comment relating
to your discussion

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.910
of how lawyers can
use technology

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.110
and technology relating
to legal services.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.600
I had heard at least in the
homelessness, homelessness

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:51.830
and poverty arena that there
are experiments in skyping

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:56.750
with lawyers for clients who
live in rural communities and is

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:01.140
that something that the ABA
is looking at promoting?

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.690
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So,
one of the focuses

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.010
of our pro bono efforts
this year,

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.790
is providing legal
assistance to homeless youth.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.630
There are over a million
children in our country

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.430
that live on the street or couch
surf, but don't have a home

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.470
to go to at night and one of
the things we've been focusing

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.100
on is trying to get our
associations, law firms,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.230
in-house groups to pair
with homeless shelters

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.390
in their community to be
available whether by phone

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:33.610
or once a month in a
homeless legal clinic

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:39.550
to answer basic questions
for these youth.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.300
Two weeks ago I was at Google
and they've been very engaged

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:49.000
in this project and they
have started a program

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.870
where they have a terminal
in the homeless shelter

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.690
where people can Skype
their legal questions

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.960
to an in-house lawyer who's
willing to say; I mean,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.720
it's very easy to get a lawyer
to say I'll commit an hour

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.030
or 2 hours to answer
basic legal questions.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.500
It's much tougher when you say
oh and by the way we want you

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.140
to get in your car and drive
an hour-and-a-half and then,

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.850
you know, battle traffic
to come back to the office.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.140
So, that's a perfect example
where we can use technology

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.070
to address so much of this,

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:25.130
as long as the homeless shelter
has a terminal and can utilize

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.790
that capability, you
can have a whole wealth

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.950
of additional lawyers
who are more than happy

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:33.590
to spend half an hour
answering questions,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.890
and what we've created

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.650
in the homeless youth
space is a whole toolkit.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.280
We have one for Washington,
D.C., one for New York,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.490
one for Florida,
one for California,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.760
where any lawyer can get the
basic information they need,

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.340
because we know the
questions of many

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.950
of these homeless youth
are often times the same.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.250
How do I get back in school?

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.660
I'm a runaway from foster care,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.560
I want to get my
high school degree.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.380
How do I get access to my birth
certificate, because I want

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.990
to get a driver's
license and I'm

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:05.020
in a foster care environment,
I don't know how to do that?

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.470
How do I apply for
public benefits,

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.780
because I believe I
meet the requirements?

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.000
There are all kinds of
questions, but there's a lot

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.410
of repetition, so these
toolkits we put together

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.040
and they're also online.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.490
So, any lawyer sitting
in their office can say,

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.820
oh birth certificate

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.860
or eliminating a criminal
infraction, type it in,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.150
and they get all the information
they need right there

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.230
to answer these basic questions
for these homeless youth.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.750
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Fantastic.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.910
Anyone else?

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:40.510
&gt;&gt; Hi. I found your
discussion very interesting

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:44.960
for when you talked about
separation of powers

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.970
and you mentioned a few
countries, foreign countries

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.340
where this is very acute.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.220
I just wanted to commit from
my knowledge and expertise

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:59.680
in foreign law that this is
a topic that actually appears

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.520
or is it's often discussed
in many more countries

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.970
as exactly the same way
you mentioned as a way

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.080
to empower government

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.020
by reducing the stature
of the courts.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.320
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Right.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.600
&gt;&gt; One of the arguments that
is sometimes made in comparison

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.010
of foreign law to American law
is that look there is a process

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.310
of politics in selecting

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.870
and appointing judges
in the United States.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:42.450
So, that's I think
something I wanted

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.730
to hear your opinion about.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.930
Now, regarding the second,

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.410
to me second among
many interesting points

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.800
that you mentioned, the effect
of technology on the practice

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.840
of law, I think I can
see that in the future

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:06.340
because of technology the
need for lawyers will decrease

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:14.110
and maybe young people should
be advised to specialize

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:18.450
in other professions and
I think that the lawyers

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.780
that could be successful in
the future economy are those

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:28.590
that are not dealing just with
the technical things, the forms,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.900
everything will be
very easily obtainable.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.580
So, all these people that
worked on procedural thing,

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.820
maybe that will be, there
won't be so much of a need,

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.600
but the ones that deal
with the principles,

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.900
the constitutional principles

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.320
for example the case you
mentioned on that adoption,

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.880
these are the important
and always classical types

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.580
of professional legal
work in my view.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.060
So, I wanted to hear your.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.510
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So, let me
take the first question about.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.810
&gt;&gt; The judiciary, yes.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.650
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: So, obviously
every time you have an

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.390
administration change, the
president has the ability

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.380
to appoint judicial nominees.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:15.080
The ABA is involved in
a peer review process

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.180
with every president
since Eisenhower.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.200
This president has us in the
post-nomination review process,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.930
but senate judiciary
still looks to the ABA

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.140
to get our peer review report

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.510
where we do a non-ideological
peer review,

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.480
meaning we don't ask
people what their party is,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.160
whether they're conservatives or
liberals, we're looking purely

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.630
at whether they have the
intellectual capacity

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:44.930
to be a lifetime
appointment judge,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.230
whether they have
the temperament,

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.340
and whether they have the
integrity and that process

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.930
of peer review, remains constant
from president to president

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.800
and I believe it's
one of the reasons

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.630
that this Senate Judiciary
Committee relies upon our

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.820
reports even if they don't
always agree with them,

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.480
because our committee does a
completely confidential review

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.480
process, even I as president
of the ABA does not get access

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.750
to those reports, and they
literally call a 100 people

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.670
everybody who's been,
has been an advisory

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:22.150
to this judicial nominee,
they're law professors,

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:25.310
they're the judges in front
of whom they've appeared

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.140
to really get a full
perspective about whether

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.400
or not this person has the
appropriate temperament

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.950
and intellectual
capability irrespective

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.120
of their ideological basis.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:40.480
So, is there more politics
in judicial selections

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.920
than there have been
in the past?

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.660
Well, obviously anybody
who reviewed what happened

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.580
in the last 6 months of
the Obama Administration

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.650
with his inability to
fill a judicial vacancy

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.450
on the Supreme Court
has to believe

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.580
that politics have
infiltrated that process more

00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:01.500
than in the past, but the ABA
continues to endeavor to ensure

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.460
that politics do not affect
their analysis of whether

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:08.420
or not the person has the
appropriate intellectual

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.990
capacity and integrity
to be a judge.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.670
ON the secondary issue
about technology,

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.040
clearly what lawyers
do will change,

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.760
with 80% of the population
being unrepresented,

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.430
I don't believe there's going
to be a need for less lawyers.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.950
I do believe what lawyers
in the future will be asked

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.860
to do will be different and not
everybody is going to be able

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:33.870
to get into big law and
charge 700 dollars an hour.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:39.370
That clearly is a market that
is retracting, but those people

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.970
who are prepared to go out
there and serve the public

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:44.400
in all kinds of different ways,

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.990
there will be an unlimited
opportunity for people

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:52.690
who are prepared to do that.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:55.130
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Donna, up here.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.910
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:02.080
I have a question
for both of you.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.080
We have before us Jane Sanchez
that is the Law Librarian

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.700
of Congress, the world's
premiere repository

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:20.860
of legal information, more legal
information, more legal trees

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.080
and codes of laws are housed
in the Law Library of Congress

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.810
than anywhere in the world
and we have Hilarie Bass,

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.750
the Chair of the
American Bar Association,

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:37.160
the world's largest voluntary
professional organization,

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.400
largest organization
of legal professionals

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.320
and there is a problem that
you've cited this justice gap,

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.370
access to justice where 80%

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.270
of the people don't
have access to justice.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:56.870
Is there opportunity for
the Law Library of Congress

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:01.050
and the American Bar
Association to work together

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.510
to close that justice gap?

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:06.290
You talk about legal
forms and things, I mean,

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:10.790
could those be collected
and worked

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.590
on by the American Bar
Association and then housed

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.060
in the Law Library of
Congress so they're available?

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.920
Are there other opportunities
where the Law Library

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.800
of Congress and the American Bar
Association can come together

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.410
for the public good?

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.750
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Wow.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.490
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass:
Well, I'm all ears.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.580
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: As the
library, we do not give advice.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.850
We cannot give legal advice.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:42.810
We are a repository and
as you acknowledged,

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:48.820
we are the world's largest
law collection and just

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.600
to be a little self-serving,
as I told Tom earlier today,

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.300
60% of our collection is
foreign legal material.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.820
So, not only are we an exemplary
American legal Collection,

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:05.100
we are also a phenomenal
international foreign legal

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.410
collection as well, but library,
as librarians even though many

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.390
of our librarians
are JDs and MLS's,

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:16.590
we do not give legal advice.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.330
We will help people
do their own research.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.860
We will help them find
the materials they need,

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.870
but we cannot provide
legal advice.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.340
We are not practicing attorneys.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.410
Over to you.

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:33.520
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Well, I
there's certainly a lot

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.660
that whether it's the Law
Library of Congress or libraries

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.290
in general, can provide
as far as capabilities.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:45.750
One of the things that I would
like to see in every courthouse,

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.280
is some kind of ombudsman
that assists people

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.420
who are there pro hac,
meaning on their own,

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.740
to basically say this is where
you go for this and this is

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.990
where what you do
for that, as well as,

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:03.310
a kiosk where every state form

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.170
for the basic filings
would be available.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:11.020
I mean, for example, uncontested
dissolution of a marriage

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.380
without children,
it's a simple form.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.290
Why can't there be a
kiosk in every courthouse

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.840
that has the state recognized
form you just type in your name

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.290
and it puts it out and
triplicate and you're done.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:24.590
They say, "Oh and by the way,

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.930
this gets filed in
the room 212."

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.190
Why shouldn't we make that
available to our citizens

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.230
who are paying the taxes to
keep the building in place?

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.910
Why don't we create
the opportunity

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.240
for online dispute resolution?

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.890
I had hoped this year and it
doesn't look like it's going

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.290
to happen, that the ABA
come up with a pilot project

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.980
for small claims court.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.080
Right now, if you're
a low-income person

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.180
and you have let's say it's
a car repair for 800 dollars

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.780
and the repairman runs
off with your money,

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.800
that's a critical
amount of money to you

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.100
and you have no choice

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.310
but to file a small
claims claim, filing.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:07.060
Our current system requires
that person to take a day off

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.840
of work, get on a
cross town bus,

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.210
travel for an hour-and-a-half,
wait around for 2 hours

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.880
to be called, be given 5 minutes
with the judge to be told go

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.770
in other room and
try and resolve this.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.320
If you don't resolve
it, you come back

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.520
and are told well we'll give
you a trial date, 6 weeks out,

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.610
where you, again, take the
day off of work, again,

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.290
why would we have
to do any of that?

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.880
Why can't we have people dictate

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.690
into their Smart phone
what they're claim is,

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:38.360
have a dedicated email
address where it goes directly

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.020
to the court, obviously
we have to figure

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.760
out how we serve the defendant,
but you can have a judge

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:48.180
on Skype with 2 people
on Face Time

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:53.380
and resolve the whole dispute
within a matter of minutes.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.560
And I believe, that if we have
80% of our population not able

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.970
to access our court system,

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:04.630
there are so many things we
can do to make them believe

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.680
that the courthouse doors are
open to them, because again,

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.220
when you get to the issue
of having confidence

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.260
in our democracy,
if the vast majority

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.630
of our population does not
believe they can access the

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:20.930
courts, that impacts their
view of our whole democracy

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.390
because they believe
it doesn't serve them.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:28.130
It only serves the other
people and that's not healthy.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.310
So, we've got to figure
out a way to ensure

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:33.590
that everybody perceives
that there are ways

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:39.090
to access the courts to
help solve their problems.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.830
&gt;&gt; Appreciate the presentation

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:43.880
and the questions
and their responses.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.050
One comment for you,
you've mentioned everything

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:50.440
from education and, of course,
many of our societal issues,

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.700
you have avertable
army available to you

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.300
that you might want to consider
and that is we're seeing

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:05.280
about 10,000 baby boomers
retire almost every day,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.610
and many of those are
well-educated and had

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:13.490
to get retirement attorneys
and yet we're on the cusp

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.630
of a period where good
health favors many of them

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.400
and they have financial
resources.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.280
We don't seem to have
an organized method

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.930
that could bring those
individuals into the fold

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.400
to help staff some of the.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.700
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Right.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.550
&gt;&gt; Of the positions you've just
mentioned in the courthouse,

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:37.370
provide civic education
by individuals

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:40.350
who are knowledgeable
about separation of powers

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.780
and many others, there
is hardly an issue

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.910
that hasn't been
touched by these people

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:53.160
that have spent 30-40
years in some cases ranging

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.890
from small practitioners up
to the judiciary, so one piece

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:01.010
for you is yes it's great
to talk about the technology

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.260
and the application and the
rest of it, but the human talent

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.220
that you have available to
you might be another piece.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.520
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: I love it.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.820
Thank you.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.120
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Excellent.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.420
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: It's
a great suggestion.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.720
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Very nice.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.400
Okay, I think we shall
begin to wrap up.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.700
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: You are?

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.000
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.300
One question.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.820
&gt;&gt; Well, I've sat here and I've
heard president have asked,

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:27.830
speak on the issues with
women and the legal profession

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.110
and staying in the retention
of women legal profession,

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:32.410
and then you've talked about
you have a task force that's

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:34.910
studying that, but I'd
be curious if you're able

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:39.270
to discuss or add any
perspective on what type

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.570
of things you're seeing

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.580
as to why women are leaving
the profession and not staying,

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:48.610
in particular, especially with
the minority women and their,

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.960
the greater gap and so I
would just be interested

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.260
in hearing more from that.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.560
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: Well, some

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.860
of the consistent
responses we're getting

00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:57.290
and obviously don't come
to any direct conclusions,

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.610
because we'll do that
by the end of the year,

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:04.220
but one of the top things
we hear is women complain

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.210
about something called
"success fatigue",

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.770
and this is basically
the idea that women

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:12.810
and minority lawyers
perceive that they have

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.150
to do everything just
a little bit better

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:18.260
than their white male
colleagues to get the same level

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:21.850
of recognition, and
initially that's a bargain

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:25.120
that we all make because we want
to prove ourselves and we want

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.250
to reach that partnership
level, and be successful,

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:34.850
but at some point, women tell
us it's just very fatiguing

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.570
and at 25 years in, they
finally say, "You know what?

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.080
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.380
It's just too hard.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.740
It's just too inherently
unfair."

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.030
So, that's something
we hear a lot about.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:52.480
Implicit bias continues to
be a major issue not just

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.940
in the legal profession, but in
industry in general at a time

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.930
when we're all trying
to diversify industry,

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.940
legal professions,
boards; what we know is

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.770
that people feel most
comfortable with people

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.510
who look and act like they do.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:13.130
And so, the assumption that were
objective in our analysis just

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:17.070
because we say, "we're
objective", what we know is

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:22.850
that bias infiltrates all
of us, women, men, all of us

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:27.960
and it does affect how we
interact with people and,

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.780
you know, there have been
all kinds of studies done.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:34.060
My favorite is the one with the
orchestras where the maestros

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.660
in response to a class
action by 5 top orchestras

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:42.480
as to why women were only 3
to 5% of the top orchestras,

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.140
and the maestro swore up

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.910
and down "What are
you talking about?

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:49.420
The only thing we care about
is the quality of the music."

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.770
And the way it was resolved,

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.200
that auditions would
be held behind screens

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.980
and they even decided
to put a carpet

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.050
down so you couldn't
tell whether it was a

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.040
clup-clup-clup-clup of
high heels walking in

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.010
or the soft sloughing of
loafers and what happened?

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.590
Within 3 years, the
number of women

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.520
in orchestras more than doubled.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.440
They're now up to 35% and
it's just a perfect example

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.450
because it's an instance
where even more

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.270
than evaluating legal work,

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.120
these concert masters
were absolutely convinced

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.630
under sodium pentothal that they
were reacting to nothing other

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:32.040
than the quality of the music
and it's just a reminder

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.500
that other things
infiltrate our decision-making

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.340
that we're not even aware
of, and so for anybody

00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:42.250
who has 5 minutes today and
has not done, done it over,

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:46.890
go take the implicit Bias Test;
harvardedu/implicitbiastest.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:48.770
It is free.

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:50.480
It is confidential.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.150
You can test your own implicit
biases based on gender,

00:57:54.150 --> 00:58:00.070
ethnicity, religion, you can
even test your bias against age,

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.490
obesity, it's remarkable,
because so many

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:07.810
of us today really
believe we're colorblind,

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:12.410
we're gender neutral, we're not
affected by this and, in fact,

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:16.740
every study that's been done
shows that even at 6 months old,

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.520
if you take babies and put
them in pink shirts and half

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:25.030
of them are orange shirts, they
interact differently by virtue

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.970
of the fact that they others
don't have the same color shirt.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:33.810
So, it's in our DNA that we
just make snap decisions based

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.560
on appearances and that affects
our ability to be objective.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.330
So, take the test.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.050
You will be amazed.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.970
It's a real challenge not just

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.060
for the law, but
across the board.

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.170
How do we get past
our implicit biases,

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:50.980
because it's affecting how
we elevate, compensate,

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:55.750
and promote women, diverse
attorneys, and other people

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.420
who don't look and
act like we do.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.720
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.020
Thank you so much.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.630
Thank you Hilarie for your
insight in today's Law Day.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.930
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: My pleasure.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.250
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: And talking
to us about the future

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.930
of the legal profession.

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:13.260
Before we end today, I want
to recognize a major policy

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.400
that the American Bar
Association approved

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.660
in support of the Law Library.

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:23.080
We want to thank you
sincerely for that.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:26.700
At the American Bar
Association 2018 midyear meeting

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.790
in February, the standing
committee on the Law Library

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.560
of Congress presented
the policy proposal

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:39.050
for ABA PROP 109 adoption
asking the Congress

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.510
to approve the appropriations
necessary

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:44.920
to support the Law Library's
efforts to adequately staff

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.340
and enhance our services,
collections, facilities,

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.590
digital projects, and outreach.

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:54.530
We are elated to announce
that the ABA House

00:59:54.530 --> 01:00:00.320
of Delegates numbering over 500
unanimously adopted the proposal

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.510
as ABA Policy.

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.270
This was unprecedented
and as a result,

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:08.310
the Law Library can count
on ABA's wide support

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.610
for many years to come.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.510
Thank you so much.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:18.060
[ Applause ]

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.110
Just a little bit
more; following up on

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:23.600
that endorsement, Hilarie
sent a letter to the chairman

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.220
and ranking member of the
House Appropriations Committee

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.580
in support of the Library

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:33.300
of Congress' FY 2019
budget request,

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.730
FY is Fiscal Year
Budget Request.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.870
With the ABA's support
and Congress' approval

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:43.200
of our budget, the Law Library
hopes to increase its services

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.080
to the legal community
and increase the amount

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.010
of digital materials that we
offer free from our website.

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:54.620
Thank you Hilarie and the
ABA for all of your efforts

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.390
to support the Law Library.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.530
I invite everyone watching to
subscribe, and everyone here,

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.760
to subscribe to the Law
Library's email alerts

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.530
at law.gov/subscribe so
you can keep up with all

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.800
of our news and events.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.080
We always have something
going on.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.580
Once again, thank you Hilarie.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.880
&gt;&gt; Hilarie Bass: My pleasure.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.180
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: We really
appreciate you spending time

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.480
with us today.
