00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.320
When a man can't sustain an erection a search for explanations begins.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:13.820
In our culture most of these explanations tend to be punitive, humiliating, and catastrophic for both parties.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.180
Do you even love me anymore?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.460
Is that why you couldn't get it up?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.980
Are you not attracted to me?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.200
"I've been doing some research, reading some Freud, and"

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.280
"something happened in your childhood; I don't know, it's your Mums fault, but you're not right."

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520
"You're really not right".

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.560
"John, have you been taking you vitamins?"

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.880
"Hmm? No. I'm going to the chemist and we'll get you some more."

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.160
"I think he must be gay!"

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.680
"All the signs are there."

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.820
The guilty men, for their part, are often hopeless at coming up with any better explanations.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.020
"You're very attractive and Iove you, and"

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.580
"It's just, that's not how it works, and"

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.140
"just...let's...I can't just..."

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.000
"You know, it's just been a really tough time at work"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.180
"there's a presentation and..."

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.680
"Well what if it's you, have you thought about that?"

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.980
"Did you consider that-that maybe it's something that you're doing? You're putting me off."

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.480
"You know, it is not... click your fingers and... here we go... not a magic... wand"

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.120
"It's..."

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.040
"You don't understand"

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.560
To help reframe what impotence is and means

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.480
We would be wiser to turn to some figures, from the world of culture

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.460
For the poet Charles Baudelaire impotence is an achievement of the intellect

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.200
For Marcel Proust impotence is a symptom of deep politeness

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.680
It springs from a solicitude about

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.980
For Stendhal men who've been impotent should be celebrated

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.180
They are going to be self-reflective, modest, able to laugh at themselves

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.260
And probably very interesting

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.720
And for Montaigne

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.680
The impotent man should be celebrated

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.080
for being sweetly unsure of himself

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200
and touchingly uncertain of his prerogatives

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.000
We live in a culture that has unfortunately come to see hardness as the ultimate proof of love

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.160
and cant see virtues in anything else

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.240
But one shouldn’t only medicalise and stigmatise impotence

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.580
We can afford to see it as connected up with some deeply charming

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.560
and occasionally interesting traits that partners might come to respect and be curious about

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.420
As ever, it’s the job of culture to re-frame out experiences and render us a little less lovely and persecuted
