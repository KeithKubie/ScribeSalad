00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt;Richard: Welcome to this week's Android
Developers Office Hours.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm Rich Lyman.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hi.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
&gt;&gt;Richard: You're not Nick Butcher?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: I am Nick Butcher.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.920
&gt;&gt;Richard: He isn't Nick Butcher today because
of the Olympics.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.150
It didn't make any sense.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.289
Yeah, welcome to this week's Android Developer
Office Hours.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.830
We're here to answer your questions on Android
development.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.369
If you would like to join in the Hangout,
please just ping on the thread inside the

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.820
Google+ or Android Development's plus page.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.109
We'll add you in so you can come and ask questions
on Android development.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.260
Things that we don't talk about in these sessions
are product road maps, future releases, other

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.760
things that may be deemed confidential.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.490
It's all about the development and Android
technologies and Android devices, themselves.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.390
Do you have something else to say?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.790
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, you just did it.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
You just did it.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.290
&gt;&gt;Richard: I'd like to welcome Al Sutton back
in again.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.680
He's definitely our most regular attendee
of these Hangout sessions as well.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.720
&gt;&gt;Al: Hey, guys.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.780
&gt;&gt;Richard: Hey, Al.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.400
I should open the chat window 'cause I'll
often post the most useful links in that as

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.490
we're running through.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.480
We have some viewers on YouTube already.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.640
So, I guess--.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, anything interesting going on
in the world of Android you want to talk about

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.430
there before we start the meeting, Al you
mentioned that some cities are offering something

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.550
interesting for developers?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.550
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.940
They're offering a remote testing lab, which
you can sign up to and you can get a lot of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.810
access to devices like the S3 Galaxy Note,
even S2's, Tabs 10.1, just to test out your

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.980
applications remotely.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.960
So there might be some developers who wanna
play around with the S3 because it's, they

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.860
were saying they sold ten million now.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.120
So it's well worth trying out apps on it.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.120
From what--.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.120
Ten million.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.960
From what I can see, you get a number of credits
assigned to you and you can book a 15- or

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.220
30-minute slots and use that device as you
want.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.729
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, much like Testdroid or the cloud-based
testing solution you've seen before, but it's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.170
the free set and just handset devices?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.170
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.820
It looks like, from what I've seen, they give
you a certain number of credits.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.369
You can probably buy more credits if you want
more time.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.549
But you get a certain number of credits, which
I think works out about four hour's worth

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.719
of testing on any device that they've got
in their system.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:15.849
And looking through it, they've got S3s, Galaxy
Note, Galaxy Nexus, the original Galaxy S,

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.510
S2, Tab10.1, various variants even going back
to the original Galaxy Tab 7.0 oh.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.510
So--.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, that sounds quite reasonably
high-end.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.700
What about the lower end stuff?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.870
I think those are often the ones which might
pull up some nibbles on certain apps, like

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.560
the Galaxy Y and Ace and this smaller, lower
end devices.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
[inaudible].

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.480
&gt;&gt;Al: It seems more focused on the premium
offerings.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.640
The Galaxy S, I suppose, is what you could
class the lowest it appears to go to, even

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.269
though it's what's high end a few years ago.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.250
It's a WVJ device, so it gives you that 800
by 480 screen in most of the things you'll

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
see.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.930
But there's a limited selection at the moment,
but it does, it very much seems to be the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.930
higher end offerings.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.069
&gt;&gt;Nick: And what's the URL to that?

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.069
&gt;&gt;Al: [inaudible].

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.069
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069
Create your account there and let's go and
have a look at the test lab.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.110
We get asked a load of physical devices over
the web.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.159
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's cool.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.779
I think Sony, well, nee Sony Ericsson, now
Sony Mobile, I think they're called, offers

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.779
something similar.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.859
I think they have physical--you can basically
borrow devices.

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.069
&gt;&gt;Richard: There's a bunch of other third
party solutions that we could mention as well

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.879
that have a variety of handsets.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.079
Usually, they're not free.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.220
I heard that Samsung is gonna be free for
Samsung developers, which is excellent.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.549
You just book your time slot and get your
device.

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:45.709
&gt;&gt;Al: And the fact that they're carrying ten-inch,
seven-inch, and four-inch and down to, I think

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.909
four inches is as low as they go.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.529
That means you can also cover a range of sizes
if developers haven't got access to tablets

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.760
and stuff like that.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760
It's pretty cool.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.969
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's cool.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.639
&gt;&gt;Richard: Cheers for [inaudible].

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.189
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, you know, the emulator gets
you a lot of the way of the screen-size testing,

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.339
but it's often OEM customizations.

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:05.109
So, if you do something with a camera or something
like that, when real devices can come in real

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.159
handy for the testing.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.159
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.159
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.839
&gt;&gt;Nick: I guess that's really helped out some
people.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:10.839
So, yeah.

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:12.099
Well, thanks for bringing that up.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.689
That's an interesting topic.

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.079
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.750
So, we'll head into the moderator.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.790
I've put the moderator link for the question
for today inside the Google+ post as well.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.521
I was hoping you could see that.

00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.220
It's also at developers dot Google dot com
forward slash live forward slash Android,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.919
where you can track these events going forward.

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.680
We actually have three sets of Office Hours
the following Wednesday.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.470
One in the Asian time zone, one in European
and one in the America time zone.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.310
So, you can either switch to watch it during
work or after work, whichever suits you.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.590
&gt;&gt;Nick: Or, if you're super keen and do the
triple, you win some kind of prize maybe?

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.080
&gt;&gt;Richard: But if you ask the same questions
in all three, then you lose the prize.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
[laughter]

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.500
Just trying to see if you can get three different
answers out of three different sets.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.250
&gt;&gt;Al: There is no prize.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.000
&gt;&gt;Richard: There is no prize.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[inaudible].

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.650
So, onto the moderator.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.560
"Hi," says someone.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560
It's up there.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.710
"A friend of mine has created his IOS application
and he wonders what ways are available to

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.509
convert it to an Android application."

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.130
&gt;&gt;Nick: What is this IOS?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.130
&gt;&gt;Richard: IOS?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.130
I-O-S.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.130
Other products.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.130
&gt;&gt;Al: I think it runs on Cisco routers.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.470
&gt;&gt;Richard: He's created a mobile application
for a platform and would like to bring it

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.470
to Android.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.470
Maybe he don't want--.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.100
&gt;&gt;Nick: Is that Stockholm Syndrome?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.100
[laughter]

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.840
&gt;&gt;Richard: So, I mean, the thing is to become
an Android developer, really.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.060
We don't charge you to get hold of the SDK.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.020
So, you can go to developer dot Android dot
com and start looking through on how to write

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.020
Android applications.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.470
That's gonna be the best thing to do.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.849
We have a great design site at developer dot
Android dot com forward slash design.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.430
And in there, there's some pages around pure
Android, which actually hints as to how things

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.099
should look across different platforms.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:08.259
So, it'll help with redesigning the application
so it looks and fits better into the Android

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.879
ecosystem.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.879
Makes use of the back button.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's the only thing about this topic
is I think the industry as a whole is gonna

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.310
struggle with this a bit.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.940
And a lot of people have looked toward HTML
5 and other hybrid technologies to be the

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.150
shining light that rides in from the East,
saves you so you only have to write your app

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.830
once and it runs perfectly on every single
different platform out there.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.440
But I think that's never really come to pass.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.080
I think if you take a look at Facebook, for
example, used to be the poster child for this

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.969
movement where they were writing a lot in
HTML.

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.870
And while it may have simplified the development
process, I think most people agree that it

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.530
didn't yield the best possible user experience
in their applications.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.539
And it's interesting to see those guys.

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.650
You see Facebook turning around and saying
now that they're gonna focus on native mobile

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.650
applications.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.850
So, I think that really speaks to the fact
that if you wanna have a best in class, really

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.449
responsive, useful application, then you really
need to go native.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.449
That's my view.

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.449
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:07.449
I kind of agree.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.440
I mean, there are solutions which do cross-platform
output from HTML to Titaniums and phone gaps

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.910
of the world, but I'm still yet to see an
application that was done one of those cross-platform

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.080
solutions that you couldn't tell wasn't native--the
bounce backs done in Java Script, the list-scrollings,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.550
things like that.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.150
The native components, the UI components,
across various versions of Android, it all

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.650
is pretty clear, upfront that the application
you're using is a web-based application or

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.650
HTML cross-platform application.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.870
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, you get things like links in
apps which just look massively out of place--highlights

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.340
kind of wrong and scrolling is slightly off
and it just feels wrong.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.449
&gt;&gt;Richard: And, of course, you can't take
advantage of a lot of the platform features

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.580
that Android has for supporting multiple devices--supporting
the seven-inch devices.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580
Nexus 7.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.509
&gt;&gt;Al: It's quite interesting.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:00.229
I see that Facebook at the moment I know are
hiring Android engineers.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:04.909
So, they definitely are moving away from the
HTML 5 experience.

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:07.090
&gt;&gt;Nick and Richard: Who are? Facebook?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.599
&gt;&gt;Nick: Jobs for Android engineers.

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:09.599
And they obviously bought Lightbulb.

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.620
A talent acquisition?

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.719
I don't know.

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:16.240
&gt;&gt;Al: I've heard it's a talent acquisition
rather than anything else.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240
So, yeah.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.650
They're definitely taking people on, so hopefully
we'll see something good from them in the

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.650
future.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.650
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, it should be.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.699
There's been lots of reports of the number
of users of Facebook that are only doing it

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:26.699
from mobile now.

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:29.740
Hundreds of millions or whatever, that it's
just from mobile.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.979
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's [inaudible].

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:32.560
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.900
Where are all the viewers today?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.390
Well, we have viewers on YouTube.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.260
We need some people to join in the Hangout.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.830
Come along and ask some questions like we
have.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.370
&gt;&gt;Nick: Has the men's time trial started?

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.700
We're almost up against the men's time trial.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.260
How can we compete against them?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.110
&gt;&gt;Richard: We get a second live stream in?

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.980
And then people can come to the Hangout to
watch it?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.980
Why not?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.140
&gt;&gt;Al: We need the Android power exercise bike
from IO 11 in.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.270
&gt;&gt;Richard: Cheers to you.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: Good memory.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.760
&gt;&gt;Richard: The ADK Android exercise bikes.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.090
&gt;&gt;Nick: Brilliant.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.430
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.060
Let's have a look at the next question up
there.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.440
&gt;&gt;Nick: As they try to--.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.360
&gt;&gt;Richard: The Google Play content policies
have changed.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
They have, indeed.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.260
If you're an Android developer, you would've
got an email today saying that we've updated

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.410
our policies for distributing applications
in Google Play.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.480
There's details for that inside the email
and then you can look through the link for

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.480
the Google policy.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.230
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, you should have little bar
at the top."So, the policy about games incentivizing

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:43.560
ratings on the market was there already,"
says Mathis, "but it was never really enforced.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.870
Will it be enforced from now on?"

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.470
So, it's a tricky one.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.580
I mean, we don't look at every single game
and play every single application in the Play

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.780
Store, we don't have people that do that.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.030
That's not how the Play Store works.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.830
We're a much more open ecosystem.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:09.330
However, we have systems that look through
the Google Play portfolio of applications.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.420
It's one of the reasons why it takes a little
bit longer for your applications to get published

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.710
now.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.670
We have systems that are bouncer, indeed,
that's looking for malware, specifically.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.310
But we also do look out for things like applications
which have a suspicious number of five-star

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.650
ratings over a short period of time.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.200
So there are systems looking out for these
things.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.220
And of course, we can use those to try and
highlight the apps.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.410
But the main point here is you're definitely
not gonna get your application featured if

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.270
you have this kind of functionality in the
application.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.150
So, the apps that do get fully tested are
the ones that go through featuring, editor's

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.910
choice, and staff picks.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.320
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's also some subtleties in what
we consider incentivizing as well.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.870
Like, you can say, "Please rate my app."

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:53.120
And the best way to do that is to have a yes/no/never
kind of thing, so you don't annoy the user

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.570
pumping it all the time.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.570
But you can't say, "Please rate my app five-stars."

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.260
'Cause that's trying to influence the way
to do it.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.950
And you certainly can't say, "Rate my app
five-stars to get X." 'Cause, well, it's just

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.950
a lie.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.700
There's no way for the app to actually determine
what your rating was.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.710
So there's subtleties in what you can and
can't do.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.100
So, maybe Mathis isn't clear about that.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.970
You can actually ask people to say, "Please
rate my app if you find it useful."

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.590
And please do that in the non-annoying way.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.590
But yeah.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.060
You can't really incentivize them to rate
it, to a particular rating, which I would

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.740
imagine to be five stars.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.090
&gt;&gt;Al: There is, of course, the ability to
report apps in the Play Store.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.730
&gt;&gt;Richard: There is at the bottom of every
app listed on a mobile device.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.370
You can scroll down and report apps.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:40.320
And there's an inappropriate apps form for
reporting on the web store as well.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.080
Yeah, you really don't want to start getting
your applications banned.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.500
Three of those and you can get your account
shut down and other things.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.380
So, it's just much better to abide by the
content policies, how they're laid out.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.150
And not try and work around them in any way.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.280
Now, they have been made more specific in
a few of these areas now.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think the changes are better.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.440
I think they clarify that stuff and I think
they add a few more examples about things

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.250
which I've seen people confused about in the
past.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.480
&gt;&gt;Al: One of the big changes, it seems, to
be getting rid of something that bugged me,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.940
which was notification adverts.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.310
You'd get adverts that appear as system notifications.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.930
They would just, I've not met anyone who have
found those useful or actually used them to

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.250
click on without thinking that they were something
useful in terms of a notification from an

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.300
app rather than an advert.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.300
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.300
I'll talk about advertising.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.830
We might as well go into that a little bit.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:31.050
We've made it very specific now that adverts
inside your application must also abide by

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.070
the same rules as your entire application.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.990
You're fully responsible for every advert
that's shown in that app.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.170
So, if, for example, you're using an advertising
platform and the end user is turning gambling

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.730
adverts off, you should turn them off instantly
because if gambling adverts start appearing

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.600
inside your application and they link through
to live gambling sites, your application can

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.360
get banned from the store for that.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.630
You can get taken down.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.900
People can report it when they can find it.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:59.770
So just be aware that you are fully responsible
for every advert that shows in the app.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.160
Don't put them in the wrong places.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.490
Don't mislead users into clicking them.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.310
&gt;&gt;Nick: Don't show adult ads in an app that
is rated E for everyone.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.930
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, also true.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.930
Yup.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.630
So, just be a bit more careful on the ads
as well.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.640
And this was all covered in the guidelines
before.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.640
Now, it's just very specific and a little
bit clearer.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640
OK.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.350
So, if anyone has any other questions about
the new guidelines, we'll ping them through.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.450
Where are we?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.450
Huh.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.080
&gt;&gt;Nick: One, one.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.390
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.709
Why not?

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.000
From V-1-P. Do you want to go for that one?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.670
&gt;&gt;Nick: V-1-P asks, "How can I access the
phone's incoming call screen inside of my

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.670
application?"

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.670
You can't.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.670
&gt;&gt;Richard: No.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.410
There's a couple of things that you can't
do and that's one of them.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.150
You can't muck about with people's phone calls.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.740
&gt;&gt;Al: Unless you wrote your own firmware.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.180
Get a hold of the AOSP.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.520
&gt;&gt;Richard: You can do it on your own device
if you really wanted to.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's actually some apps which try
and do things a bit clever, don't they?

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.780
Like, by having a window floating on top of
it.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.490
There was the app [unintelligible], I remember
a while ago, which tried to give you extra

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.790
options when you were in call to someone,
so you could easily share your location with

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.430
them or send them an image, like while you're
on the call.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:16.100
They try and do strange floaty over the incoming
call screen thing, but you can't actually

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.090
have interaction with that.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.730
&gt;&gt;Al: There's nothing stopping you though
writing your own dialer application, to dial

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.730
out.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.730
It's just the incoming calls you can't intercept.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.730
Is that right?

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:26.730
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.730
Skype in an example of that.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.770
When you want to make a call, if you've got
Skype installed, it'll come up and say, "Do

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.050
you want to make this phone call using dial-up
or Skype?"

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.930
You can register for that intent and them
as well.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.850
We saw our first application today come through
that was also now registering for this action.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.221
So, when you do that, an ad comes up and says,
"Do you want to use Google now or do you want

00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.221
to use--?"

00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:47.221
&gt;&gt;Nick: Swiping up from the bottom.

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:48.810
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, the swiping up from the bottom.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.070
Actually, it normally launches Google Now
on these devices.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.290
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's changing it.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.510
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's changing it.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.480
Do you know what the intent was?

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: Actually, I heard it was intent dot
inassist?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.590
&gt;&gt;Richard: Could be.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.800
It's there, documented in the latest developer
docs.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.170
I think it was.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.700
&gt;&gt;Nick: In the source code of [unintelligible].

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700
[laughter]

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.950
&gt;&gt;Richard: Just run off the Java and you'll
be fine.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hi, David.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.360
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, hi David.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.390
&gt;&gt;David: Hi everybody.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.690
&gt;&gt;Richard: So you can't, exit on the screen
there.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: OK.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.600
&gt;&gt;Richard: Let's just go back to the thread
and see if anyone else has made a comment.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.130
Are you in the comments here?

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.130
Oh.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.130
OK.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.130
[unintelligible].

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.130
Alex, who's also lost inside.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.190
I'll ask on the moderator.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.270
[pause]

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:48.130
FreeSoul, who is probably the same person
as Alex, asks, "Can I make clickable drawables

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.860
inside a text view?

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:56.050
The drawable created using HTML Image Getter
from Image is downloaded from the web.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.170
I want to be able to zoom the images."

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:05.640
Can I make clickable drawables from inside
of text view?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.640
No.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:16.010
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, I'm guessing he's using HTML from
HTML or link to some linkable methods to try

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.800
and turn some HTML, set some HTML in text
view, right?

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800
&gt;&gt;Richard: Mm-hmm.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.480
&gt;&gt;Nick: Will that load images?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.350
&gt;&gt;Richard: I don't think so.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, David has joined the Hangout.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.171
Do you want to explain your issue?

00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:30.171
&gt;&gt;Richard: That's not his question.

00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:31.171
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, it's not?

00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:32.171
&gt;&gt;Richard: No.

00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:33.171
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, sorry.

00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:34.171
&gt;&gt;Richard: That's all right.

00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:35.171
&gt;&gt;David: I do have a question.

00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:36.171
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:38.060
Well, we'll think about Alex's question whilst
you ask yours, if you want.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.320
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, sorry.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.440
So, you know how they have all these phone
gaps and other APIs and tools to help you

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.990
do cross platform?

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:54.889
Is there any framework, just the idea of a
framework of a lightweight like, wrapper,

00:16:54.889 --> 00:17:00.060
like maybe Google Docs does, where that it's
more of like a link?

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.390
Like, the app icon launcher would be almost
like a link and have a lightweight amount

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.620
of meta data about the person.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:14.590
But if you're always connected to the web,
it would go to the website and download like,

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.050
HTML 5 pages on there.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:23.939
So, maybe keeps your login credentials and
some meta data about you, but really it's,

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:24.970
uses the HTML--.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.100
&gt;&gt;Richard: We understand.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.900
I guess in some respects the browser does
all that for you anyway.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.880
It says you can save login details.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.660
You can do that kind of identification using
Chrome or the normal browser on Android.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.380
So, you could just get away with making a
bookmark and then saving that bookmark to

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.770
your home screen.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.460
If you wanted to go and write a custom launcher--.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.390
&gt;&gt;David: I'm thinking like a framework that
other people can adopt so that it kind of,

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.040
the user doesn't know.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040
It looks native.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.510
They think it's native, but I don't know if
there's something out there.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.130
I wouldn't want to go out and create this
if it already existed.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.520
I looked around, but I was just wondering
if you guys knew.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: I don't know of a specific framework,
but in terms of lines of code, it would be,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.760
it wouldn't be particularly many.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.760
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.030
&gt;&gt;Richard: You can add view and load things
into it.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: Why do you want to fool people into
thinking they're in a native app.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:24.880
&gt;&gt;David: Well, not fool, but more of, you
have HTML 5 people and everyone wants their

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.880
own little app.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.730
Everyone wants that little icon on there.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.990
They don't want people to think, "Oh, I'm
going to the web."

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.890
Also, a lot of people want to natively control,
like, here's your login screen, here's some

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.890
credentials.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.420
And it's more of a perception.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.390
Yeah, it's not fool, but it's more of a user
perception, "Hey, I've launched that icon.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.640
Hey, I got this app."

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.850
But if most of your stuff is making JSON calls
or calls to the web, why not use a common

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.730
language that everyone knows?

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.750
&gt;&gt;Richard: PhoneGap does actually let you
do that.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.760
It does let you have the pages which load
the data straight from the web.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760
&gt;&gt;David: OK.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.350
&gt;&gt;Al: So I guess it's probably worth bringing
up web view, which is an object you can use

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.790
in Android where you create a native app and
it uses a web view.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.390
And a web view is populated from an HTML source.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.480
So, you can use that and connect back to your
main application.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.400
And you can use a Java Script interface if
you want to call into native code.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.560
So, you can make some small tweaks to make
it a little bit more native and make some

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.800
use of Android's functionality without going
fully down the route of having a complete

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.940
Android application.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.780
But once again, as the guy said earlier, it's
usually better to go down the route of an

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.180
Android app if you've got the resources to
do it.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.020
Its users tend to spot HTML 5 apps, whatever
you do.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.020
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah, and I was just, I was just
putting that idea out there to see if someone's

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.630
done it 'cause, and to get your input from
it 'cause I was just thinking about doing

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.540
it instead of going totally native.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.950
So, I mean, I've always been, I've done native
and done the JSON, but I was saying well,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.040
if it's out there or if you thought maybe
it was a good idea or something like that,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.040
'cause I--.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.710
&gt;&gt;Nick: I would say be cautious of doing that
'cause like you say, everyone wants an app

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.490
experience, have an icon on the home screen
and whatnot.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:15.919
But just being really cognizant of when they
launch that, they're expecting an app experience.

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:20.630
And if what they are getting is a web experience,
which is slightly different and you get into

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.230
this uncanny valley where the interactions
aren't quite the same.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.740
With an app you set an expectation.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.830
It's gonna work one way.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.010
It's gonna be really responsive.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.809
It's gonna-- buttons are gonna do one thing,
rather than have links or something like that.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:35.840
So, just be real careful about mixing those
two metaphors.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.190
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah, I know.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.190
Great.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.190
Thank you.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.950
I just, something that was always on my mind
and I was wondering--.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.500
I have another question too, but you can go
to the other guys first and I'll wait.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.500
&gt;&gt;Richard: No, it's OK.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.520
Go ahead with your question, yeah.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.520
It's fine.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.740
&gt;&gt;David: I have a little app called Magnifying
Glass.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:21:00.380
And so, this app uses a camera on many different
phones.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:06.680
And even though I say, "OK, use the permissions
and make sure they have zoom and everything

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:13.430
else," I found out I'd given a way to someone
can zoom and send me the parameters of their

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.430
camera.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:19.390
And I see oh, it doesn't have a zoom or it
doesn't have, it doesn't support it, but it

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.240
still is able, they were able to download
it.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.850
And it's usually the cheaper phones that it
doesn't work real well.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:33.620
But I really get a lot of people-- bad comments,
like hey, you, some really good ones that

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.690
are pretty-- it's free, too.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.710
But I don't wanna repeat the words.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:45.309
And I was wondering, I'm just, I'm not a big
company and everything, and I heard about

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:52.460
being able to moderate or respond to people,
because I'll use a generic term like "stinks--"

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.710
one word, stinks.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.180
And one star.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.620
I'd like to be able to ask a question, like
"Why does it stink?"

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.620
And everything else.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.800
And that's probably the new one.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.820
If you look at it, that's, I rewrote it for
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.490
So, there's older versions.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.950
Yeah, and it also has a mirror now, too.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.470
Yeah, that's me.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.140
[laughs] And you can do a mirror, too.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.320
So, I did it for my girlfriend so she can
do her lipstick now, too.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.220
So, abuse the men.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:23.250
And, but you'll see on there that some of
the focusing and other things like that doesn't,

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:28.930
I have it so you have to click on the focus
something because Motorola is notoriously

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.780
bad at accepting the basic APIs.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.380
Like, even the zoom.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.310
Like I say, even doing the regular zoom.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.310
So, I--.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.780
&gt;&gt;Richard: What do you mean by that?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.430
&gt;&gt;David: Well, what I, the actual properties.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.010
You know when you have the properties, you
give the set zoom and you give it the zoom

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.120
value?

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.600
I've gotten back people saying, "Hey, it doesn't
work."

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.750
And then I have a friend that has a Motorola
phone.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.860
I can't remember the version of it.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.010
And he's like, "Oh, yeah.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.610
You only have to do a work around with the
camera, though."

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: So, those camera settings should
be added to the compatibility test suite,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.630
if they're not already in there.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.630
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.040
&gt;&gt;Richard: It shouldn't be getting through
with those kinds of bugs in them.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.690
And I, sometimes I think it maybe it's people
just don't know how to use it.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.540
I thought it was pretty intuitive to use.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.730
But I mean, I would like that.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.330
Is there any way, how do I go about?

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:29.550
I send in request after request through the
whole developer store 'cause I'm the top-level

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.550
person.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.550
I'm the only one on my developer store.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.110
So, I wanted to do that.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.290
&gt;&gt;Nick: To who, sorry?

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.410
&gt;&gt;David: Through, to Google.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.410
To the ether.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:46.600
I went through the developer store, the help,
and what form, tried to fill out forms.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.630
Is this about--?

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.990
There's nothing about development or a question
like that to ask for that directly.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.410
It's more like, "Oh, for billing."

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.410
So, I did it for general.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.120
&gt;&gt;Richard: If you have some development questions,
we would definitely recommend going onto Stack

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.290
Overflow or the Android Google group.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.290
The Stack Overflow--.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.020
&gt;&gt;David: But this wouldn't be developer.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.220
This is definitely just for the store, no
development question.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:13.890
This is just how can I have that top level
request to talk to the people who say--?

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:14.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: I see, yeah.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.050
To respond to comments.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.050
So, yeah.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's no form to request that.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.980
Yeah.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.250
It's only the people who have the top developer
badge right now.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.280
&gt;&gt;David: OK.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.220
So, I'm, but I'm the main owner of mine.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.390
So, how do I, can I ever get onto that?

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:38.590
&gt;&gt;Nick: Top developer is a badge awarded to
certain developers, not top as in groups.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.670
&gt;&gt;David: Ah.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.710
OK.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:48.290
&gt;&gt;Al: Only one other thing that might be useful
is mentioning what the remote testing service

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:54.850
is like, or is it Perfecto Mobile, where if
someone reports a boot problem from a specific

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.570
device, you can get some time on a device
that they host.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.081
And you just get an end face to it.

00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:03.850
And you can see whether you can reproduce
the problem and then you can get a bit of

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.490
a head start in debugging on that specific
device.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.490
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:13.660
Specifically to say, I mean, the top developer
badge, which does at the moment get good response

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.660
and comments.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.809
Since we announced it at Google IO, we've
had a lot of requests to be top developer

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:19.809
come through.

00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:23.040
A whole lot of requests for people asking
to get the "respond to comments" functionality.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.300
And right now, it's limited to that group
and we don't have any more announcements on

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.320
before when that would be expanded.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.040
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's just that, when we're developing
a feature, we only want a small set of users

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.420
about it and give us feedback on it.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.460
So, you know?

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.100
&gt;&gt;David: Well, and then my next question is,
why can't anyone help me?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.940
I Open Sourced this a long time ago.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.010
It's on Google, I have a link to it.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.710
It's hosted by Google.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:54.830
And I have even both branches on Google Ice
Cream and checked it in.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.750
And I don't put the code out there in the
wild.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.420
You have to like, ask to join.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.809
And I only had one person ever ask to join,
but he never followed through.

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:06.809
But it's free, you know?

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:07.820
I was like, "I'll give you credit.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.100
I'll put it out--."

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.100
All that stuff.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.970
And I just, I was, it's remarkable.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.160
Sometimes, you get people to help.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.590
I only have a few people that downloaded it.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:18.590
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.030
I have apps with similar numbers of downloads
that are Open Sourced as well.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.610
And it's very rare that you get anyone else
just going through and deciding to commit

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.800
to the application.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.059
You need to go to user groups in your area--Android
user groups or Google developer user groups.

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:33.450
And then get some interest in it.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:39.580
And then some people who you actually meet
face to face maybe commit to doing something.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.580
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.809
'Cause it only has like, 240 thousand or something
like that, plus I got kicked off the group

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:45.809
once.

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:48.700
I still have 30 thousand from the other IP.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.730
Google slapped my hand one time.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.730
[laughter]

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.450
&gt;&gt;Richard: You don't have to go into that.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.690
&gt;&gt;David: Sorry about that.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.650
I didn't mean to do it, but that was--.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.970
To get back to the camera issue, I think you
get into the important thing is that it sounds

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.290
like there's bugs in the OEM implementation
in the camera.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.010
Like, they'll see you're not using our camera,
but using their camera and they're basically

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.510
not really called API.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:17.420
So, the thing you can do pragmatically is
black list the device until you manage to

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.370
get some decent debugging work around it and
all that.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:27.620
But the best answer is to submit a CCS test,
so this is a suite of tests which every phone

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:33.820
has to pass in order to get in the Play Store
and Gmail and Google Maps and stuff like that.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.960
So, if you go to source dot Android dot com,
and it has instructions there about how to

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.210
write and submit a CCS test.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.490
And that would be doing everyone in the world
a favor.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.490
&gt;&gt;David: Oh, awesome.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.490
Yeah, I'll start doing that.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.490
I have the old one.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:53.170
I did it, it seems like the newer phones with
Jellybean, 'cause I have Jellybean and Ice

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.600
Cream Sandwich, that they're not sending them
to me.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.481
And plus, I did the new UI and some people
get mad at the little icon bar, but they're

00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:03.770
getting used to it.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:14.330
But the old one, yeah, the old app, I actually
had a way that you could contact me.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:20.690
I don't do--[audio cuts out for a few seconds]--
internet connection or anything else like

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.850
that.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.840
People like that, too, because there's no
advertisements.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.340
&gt;&gt;Nick: No permissions is good.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.850
&gt;&gt;David: All right.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.850
Thank you.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.850
&gt;&gt;Richard: All right.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.850
Thanks for coming in today, then.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.850
It was nice talking to you.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.230
Feel free to stay in if you want to hang out.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.230
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.100
I like doing this.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.480
&gt;&gt;Richard: What comment is that?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.790
Anything interesting coming in on that comment
string?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.929
What language is it?

00:28:47.929 --> 00:28:50.720
Is it in Android?

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.860
OK.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.250
Let's go back to the moderator and.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.540
[pause]

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:07.130
Someone is asking, "How can I set the shooting
mode for the camera of your application?"

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.130
Interesting.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.090
Well, maybe David can even answer that.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.810
He seems to be--.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.590
He uses the camera quite a lot.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.940
Have you ever looked into the different shooting
modes for the camera, David?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.090
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.990
If you go to the properties, I think it's
shooting dash modes.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.720
So, you have to go get camera dot-- to get
the properties.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.970
I forgot the actual method call.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.740
And then there it comes back name value pairs.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.080
And it'll tell you the different modes that
they have.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.130
And then from there, you have to read and--.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.520
And so, there's, like in Motorola, there was
actually moto dash zoom.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.650
And there's a moto dash shoot.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.420
It's really neat to look at some of the added
properties.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.220
A lot of cameras have--.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.680
&gt;&gt;Richard: Where are you finding those?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.610
In the properties, where did you find the
Motorola specific programs?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.910
&gt;&gt;David: I print them all out.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.060
You can do to flatten on the properties and
that's all I do.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.620
So, once you get the properties, say, dot
flatten--.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.460
And it just prints out all of them.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:12.860
And I just take all that and I call the email
client and send those to it as a body of message

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.080
and put my email in there.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.380
And so, it's up to the user to send me it,
but oh, I'll tell you.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.380
I get a lot.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.799
&gt;&gt;Richard: Tell me.

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:21.020
You get users sending those in?

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.429
&gt;&gt;David: I get at least six a day.

00:30:23.429 --> 00:30:26.210
Some of them just send me the properties with
no input.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:32.080
So, I tried to like, get this whole support
going on my own.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.100
I mean, I'm doing this for free.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.130
This is my hobby.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.140
&gt;&gt;Richard: So, you probably have one of the
most comprehensive libraries on camera settings

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.140
ever.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.170
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah, I do.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:47.230
[laughs] I could probably, and I'm willing
to give it to you 'cause I don't, I don't,

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.930
it doesn't give you any specific user information.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.140
It's just the properties.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.430
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well, man.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.190
We'll talk to you about that afterwards.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.870
It would be interesting if you could post
it somewhere where we could repost it on our

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.870
Google+ page.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.870
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:00.870
They're all emails.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.280
They're all emails and I even, I have them
in Gmail bulk.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:09.340
&gt;&gt;Richard: Just waiting for the bug reports
to come in.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.340
Excellent.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.610
That was quite a comprehensive answer.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.880
So the camera question from Andre.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880
[pause]

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.830
Have we got anything else?

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:29.970
&gt;&gt;Al: We got some new moderator stuff that
seems to be popping up.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.090
[pause]

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.860
There's an interesting one there.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.440
I need to use some hard coded credentials
in my app.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.731
For example, the mail address that is used
to send a bug report or the couple ID key

00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:42.809
used for O-auth.

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:45.860
Is there a way to protect this data?

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.130
[laughter]

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.680
&gt;&gt;Richard: No.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.960
Umm.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.230
Yeah.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:59.390
We would suggest that, especially for O-auth
key, the thing about it potentially not keeping

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.390
it inside the application.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:05.220
You keep them on the website for support if
you need them.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.300
There was a good talk from last year's IO
in 2011.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.730
The pirates and vampires talk by Dan Galpin.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:18.230
You'll actually run into how to secure data
because there are things inside LVL, license

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.890
verification, that are very useful to secure.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.559
And then run into, of course, obfuscating
your code.

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:28.640
It run into if you really wanted to make it
more secure using the NDK.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.990
And then put the secure information in the
native layer and pull through to it, so it's

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.240
much harder to decompile it and get hold of
it.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.669
Al has just linked to the "pirates and vampires"
talk.

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:45.540
There's some information on Stack Overflow,
if you search for the same kind of things

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.700
that have secure keys inside Android.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:54.690
But as far as the standardized, I think what
you're looking for is a standard, secure,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.380
to put it in its place.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.340
There isn't actually an answer for that that
I know about.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.290
It's up to you to sift through that data.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:15.190
And one of the more secure ways to do that
is to go through [audio noise obscures speech].

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.420
--just joined the Hangout.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.420
Hey.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.420
Stephan.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.420
&gt;&gt;Stephan: I have a short question.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:26.370
Currently, I am doing to get our application
hardware attribute accelerated.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.590
And we found several methods which are not
supported but use acceleration, especially

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:37.900
the draw path, the draw from text, is one
of them.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.030
And we're using them.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.240
Do you know any substitutions for this?

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.850
&gt;&gt;Richard: So we do have a list of the methods
that aren't supported.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.640
Certainly, we had it for Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.730
I haven't actually seen an updated list for
Jellybean.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.750
Have you seen one for that?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.750
OK.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.290
It probably hasn't changed.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.650
So, no I don't know of an alternative for
using draw path accelerated.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.010
Of course, you can turn acceleration on and
off around the screen at the time that you're

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.010
using.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:14.369
The, one of the sources of our information
is checking the manuals from top Google IO

00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:15.829
2011 as well.

00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:17.289
They have it.

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:18.289
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:22.409
The only thing you can do is [unintelligible].

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.409
&gt;&gt;Stephan: I really didn't understand you.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:31.639
&gt;&gt;Nick: The path from which you're rendering
your text [unintelligible].

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:46.999
And then 

00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:49.500
you can just re-render that same.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:35:00.499
&gt;&gt;Stephan: The text is not changing, but the
background is changing.

00:35:00.499 --> 00:35:01.499
[pause]

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.499
OK.

00:35:02.499 --> 00:35:03.499
I will try this.

00:35:03.499 --> 00:35:04.499
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible].

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:05.499
&gt;&gt;Stephan: OK.

00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:08.519
I have seen this from [unintelligible].

00:35:08.519 --> 00:35:14.819
&gt;&gt;Richard: As far as I know nothing has changed.

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:17.869
And even if it had changed for Jellybean,
you'd obviously need to still support the

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:19.049
previous versions anyway.

00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:20.049
&gt;&gt;Stephan: Yeah.

00:35:20.049 --> 00:35:23.760
&gt;&gt;Richard: And most changes to hybrid acceleration
in Jellybean would have done around the web

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760
view.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.819
The new web viewing inside Jellybean is--
a lot more of the elements in there are hybrid

00:35:30.819 --> 00:35:31.819
[unintelligible].

00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:32.819
&gt;&gt;Stephan: OK.

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:33.819
Cool.

00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:36.009
&gt;&gt;Richard: I assume it's a similar story.

00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:37.509
&gt;&gt;Stephan: Yeah, thanks.

00:35:37.509 --> 00:35:39.009
&gt;&gt;Richard: No problem.

00:35:39.009 --> 00:35:40.009
Hi, Islam.

00:35:40.009 --> 00:35:43.000
I can see you here as well.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.140
I had you [unintelligible].

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.839
Oh well.

00:35:53.839 --> 00:36:05.869
I'll just type it in instead.

00:36:05.869 --> 00:36:06.869
Here.

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:07.869
OK.

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:09.059
Where are we?

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:10.059
2:37.

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:14.289
Back to the moderator.

00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:19.440
What's the best channel for suggesting ideas
for Android?

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.029
&gt;&gt;David: This one.

00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:23.550
I just asked and suggested that framework.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.450
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes, come and ask.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.750
You get to talk directly to Google.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:33.089
But source dot Android dot com is the place
to go.

00:36:33.089 --> 00:36:40.440
&gt;&gt;Al: If it's a big change, there's an Android
contributing Google group, which people can

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.220
save big chunks of code that they want to
submit.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.150
And then they can code it up, submit it to
the Android Open Source Project and eventually,

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.970
it'll filter it's way through.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:49.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yep.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.930
You can go into the Android discuss forum
on Google groups and start suggesting it in

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:54.930
there as well.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.809
All these places are monitored by Googlers.

00:36:56.809 --> 00:36:58.792
And you can have a look for ideas.

00:36:58.792 --> 00:37:00.589
But probably discussions--.

00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:01.589
OK.

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:02.589
[unintelligible].

00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:10.089
But the places to go suggest it that the Googlers
are looking--.

00:37:10.089 --> 00:37:13.940
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible] you can choose [unintelligible]
the feature request [unintelligible].

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.690
&gt;&gt;Richard: Must have put [unintelligible]
in.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.970
And the source as well.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.619
&gt;&gt;David: Can you put the link for the source
thing?

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:23.089
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, sure.

00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:24.569
&gt;&gt;David: Thanks, sorry.

00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:26.519
&gt;&gt;Richard: Just source Android dot--

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:34.319
&gt;&gt;David: I always look in, the one to submit
to the Open Source Project.

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:37.029
&gt;&gt;Nick: The instructions are on that page.

00:37:37.029 --> 00:37:38.029
&gt;&gt;David: Oh, OK.

00:37:38.029 --> 00:37:39.029
There it is.

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:40.029
OK.

00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:41.319
&gt;&gt;Al: I put the link to the group up as well.

00:37:41.319 --> 00:37:46.170
&gt;&gt;Nick: Al, do you want to talk real quickly,
for you had some submissions accepted into

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.170
AOSP, right?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.479
&gt;&gt;Al: Sure, yeah.

00:37:48.479 --> 00:37:51.630
Basically, if you've got a large chunk of
functionality, the best place to go to start

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.420
off is Android [unintelligible] group.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.359
And that's the place where your idea gets
bounced around.

00:37:56.359 --> 00:38:01.809
People then tweak it to what would fit into
the Android way, what would be better suited

00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:03.650
to the current code base.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.109
Once you've done that, you can submit your
code to the Android Open Source Project.

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:10.650
A lot of the stuff for that, you get from
Open Source dot Android dot com.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.823
You submit your patches into what's known
as Garrett.

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:17.130
And that's a system where those patches can
then be reviewed by Googlers, they can be

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.480
approved, they can be commented on.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.079
Sometimes, things that may make sense, given
the current code base, may get held back because

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:29.059
there are changes in the internal Google repository
that aren't public yet, may knock on what

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:30.319
you're trying to do.

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:35.040
So, once you're in Garrett, you may see things
that don't make sense at that time, but in

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.960
the future, may make a little more sense.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.289
Once those are accepted, they end up into
the Android Open Source Project code base.

00:38:41.289 --> 00:38:45.559
When you're playing around with that, the
best branch of code to play with is called

00:38:45.559 --> 00:38:49.420
the master branch because that's where all
the development goes on.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.240
Once those are in there, then there a quite
good chance that they will eventually make

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.599
their way into the next major release of Android.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:59.160
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's also worth noting the best time
to make a contribution is just after we've

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:06.190
Open Sourced a release 'cause that's the point
at which the other AOSP is, I guess, the closest

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.190
to master.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:12.109
So, it has the least likelihood to collide
with an internal change.

00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:13.109
That's it.

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:14.109
&gt;&gt;Al: Absolutely.

00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:18.900
But it's definitely worth re-emphasizing that
submitting changes to an existing release

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.490
as an external contributor, it's very unlikely
that things will be accepted unless they're

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:30.479
going into the compatibility test suite, CTS,
because a lot of the development for releases

00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:33.930
which are made, like Jellybean, has already
been frozen.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:37.160
So, there's not gonna be big features added
to it or anything else like that.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.650
It's always worth adding new stuff in master
rather than picking a specific release.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.839
&gt;&gt;Richard: Right.

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:47.119
Thank you, Al.

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:54.160
&gt;&gt;Nick: Any more questions you'd like to ask?

00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:00.119
So, Sam from Florida asks on moderator, "What's
the best advised way to sync timing in an

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:01.119
app?

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:03.099
For example, switching rotation while a timer
is running.

00:40:03.099 --> 00:40:06.359
Is a service the best way to do it?"

00:40:06.359 --> 00:40:08.680
&gt;&gt;Richard: A service is definitely, yeah,
a reasonable--.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.329
&gt;&gt;Nick: We offer an ultimate stopwatch.

00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:13.410
The ultimate stopwatch app on the Play Store.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:14.450
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yep.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:18.089
&gt;&gt;Nick: You can ask Rich this question.

00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:19.650
&gt;&gt;Richard: So, [unintelligible].

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.210
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible], too.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: I say it's the share practices
in on call technology.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.250
Isn't it slightly--?

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.250
Oh no.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.250
I do.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.690
I was gonna be embarrassed to not having my
own application installed, but I do have it

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:31.690
installed.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.170
The nice thing about using on pause and on
resume, is that the app is going.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.140
You can hit, 21 seconds, you can hit the home
button.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.220
And it looks like it's gone into the background,
but it's still running.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:47.839
And when you go back to it, it'll have carried
on from, it looks like it's carrying on from

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:48.839
the background.

00:40:48.839 --> 00:40:49.839
So, it's 33 seconds.

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:52.700
But that's all just made through unpause.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.240
I just store the current time on the clock
as well as the current real time.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.250
And then resume, I just set it back to where
it would be.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:03.910
&gt;&gt;Nick: You don't have to commit to adding
the new Jellybean notification chronometer

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.180
API.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.440
You can carry on counting in my status in
my notification bar.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.249
&gt;&gt;Richard: So then this goes into the background
and I have counting going on in the notification

00:41:12.249 --> 00:41:13.249
bar.

00:41:13.249 --> 00:41:17.690
And exactly to this point, we go into, when
we rotate, I do the on pause, on resume as

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:18.690
well.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.469
&gt;&gt;Nick: So you're using shared references?

00:41:20.469 --> 00:41:25.549
I know that idea has, according to the moderator,
is using the bundle, which is passing on destroy.

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:28.589
You can save it in that bundle.

00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:34.719
&gt;&gt;Al: There's also, if it's not necessarily
showing the time using the alarm manager to

00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:39.259
set future events, if they're just looking
for a way of saying, "In 15 minutes, I want

00:41:39.259 --> 00:41:40.259
something to fire off."

00:41:40.259 --> 00:41:45.759
&gt;&gt;Richard: That's a fantastic point, Al, because
Ultimate Stopwatch also has a countdown timer

00:41:45.759 --> 00:41:46.759
mode.

00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:49.369
And when you switch modes to the countdown
timer and you put your time of one minute

00:41:49.369 --> 00:41:52.589
in, again, it's counting down.

00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:55.210
And when you do that, it actually shuts the
app down.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.140
And this time, it's used the alarm manager
to set an alarm in 58 second's time.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.589
So, the countdown still, still beats.

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:07.460
And it looks like it's counting down in the
background, but actually, the app's shut down

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.799
and it's just using the alarm manager.

00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:11.839
I'll wait for that to go off in a minute to
check if it's still working.

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:13.660
Haven't tested it in ages.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.049
[laughs] But yeah, the chronometer using the
application's things is a good idea.

00:42:18.049 --> 00:42:19.359
&gt;&gt;Nick: And countdown timer is good for doing
punch dates.

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:20.819
&gt;&gt;Richard: That was useful.

00:42:20.819 --> 00:42:28.269
Well, the new thing in London now tends to
want everyone to shower within four minutes.

00:42:28.269 --> 00:42:35.980
So, you could put your phone inside a freezer
bag and use it there, counting down your four-minute

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.980
shower and saving water.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.719
Then maybe, we can use the icebox again.

00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:40.789
&gt;&gt;Nick: This week on [ ] Apps.

00:42:40.789 --> 00:42:43.700
&gt;&gt;Richard: My other app is also--.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.339
Would you like to look at the source code?

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:49.950
The Ultimate Stopwatch is also Open Source
on Google Code.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:55.410
So, you can just look through the code for
that and see how it's done.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:02.339
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, Dave, service, it sounds like
a bit of a heavyweight approach.

00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:04.059
&gt;&gt;David: I have another--.

00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:09.180
So, you know how now most apps, you have the,
when you're paying for one or even a free

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.219
one, EULA, the end user agreement?

00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:17.469
Is there anything you know, I haven't looked
in the Open Source Project.

00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:21.719
Is there anything like the framework is gonna
just come up with that so there's a consistent

00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:25.410
one look where you just put in your user agreement?

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.359
Isn't it, I mean, isn't that kind of canned?

00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:28.499
You put in--.

00:43:28.499 --> 00:43:32.670
&gt;&gt;Nick: Are you talking about where you, which
EULA are you talking about?

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.630
&gt;&gt;David: The end user agreement.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:39.630
So, more like, I accept or don't accept, some
kind of standard thing that you could call

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:40.799
to, like an API instead of--.

00:43:40.799 --> 00:43:41.809
&gt;&gt;Nick: One in the app?

00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:45.119
You mean, one that keeps showing when you
launch an app, for example?

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.119
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:50.390
And so they would be something that's given
to you by the Play Store, so you could, it

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.390
takes you to the Play Store.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:58.039
And the Play Store says yeah and saves that,
just like with your in-app purchases to this

00:43:58.039 --> 00:43:59.039
and that.

00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:02.309
So, it's something that it would manage instead
of you having to manage that in your--.

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:04.749
You're already doing it for the--.

00:44:04.749 --> 00:44:09.440
&gt;&gt;Nick: Wasn't that, that's an interesting
area 'cause we're actually handling the app

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440
purchase.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.660
So, we know what's going on there and we can
be confident that a EULA covers that.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.210
If it's some behavior which your app then
goes on to do, like, I don't know if we can

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.519
suggest some legal text.

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:21.839
That sounds murky to me.

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:27.200
I do know there's some templates out there
for store developers, like that don't have

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.119
the resources to engage a lawyer to write
these things for them.

00:44:30.119 --> 00:44:34.569
But I know there's some like, creative commons
licenses out there where you basically go

00:44:34.569 --> 00:44:38.210
through and fill in a wizard to send your
app name and what you wanna do.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:43.089
It'll give you some standard ones, like location
based app and whatever app.

00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:44.089
I'm gonna try--.

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:45.819
&gt;&gt;David: I'm not talking about the text.

00:44:45.819 --> 00:44:51.559
I'm talking about just the part of the API
where that all Play Store.

00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:52.940
And you pass in that verbiage.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.819
So, I'm not, we don't want you to be a lawyer.

00:44:55.819 --> 00:44:59.230
&gt;&gt;Richard: So, we do have it for privacy policies
already.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:04.710
But, of course, privacy policies don't need
to be accepted by the user explicitly in the

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.609
same way that end user license agreements
usually do.

00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:08.950
So, you're right.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.849
It's still up to the application to provide
a dialogue or some kind of acceptance so they

00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:17.849
can see end user agreement and accept it explicitly
there and have it have the time stamp or whatever.

00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:24.019
&gt;&gt;Al: Most of the ones I've seen tend to just
be a scrolling text view with an OK or cancel

00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:25.019
button at the bottom.

00:45:25.019 --> 00:45:29.150
&gt;&gt;David: That's what I have on my one app,
but I'm just, you know?

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.480
It would be nice to be able to say, "A third
party."

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.809
Also, a third party has captured your agreement,
too.

00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:39.859
It's not something in my app that I could
have manipulated.

00:45:39.859 --> 00:45:41.190
When you get lawyers involved--.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:49.219
&gt;&gt;Nick: We do already release the permissions
for apps, so when you hit in store, it pops

00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:53.700
up saying that these are the permissions they
use and you have to accept and store.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.349
You talking about that level?

00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:57.210
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah, something like that.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.579
Here's the end user agreement, too.

00:45:58.579 --> 00:45:59.579
Boom.

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:03.930
So, it's something I fill out in the Play
Store, not in the app itself.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:10.000
And then I can say to the lawyer when someone's--,
"Look, I didn't manipulate this in my code.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Here's the time stamp.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.880
It's a true time stamp because look, it's
managed by the Play Store."

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880
&gt;&gt;Richard: Interesting.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.640
I guess it's quite a lot of infrastructure
on and support from outside if we did build

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640
it.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.630
We need to give you access to the list of
users that have accepted it, which versions

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:27.980
of your unit they've accepted, when they accepted
it and all that kind of thing.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.650
&gt;&gt;David: Or I wouldn't even need that.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.279
I'm only thinking like, if I get sued or something.

00:46:33.279 --> 00:46:37.141
Yeah, I would say go to Google and make a
request for it.

00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:40.181
Maybe something like that, like where you
can make a request 'cause it's not gonna be

00:46:40.181 --> 00:46:41.559
like something I need like that.

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:47.190
I just need a, this is gonna be, if it's a
long battle, you just say, "Hey, here," and

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:49.489
make a formal request and get it.

00:46:49.489 --> 00:46:50.529
&gt;&gt;Richard: Interesting.

00:46:50.529 --> 00:46:56.239
&gt;&gt;David: And I don't know why I would need
it unless, you know?

00:46:56.239 --> 00:46:58.349
&gt;&gt;Richard: Something goes wrong.

00:46:58.349 --> 00:47:02.799
Well, we sit next to the, the play publisher
site team.

00:47:02.799 --> 00:47:03.799
We'll mention it to them and see what they
say.

00:47:03.799 --> 00:47:05.009
You never know.

00:47:05.009 --> 00:47:07.740
&gt;&gt;David: They'll probably shoot me.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.740
[laughs]

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.980
&gt;&gt;Richard: Who knows whether they've had that
suggested before or not?

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.650
They got a lot of feedback, this kind of feedback,
quite recently when they were working with

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.650
Google IO, which they are looking through.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:24.069
But I'll definitely add it to the list of
feedback and see what they say.

00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:25.529
Who knows?

00:47:25.529 --> 00:47:30.999
Do we have any more moderator questions?

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:33.279
Best chance testing ideas--.

00:47:33.279 --> 00:47:36.209
I have a library project, OK.

00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:40.309
This is, looks like a new one.

00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:45.839
I have a library project, this is from Dave,
with a content provider and multiple application

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:49.200
projects that reference the library.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.130
I can't install both client applications at
the same time because of the content provider.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.009
Any suggestions on how to solve?

00:47:57.009 --> 00:48:00.789
&gt;&gt;Al: You need to use a different name space
for the content provider in each app.

00:48:00.789 --> 00:48:02.400
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.190
The content provider, you can't have the same
content provider twice on the device.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.010
It wouldn't make any sense.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:11.510
So, the content provider, I mean, it's like
saying that your two apps have the same package

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.510
name.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.510
It's just not gonna work.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.839
I mean, you have to create two apps building
on the library with different package names

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:20.380
and give the name space of the content provider.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:27.160
Actually, the name space of the content provider
should often include the package name anyway

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.769
into the same name space.

00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:33.799
So, they should be different.

00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:34.799
[pause]

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:40.890
&gt;&gt;Al: It would be pretty confusing to a user
to have two content providers providing different

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:41.940
data in the same name space.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.140
I mean, it's, I can't see of a use where you'd
want to do it.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:49.259
&gt;&gt;Richard: And how would you know which one
you were talking to and yeah?

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.259
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:48:50.259 --> 00:48:51.259
[pause]

00:48:51.259 --> 00:48:52.259
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:48:52.259 --> 00:48:54.200
&gt;&gt;Al: There's another new one in there at
the moment.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.950
I use a fragment class in five tabs.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:03.280
I want to know what the tab is being created
in the background, what the tab is being created

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.280
in the background.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.630
I realize DVM created two tabs even though
it has five, eg, I click on tab three, the

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:13.029
tab one will be destroyed and tab four will
be created in the background.

00:49:13.029 --> 00:49:14.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: What's DVM?

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.700
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm guessing it's a Dalvik Virtual Machine.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: OK.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880
Yeah.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.880
You're right.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.459
&gt;&gt;Al: I hope you guys understood the question
'cause I'm not too sure what's being asked.

00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:29.530
&gt;&gt;Nick: He's basically asking, look, 'cause
he's essentially using adapter, right?

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.119
So it adapts all to supply views.

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:36.400
Or only can substantiate them when they're
needed so that you can handle arbitrarily

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.779
large data sets.

00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:39.369
So I think that's your major problem.

00:49:39.369 --> 00:49:43.509
He wants to know why all five aren't created,
it sounds like.

00:49:43.509 --> 00:49:48.329
&gt;&gt;David: I think you want to know when the
tab is being created.

00:49:48.329 --> 00:49:51.200
Or, which one is being created next.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200
[pause]

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.259
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:49:53.259 --> 00:49:59.229
I mean, he's the one who's providing the layouts.

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:04.140
I don't really understand.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.140
OK.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.710
If you're using the view pager.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, he's on view pager.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:12.249
&gt;&gt;Richard: If you're using view pager, then,
of course, you've got to provide the pages

00:50:12.249 --> 00:50:17.940
and it will say, once you get to page three,
page one gets cleared out and page four will

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.940
be requested.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.940
So, you will keep swiping through them all.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.859
&gt;&gt;Nick: And you can set how many tabs in advance.

00:50:21.859 --> 00:50:24.969
&gt;&gt;Richard: The question is, is he using a
view pager or has he just got five tabs and

00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:31.599
each one has, each one has a fragment in it?

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:35.440
If that's the case, then there isn't any preloading
that I'm aware of.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.869
So, one would be shuffling tab one out of
memory and loading tab four when you click

00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:41.989
on tab three.

00:50:41.989 --> 00:50:46.030
Unless you do have some kind of adapter in
place in the view pager and these kind of

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:47.030
things.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.329
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think it really depends on
your view pager.

00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:51.329
There's just a new layout, so [unintelligible].

00:50:51.329 --> 00:50:53.089
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:58.700
And also, they're your fragments, so you'll
know when their life cycle is changing.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.119
And that's exactly when--.

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:02.180
&gt;&gt;Nick: We'll need more details than that.

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:05.240
Perhaps, if you could post a bit more information.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.150
Yeah, I must say, if you post some more information
and maybe some code samples to Stack Overflow

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.690
and link to it in the moderator, that might
help us.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.410
Maybe a bit more information to go on there.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.579
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:18.680
There's a few different scenarios around that.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:26.390
OK, anything else in the comments before we
bring other questions from inside the Hangout?

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:32.730
If not, I'll have a look for comments and
maybe we'll close up early.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:37.109
&gt;&gt;Al: We'll have time to see Bradley Wiggins
in the Olympics.

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:38.109
&gt;&gt;Richard: Right.

00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:40.940
Not that we're legging it off to go watch
the Olympics.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.969
&gt;&gt;Nick: This room says up in seven minutes.

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.219
Sorry, what?

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:49.109
You said that?

00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:51.619
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's all right.

00:51:51.619 --> 00:51:52.619
[laughs]

00:51:52.619 --> 00:51:54.619
&gt;&gt;David: What about Phelps?

00:51:54.619 --> 00:51:56.690
Is that a big thing?

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:57.690
Yeah?

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:58.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, no.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:51:59.690
Good for him.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:00.940
&gt;&gt;David: Do you think it's gonna be broken?

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.890
&gt;&gt;Nick: Who knows, eh?

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.809
Swimmers seem to be able to compete in a lot
of events.

00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:07.400
I can't see--.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400
[laughter]

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.779
&gt;&gt;David: Nice.

00:52:09.779 --> 00:52:14.660
&gt;&gt;Richard: I'm watching the Olympics on my
Nexus 7.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.630
&gt;&gt;David: I didn't get to go to Google IO.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.700
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I'm really impressed with Phelps.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.450
It must be another swimmer who, if anyone,
is gonna beat that, right?

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:28.560
'Cause no one else seems to do as many events.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.520
Like, is it his third Games or second?

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.209
&gt;&gt;Al: The rowers seem to be in for quite a
lot.

00:52:34.209 --> 00:52:35.209
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah?

00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:36.209
&gt;&gt;Al: But yeah.

00:52:36.209 --> 00:52:39.259
But they, what's it say, is it 19 medals he's
at now?

00:52:39.259 --> 00:52:40.259
It's incredible.

00:52:40.259 --> 00:52:42.309
&gt;&gt;Nick: Who's got the previous record?

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:43.769
&gt;&gt;David: The Russian girl.

00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:47.349
I'm trying to remember her name, was like
34 years ago or something like that.

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:48.619
&gt;&gt;Nick: What did she do?

00:52:48.619 --> 00:52:49.619
&gt;&gt;David: She was gymnastics.

00:52:49.619 --> 00:52:50.619
&gt;&gt;Nick: Huh.

00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:52.910
&gt;&gt;David: Which is a lot of different events.

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.869
You have team events and your separate personal
events.

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:57.990
&gt;&gt;Nick: Nice.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:00.779
Well, I'm cheering for Bradley.

00:53:00.779 --> 00:53:08.380
What's it, this will be his, he'll be our
most medalled, best ever for Britain if he

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.380
wins today's game.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.849
&gt;&gt;Richard: We are very much enjoying the Olympics.

00:53:11.849 --> 00:53:13.430
Haven't gone the whole time.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:16.930
One final question from Catherine just came
in saying, "Can you provide an example of

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:19.009
a very simple privacy policy?"

00:53:19.009 --> 00:53:20.670
I don't have one.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.579
I imagine if you looked on the internets for
one, one would come up pretty easily for standard

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:27.499
privacy policies and things like that.

00:53:27.499 --> 00:53:30.529
Also, you could look around on Android apps
for privacy policies.

00:53:30.529 --> 00:53:34.229
But unfortunately, I don't, I don't think
we have one.

00:53:34.229 --> 00:53:35.229
Not yet.

00:53:35.229 --> 00:53:40.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: I found someone in my G+ stream shared
something just like that.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.230
Creative commons privacy policies.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.079
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well there you go.

00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:46.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, they're [unintelligible].

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.800
I can't remember what it says.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.109
&gt;&gt;David: Well, isn't it also depending on
the content that you have in your app is the

00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:56.200
type of privacy policy you have to have an
agreement to.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.479
So it's very specific to your app, isn't it?

00:53:58.479 --> 00:54:02.739
&gt;&gt;Al: There are some quite large encompassing
umbrella ones that basically say, "We're not

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.299
gonna share your data with third parties.

00:54:04.299 --> 00:54:06.700
We're not gonna distribute it around the internet.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.749
We're not gonna post it on our local notice
board."

00:54:08.749 --> 00:54:13.640
Those kind of ones tend to be reasonably OK
for most things, but there are, there are

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.550
some complexities in it 'cause in certain
countries, you can't put into a privacy policy

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.529
certain things because you have to hand over
information to legal agencies and all the

00:54:22.529 --> 00:54:23.529
rest of it.

00:54:23.529 --> 00:54:24.529
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:54:24.529 --> 00:54:25.529
&gt;&gt;Al: It's tricky.

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:30.089
&gt;&gt;Nick: I'm trying to find the link that I
was talking about and share after this session,

00:54:30.089 --> 00:54:34.499
but I will also caveat that no one here is
a lawyer.

00:54:34.499 --> 00:54:36.709
So, don't take our advice.

00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:37.709
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:39.369
&gt;&gt;Nick: Olympics amateur commentators.

00:54:39.369 --> 00:54:42.650
&gt;&gt;Richard: Australians have just left the
traps.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:46.519
&gt;&gt;David: As we know with all these patent
wars, they're evil.

00:54:46.519 --> 00:54:48.349
&gt;&gt;Richard: Thanks for coming in today, David.

00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:50.079
It's been great to talk to you.

00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.959
Your questions as well and helping out.

00:54:51.959 --> 00:54:53.299
Feel free to come back in any other time.

00:54:53.299 --> 00:54:55.599
You're on the invite list now.

00:54:55.599 --> 00:55:00.780
&gt;&gt;Al: And the interesting thing is the creative
commons' privacy policy is creatively commons

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.780
licensed.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.099
&gt;&gt;Richard: Interesting.

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:04.640
All right.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.579
Thank you all very much for watching today.

00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:13.180
If you've got questions for next week, please
start populating the moderator and we'll be

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.680
back at 2 PM, GMT, next Wednesday.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.839
&gt;&gt;Al: Thanks, guys.

00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:17.999
Enjoy the cycling.

00:55:17.999 --> 00:55:19.940
&gt;&gt;David: Thank you so much.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.940
&gt;&gt;Richard: Cheers.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:21.489
&gt;&gt;Al: Bye.
