00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.400
We're on problem number 7.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.010
And let's see, they drew a
triangle here, let me draw a

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.260
triangle here as well.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:25.390
It's got altitude like that,
this is the height h, this is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.670
perpendicular, xyz.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.190
They say, in the triangle
above xz is 6/7 of h.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.420
So this right here is 6/7h, h is
the length of the altitude.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630
What is area in terms of h?

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.100
Well area is equal to 1/2
base times height.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.340
And what's the base?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.650
1/2 times the base.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.065
Well the base is 6/7h, and
then the height is h.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.700
This 2 becomes a 1, this becomes
a 3, so I get 3/7

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.990
times h squared.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.840
Which is choice B.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.590
Their word is 3h squared over
7, but we know that is the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.270
same thing.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.720
So that is choice B.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.970
Next problem.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.420
Problem number 8.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.380
If a and b are positive
integers, and they say a to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:38.460
the 1/2 power, times b to the
1/3 power, to the 6th power,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490
is equal to 432.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.320
What is a times b?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.960
Here I just try use exponent
rules and play around with

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.470
this as best as I can.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.200
So if I raise a product of two
numbers that have exponents,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.830
and I raise it to an exponent,
that's like raising each of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.940
these to the exponent.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.890
So this is the same thing is a
to the 1/2 to the 6th, times b

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.490
to the 1/3 to the 6th.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.919
And then when you raise
something to an exponent, and

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.300
you raise that to an
exponent, you just

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880
multiply the exponents.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.880
So that's the same thing as a
to the, what's 1/2 times 6,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.530
that's a cubed.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650
And what's 1/3 times 6?

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.310
That's 2.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.695
1/3 times 6 is 2.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:36.420
That's a cubed times b squared
is equal to 432.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.220
And then we could even write
this as, a times a squared

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.550
times b squared is
equal to 432.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.280
And then this we could write
as, a times ab squared, I'm

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.850
just playing around I actually
don't know if this is going to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.640
get me to the problem, is
equal to 432 So this is

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.650
interesting.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.880
We want to figure
out what ab is.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.920
So if we can divide this
expression by some number,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.110
some integer, and get a perfect
square, then we're

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.690
essentially done.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.930
So let's just try divide by 2.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.350
What's this divided by 2?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.970
If you divide it by
2 you get 216.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.750
Is 216 a perfect square?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930
See, I forget.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.110
6 times 6 is 36.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.890
9 and then 160.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.610
No, that's 256.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.820
14 times 14, that might be it.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.470
14 times 14.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.890
4 times 4 is 16.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.300
1 times 4 is 4, 56, 0,
140, no that's 196.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.510
216 isn't a perfect square.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.760
Well let me erase all this.

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:02.140
As you can see, I don't do these
problems ahead of time.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.110
I do them in real time
for your benefit.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.400
I don't even know if I'm going
down the right route, I'm just

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.270
taking it cold like you
will when you're

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.520
in the mix of things.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.970
What other numbers are there?

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.440
Let me make sure my
pen is right.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.160
Is this divisible by 3?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.510
Yes.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.790
What happens when
3 goes into 432.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.450
432 into 3.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.780
It's 100, remainder 3.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.740
13 goes into it 4 times.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.440
4 times 3 is 12.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.760
Look at that, that's
a perfect square.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.740
So we could write this, that's
equal to 3 times 144.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.190
So ab could be 12.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.820
How do I know ab can be 12?

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:59.310
If we said a is equal to 3,
then ab squared, then this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.320
whole term is going to
be equal to 144.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.190
And if this whole term is
144, then we know that

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.050
ab is equal to 12.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.930
And that's choice B.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.370
You know, you could have done
it the other way around.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.230
You could have actually looked
at the choices and tried to

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.490
work backwards.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.070
I kind of fumbled a little bit
trying to figure out, well,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.250
how can I have 432 as the
product of a perfect square

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.540
and some other number?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.760
And you could have tried each of
the choices, squared them,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.410
and tried to see if they
actually went into 432.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.510
And also met the other
constraints, that a and b have

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.130
to be positive integers
that are different,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.120
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.600
And of course if a is 3 and ab
is 12, then of course b is 4.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.150
But we didn't have
to know that.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.310
Alright, next problem.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.440
Invert colors.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.380
Problem number 9.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.910
What is the greatest three
digit number that

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:11.350
has a factor of 10?

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.750
Oh, OK, that has 10 as
one of its factors.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.180
For some reason when
I read that it just

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.530
didn't register my brain.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.710
So first of all, when they say
three digit integer, we're

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.260
essentially saying any number.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.860
So let's say x is our integer.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.460
So it has to be greater
than or equal to 100.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.460
It has to be less than 999.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.850
And we essentially want some
number in this range that has

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.280
10 as a factor.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.570
Well, what do we know
about things that

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.990
have 10 as a factor?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.580
They end in 0.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.440
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.050
They have to end in 0.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
So what's the largest number,
that's less than this number,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.470
that ends in 0?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.320
Well, 990.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.920
And that's our answer.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.120
Problem number 10.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.355
Maybe I don't have to
clear this, I can

00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:00.920
just do it right here.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.230
Problem number 10.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.380
A recipe for chili
for 20 people

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.946
requires 4 pounds of beans.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.760
At this rate, how many pounds of
beans are required to make

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.320
chili for 150 people?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.690
So we can make a ratio.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:29.270
20 is to 150, as 4
pounds is to x.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.430
I just say whatever factor I
have to multiply 20 by to get

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.745
150, I have to multiply the
same factor to get to x.

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.100
I just set up a ratio.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.880
And if we cross multiply,
we get 20 times x is

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.560
equal to 4 times 150.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.102
What's 4 times 150?

00:07:45.102 --> 00:07:47.430
It's 600.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.300
Divide both sides by 20.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.485
600 divided by 20 is 30.

00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:54.680
We need 30 pounds of beans
if we're going to

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.340
do it for 150 people.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.590
Next problem.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.210
Problem number 11.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.770
I'll switch colors.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:11.080
When the positive even integer
n-- n is positive and even--

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.950
is increased by 50% of itself--
so plus 50% of

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:25.390
itself-- the result is
between 10 and 20.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:33.270
10 is less than n plus 0.5n,
which is less than 20.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.210
That's what we know.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.409
What is one possible
value for n?

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.440
So let's do a couple
of things.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.080
One, we can simplify this.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.709
What's 1n plus 0.5n?

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:41.959
That's 1.5n.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.200
And that's -- I'm going to write
as a fraction-- that's

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.570
3/2n, is greater than 10,
which is less than 20.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.300
This is an inequality, right?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.390
So we can multiply every term
of this inequality by 2/3.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.770
So 2/3 times 10 is less than 2/3
times 3/2n, which is less

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.170
than 20 times 2/3.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:13.660
So here we get 20 over 3 is less
than-- this cancels out--

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:18.840
n which is less than
40 over 3.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.210
And 20 over 3, this is 6 point
something something.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.170
It's a little less than 7, is
less than n, which is less

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.140
than 40 over 3.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.820
This is 13 point something
something.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.780
So just have to pick
any number between,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.160
essentially, 7 and 13.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.130
So 7 is less than or equal
to n, which is less

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.340
than or equal to 13.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.240
Any number you picked between
that range would work.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.910
So 10 would be a good number
to write down.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.470
And a very easy way of doing
that problem is just trying

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.030
out 10 and seeing if
it worked out.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.230
And it would have worked out.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.720
Anyway I have 10 seconds
left, so I'll see

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.970
you in the next video.
