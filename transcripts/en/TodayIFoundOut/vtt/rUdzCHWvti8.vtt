00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:51.629
was, in part, due to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.629
the fact that when they were submerged they
were undetectable by technology of the day.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.260
Another factor that played into German hands
is that the Allies, especially the British,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.210
consistently downplayed the danger posed by
submarines and their value in combat.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.180
In fact, at first British Naval brass simply
refused to acknowledge that U-boats were sinking

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.180
ships.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.790
For example, the aforementioned actions of
U-boat SM U-9 were initially attributed to

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.790
mines.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.830
In short, British Naval officers had little
faith in the potential of submarines and wrote

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.450
them off as a mere fascination that had no
real potential in combat beyond novelty.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.119
Thus, they did little at first to try to come
up with viable ways to combat them.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.600
Things got real, however, when U-boats like
SM U-9 began targeting British supply ships,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.320
almost bringing the country to its knees when
it found itself unable to secure even basic

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.640
provisions for its citizens and factories.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.560
A solution was needed.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.700
But how to take out a target that is capable
of disappearing at will?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.079
It was quickly noted that one weakness of
the U-boat was that it needed to use its periscope

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.840
to mark its target before attacking.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.000
This presented a brief, but exploitable window
of opportunity to attack the craft in some

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
way.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.350
But how?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.630
Up until the introduction of depth charges
in 1916, while mines and large nets were utilized

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.110
to protect certain areas with some minor effect,
the conclusion of the Admiralty Submarine

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.390
Attack Committee was that the best thing to
do was simply for ships to either run away

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.040
from or try to ram the U-boats when the periscope
was spotted.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.200
Naturally, beyond risking damage to your own
vessel, getting closer to the thing that’s

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.720
about to shoot you with an otherwise somewhat
unreliably accurate torpedo isn’t ideal,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.260
nor is necessarily trying to run away when
you’re already a marked target.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.160
However, it is at least noted that with the
periscope up, U-boats couldn’t go faster

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.030
than about 6 knots and, as stated, torpedoes
of the age weren’t terribly accurate or

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.040
reliable so the more distance you could get
between you and the U-boat the better.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.440
In the end, these two methods weren’t totally
ineffective, but a better solution was still

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
needed.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.010
This all got the wheels turning among the
military think tanks, with the result being

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.040
some rather humorous proposals as to how to
solve the U-boat problem, with particular

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.900
emphasis put on somehow taking out the periscope.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.750
After all, without the periscope, the U-boat’s
only way to target a foe would be to completely

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.960
surface, making it a relatively easy target
for more traditional and accurate weaponry.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.490
With proper escorts for the supply ships,
this could easily solve the U-boat problem.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.890
But how to take out the periscope?

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.940
A suggestion by the British Board of Invention
and Research was to train seagulls to fly

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.940
at the periscopes, which would both make the
presence of the periscope more apparent and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.310
potentially obscure the vision of the person
looking through the periscope long enough

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.490
to take action…

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.210
To do this, it was suggested that they feed
seagulls in certain regions they wanted protected

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.480
through periscope like devices.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.210
Next up, there was a suggestion to simply
put a type of paint in the water with the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.950
hopes that it would get on the periscope lens,
blinding the operator.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.760
Going back to animals, a sea lion trainer
called Joseph Woodward was hired to look into

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.040
the possibility of training sea lions to detect
U-boats and then hopefully alert the British

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.230
of their presence.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.700
Unfortunately it isn’t known whether this
method was effective, though the Royal Society

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.540
does note that the training of at least some
sea lions was performed.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.630
We presume given that the program wasn’t
expanded beyond trials that it wasn’t terribly

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.180
effective or perhaps not practical.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.930
As you might imagine, none of these methods
went anywhere.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.750
But this brings us to the rather absurd method
that does seem to have been put into practice.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.490
In the early days of the war, sailors were
put on small patrol boats, all equipped with

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.780
the latest and greatest in anti-submarine
technology- large hammers and bags.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.310
They were thus instructed that if they saw
a periscope popping up to the surface, they

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.000
were to try to get close to it, then have
one person place a bag over the periscope

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.860
while another got their Whack-A-Mole on in
an attempt to destroy it, hopefully all before

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.860
any target could be identified and a torpedo
launched.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.660
Exactly how effective this tactic is isn’t
clear but we do know that it was popular enough

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.530
for at least one senior officer aboard the
HMS Exmouth to enlist the help of burly blacksmiths

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.210
with extra large hammers to patrol with sailors
aboard the smaller boats.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.340
With their amazing hammering abilities, both
in strength and blow accuracy, presumably

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.160
it was hoped they’d do a better job than
your average sailor at quickly taking out

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
a periscope.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.430
Of course, as more sophisticated technologies
were developed, this tactic, sadly, became

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.820
obsolete.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.150
But never forget for a brief, but glorious
time in history, there was a guy who could

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.760
claim his job was to hunt submarines with
a giant hammer, no doubt giving a cry of “For

00:05:28.760 --> 00:06:18.020
Asgard!!!” before smiting his foe.
