00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.620
well I think the short answer to that is

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630
well I think the short answer to that is
 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.260
well I think the short answer to that is
there's two two pieces to it one is to

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270
there's two two pieces to it one is to
 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.750
there's two two pieces to it one is to
maintain a robust set of educational

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
maintain a robust set of educational
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.280
maintain a robust set of educational
programs so that so that you have lots

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290
programs so that so that you have lots
 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.510
programs so that so that you have lots
of students who want to come to the

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520
of students who want to come to the
 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.540
of students who want to come to the
school but the second way frankly is

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550
school but the second way frankly is
 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.189
school but the second way frankly is
through the generosity of your alumni

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
through the generosity of your alumni
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.240
through the generosity of your alumni
that with the state budgets being being

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
that with the state budgets being being
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160
that with the state budgets being being
cut as they are in Michigan and a number

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
cut as they are in Michigan and a number
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.180
cut as they are in Michigan and a number
of other places we found a few years

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
of other places we found a few years
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.799
of other places we found a few years
back that we were just not going to be

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
back that we were just not going to be
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.710
back that we were just not going to be
able to be within the top tier of the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720
able to be within the top tier of the
 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.299
able to be within the top tier of the
schools competing with the people we

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
schools competing with the people we
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610
schools competing with the people we
want to be competing with if we didn't

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
want to be competing with if we didn't
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.530
want to be competing with if we didn't
go out and raise a significant amount of

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540
go out and raise a significant amount of
 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.700
go out and raise a significant amount of
money from our alumni so we we started a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
money from our alumni so we we started a
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.640
money from our alumni so we we started a
capital campaign probably five six years

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650
capital campaign probably five six years
 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.070
capital campaign probably five six years
ago which we just ended up and the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080
ago which we just ended up and the
 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.740
ago which we just ended up and the
timing was was good for us obviously but

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
timing was was good for us obviously but
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.219
timing was was good for us obviously but
but we raised 362 million dollars

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
but we raised 362 million dollars
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.670
but we raised 362 million dollars
against a goal of 350 and so it's really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
against a goal of 350 and so it's really
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730
against a goal of 350 and so it's really
through the generosity of the alumni and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
through the generosity of the alumni and
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.450
through the generosity of the alumni and
I think more and more is difficult as

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460
I think more and more is difficult as
 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.250
I think more and more is difficult as
fundraising maybe in an economically

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260
fundraising maybe in an economically
 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.920
fundraising maybe in an economically
difficult time like this for schools

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
difficult time like this for schools
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.600
difficult time like this for schools
like ours as we try to stay in the same

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
like ours as we try to stay in the same
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.130
like ours as we try to stay in the same
league with the with the private

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
league with the with the private
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960
league with the with the private
institutions I think it's what the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
institutions I think it's what the
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330
institutions I think it's what the
alumni are going to be kind of support

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
alumni are going to be kind of support
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.400
alumni are going to be kind of support
that they're going to be providing so so

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410
that they're going to be providing so so
 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.020
that they're going to be providing so so
that is I think an increasingly

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
that is I think an increasingly
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910
that is I think an increasingly
important part of the financial

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
important part of the financial
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420
important part of the financial
structure of the school as as the state

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
structure of the school as as the state
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.970
structure of the school as as the state
support has has dwindled and you would

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980
support has has dwindled and you would
 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.760
support has has dwindled and you would
expect you could not form a viable

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
expect you could not form a viable
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.870
expect you could not form a viable
strategy around increase seeing that you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
strategy around increase seeing that you
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580
strategy around increase seeing that you
believing that state support was going

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
believing that state support was going
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230
believing that state support was going
to be increasing in the future I think

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
to be increasing in the future I think
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660
to be increasing in the future I think
it really is the alumni support and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
it really is the alumni support and
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.070
it really is the alumni support and
we've been very fortunate that we've had

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080
we've been very fortunate that we've had
 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.470
we've been very fortunate that we've had
some terrific alumni help us with that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480
some terrific alumni help us with that
 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.110
some terrific alumni help us with that
and and the second thing we did is we

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120
and and the second thing we did is we
 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.210
and and the second thing we did is we
really didn't have the physical plant

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
really didn't have the physical plant
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.600
really didn't have the physical plant
that would enable us to offer

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
that would enable us to offer
 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.219
that would enable us to offer
educational programs in a way which

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
educational programs in a way which
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.949
educational programs in a way which
which had some economies of scale

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
which had some economies of scale
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.290
which had some economies of scale
associated with them and so as part of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
associated with them and so as part of
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.180
associated with them and so as part of
our capital campaign and part of the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
our capital campaign and part of the
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.920
our capital campaign and part of the
hundred million dollar gift from from

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
hundred million dollar gift from from
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.190
hundred million dollar gift from from
Steve Ross we just completed a two

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
Steve Ross we just completed a two
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720
Steve Ross we just completed a two
hundred and seventy thousand square foot

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
hundred and seventy thousand square foot
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.990
hundred and seventy thousand square foot
facility which came

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
facility which came
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.270
facility which came
line a couple months ago so so we now

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
line a couple months ago so so we now
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.390
line a couple months ago so so we now
have a great physical plant in Ann Arbor

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
have a great physical plant in Ann Arbor
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.370
have a great physical plant in Ann Arbor
that allows us to do things in a very

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380
that allows us to do things in a very
 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.620
that allows us to do things in a very
efficient way while we're still under

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
efficient way while we're still under
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.270
efficient way while we're still under
taking the action based learning of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
taking the action based learning of
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550
taking the action based learning of
disbursing our student teams around the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
disbursing our student teams around the
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.800
disbursing our student teams around the
globe which is a reasonably expensive

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
globe which is a reasonably expensive
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.310
globe which is a reasonably expensive
way of doing education so so I think the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
way of doing education so so I think the
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.410
way of doing education so so I think the
the two big things were number one to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
the two big things were number one to
 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.270
the two big things were number one to
have have a really good physical plant

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
have have a really good physical plant
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.650
have have a really good physical plant
that allowed us to do things in an

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
that allowed us to do things in an
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.470
that allowed us to do things in an
efficient way and keep building the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
efficient way and keep building the
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.490
efficient way and keep building the
Alumni relationships and kind of making

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
Alumni relationships and kind of making
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190
Alumni relationships and kind of making
the case for alumni support and we're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
the case for alumni support and we're
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.979
the case for alumni support and we're
very fortunate that we've had a great

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989
very fortunate that we've had a great
 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.050
very fortunate that we've had a great
history of people who've been very

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
history of people who've been very
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.940
history of people who've been very
committed to the school

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950
committed to the school
 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.330
committed to the school
in michigan our model is that we're

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340
in michigan our model is that we're
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.089
in michigan our model is that we're
pretty decentralized operation so unlike

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099
pretty decentralized operation so unlike
 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.210
pretty decentralized operation so unlike
some public schools in which you would

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
some public schools in which you would
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.240
some public schools in which you would
have to get presidential approval for a

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
have to get presidential approval for a
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.550
have to get presidential approval for a
particular slot or the number of the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
particular slot or the number of the
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.580
particular slot or the number of the
tenured faculty that's pretty much a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590
tenured faculty that's pretty much a
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.620
tenured faculty that's pretty much a
decision which is left to us says the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630
decision which is left to us says the
 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.479
decision which is left to us says the
business school so we have to be able to

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
business school so we have to be able to
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.830
business school so we have to be able to
operate as an economically sound

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
operate as an economically sound
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.000
operate as an economically sound
institution but as long as we can do

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010
institution but as long as we can do
 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.580
institution but as long as we can do
that we can grow the faculty as we as we

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590
that we can grow the faculty as we as we
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.240
that we can grow the faculty as we as we
wish so we are not in a mode where we're

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
wish so we are not in a mode where we're
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.890
wish so we are not in a mode where we're
saying okay what we're going to do is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
saying okay what we're going to do is
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.500
saying okay what we're going to do is
decrease the number of tenured faculty

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
decrease the number of tenured faculty
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.620
decrease the number of tenured faculty
estate support comes down instead we're

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630
estate support comes down instead we're
 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.259
estate support comes down instead we're
looking at ways to probably increase the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269
looking at ways to probably increase the
 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.699
looking at ways to probably increase the
size of some of our programs

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709
size of some of our programs
 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.220
size of some of our programs
particularly right now the demand for

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230
particularly right now the demand for
 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.199
particularly right now the demand for
our undergraduate business program is

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
our undergraduate business program is
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.960
our undergraduate business program is
extremely strong and while we were in a

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
extremely strong and while we were in a
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.600
extremely strong and while we were in a
constrained physical position over the

constrained physical position over the

construction we really had demand three

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
