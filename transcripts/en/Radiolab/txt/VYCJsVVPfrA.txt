Speaker 1:          00:05          You're listening to radiolab from public radio, w.N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Today I want to start the show by telling you about a guy with a very, very, very important man. Probably one of the most important guys. And guide them. Yes. Okay. Tell me the correct pronunciation on a Leo Leo. Leo Can Hook in the way that you should say is something like 11 Herc and here, thankfully, to help with our pronunciation and to fill in the details is professor Matthew Cobb. I'm the program director for Zoology at the University of Manchester, leaving hope, and I've written a book about this called generation the 17th century scientists who unraveled the secrets of sex, life and growth. Okay, so Lavan Hook. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so what did he do? He was a draper. Draper. Yeah, so he just so cloth. Oh, hey. He had no scientific training whatsoever. He was interested in microscopes. Why would a draper be interested in microscopes? Is this hobby, is what he did. He made these microscopes

Speaker 1:          01:09          and he was actually really good. That's right. Although you have to keep in mind that microscopes at that point in time talking 1670s here, it's not exactly how we think of them now. Back then they were just tiny balls of glass and that's it. And Science itself was just a wee little baby. You gotta just really put yourself back. Okay. There was Lavan Hook doing really well with these microscopes and pretty soon scientists all over the place. We're asking you to look at stuff, for example, um, what's in blood or what's in sweat or what's in semen. Dentata this is where it does get rather sorted. Okay. So Chad, before you do, I would just, this is a point where we should tell our audience that some of the references from here on in will be a bit graphic. If you don't want to it, we don't want to hear that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Now go out to the garden and you know, check out the rats. All right. Okay. Now getting back to the story, it's 1667 just imagine and losing hope has just received a letter from the Royal Society of London. This big group of scientists asking him to take a look at a drop of humans. Seems to see what's in that, and not to be graphic, but one Autumn Day, Autumn 1677 he is in his bedroom having conjugal relations with his wife, Cornelia. He's got his microscope ready plus a little vial and then as he put it within six beats of the posts, after he ejaculated, he'd got the seaman and he put it into this very thin cappelary tube, rushed over to the window. His wife's laying there thinking, well, what the hell are you doing? Not Again, come on. Well, you I know for the microscopes already, and then he looks into the, into the semen and he can clearly see that there's a thing, there's something in there, some kind of small structure,

Speaker 2:          02:54          [inaudible] focuses.

Speaker 1:          02:56          He can see all these wriggling things.

Speaker 3:          03:01          He's just full, absolutely full of these tiny eel like things that he says are vast number of living animal, cute animal bodies were rounded, furnished with a long thing tail. They moved with a snake like

Speaker 1:          03:16          motion of the tail as eels do when swimming in water.

Speaker 3:          03:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:27          so what was he thinking at this point? Do we know? I don't know. I putting myself in his place. I think, wow. Because here's the thing. At this point in time, people didn't really understand where babies came from. They knew it had something to do with sex. But the notion of heredity, we are still very fuzzy. And how a baby developed was a total mystery. What's life? How would you know if something's alive in those days? One of the main things that they associated with life was movement, isn't it? It stuff moved. It was alive. So if movement is the key, you can imagine what labor and hooked must've been thinking staring at these wriggling little beasts in the vial because they [inaudible] that's right here. Oh boy, did they move? These things are trying to get somewhere that thrashing, that desperate maybe in this vile is the secret to life.

Speaker 3:          04:18          No

Speaker 1:          04:19          to the soul. This is what people thought it didn't take long before. Pretty fantastic idea began to circulate, which is that not only is the sperm, the vehicle of the soul, but if you could somehow zoom all the way down into its little head, you would find in there a little man, hello, hello. This little chap or hunched up, little tiny guy, Tony human thinking was that one day when the microscopes got better, you'd actually be able to see that tiny little human with your own eyes because it had to be there because if the sperm was the sole source of life, then there must be something in there that look pretty much like a human being. One problem though. What if you were one of these folks who believed yes, but the sperm was the sole? Well then you had to ask yourself, what is the say about God?

Speaker 1:          05:07          Because it would mean he was creating all these souls and then he was just wasting them lave and Herc did a calculation. He worked out that there were more seaman, more spermatozoa in an ejaculate of a cod. He got a card and he opened it up and saw how many sperm they must be in. It's a jacket. And he said there he was pretty much right. There are more sperm in this ejaculate than there are human beings alive on the planet. And that's just in one cod. What? That's true. Yeah. Holy Moly. So you imagine all the men producing all this stuff all the time. Best an awful lot of souls if they're all potentially human beings just dying. Well, oh, but one. How many spare Mary in a human ejaculate, but 180 million. Oh, see that's nothing these days. Yeah, it's like Brooklyn. You just there. All right. This is radio lab from Genova, I, Robert Krulwich, and our program today is about the way 180 million is still alive. It's not a lot. It's something that you only have a couple of eggs who has a cup of [inaudible], has a couple of eggs. She's got a finite number. Where's the guy is making millions every day. Oh wait. Oh, that's right. Anyhow, our program today is about sperm. Yup. Stick around

Speaker 3:          06:25          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:25          Okay. In all seriousness, before we get started for real, just wanted to tell you that that this program does actually contain strong sexual material and nothing too graphic, but this is your warning stick around. It'll be okay. For those of us whose we may, let's get back to our basic question, the why so many questions. Yes. Why is there such a startling asymmetry between number of sexual sales produced by a male and the very relatively few eggs in the female? Well, of course, this is the question I put the question to. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. There's a lot of English people in this show today. [inaudible] work at the University of Sheffield in the Department of animal and plant sciences and he is an expert on sperm in birth.

Speaker 4:          07:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          07:07          you choose this line of work. Ever since I was a teenager, I was obsessed by birds. I was also obsessed by sex and I managed to combine the two into an academic career. Isn't that lucky? In any case. He says this question of waistline, earth, did God make so many sperm? It just didn't seem very sensitive.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Well, this question not only troubled the church at Flamingo Science Flomex does I think the right words I mixed scientists for for a very long time. It really wasn't until about the 1970s that finally the large numbers of sperm that males transfer to females finally began to make sense. What happened in the 1970s well before the 1970s bird scientist assumed that if a female chose a spouse for the season, she would stick to the spouse for the season, she would be faithful. But in the 70s when they looked a little more closely, they found there was one more to this story.

Speaker 4:          08:06          Springtime in Somerset, the female bushy tailed with the well is always present in words like this. Always searching for that springtime joy of love, a love song. He's skinny, beautiful as is he any condoms and then is the act of love consummated rather quickly and now he's off to get his new sweetheart. Juicy. Well, she's [inaudible] for the time and she, and actually she's hoping off to to another Bronx. Um, it seems to be another main [inaudible] oil to this first part. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:53          hype prior to the 1970s, if

Speaker 5:          08:56          people saw females behaving promiscuously, they assumed that there was something wrong with them. What is wrong with this bird? You have another bed, a lunch, if you've got another hormone imbalances or some kind of misunderstanding. But then they discovered DNA fingerprints, the DNA test, which provided a completely unequivocal test of paternity. They'd go to a nest, say and look at the five eggs in the nest, test the DNA and discover that some of those eggs came from different dads indicating the female had mated with more than one male.

Speaker 6:          09:33          What are these four man as a father? But you don't know which one [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          09:37          DNA fingerprinting gave us the evidence that in fact the majority of animals, the females are promiscuous. Really? I mean this is like chimp babies, chickadee babies, chipmunk babies. Almost ubiquitous. Let's find out the truth. You are not the father

Speaker 5:          09:56          at the moment. I'm only talking about a non humans, right? But what does this female promiscuity thing have to do with the why so much sperm connects that we think because once people understood that that was going on, well then the level of competition between males gets actually much more complicated. When you mean, well, if I am chasing the lady now, not only do I have to worry about a competitor, but I have to worry about all the people I've never met who have been having sex with my girl. There's a whole level of, oh you mean like the sperm is a complete room is competing with just the makers of the sperm, but the sperm itself is sperm itself. So there's outdoor competition, but now there's indoor competition. Exactly. If you get my drift, one very effective way of competing is simply to produce more sperm than the next guy.

Speaker 7:          10:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          10:50          okay, look, we need to step back a little bit. If females are promiscuous, natural selection is going to favor the male that wins and fertilizers that particular females eggs. As a consequence of that, males have evolved the most staggering array of adaptations to minimize their own chances of being cuckolded. What does cuckolded mean? Cuckolding means your wife is cheating on you and you don't know it. Oh, so what he's saying is that animals will go to elaborate lengths to beat, not cheated on. In fact, let me give you three spec

Speaker 6:          11:28          illustrations as never before heard on Albert program. When wouldn't it again, which includes most things with sperm competition as this played by [inaudible],

Speaker 8:          11:39          the rogue beetle

Speaker 5:          11:42          [inaudible]. These beetles are amazing. When the male B dog, the male Rovio has sex with a female. So is Tim. They transfer this berm and basically a package of sperm called spur motto for once it's inside the female, it starts to [inaudible]. Well, expand like a balloon. Yes. In swelling and expanding. It pushes out or away any rivals. Hey, hey, but the sperm is stuck in a balloon. It's gotta get out. Oh yes. Well, but the lady Rove Beetle has the Lukens structure of structure, like a two that will [inaudible] the spray for releasing the male's sperm. No kidding. Yeah, it was kind of like science fiction. But if you think the role of beetle has got something going on, let's meet.

Speaker 5:          12:38          Um, males have the most elaborate and bizarre penis is covered with backwards pointing spines, hundreds of backward pointing spines, kind of like, uh, you know, bristles on a pipe cleaner and a very clever guy called Jeff wog. He did a very clever experiment. He allowed male drag and tries to mate with females and separated them at different stages during their rather protracted copulation. And what he found was halfway through the copulation, the male before he actually does the act is actually moving his penis from the female and it's covered with sperm from the previous male. It inseminated that female. Oh, so he's brushing out the other guys. Exactly. That's rather shocking. Yup. Batter's still better still is the duck the duck, the duck. Most birds don't have appears male birds. Ducks do.

Speaker 5:          13:33          That's it. No, it goes on across different ducks species. The penis size varies from very small to about 14 inches. I mean, absolutely astronomical on relatively small duck. And the thing about the duck is, I don't quite know how to put this ducks engage in forced extra pair copulations. What he's really saying is that the males are, are they're raping the females. Oh wait. Because the females have a strategy of there. A couple of years ago, we were dissecting a female duck and a postdoc called Patty Brennan called me into the, and she said, look at this. I've just found this funny structure in the female's vagina, and what it was was a side-branch, meaning instead of one, you know, clear highway, right to the egg. This one had a kind of off ramp off ramp. I phoned a colleague in France who was a duck expert and he said he'd never seen such a thing but give him 10 minutes and he'll go and check.

Speaker 5:          14:30          So he obviously went off and dissected his own duck. He phoned me back and said, my God, you're right there. It was an off ramp in the fringe dock by which time we'd finished our dissection and in fact, when the British took a look at their dock and the duck that we looked at, there were two or three separate side branches. Patty then went on to do a comparative study of a lot of different duck species. And what we found was that in species where the nail had an enormous fallows, the female had the most complex vagina we'd ever come across. Some had two or three side branches and a very long spiral, like a cook screw or the end of the vagina. And if you think about it, what seems very likely here is that the female has got these structures to deflect the male. If she's being raped, she might contract part of her reproductive tract to send the mail off down a blind alley. If he avoids that, she can just tighten up the spiral so his sperm can't get to the right place. So what you've got here is a kind of warfare. The mail says, all right, I'm coming in there like it or not. And then the female

Speaker 7:          15:34          is, well, you're getting nowhere like it or not

Speaker 5:          15:39          go female ducks. Remarkable case of females evolving counter adaptations to keep males at arms length. Well, penis is length so to speak.

Speaker 3:          15:57          Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. So this is maverick and buckles, African group.

Speaker 9:          16:10          The British male science is section of our protein who's coming easily to a pause so we can meet an American and a female. My name is Joanna Ellington. Joanna Ellington, I'm a phd in reproductive physiology. We spoke with her at her farm in Washington state. So we have a 70 acres here and I was a veterinarian before I did my phd. You are an andrologist? Yes. An andrologist is study of male reproduction and dro for man and allergy is study of, yeah. Yeah. Are the big, they're right there. Pigs are over here sleeping. They're going to be bred today. We actually have semen flying in from the basket and we're going to go down here to the chicken coop. And while she's walking into the chicken coop, let me just say, we finally come to a human sparing expert to ask Jerry about us. Yeah. And as, I mean, this competition thing, does it work like that with those ginger? No part. Well, that's the real surprise to me. I mean, we've all seen the sex education films. You know when you're in fourth grade,

Speaker 10:         17:09          the woman's own defense system attacks the sperm. They are unwelcome cells from another organism and they are potential enemies. But

Speaker 9:          17:19          when Joanna gave me her version of all this, it was not like that at all. Let me, let me start from the beginning. First, this firm have to get through the cervix. The woman's cervical mucus has a lot of fibers in it that are crisscrossed, so you think it'd be this big mesh barrier they couldn't get through. The barriers are numerous by when women are [inaudible]. The hormones in her body make all those fibers in the cervical mucus

Speaker 9:          17:47          lineup and they basically make a little highway that the sperm can swim, Zip, Zip, zip. Not only is she welcoming the man, he's making sure later that they don't get along. They're directed to the side that has the egg on it all because there's some tubes with eggs and some twos without right. One Fallopian Tube leads to the waiting game. The other to an empty tomb except for the woman's body says over here, guys, this site this night and most surprising of all is that halfway through the journey there's a a rest period n it was called the Fallopian Tube. The Fallopian Tube says, oh great, we know that you guys are here. We know that you're pretty fragile guys, so we're going to change the type of sugar proteins that we make. We're going to make sugar proteins that you're bathed in and you just hang out here until an egg comes. Oh, so we're now in the waiting room. Yes, and we're being sugar. Yes. This sounds nice. It is nice. That was like a little Roman moment. Everybody's lying down and kind of getting a towel wash or something. They're very quiet at that point. Metabolically, they're quiet.

Speaker 11:         18:59          The female is essentially coming in

Speaker 7:          19:00          the [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          19:07          They can live in the Fallopian tube for two, three, four days, maybe even a week. Oh Week. No kidding. Until her egg is ready. That's when she said, hey, we just odd related. You need to let the guys go.

Speaker 7:          19:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          19:28          are released and starts swimming up the track. They swim dense functions to meet the egg in search of the aid and the rest of it. Of course. You know

Speaker 7:          19:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         19:39          never heard about the sugar room before. I mean that seems like news you have to in the Fallopian didn't. Yeah, neither had I, this had been discussed by scientists, but there was no evidence to prove that it was so,

Speaker 9:          19:50          uh, but Joanna as a good scientist, she was the first to provide the evidence. She said, after I had my last son, I told my doctor, I said, my husband and I are going to have intercourse. You are going to do your mind Tubal ligation and cut out my tube and we're going to get pictures of the sperm stored in the Human Fallopian tube. So we did. So you counted your husband's guys? Yes. Yes. At the gate. Yeah. There weren't very many. There were just a few. How many were there? He had about 20 in the Fallopian tube that we looked at. Oh man, that seems like a fragile [inaudible] low number. Well it is, but you have to remember that you only need one.

Speaker 11:         20:34          Wow. That blows my mind. I mean it's like 20 little. Yeah, I'm sure lost at the gate. The cool thing is that yes, there is this level of competition still, but underneath there is this substrate of male

Speaker 12:         20:48          female cooperation. It's much more inactive teamwork than one would have supposed

Speaker 9:          20:54          Hazel sperm just arrived. But I'd let you guys know. Oh, get pregnant. Yeah, they're going to get pregnant. Oh, she, that's her pet boxer w what is it? It's a white styrofoam cooler. Go ahead and scratch Hazel's back. Say Gee, we'll end up putting probably about a half a cat into Hazel. Yeah. How long did it take Mr pig to make a half a cup? Pigs, man. A lot of spam. Rubber ces now. Seven that, Ya know, come on. Wait, we got to go gray. Sorry. We're going to miss some stuff about the pig Radiolab. We'll continue in a moment.

Speaker 13:         21:32          Message one radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation. The corporation for public broadcasting and the National Science Foundation. Radio lab is produced by W N Y C and distributed by national public radio. And this message.

Speaker 14:         21:50          Hi, I'm Abby Jacobson and you may know me from my fifth TV show, broad city, but before that I went to art school. And why am I telling you that? Well, it's because I have a podcast baby about art. It's called a piece of work. It's a collab between me, w NYC studios and Moma. I'll talk art with some of my friends like Questlove, Tavi, Gevinson and RuPaul and we'll consult some experts and learn some incredible things. Listen to a piece of work with Abby Jacobson wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 12:         22:24          Hello, I'm Jan [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Our topic today is berm actually. That's right. And what is a sperm if not one teeny tiny little a dad. Oh, it's much more than that. No, it's the soul. If everything, well we'll get it just to leave you in the garage and turn to Kathleen Labounty who a few years ago sat down to try to draw a picture of her dad. And this is the picture that she drew. I drew a picture of a sperm,

Speaker 15:         22:53          it isn't very impressive. It was like a cartoon sperm with blue eyes and brown hair and a little bit of a mustache. And then I had a really big question mark behind the sperm and that was to represent the fact that, I don't know this man's identity.

Speaker 11:         23:12          This might sound like your typical magic market paints a sperm donor story, but it's really not. And here to tell us about it is reporter Harry Daniels.

Speaker 12:         23:23          Should I, should I just kind of take it from the top? Yeah. Okay. Kathleen lives in Houston and when she was eight her mom began telling her rather repeatedly, Kathleen, there's something special about you.

Speaker 15:         23:36          And I really wasn't that curious, but she kept saying it so many times that eventually I decided, okay, what is it that makes me different? So she took me upstairs, sat on my bed, and she just said that the man who raised you is not your biological father. We had to go to the sperm bank and that a very nice man gave us his berm so that you could be born. And then she said that I could still consider my dad to be my father, even though he wasn't my biological father. Right afterwards, I just ran downstairs and I threw my arms around my dad's neck and he was on the computer and I just told him that I left him and he didn't know that I had just been told that I wasn't his biological daughter, so she just took it in and it was a source of joy for her initially. It felt kind of magical. It felt magical. Yeah, it was just unique. It didn't completely sink in. At first

Speaker 7:          24:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         24:30          things started to change as she got older. She just became aware of all these things that were different between me and my family. Okay. So I've gotten the picture out if me and my cousins, so I'm feeling like FedEx, I kind of don't blend in. The obvious thing is my height. I'm five two and all of my cousins are between five 10 and six five. Wow. Wow. That's like a foot taller. Right. So that was one thing. And then there were lots of other things, like she had blue eyes, whereas the rest of her family had mainly Brown and she had these drawing abilities. My mom, she can barely draw stick figures. She's a vegetarian and the only one in my family. And so I was kind of wondering if that desired to take care of anything living maybe came from him. It just became more curious about how this man contributed to who I am.

Speaker 15:         25:19          What did you know about him? The only information that I got is that he, he attended Baylor called to medicine. Baylor is where Texas in 1981 when I was conceived, but I don't know if he was a first year, second, third or fourth year student. And that's it. Correct. That was us as brain much. Yeah. So when she was a teenager, she contacted the clinic trying to request medical records and I was told that they were destroyed years ago. I felt like I had lost part of me. So can she solve this in any way? What is she going to do? Well, one night when she was in college, and this was a few years later, her mom just happened to be watching TV every year, 30,000 children are born in this country. The mothers who had been artificially inseminated with sperm from an anonymous donor and she saw a special about the generous sibling registry, our base called the donor sibling registry.com oh, it's a website.

Speaker 15:         26:13          So website we try to help donors and donor offspring and half siblings find each other. CBS News 60 minutes. So after my mother saw this show, I decided to register. So she logged on pest clinic and she put into the search engine, Baylor College of Medicine [inaudible]. And there was actually a girl around my age, young woman named Jessica, which means they could be sisters. Say she and I got in touch and started to talk right away. They noticed. They had a lot of things in common. We both had polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is a genetic syndrome that you would inherit and we are on the exact same medication and the same dosage and that seemed like more than a coincidence. Kind of sparked our curiosity and so they decided that they would meet up. She came and spent a weekend with me. By the time she left we had come up with a list of a hundred similarities, a hundred on our list.

Speaker 15:         27:09          We have that. We can't roll our tongues bed born in 1982 but have curly hair. We both had high cholesterol. Don't have any sense of direction. This is, this is what you do when you want something to be true, but had butterfly tattoos absolutely had the same taste in music when you eat. I think want to believe we are very thoughtful. All these things that would otherwise I think maybe escape detects, have that. Our handwriting was pretty similar. All of a sudden become really important. That just goes on and on. So they decided to have a DNA test and and the results come back. They called her and then she called me. I mean you can hear people's disappointment and sadness. So I knew before she said anything

Speaker 7:          27:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         27:52          I think of it as a 0.001% probability that we were sisters just like that this possibility was gone. They began to feel loss and grief. Like I look in the mirror and I see a stranger looking back at me. Okay, so fast forward now a couple of years, she goes to a library, a library, and the medical center, she walks over to the stacks, pulls out old Baylor yearbooks, the old Baylor what your books. She figured as long as he showed up to get his picture taken on picture day, he'd be in one of those books. Exactly. So I take them off the shelf and I photocopied every page, your pegs say 19 791980818283 and 84 year old letters and she took them home. I was expecting just to flip through it and not see any similarities with any of the men and then get to one picture and think, hey, this is the man.

Speaker 15:         28:53          But that's definitely not what happened. Instead, I realized that I looked like dozens if not hundreds of the men. Let's see, and I would think that I had one man's news and this guy, another man's eyes in prison, another one, the other man's chin. Even this guy, I mean, I think it's possible because the rounded eyebrows and bigger eyes. I just got overwhelmed so she decided to enlist some help. Right? So I had my mom and three of my closest friends take sticky tabs and flip through the photos of all of the men. He has blue eyes. They might say, Molly, you kind of look like this man, or you kind of look like this other man or smiles or similar, and then they would mark the man who they thought resembled me, the meadows. She then decided she would draft a letter, a letter.

Speaker 15:         29:38          Dear doctor, it is after match thought that I am you. I was thinking, well, all right. The men who were consistently picked out, it was conceived May 4th, 1981 by an anonymous sperm donation through a Baylor called to medicine students. I tried to think, okay, if I were a donor, what would my concern speed. I want to assure you that I am emotionally stable and financially secure, provide additional reassurance to donors. I have been using a non legally binding DNA test that cannot be used in court and then I just explained in many ways, okay I that even if I tried to give an overview of who I am, I have large, I'm these navy blue eyes. I barely reached five to both my mother and I have a positive blood. I am attaching my photographs to see if you recognize my face and then I just said thank you for your time.

Speaker 15:         30:21          Sincerely Kathleen. And so she actually sends it out the letter. Yeah, around 25 letters to the men that looked most like her. Another round of 50 my biggest fear was that my letters would not be acknowledged. I had been told for so long that my donor wouldn't want to know about me. He wouldn't care that I exist and I thought if I send out 25 letters, maybe one would take the time to respond to me. Did she get anything back? She did what they say. Well, I mean some of them more what you might expect. Wow. Your letter was unexpected. Dear Kathleen, take me off your mailing list and do you not ever contact me again?

Speaker 16:         30:58          I remember just before my shift started, it was a 10:30 AM a rummage through the mailbox and saw a letter that was addressed to myself, Dr. Daniel Zack. I live just outside Seattle. And I remember, um, practice emergency medicine opening the letter and uh, the first sentence or two I thought, oh, oh see, here's one that's handwritten. I was assured that it would be anonymous and that there would be no way for anyone to track me down even if they wanted to.

Speaker 15:         31:26          That your motivations may be innocent. Please consider the ramifications for others by the knowledge you seek.

Speaker 16:         31:33          I felt that I would never be contacted.

Speaker 17:         31:36          Good. But then there were others, like this guy, I think I called her, um, right away I'm Merryman Baker. I'm an orthopedic surgeon who's, uh, lives in the Houston area. And I said, well, I was a donor I think 25 years ago. And, uh, I never thought this day would come. What does that mean to he? You know, I wrote this one line down that he said, um, he said that's how really good things happen. You know, usually the way really good things happen, they come out of the blue. Uh, I'm, I'm 51 now and I don't have any kids, you know, not having kids would be the last thing I would have guessed, you know, 35 or 40 years ago from my own perspective. But I've always been very work oriented. All of a sudden you kind of look up and, you know, a few years have passed by and you don't have any kids yet. So the prospect of, uh, of having, you know, a daughter out there somewhere that I didn't know bad was, was quite frankly a kind of a, a rush.

Speaker 15:         32:36          He called me and, um, we just talked about our interests and our personality and we started finding similarities.

Speaker 17:         32:45          Her mother had a, requested a blue eyed donor, which I am. She has a positive blood, which would be compatible with mine. And it gets even more, uh, Erie [inaudible] Oh gee, my major in college and our cumulative grade point average was identical. She certainly could be my daughter on many fronts because I spoke with my mother at length. She was extraordinarily excited that the prospect of having a grandchild and she prepared a place for her at a Christmas dinner with her name on it. Wow. Today they get the DNA test. Not Exactly. They just kept waiting. Probably subconsciously. I almost didn't really want to know.

Speaker 15:         33:31          Right. You know, let's just not even open up the results of the test. Let's just assume that we're, it's a match. We get along so well, why does it matter? But at the same time, we both knew that we needed to know the truth.

Speaker 17:         33:41          In the end. They finally went through with it. I mean, it was kind of a running lottery about, you know, what do you think? And I was pretty, uh, impressed at the fact that it was probably going to be positive.

Speaker 3:          33:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         33:54          the results come back from the lab and it looks like yellow. It's basic information, [inaudible] information about this and that in terms of the DNA, I have no idea what blue, green, gray, pink. Then at the bottom it's, it's, you know, kind of yes or no.

Speaker 15:         34:14          The probability equals 0%.

Speaker 17:         34:19          It was like 0% chance that it was positive.

Speaker 15:         34:24          He wrote me and he said, I'm heartbroken. I'm so sorry this was negative. And um, I think it took him about three or four weeks before he felt up to speaking to me again.

Speaker 3:          34:34          Yes.

Speaker 17:         34:36          Yeah. I mean, I've always thought I'd be a good dad and you know, I, I guess it was Kinda like, it would've been kind of Nice to have a child out there who's well adjusted, a intelligent person. Yeah. It's kind of all the things you'd want your kid to be.

Speaker 3:          34:53          Yeah.

Speaker 15:         34:53          And that's what all I've made. It's made me stop my search.

Speaker 3:          34:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         35:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         35:03          so did she stop then for the, she does exactly the opposite.

Speaker 15:         35:07          I wrote every single male who went to Baylor from 79 to 84 which is how many males? 600 out of those 600, 250 responded. Wow. Half of them greater back. Yeah. That's so weird. Exactly. That was exactly my reaction. Weird are still, not only did they respond, but they were very supportive. Dear Miss Labounty, you are clearly someone who thinks and feels deeply that makes you special. One guy sent me a card, you sound and look like a remarkable young woman. This one says, I would claim you in a second. I'm trying to read his handwriting. Doctor's handwriting. Dear Kathleen, I've waited 26 years to receive a letter like this and this is man who's actually a friend of mine now. I've met him and I've met his wife. This one's really sweet too.

Speaker 12:         35:53          Well, we'll wait about, what about that guy at the beginning that I went, oh, Dr Dan Zack. Yeah, him even he came around. As time has progressed since I initially read the letter. Now I'm almost sorry that she's not my biologic daughter. That would have been kind of fun and have all those has, has anyone else agree to do a paternity test? All told she's had 16 DNA tests

Speaker 15:         36:14          of the alternate negative. Every, every test came back as negative, but I still feel like I probably have the answer in front of me. I just don't know which pages is [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         36:25          it just, it just real quick. So I realize it's 12 now. Um, the, the song, I don't know a few. I mean I was just thinking about that too. [inaudible] some of it. Okay. I just need it.

Speaker 18:         36:35          Hello?

Speaker 19:         36:37          Um,

Speaker 18:         36:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         36:41          well, whenever I've heard somewhere out there, ever since I was a kid it would remind me of my biological father and that he's out there when I was a kid. Sometimes I'd look up at the sky and I would think that I, I literally know nothing about my father except that we were both looking at the exact same size.

Speaker 19:         37:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         37:03          yeah, that's as far as they got. That's as far as you got. [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         37:07          I never learned the engine. I'm still working on,

Speaker 3:          37:14          yeah,

Speaker 12:         37:21          that story from Ra Daniel Shapiro and Lulu Miller, our producer, time for a break. Radiolab will continue in a moment.

Speaker 12:         37:50          hello, I'm Janet. Boom, Rhonda. And I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Our topic today is sperm Yellow Wigley cell that uh, along with male pattern baldness teams should describe everything you need to know about being a man. Speaking of which, let's ask now one of the bigger questions that you can ask in a show about sperm, which is why are their sperm, why are there men? What, why are there men? This is a real question of biological question, which is completely baffling. That is Steve Jones. Hello, I'm professor of genetics at University College London. He wrote a book called the descent of Man, where he speculates about how we men got our start and why we've managed to stick around so long. That's the real question. Here's this theory. Let's imagine ourselves in the primordial soup. Okay. 3000 million years ago was actually minestrone because it was lumpy, right? And the lumps, the sounds, and to reproduce these sounds, what they have to do is gather up their energy and all on their own.

Speaker 12:         38:50          It's split in half. [inaudible] make copies of themselves, which are more or less identical. Most of the time the normal flow of events is these cells are coming and coming and coming. Every so often there would be a copying error. Hello, a mutation. These are happening all the time. Hi, hello. Most were harmless, but not so much in the one of these mutations cause the cell that we saved it to behave in a different way. This new cell, how you do it through the randomness of nature, it had acquired a talent instead of dividing on its own. It figured out that it could save some energy if it could swim up to another cell. Hello Burrow. It's way in and forced that second cell to divide. By so doing, not only was it avoiding a lot of work, it was copying its own genes at that that moment males were born.

Speaker 7:          39:54          How do you, how are you [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         40:01          that's what you're saying is that guys are essentially moochers like they left, we got our start. According to this theory, males began with selfishness. These little cells began to mooch off of other cells. Then they figured out, you know, over time they could much better if they got smaller, small and faster and as mobile as they possibly can because then they can fuse with more and more of the other kinds of sales and persuade them to divide. So now, yeah, if you want a definition that encompasses all males everywhere from oak trees to elephants to humans to fish, there's only one real universal definition of what it means to be male. It's the sex that makes small sex sells and often lots of them. That's it. We make the small sex sells. Not really is the mark of the male having a tiny sexer meaning you, me, Steve.

Speaker 12:         40:46          Yeah. At the core of it, our maleness is defined by these little tiny swimming packets of genes, what we now call sperm, but we know we don't, I don't understand if all males are, are parasites. Yeah. Yeah. But why would the female cells allow us to do that? Why don't they just say go away? And that's a big question because there are some species that have dispensed with males altogether. Really? Yes. The one that comes to mind is a California Lizard, which is quite common. It's called the whip tail lizard. And they live in the Mojave desert and they're all female as far as we can see that I've not been no males around for a long, long time. It's kind of strange because they actually caught each other and one female gets on top of the other and tries to mate with it. So there's some kind of remnant of male behavior, but that all female.

Speaker 12:         41:34          But how has it that, did they make little lizards? They just produce adjuncts, which develop into lizards. Oh, they just don't bother with males. So the baby is identical to the mommy. So we're not gonna have a cloning here. Yeah. You know, plenty of birds can do that. I mean, chickens often lay eggs, which develop and hadn't been fertilized frogs. He says there's some frogs that can do it too. But here's the thing, even though making babies without men is green, as some scientists, the most efficient way to do it, to reproduce, it's still pretty rare. There are very few land vertebrates, which are all female. Which brings us back to your question, why? Why do females not make huge efforts to escape from? Why are we here? Why have males hung around this long? I mean, we shouldn't be doing this program. Somebody named Alice and someone named Laura should be here.

Speaker 12:         42:20          Hi, I'm Alice, a boomer. I'm Laura Cro and this is really not so fast. Ladies, we're still here now. That's for why we're still here. There are tons of theories. Steve's best guess is that, you know what? We're not just parasites. We do offer the ladies one thing in return. Like what? Well Lulu, going back to the soupy days at the beginning, just imagine, says Steve, what if that's super PC is changing? Then the water's getting warmer and the water is getting salty. So let's say on one side of the pond there's a cell that mutates and suddenly it can handle warm water. On the other side, there's a cell that mutates and suddenly it can handle salt. If this is an all female world, the warms would copy themselves. Saltings would copy themselves in. Every new member of both of these tribes would die for the waters both warm and salty cause they couldn't combine their talents.

Speaker 12:         43:13          But if one of the ses, salty sells as a male, how you doing? Well that male can swim up to a warm, he sailed do his mail and Bader thing and then the next generation anti warm and anti salt can get together. So that's what males do. They bring female lines together and allow them to mix their genes. And that may be, that may be so important says to you that the only time you can do without meals is if your world is static. Wait, what about the lizards? Yeah, well that's the interesting question and I think the answer is maybe, and then we would kind of guesswork here. They live out in the desert. The desert doesn't change very much. The enemy is always the same, which is hate children's. Your food. That enemy isn't something like disease or parasites, which are constantly evolving themselves so they can afford to get one set of genes which are very effective, clone themselves by not having sex, whereas other creatures can't. Does that mean you think that if our world were like that, that if we'd somehow perfected it, that we wouldn't need men? That's arguably true.

Speaker 12:         44:19          Um, and somebody does it on the doorbell now. That's now still, hang on. We got another bloody nuclear explosion on the right sided Jesus Christ is normally quite as the grave in here. Okay, right?

Speaker 21:         44:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         44:38          if we lived in a, in an unchanging world, maybe we wouldn't need men, but we don't live in a world that doesn't change. Look at the AIDS virus. Look at bird flu. They're out there. They're waiting to get you and they're going to get lots of us sooner or later with a new epidemic, which itself has changed genetically. And you're going to need the males to mix up the genes to make sure that the whole species doesn't just disappear. So that you know, I think we males do for a brief moment of quiet self-congratulation Robert, I've never told you this, but you're a really good guy and you are spectacular. Thanks. Yeah. The prospect of a world with a man seemed remote until the invention of the deep freeze

Speaker 21:         45:26          because he can freeze, burn and use it. I do like blue eyes, get that one mensa and it can be used after that death and maybe I'm not ready yet.

Speaker 12:         45:38          So the don't congratulate yourself that you're always going to have a world with men in it. You may just have a world with freezers.

Speaker 22:         45:55          Steve Jones wrote the book. Why the descent of men moving right along the idea of like a world without men or a world where men have been replaced by freezers. Men replaced by freezers. It's sperm frozen in the speeding freezer. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. That's frozen men. Yes. Frozen little baby man. I wanna I want to tell you a story that's gonna wipe that smile right off your face. Krulwich it's a, it comes from one of our favorite reporters. NPRs Nell Greenfield boys. Hello Radiolab. Hello.

Speaker 22:         46:24          So should I just introduce this person? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, my name is Alisha Naval Taylor. You shouldn't evil Taylor and I live in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Basically. Um, I love animals. Back in 1995, Alicia and her husband John, were living in New York City. Uh, Melson fested cheesy little dump in park slope. They were this young couple in their thirties. She was working at like a daycare center. I did basically creative movement with little kids under five and he was a super in this big apartment building on the upper east side and she and her husband both got some horrible flu and I can remember laying in bed, both of n we were, we flipped a quarter to see who would go make the can of chicken noodle soup. And I said, what would we do if we had kids right now? And I can remember laying there in their bed and John Goes, we'd set, we'd set that child up right there on the floor and throw some toys down there and we'd both lean over the edge.

Speaker 22:         47:22          I had never been so sick. Did she have any idea what made them sick? Nope. Just one of those things. And, and you know she got, what about him? He didn't get better. He was throwing up cold cough. Did you guys think it was just like the flu? Yeah, we, I mean we just thought he was getting sicker and sicker and at some point he was like having trouble kind of breathing. And so Alicia was just like, we're going to the emergency room. They wheeled him into the emergency room. First nurse we see, she says, oh my God, John, why did you wait so long? All of a sudden he's like in the ICU. But it's funny though, while John was in the hospital, I snapped three photographs of him was going to say to him, see what you put me through, see what they would see. Would you look like? Cause I don't think he would have ever believed,

Speaker 7:          48:10          okay,

Speaker 22:         48:10          how many tubes and how many things were coming out of him. Couple of days later he had a cardiac arrest and after that he's brain dead.

Speaker 7:          48:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         48:20          and I went home that night. You know, it's, I'm right across the street. I went home and I, I saw our whole lives go right out the door. I was, as I looked out over that East River,

Speaker 7:          48:32          um,

Speaker 22:         48:33          I saw the kids. We weren't going to have did that fear of, Oh my God, I'm gonna lose everything. And then she remembered something, something that had happened about six months before John and I had seen something on the news hours

Speaker 1:          48:48          after Anthony Baez died in a confrontation with police. He's widow, told her sister-in-law, I want his [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         48:54          baby. This one day before she went to work, she had seen this report about a man who had died, a young man who had died and when he was lying there in the morgue, family members of his wife actually said to the doctors, is there any way that you can save his sperm?

Speaker 1:          49:11          The family called in in New York hospital, urologist Peter Schlegel and Peter Schlegel and I'm urologist and chief at New York Presbyterian hospital who had removed sperm from many men before, but never a dead one. Had you been to the morgue before? Nope. It's probably not quite as clean as on TV. And certainly working with a dead body is different. Schlegel says Mrs Baez would have an excellent chance of conceiving with the sperm he retrieved if that's what she decides to do. Warren Levinson, New York. Yeah. And

Speaker 22:         49:40          I said to John, I go, wow, is that wild or what? What do you think of that? She said that John was like in the bathroom. No, I mean he was brushing his teeth, you know, in his usual rush to get off to work. And she said to him like, if you died, would you be okay with me doing nice as well? If it's really tragic, he goes, go for it. Then later on she went to work. Remember she works at like this daycare kind of center [inaudible] and she mentioned it to somebody at work and one of the women who works there pointed to a kid and said, you see that kid? His father is the doctor who removed the sperm. Wow. No kidding. And so she's remembering all of this. Six months later, I would, oh, that little boy, his dad, you know, her husband is brain dead at this point. And what she decides to do is go to work and find the name of that kid whose father had taken the sperm. So you pick up the phone and [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         50:34          got an appointment with him right away. That Wednesday I went and saw Peter Schlagel and they had Thursday John, he died around six o'clock.

Speaker 3:          50:52          Sorry,

Speaker 23:         50:57          I'm really sorry. Oh wait, we're best friends.

Speaker 22:         51:08          A team came in to his room. She waited outside. What do you actually need to do a procedure like this? Basically a vasectomy cat. They take a needle, put it into the man's body. One of the richest sources of sperm would be the vast, the tube that normally carries sperm from the area around the testicles to the ejaculate Teri regions. They literally put the needle into that too and suck the sperm out. So you're left with a little one inch tall conical tube that has tens of millions or maybe even hundreds of millions of sperm within it.

Speaker 3:          51:45          [inaudible],

Speaker 24:         51:45          you know, I can't help but ask myself the question. Well maybe I'll just ask you, would you do this? Absolutely. Really no question in my mind. So I've been married eight years, I don't have children. I want to have children with my husband and if he died I would absolutely do it. And no ethicist at a hospital is going to be able to tell me no because I got my husband to put it in his will. Why? So that there would be no question if he died that I would have permission to do this. But why are you so certain? Isn't that partying? It's a little hesitant about it. W what it really means. What would it really mean? I don't know that you're somehow, I mean at the very least a kid without a dad and also like the kid would have your husband's eyes and his nose and his ears and so he would be kinda like an echo of him or reminder. There is nothing that I would want more honestly. I mean, you know, if my husband died, there was nothing I would want more than, than a child of his. But you know, Peter Schlegel, what Peter Schlegel told me

Speaker 22:         52:43          is that in most cases women do not use the sport. Women will not go forward and use those farms. Really? They collect it, time passes, maybe they meet someone else and decide to move on with their life. That's interesting. And what about Leisha? Did she, uh, did she move on?

Speaker 23:         52:59          Well, no. If I, if I was standing at 70 and looking back at my life, then I'd have to kick myself. If I didn't do this, it would have been out of fear that I didn't because everybody kind of looks at it like, God, that's so weird. That's what are you going to tell this kid? Oh, you came from somebody's dad. How would you explain this to your child and simply will the, with the truth. I loved your father. He died. I saved us from post-mortem so that I could bring you into the world. You are indeed a part of him and you are indeed a part of me.

Speaker 22:         53:41          After John Died, she moved back to Wisconsin and she waited for awhile. Her life was moving on. She had relationships with other people, but she didn't let go of the idea. Finally, six years after her husband died, she decided that she was going to do it.

Speaker 23:         53:55          I think it really came down to me making a decision about doing it on my own.

Speaker 22:         54:00          You know, she called and she made an appointment at a fertility clinic back in New York.

Speaker 23:         54:04          I had gone out in September like the day before the um, planes flew into the World Trade Center and

Speaker 22:         54:13          the city felt some Felicia, it seemed like signs were everywhere. Signs of fate. I guess. There was just such a big part in the coincidences. Like what, what was

Speaker 23:         54:25          pretty amazing in that the in vitro center was in the building or John and I made love, I mean it was in that building,

Speaker 22:         54:34          you know, the doctor's office where she was getting the fertility treatments were in her old building. It was such a coincidence that she'd even seen that news report. The fact that it was the doctors, little boy I was teaching her cat died, you know, while she was in New York and she sort of had this idea that with this death, this life comes, things were were dying, but there was going to be new life. I had all these

Speaker 23:         54:56          zag sudden the chances of it working were really big. I was for sure going to get pregnant,

Speaker 22:         55:03          you know, all of these things just came together. So that felt natural and right. A fertility clinic technician thought this frozen six year old sperm injected it into the eggs and then they waited. I mean had you like gotten nursery stuff ready and stuff? Like were you at that point level of certainty gone out

Speaker 3:          55:23          shocked and yeah, I,

Speaker 22:         55:26          I had it all picked out, but none of the eggs fertilized, none. None.

Speaker 23:         55:33          It was like another death. I mean it was just, it was like another death.

Speaker 22:         55:40          She had told me that she had John Cremated and that she had sort of half of his ashes, I'm still in her house and that she didn't know really what she was going to do with them, that she knew at some point she had to scatter them or something, but she hadn't really worked out a plan. And you know, I pointed out that, well, she's got the sperm store too. Like, do you think that that's something that you want to somehow do something with or will it be there forever

Speaker 23:         56:10          until there's a power outage now? Just, I'm so cynical. Um, it doesn't amount to anything. It's, it's the, the thing that's there that isn't, it's like the chair. It's, it's not who he is or was.
