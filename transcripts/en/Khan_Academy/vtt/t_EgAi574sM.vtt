00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.222
What I want to do in this video
is that for some triangle--

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:04.680
we're going to
focus on this larger

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.700
triangle over
here, triangle ABC.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.170
What I want to do is prove
that the circumcenter

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.290
of this triangle--
remember, the circumcenter

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.760
is the intersection of its
perpendicular bisectors.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.620
That the circumcenter
for this triangle,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.190
the centroid of this
triangle-- the centroid

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.170
is the intersection
of its medians--

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.530
and the orthocenter of
this triangle-- that's

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.840
the intersection
of its altitudes--

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.610
all sit on the same line.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.060
Or that OI right over here
really is a line segment,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.670
or that OG and GI are really
just two segments that make up

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.020
this larger line segment, which
is part of the Euler Line.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.880
And to do that, I've
set up a medial triangle

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.820
right over here, triangle
FED, or actually I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.680
should say triangle DEF, which
is the medial triangle for ABC.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.480
And there's already
a bunch of things

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.320
that we know about
medial triangles,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.480
and we've proven this
in previous videos.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.260
One thing we know is
that the medial triangle

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.580
DEF is going to be
similar to the larger

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.530
triangle, the triangle it
is a medial triangle of.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.220
And that ratio from the
larger triangle to the smaller

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640
triangle is a 2 to
1 ratio, and this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.810
is going to be really
important to our proof.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.660
When two triangles are similar
with a given ratio, that

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.950
means that if you take the
distance between any two

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.970
corresponding parts of
the two similar triangles,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.290
that ratio will be 2 to 1.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.210
Now, the other relationship
that we've already

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.380
shown-- the other relationship
between a medial triangle,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.880
and the triangle it is
the medial triangle of--

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.270
is that we've shown
that the orthocenter

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.880
of the medial triangle is the
circumcenter of the larger

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.080
triangle.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.650
So one way to think
about it-- point O,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.020
we already mentioned,
is the circumcenter

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.820
of the larger triangle.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.250
It is also the orthocenter
of the smaller triangle.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.500
And we actually wrote up here.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.999
So point O, notice it
is on this perpendicular

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.790
bisector over here.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.498
And I actually draw
a bunch of other ones

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.310
in this dark gray
color, but I didn't

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.220
want to make this
diagram too messy.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.910
But this is the circumcenter
of the larger triangle,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.310
and it is also the
orthocenter of the smaller

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.200
triangle-- of DEF.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.750
And we actually
used this fact when

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.110
we wanted to prove that
orthocenters are concurrent.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410
We started with the
medial triangle.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.875
We said, OK, let's think about
where the altitudes intersect.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.780
And we said, well, look,
all of the altitudes

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.664
are actually perpendicular
bisectors for our larger

00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:44.080
triangle if we
assume that this is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.980
the medial triangle of
that larger triangle.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.540
So point O, and this is going
to be important to our proof.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.130
It is a circumcenter
of triangle ABC,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.940
but it's the orthocenter
of DEF, and we've already

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.460
talked about this
in previous videos.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.230
Now, in order to prove
that O, G, and I all sit

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.930
on the same line--
or the same segment,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.910
in this case, what
I'm going to do

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:21.090
is prove that triangle
FOG is similar is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.482
similar to triangle CIG.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.800
Because if I can prove that,
then their corresponding angles

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.060
are going to be equivalent.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.750
You could say that
this angle is going

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.030
to be equal to this
angle over here.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.815
And so OI would have to be
a transversal because we're

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.190
going to see that these two
lines over here are parallel.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.280
Or if they have these two
triangles are similar-- so

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.792
remember, we're looking at
this triangle right over here

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.000
and this triangle over there.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030
If they really are
similar, then this angle

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.790
is going to be
equal to that angle,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.980
so these really would
be vertical angles.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.010
And so this really
would be a line.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.470
So let's go to the actual proof.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.920
So maybe I-- well, I
won't leave those two

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.510
highlighted right there.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.260
So one thing, and I
hinted at this already.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.380
We know that this line
right over here-- we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.240
can call this line XC.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.280
We know this is
perpendicular to line AB.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.720
It is an altitude.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.079
And we also know that
FY right over here

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.115
is perpendicular to AB.

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:24.850
It is a perpendicular bisector.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.210
So they both form the same
angle with a transversal.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.020
You could view AB
as a transversal.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.550
So they must to be parallel.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.190
So we know that FY
is parallel to XC.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.520
Segment FY is
parallel to segment XC

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.990
and we could write it like this.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.040
This guy is parallel
to that guy there.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.060
And that's useful
because we know

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.250
that alternate interior
angles of a transversal,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.330
when a transversal intersects
two parallel lines,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.065
are congruent.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.400
So we know that FC is a line.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.660
It is a median of this larger
triangle, triangle ABC.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.850
So you have a line intersecting
two parallel lines.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.010
Alternate interior
angles are congruent.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.570
So that angle is going to
be congruent to that angle.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:26.720
So we could say angle OFG
is congruent to angle ICG.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.880
Now, the other thing
we know-- and this

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.840
is a property of medians--
is that the centroid

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.850
splits the median
into two segments that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.096
have a ratio of 2 to 1.

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:46.970
Or another way to think
about is the centroid

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.970
is 2/3 along the median.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.870
So we've proven this
in a previous video.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.590
We know that CG is
equal to 2 times GF.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.490
And I think you see
where we're going here.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.410
We have an angle.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.340
I showed you that the ratio
of this side to this side

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.140
is 2 to 1.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.890
And that's just the property
of centroids and medians.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.433
And now, if we can show you
that the ratio of this side, CI

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:18.300
to FO, is 2 to 1, then we
have two corresponding sides

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.770
where the ratio is 2 to 1.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.810
And we have the angle
in between is congruent.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.810
We could use SAS similarity
to show that these two

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.810
triangles are actually similar.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.620
So let's actually
think about that.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.840
CI is the distance between
the larger triangle's point C

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.740
and its orthocenter.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.240
Right?

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.510
I is the orthocenter
of the larger triangle.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.030
Well, what is FO?

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.250
Well, F is the
corresponding point

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.120
to point C on the
medial triangle,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.000
and we made sure
that we specified

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.130
the similarity with the right--
F corresponds to point C.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.350
So FO is the distance between F
on the smaller medial triangle

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.130
and the smaller medial
triangle's orthocenter.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.670
So this is the
distance between C

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.310
and the orthocenter of
the larger triangle.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.440
This is the distance between
the corresponding side

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.040
of the medial triangle
and its orthocenter.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.950
So this is the same
corresponding distance

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.255
on the larger triangle and
on the medial triangle.

00:07:18.255 --> 00:07:21.970
And we already know they're
similar with a ratio of 2 to 1.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.450
And so, the
corresponding distances

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.720
between any two points
on the two triangles

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.850
are going to have
the same ratio.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.990
So because of that
similarity, we

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.060
know that CI is going to
be equal to 2 times FO.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.780
I want to emphasize this.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.190
C is a corresponding
point to F when

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.340
we look at both of
these similar triangles.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.320
I is the orthocenter
of the larger triangle.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.630
O is the orthocenter of
the smaller triangle.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.220
You're taking a
corresponding point

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.995
to the orthocenter of the larger
triangle, corresponding point

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:57.370
of the smaller triangle to
the orthocenter of the smaller

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.240
triangle.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.500
The triangles are similar
in a ratio of 2 to 1.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.940
So the ratio of this
length to this length

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.080
is going to be 2 to 1.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.340
So we've shown that the ratio
of this side to this side

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.900
is 2 to 1.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.010
We've shown that the ratio
of this side to this side

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.670
is also 2 to 1.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:24.100
And we've shown that the angle
in between them is congruent.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.120
So we have proven
by SAS similarity--

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.250
let me scroll down a little bit.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.030
By SAS similarity-- not
congruency, similarity.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:43.500
We've proven that triangle FOG
is similar to triangle CIG.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.510
And so we know corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.320
We know that angle CIG
corresponds to angle FOG,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.300
so those are going
to be congruent.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.830
And we also know
that angle CGI--

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.800
let me do this in a new color.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.850
Angle CGI corresponds
to angle OGF,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.541
so they are also
going to be congruent.

00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.290
So you can look at
this in different ways.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.520
If this angle and this
angle are the same,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.240
you could now view
OI as a true line--

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.541
as a transversal of
these two parallel lines.

00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.040
So that lets you
know it's one line.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.748
Or you could look at
these two over here.

00:09:18.748 --> 00:09:21.200
Say, look, these two
angles are equivalent.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.790
So these must be
vertical angles.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.660
And so this must actually
be the same line.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.085
The angle that is approaching
this median right over

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:32.000
here is the same angle
that it's leaving.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.690
So these are definitely
on the same line.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.930
So it's a very simple
proof, once again,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:43.200
for a very profound idea-- that
the orthocenter, the centroid,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.050
