thanks to the organizers for inviting me

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900
thanks to the organizers for inviting me
 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.520
thanks to the organizers for inviting me
to come here and chat with you they

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530
to come here and chat with you they
 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.579
to come here and chat with you they
asked me to come here and talk about the

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589
asked me to come here and talk about the
 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.589
asked me to come here and talk about the
researcher perspective and you know I'm

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599
researcher perspective and you know I'm
 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.630
researcher perspective and you know I'm
not really a random researcher okay

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640
not really a random researcher okay
 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.359
not really a random researcher okay
randomly selected researcher I'm trained

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369
randomly selected researcher I'm trained
 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.589
randomly selected researcher I'm trained
as a computer scientist and worked in

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599
as a computer scientist and worked in
 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.479
as a computer scientist and worked in
biomedical informatics for many many

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489
biomedical informatics for many many
 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.850
biomedical informatics for many many
years so I thought it would be really

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860
years so I thought it would be really
 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.560
years so I thought it would be really
interesting to talk a little bit about

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
interesting to talk a little bit about
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.460
interesting to talk a little bit about
the antagonism for contradiction or

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470
the antagonism for contradiction or
 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.780
the antagonism for contradiction or
tension between the incentives and the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790
tension between the incentives and the
 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.119
tension between the incentives and the
interest of data scientists and bench

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129

scientist here because it's really

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
scientist here because it's really
 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.799
scientist here because it's really
important to navigate this if we're

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809
important to navigate this if we're
 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.789
important to navigate this if we're
going to actually make any progress and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799
going to actually make any progress and
 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.300
going to actually make any progress and
everything I have to say is going to be

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310
everything I have to say is going to be
 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.029
everything I have to say is going to be
really connected to the biomedical world

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039
really connected to the biomedical world
 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.980
really connected to the biomedical world
which I know I can't say very much about

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
which I know I can't say very much about
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.429
which I know I can't say very much about
the humanities which I a field that I

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439
the humanities which I a field that I
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.109
the humanities which I a field that I
respect very much but I just don't work

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119
respect very much but I just don't work
 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.330

were only principles so we developed
 

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.520
were only principles so we developed
some tools and guidelines that we

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:15.530
some tools and guidelines that we
 

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.570
