[ Laughter ]

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.053
The biggest threat to suburban
white teens in this country

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.354
is opioids.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:24.090
Close second?
Trampolines.

[ Audience groans ]

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.167

if the net wasn't there.

I've invented the safest way

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.098
to enjoy
the deadly double bounce.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.533
You can do it anywhere,
except on a trampoline.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.035
The only other requirement

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.803

Not since surprise trust falls
