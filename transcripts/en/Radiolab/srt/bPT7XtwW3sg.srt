1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,580
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad. And I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,000
In this hour we are
looking at [inaudible].

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,720
Wait.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,440
Oh, who was that? I'm sorry.
Okay, here we have the laugh box.

5
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:14,680
That's a strange little device that
Robert Provan from the University of

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,230
Maryland Plate. Remember him from the
previous heck yeah, he played it to me.

7
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:17,600
And he has

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,430
the notion about this. Yeah. So basically
you just need laughter, you know,

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,450
cause weapon. The notion here is you
don't need a joke to start the laugh.

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,190
All you need is a laugh. You can throw
the joke away. Laughter causes laughter.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,260
No, you can't get a
laugh going from there.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,600
Well actually actually you can.
And he said I'll prove it to you.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,110
So he showed me a video tape.
This was at in the mall.

14
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,260
Excuse me. Hi. We're doing a study on
the laughter. Laughter. A good thing.

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,330
Absolutely. You'll laugh a lot. I
laugh every day. I make my wife laugh.

16
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:53,260
All ready. What do you
do that makes him laugh?

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,520
Trip spills a lot of things.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,290
What are the thing? We have
a piece of apparatus here.

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,530
You pushed the button before

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,803
[inaudible]

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
why were you laughing?

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,480
Did anyone tell a joke?
Anyone do anything funny,

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,750
easy. What's true? Provide is
absolutely correct about this.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,650
What we're dealing here is
something that's very contagious.

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,220
[inaudible] um, I'm, I'll go gray.

26
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,880
All right. Well, well while we are on
the subject of contagious laughter,

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,020
I've got a story to tell you.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,420
We are filming.

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,910
You want to, all right, now
imagine you Whitney. Yeah.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,420
Imagine 1960 [inaudible] I would just
sit here, eyes your attention. I mean,

31
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,340
Oh yes. 1962. Yeah. Rural village of
Catia, Tanzania, girls boarding school.

32
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,520
When a girl is sitting in
class, she begins to laugh.

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,800
The girl next to her maybe
turned left. Here's her laugh.

34
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:25,230
And she begins to cross the classroom
with their girl joins in and the teacher

35
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,350
gets upset, but it's too
soon for girls in eighth.

36
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,160
The entire class has begun to
laugh and then cry and then laugh,

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,320
cry and the cow. What? Just cause
I don't know. [inaudible] anyhow,

38
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,790
a girl outside at that moment,

39
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,240
walking down the hall to imagine she
hears the laughter from the classroom.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,700
She started still laugh.
And as she walks in,

41
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,660
laughs her laughter goes into other
classrooms and soon the whole school is

42
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,060
doing this laughing,
crying, laughing, crying.

43
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,730
Teachers cannot control these girls
when they try to, the girls get violent,

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,530
they could play one. Yup. And
the principal then has choice.

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,270
He's got to close the school.

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,540
They opened the school a week
later and it happens again soon.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,960
They closed the school a second time.
Meanwhile, the girls who started all this,

48
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,110
they go back to their villages many,
many miles away and this thing,

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,610
whatever it is, spreads up and down
the coast of Lake Victoria. You mean?

50
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,280
People in the villages start
to play in one village,

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,250
217 people start to laugh and cry.

52
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,370
A second boarding school has to
shut down and no one knows why.

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,120
So a team of doctors,

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,810
some British doctors in the area and they
hop in a land rover and they rush out

55
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,240
to investigate this strange phenomenon

56
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,150
and this is what they write. The
Central African Journal of Medicine,

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,620
volume nine number five, May,

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,470
1963 the disease commenced
on 30th of January,

59
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,480
1962 to mission among girls
and middle school at Kosha.

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,670
The onset is sudden with a tax of laughing
and crying lasting for a few minutes

61
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:01,671
to a few hours to a maximum of 16 days
by spite and then a recurrence in the

62
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:07,200
report there was an account of a 52 year
old man who saw some people afflicted

63
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,840
with a sickness. I'm soon after
we're turning to his heart,

64
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,510
he felt something telling him to
laugh and cry and shout. There's,

65
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,390
he continued to do for most of the night.

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,960
No fatal cases have been reported.
This is very, what is this true?

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,510
Well, okay. We wondered. Okay.

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
So we sent our producer Ellen Horn 40
some odd years after the fact to see what

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,993
she could find.

70
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,570
I'm flying to [inaudible] to be honest,

71
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:40,040
I was a little bit worried that I can
see the sun setting over Lake Victoria

72
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:44,750
that uh, that the medical
journal article just wasn't true.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,090
Yes. With that's yeah. Cause
that's cause what I expected.

74
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:48,500
Was this a total hoax? Yeah.

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,700
Or that it was some kind of
like stunt getting close.

76
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,010
It just sort of doubted the general
credibility of the, of the whole thing.

77
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,650
Okay. We'll be correcting
the BACOPA. Okay.

78
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:05,250
So I get to recall baptist totally
in the most beautiful place.

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,050
The cover is a tiny port town.

80
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,130
It's green and lush and this very
remote part of northern Tanzania in the

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,260
morning.

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,190
And my first step was just to spend a
couple of days walking around and asking

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,220
everybody that I ran
into who spoke English.

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,250
So I'm asking them about
this contagious laughter,

85
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,780
but demic of laughter I
guess I imagined, you know,

86
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:30,500
this happened in the in the sixties so
I'm looking for people who are like in

87
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:35,360
their seventies and eighties turns out
that I didn't need old people and young

88
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:38,240
people totally new. But I
was talking about I, yeah,

89
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,350
I totally know what you mean
because it still happens today.

90
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,240
The first time I saw it,

91
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:49,241
it was in 1991 I went to this tour office
and the first person I met there was

92
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,400
this guy named Raymond Raymond.

93
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,210
When he said he thought he could find me,

94
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:59,930
somebody who had I maybe forgive
me three hours, I can find those.

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,730
I can give you my phone number.

96
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,750
About an hour later I get
a text from him that says,

97
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,350
meet me in a half hour hop
in his car. We drive off to,

98
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,480
how did you find this person? I know

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,980
he's not kidding. Raymond is a former
Tanzania national soccer team star.

100
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:21,100
He's like a local celebrity, like
kids follow him down the street,

101
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,660
so Raymond drives me up this dirt road
about 10 minutes we get to this blue

102
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,823
cement building.

103
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,780
We sit outside on the porch and these
white plastic chairs and we just, we wait.

104
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,380
Hello. After about 20 minutes, this
woman comes out really beautiful,

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,440
has a mole on her nose at long eyelashes
or she'll introduce herself for me.

106
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,380
She's nervously squeezing this plastic
water bottle. It's in her hand.

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,850
[inaudible] can Chester is her name.

108
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,320
[inaudible].

109
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,010
She tells me that in her high school
there were three girls who are affected

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,370
chicka Chicka for all of them
in happen during exams. Yeah.

111
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,780
What do you remember what the test was

112
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,190
about? It was the
morning of the math test.

113
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,180
She remembers walking into
the exam room. She sat down,

114
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:23,400
she looked at her paper and suddenly

115
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,250
[inaudible] something came over her.

116
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,520
She started laughing and
then she took a photo class

117
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,650
C and e community and then she says she
doesn't remember much ups from that.

118
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:43,200
She's told that she fought.
When they tried to restrain her,

119
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,490
she spent three days in the
hospital. They would give her Valium,

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,040
make her pass out. Then she'd wake up,

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,710
feel a little bit better for a while
and then it would come on again.

122
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,840
She'd uncontrollably be laughing.
Then they would give her more Valium.

123
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:01,200
She'd pass out. Why do
you think this happens?

124
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,970
A little gun in a c tree, she says,

125
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,380
happens for girls, right, are not free.

126
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,510
And so I asked her if she felt free,

127
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,850
like I'm not even sure
what they're talking about,

128
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,100
but I asked her if she
felt free and she said,

129
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,860
I need a quote or I can establish
you live with your parents,

130
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,040
what can you're that age,
no one's really free.

131
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,670
She said she had a boyfriend and her
parents wouldn't let her see him.

132
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,280
But in the hospital when she
had the laughing sickness,

133
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,070
he was allowed to come
visit and he definitely

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,920
[inaudible].

135
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,920
So this girl has a crazy
attack of laughing and then
her boyfriend shows up and

136
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:44,250
she's just fine. Well, we're more like,
she's allowed to see her boyfriend.

137
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,690
So it's about the wall. She's, I mean,
the real common association with this,

138
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,930
with the sicknesses that
it's a teenage girl disease

139
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,620
happens to grow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again,

140
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,060
16 to 20 years old crying and sometimes
laughy talk to a school nurse,

141
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,090
a psychiatric nurse from the
local hospital, a doctor,

142
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,930
and they all said vaguely the same thing.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,060
The reason it happened was that it had
something to do with the transitions of

144
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,930
adolescence. And, and just out
of curiosity, you're a girl.

145
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,450
Is there something about this that
makes sense to you? Terrorists. Yes.

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,220
Out of Cura. Yeah, sure.

147
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
So do you know you're just beginning to
kind of negotiate your relationship to

148
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:33,450
sex and boys and there's
these new pressures and these
new responsibilities that

149
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,320
are really challenging. It's funny,
boys don't, don't have that problem.

150
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:40,740
We just want to have sex and
it's a crisis for girls. Yeah.

151
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,050
So it does kind of make sense. Okay.

152
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,850
But it doesn't really explain
anything about 1962 to me. Why not?

153
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,650
Because in 1962 it wasn't just teenage
girls, it was boys. It was men.

154
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,160
It was villages full
of people of all ages.

155
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,680
So what explains that?

156
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,043
[inaudible]

157
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,680
personally for me, found a
woman who was there. Hello.

158
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,560
That's good.

159
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,450
Gertrude is in her fifties she's got
short loose curls and big smiles.

160
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,790
And in 1962 when the laughter epidemic
struck her village, she got it too.

161
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,660
Six years old.

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,740
Very young. Do you remember?
I remember his, yeah.

163
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,220
Sheer ever seen hundreds of people
coming down with this strange affliction.

164
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:34,500
I took many forms. Some were
laughing, everlasting laughter,

165
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,550
then laugh and cry at the
same thing at the same time.

166
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,733
[inaudible]

167
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,850
what happened to me was
I was not able to talk,

168
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,410
crying only,

169
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,410
and then my eyes were closed as
if there is a it gum on my eyes,

170
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,700
so my mom,

171
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,840
she called me on her back and they walked.

172
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,470
They walked over the hills when her mom
carrying her on her back for hours and

173
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:13,780
along the way, they ran into other
people, boys, girls, men even. Oh,

174
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,830
Dylan's dozens of people all headed
the same way. Laughing, crying.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,790
I have been yet the skin.
Where are they going to?

176
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,150
The witch doctor did this. Which
note? I didn't know what else to do.

177
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,650
[inaudible] hundreds of people. She
says, converged on this woman's tiny hut,

178
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,080
so do going east. A 10 by 10 in
the house. They will have fool.

179
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,010
They hit to stay outside.

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,120
They are mini because there were so
many people going to many people.

181
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,690
Those daily, Boom. What do you
think the problem was? Oh, okay.

182
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,530
I was asking my Erda ones

183
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,770
Tuesday problem.

184
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,470
They said that it was
something like spiritual,

185
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,900
a spiritual event,

186
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,740
because one year before this program
there we are sitting in seats.

187
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,500
She said that about a year
before the laughter epidemic,

188
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,120
Caterpillar's had shown up.

189
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,140
They were breathing in the
spread all over the ground.

190
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,330
There was this huge infestation.

191
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,490
One of the explanations was that the
people who got sick had walked across the

192
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:29,290
caterpillar. They stepped on this
caterpillars and had killed them.

193
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,970
As a result,

194
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,260
the spirit of the caterpillars were
possessing they that they to get this

195
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,860
feeling. Now she sort of dismissed
that. That's not scientific,

196
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:43,861
but maybe this caterpillar head is
eating bacterias which affected debris.

197
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,140
Okay.

198
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,820
This explanation that there was some
sort of bacteria or virus I had already

199
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:52,654
checked today,

200
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,720
I had gone to the Government Hospital
[inaudible] to talk to the medical officer

201
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,170
and insurance. They've never
found any physical costs for this.

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,020
Not in the medical
importance, which was found.

203
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,820
I'd even talked to a lab technician.

204
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,950
I've looked at the technician who had
checked blood samples in 1962 everything

205
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:14,040
was negative. They tested the
water supply, the food supply.

206
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,410
You get people negative so that the
cattle fillers seemed like a dead end.

207
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,160
So I tried a different tech.

208
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,070
I asked Gertrude what was going on then
at that time in your village and she

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,540
thought about it for awhile and then
she said you look well he's winning.

210
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,190
Of course there was
independence. Independence.

211
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,630
Whoa.

212
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,630
For 40 years Tanzania had been a British
colony but 1961 Tanzania had declared

213
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,610
independence and this was right before,

214
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,180
just weeks before that
first girl started laughing.

215
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,080
[inaudible] I don't know
much about independence.

216
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,930
What can you tell me about independence?

217
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:55,090
What they experienced by then was
people going alone seeing Ethan drums.

218
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,420
Dan seeing cause the [inaudible]

219
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,970
but the but from that I can tell more
routine dependence cause I was very,

220
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:12,474
very young.

221
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,230
Gertrude said that she knew
somebody who would remember more.

222
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,220
Someone I should talk to.
[inaudible] 71 year old man.

223
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,370
Mr Sauce was se thing deal, which
looked at, he was the witchdoctors.

224
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,520
This assistant may be,

225
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,810
this man can help more than I do.

226
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,330
You want some coffee or some
breakfast here first, how?

227
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,960
My very last day in the Cobra,

228
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,250
Raymond and I sat down with this map
and which doctor's assistant had a

229
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:44,130
restaurant near my hotel. It's a tiny guy,

230
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,550
gray hair and big oversized suit and he
filled in some of the missing pieces.

231
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,850
When you tell him, I want
to know what he remembers.

232
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,440
I asked him about the independence
celebration that Gertrude described.

233
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,270
[inaudible] the ones just
before the laughter epidemic.

234
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,710
[inaudible] he painted a very
different picture. I didn't remember

235
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,040
[inaudible]. He was 26 at the time.

236
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,170
Kenny MCHA is teens and after
the parties died down, he said,

237
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:23,220
change [inaudible] swept
through his village to do jewel.

238
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,870
Does that Buddha? It can
you cut out cause I would've

239
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,240
[inaudible] [inaudible]
following independence,

240
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:34,140
Tanzania became a socialist state and the
new government was out to create a new

241
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:38,150
world order. Lamb changed hands.
They abolished the local clan,

242
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,190
the president, president [inaudible].

243
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,850
After the independence
and the local religions,

244
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,180
the bond, the speech,

245
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,080
this was the brand new
age. This is the new era.

246
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
You were supposed to have
a modern belief system.

247
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,130
The entire village was being asked to
abandon the way that they had worshiped

248
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,810
for thousands of years. You can tweak it

249
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,450
[inaudible] within weeks. The church
has moved out. Yeah, but it's okay. Lee,

250
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,630
they had business. Catholic church
opened up on one side of the street.

251
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,670
Now Lutheran on the other patients
were [inaudible] people convincing

252
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,440
[inaudible] to join different really
tins. They even handed out money.

253
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,870
It was kind of a bidding war for
souls. All of it was too new,

254
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:30,740
too fast. The tool does
that. Buddha Sassy,

255
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,480
he even remembers this one
particular night that would assassin.

256
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,090
Everyone in his village gathered outside.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Rafa stared at the Sky Kupuna and whizzy
they had been told that was the end of

258
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:49,950
life on f uh,

259
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,280
to me the night everybody was out the
all night waiting to see whether the moon

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,970
today, a couple of hours,

261
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,440
he told me we saw that
heavens and the moon.

262
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,320
She did too slamming into each other.

263
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,860
Can you cut out cause I've sequel

264
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,670
[inaudible] what they saw, it was a

265
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,840
scoped them. That's what they see.

266
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,020
Got It. Maybe that was the end
of the world of that old world.

267
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,213
Here's the sky,

268
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,540
the switched doctors assistant who
introduced himself to me actually as an

269
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:38,541
elected official made this jump in his
life that that was a particular period of

270
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,590
time when everybody was making
this big jump all of the sudden.

271
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:46,610
So you think that this laughing
epidemic had something to do with it?

272
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,760
Like an avalanche of newness? Yeah,
well the explanations I came across,

273
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,450
this is the one that makes the most
sense to me. It's plausible to me too,

274
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,840
cause you're, you got a loss of
religion and arrival of a new religion,

275
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,150
a loss of a political
culture, a new leader.

276
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,410
And that's a very large pile up
of change all of a sudden. Yeah.

277
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,330
And of course everyone's
a little bit scared.

278
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,390
So there's a quiet and then
someone starts to laugh. You know,

279
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:13,530
who knows why that first girl went
crazy and why she started making crazy

280
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,070
laughing noises. But it was like people
saw that and they were like, Oh God,

281
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,350
I feel like that too.
It sounds like laughter.

282
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:23,220
But you could think of it as as like a
collective scream or something. Yeah,

283
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,100
like the entire society
was a 16 year old girl

284
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,790
