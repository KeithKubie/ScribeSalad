Hey, welcome to the Android
developer nanodegree.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.080
My name's Chris, and I'm a curriculum
manager here at Udacity.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.340
I'm lucky to have worked on some cool
Android devices, like the Nexus,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.370
and the Samsung Galaxy series.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.980
More importantly,
I love building mobile products.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.310
They're increasingly more personal,
enrich our lives in so many ways,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.430
and they even feel a tad magical.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.140
Now today, I'm super excited to help
you begin your journey to build and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.720
create your own immersive experiences
for this incredible platform.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.210
Now it's even cooler is we designed this
degree with our friends at Google, so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.820
you know that you're learning
directly from the experts.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090
I think they want to say, hello.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.250
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; And you learn about Android
as a platform for your ideas and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.200
become aware of the vast canvas of
APIs that will be at your disposal.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.290
Before you know it, you're writing
code that can reach millions of people

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.690
not only on their phones but also on
their tablet's, TVs, wearables and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.440
even in their cars and when you finish
the program, you'll be ready to start or

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.840
advance your career as
an Android developer.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.810
You'll even have a killer
portfolio projects to prove it.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.370
So why don't we go through them.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.743
You'll get your feet wet with an
introductory project that you'll build

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:04.900
in the first week in the nanodegree.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.730
You'll also build an app that helps
users discover the most popular movies

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.380
on the web, an optimizer for
both phone and tablet.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.680
Next, you'll take two apps and make them
production ready by adding features like

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.090
Google Cloud Messaging, error handling,
widgets, accessibility and localization

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.590
support, and a handy one that are
properly used in integrated libraries.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.910
After that,
we timed the superchargeable process

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.220
using the gridable system to automate
testing, signing, dependency management,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.627
and even configuring your app to
build a free and payed version.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:38.618
Okay, then you're going to focus on
something that's critical to every app,

00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:41.490
the user experience, something
that we all evaluate visceraly.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.304
You're going to take an existing app and

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:47.725
update it using Android's latest
design language, material design.

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:51.060
You'll even learn how to extend your
apps to wearables, TV, and the car.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.260
Finally, you'll take everything you
learned from building these projects

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.140
to develop a unique app experience
of your own in the Capstone project.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.300
Your app will also draw from Google's
extensive set of mobile services, which

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.550
includes things like maps, location and
context, analytics and AdMob.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.680
Here's Miriam to tell you more
about details of the program.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.400
&gt;&gt; Building these
projects won't be easy.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.770
We are going to challenge you so

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.001
that you are prepared to solve tough
problems and think independently.

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.248
To rise to that challenge, you'll need
to keep up with your learning schedule

00:02:21.248 --> 00:02:23.126
and engage with your
nanodegree community.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.066
Your fellow students are here to
help untangle the trickiest puzzles,

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.370
get over the biggest hurdles, and
encourage you through all of it.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.430
And when they need help
you'll do the same for them.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.210
The Audacity team will be here
too to deepen your learning,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.470
offer project feedback, and
help you develop professionally.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.810
By leveraging the support systems and
working consistently, you can prepare

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.710
yourself for an entirely new stage of
your career in a matter of months.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.080
We can't wait to see where
your nanodegree takes you.
