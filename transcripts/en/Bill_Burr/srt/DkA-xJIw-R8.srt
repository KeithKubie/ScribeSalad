1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,460
All right. Hey, what's
going on? His bill burn.

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,770
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,890
Monday morning podcasts and
I am just checking in on you.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,660
I didn't yell this time.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,680
I did yell at this time because I'm
sitting across from a man who is currently

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,000
setting the Guinness Book of World
Records for podcasting in a day,

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:22,440
promoting his new show on Netflix.
Stand up in a way for episodes,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,010
uh, debuting Christmas
Eve. Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,860
what are the greatest debt of
comedians and say the middle life.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,600
Please welcome Mister Brian Regan
Bell. How are you man? I'm excellent.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,580
How are you doing? You look like
you've already to glaze over here.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,280
You're on the whole media
tour, right? Did they get you?

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,040
Did you do some morning TV?

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,550
Did you do have that crap and morning TV?

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,500
I am not comfortable
with those morning shows.

16
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:54,240
I tend to love doing these with other
comedians. Oh, okay, good, good.

17
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,900
You know when it's, when it's
not another comedian, it's, I'm,

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,800
I am so horrible at them.
Find your funny Brian. Oh boy.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,670
It's what can people expect from
your show? That's the moment,

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,050
like if I'm doing a phone interview, like
a radio and phone, radio interviewer,

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,751
well as soon as they say,

22
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:17,040
what can people expect people for
people who aren't familiar with you,

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,900
what can they expect from your show?

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,560
I know right away they're not familiar
with the person asked me the question.

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,140
Yes.
And I just want to hang up.

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,280
Like I just want to get a few
to be over at that moment.

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,620
It's your show going to be the exact
same thing I just watched on television.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,060
Yeah, that's another one. Did
you write any new material?

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,750
Now it's going to be exact same shit.
See, after I finally got a special,

30
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,970
I then wanted to ruin it by boring
people by doing the exact same stuff. Uh,

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,240
Brian in this company asked you all
hacky questions in this current comedy

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:48,810
climate,

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,810
how do you find the altitude to fly
at with your current presentation of,

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,630
of satire? I'm going to
fucking cry. It's a, it's a,

35
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:04,110
it's an insane world. It's in the
same world right now. But um, anyways,

36
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,790
tell me about your show.
It's a hybrid half stand up,

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,050
half sketch.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,730
A lot of the older bits that I used to
do years ago when I do my shows around

39
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,080
the country,

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,010
people at the end of my show sometimes
like to hear some of the older stuff and

41
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:24,740
I'm like, well what can I do? Maybe I
could do something with this. So I'm just,

42
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,293
you get,

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,570
you're like that good that you have
like classic jokes that's harder than a

44
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:34,430
classic song. Yeah. I'm not going
to use that word on myself, but, uh,

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,280
it's nice of you to say that, but uh,
you know, so I'm like lay it on thick.

46
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,740
The Johnny Cash.
Yeah.

47
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,080
Well it feels good that people
still like to, you know,

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,470
hear some of these routines and I thought,
well,

49
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:50,820
maybe I can do something with them,
but I don't want to just do the standup.

50
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,380
I mean, people don't know that. So I
thought maybe if I do like a standup bit,

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,140
and then that segues into some sketch
or something like that. And, uh,

52
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,460
Jerry Seinfeld got involved.

53
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,470
Oh, here you go. Um,

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
he was the one who reached out and he's
always been cool with me and said that

55
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,130
he wanted to help spearhead
me having a show. I mean,

56
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:16,780
what better phone call is that? It's an
a life that's a big phone call. You know,

57
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,410
like, like you're, you're on the
phone going, look at these goosebumps.

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,940
I got goosebumps. Yeah. You know,

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,140
it's funny when you said this when you
were describing your show is I, that's,

60
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,690
he's the first person I thought I was
like, Jerry would like to show. He was so,

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,500
you know, was cool. He said that he
had this idea, he didn't have the idea.

62
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,890
He said he wanted me to have a show.
He said,

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,000
let's get together sometime and see if we
can talk about this. And I was like, go,

64
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,910
you know, of course, you know, and um, he
was performing in Las Vegas where I live,

65
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,120
so I went to go meet him at his
sweet.

66
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,560
They have sweets and hotels that are like,
that I didn't know were possible,

67
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,810
like piano and a segues to take it from.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,553
What

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,000
kind of room is this? You know,
so I go, we go meet and we chat.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,980
And he said, yeah, you know,

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,150
he thought that I was one of the
comedians that have, should have a show,

72
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:23,230
which was just a huge, huge honor even
hearing that. And he said, well, you know,

73
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,950
maybe we'll get together and talk about
it sometime soon. And I said, well,

74
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:30,790
I have an idea. And he goes, okay. And I,

75
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,470
I know he likes coffee, right? So I said,
do you mind if we order some coffee?

76
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:39,070
And we chat about it.
So called room service.

77
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:43,540
They brought up a pot of coffee. I
pitched it to him in about three minutes,

78
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,160
you know, and he goes, I
like it, let's do it. And um,

79
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,370
I got emotional. I swear
to God, I started like,

80
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,410
I got a tear in my eye because it
show business doesn't work like that.

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,510
Say we had his shell
business does. Yes, exactly.

82
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:59,890
I knew when he said,

83
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,300
yeah, yeah, let's do it.
And then you do it. And

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,950
I knew it was happening. I mean, I'm
on belittling all the work he does,

85
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:12,840
but like he has like the,
uh, whatever that is. Like,

86
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,530
he knows when an idea is good and
then he goes, let's just do it.

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,850
And then he does it. He does it way
he wants to do it. Everybody responds.

88
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,470
And then,
uh,

89
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,790
and I knew back the bank
truck up exactly that.

90
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
The money part as isn't
even that important to me,
you know, I mean right now,

91
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,440
but just his cloud agent
just slapped his forehead.

92
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,780
It goes renegotiations wait,
are they going to play this

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,310
wait is still be down to
earth crying some point.

94
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,960
Would you be a little bit of a diva?

95
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,540
Yeah. But I knew when he said he wanted
to do it, that it was going to happen.

96
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,090
Right. Who's going to
say no to him? You know?

97
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:56,330
And I knew that he's the one
shepherding this. So anyway,

98
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:57,830
it was like really that uh,

99
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,330
that uh, he's supporting
this. Yeah, I would say,

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,810
I would say that would be a, uh, if
you're going to go in with anybody,

101
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,240
that would probably be
something he did for them.

102
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,680
How long does it take
you to shoot an episode?

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm fascinated with this aspect of it.
Of the Wendy,

104
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,130
you get to go home aspect of showbusiness.

105
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,590
Well there was a lot of writers' meetings,
you know,

106
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:23,420
a a bunch of weeks of that, you know,
just coming up with the sketches.

107
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,710
A lot of the sketch ideas
I had already had. Um,

108
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,140
and then we shot the sketches also.

109
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,450
Not everyone of them is based
on one of your older bits.

110
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,750
It's just some of them are and
some of them are newer ideas.

111
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,430
None of the sketches are stand up done
as a sketch. I didn't want to do that.

112
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,460
Stand up. I love stand up and
stand up. Should be stand up.

113
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,970
So do the one where you wanted to do the
cattle prod and the person who's just

114
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,430
standing where they're supposed
to be walking in the airport.

115
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,440
It was one of my favorites. I like to see
somebody, maybe that one, maybe that one,

116
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,250
I'll do it.

117
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,880
But I wanted to stand up to be stand
up and then I wanted some type of

118
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,910
transition into a sketch.
Sometimes it's a natural lead in,

119
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,690
sometimes you have to kind
of like horseshoe it, you
know what I mean? And um,

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,950
but that was part of the fun too,

121
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,500
is like manufacturing
these segues into sketches.

122
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,690
So we shot all the sketches and then we
shot all four episodes in two nights in

123
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,670
front of a live audience
where we would throw,

124
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,710
I do stand up and then throw to the
schedules effect. Yeah. So in theory,

125
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,150
if you got 10 episodes,

126
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:28,151
you could be done by Wednesday for
foreign to do a half day on Wednesday like

127
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:33,260
they have as a PTA meeting and then
you're done. Yeah, it was cool.

128
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,770
It was cool. And then, you know, the
final night, you know, it was, uh,

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,030
happened to be my birthday and had a
big birthday celebration after that.

130
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:45,350
So it was like a nice, uh, it was a
cool experience. That's awesome. Well,

131
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,670
my next, next time I do a TV show, I don't
think I'm going to do animation again.

132
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,700
I tried. Donna was being so smart. I
love my show. I love doing the show,

133
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,730
but it's just like there's
always, you know, all, you know,

134
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,810
every gay shut the episode in
three days. I'm like, Jesus

135
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,040
takes us a fucking year.
You get this thing done. Um,

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,760
so any who, some of the cast
members, anybody I know,

137
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,220
I didn't want a normal cast.
I cast pur sketch, you know,

138
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,870
so it isn't like there's a from Isis,

139
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,660
how against the grain dejected
Dick did you cast here? I want it.

140
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:30,200
Like if it was a particular sketch where
you had three characters we would cast

141
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,200
for that particular episode or
that particular sketch. You know,

142
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,840
I didn't want like a,
like a mad TV or uh, oh,

143
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:39,320
you don't want to know kind of thing.
People know whoever services the thing,

144
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,270
you know. Okay. And uh, so
there's some obscure people,
but uh, they were all great.

145
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,500
Soon did not be obscure when this
thing debuts, like I said earlier,

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,180
four episodes on Netflix,
Christmas Eve. Um,

147
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,430
so you're a Florida Guy, right? Yeah. Um,

148
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,320
what can people expect from a Florida
guy with a sketch show? Sorry,

149
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:02,760
I just love those questions.

150
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,950
Oh, what do you think about
occurred? Prevalent. Is that crazy?

151
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
You get a Lotta let him
material that event. Yeah.

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,920
So heat in a, uh, a social situation.

153
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,170
When you meet somebody who just finds
out you're a comedian and like every

154
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,840
single thing that said
they have to throw in.

155
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,180
I bet this going to
end up in your routine.

156
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,570
You should talk about this.
You know,

157
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,990
somebody has a chip and they put some,
you know,

158
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,290
some guacamole on it and
it falls on a table. Okay.

159
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,940
I bet that's going to end up in your
act in front of you in the buffet line.

160
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:43,620
Don't put this in your APP. Yeah,
usually try to avoid bombing.

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,400
My job is to entertain, I mean I might
put this in the act there. Right, right.

162
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,960
That's this because now we are,
we're actually, they're actually,

163
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,270
we're putting it in the act. You
described the Guac falling off the chair.

164
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,010
Do you know what I want more of?
I want it

165
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,670
more celebrities, uh, celebrities.

166
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,340
If I can say the word telling me
about their political opinions,

167
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,170
I can't get enough of it.
You know,

168
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,930
cause I'm very unsure on
what I think about the world,

169
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,040
in which way I'm going to vote.

170
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,390
And then all of a sudden the f the
six lead on a sitcom, you know,

171
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:17,890
informs me about fitting or something.
And I'm like, oh, okay. That's,

172
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,610
that's how, that's how I need to think
about that. I want to see the flip.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I want to see in an og duration ceremony
for a congressman and during his

174
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:31,990
swearing in, he says, who should
have one for wardrobe design

175
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,060
in a movie? You know, criticized,

176
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,370
criticized the wardrobe
winners, you know, um,

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,220
which of course is absurd, but I
know it's a weird, it's a weird time.

178
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:53,020
And you know, I, I've never felt,
uh, I don't feel old, you know,

179
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,640
I fill out, I just feel like,
uh, it started with the music.

180
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,220
I didn't know what
people were listening to.

181
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,720
I didn't know where the popular bands was.

182
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,110
And then I started to not know who
the players were playing sports.

183
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,710
And now it's like a, yeah,
I don't know the words,

184
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,990
you know, I don't, I don't know. No other
words that I'm not that bad. I just,

185
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,520
I just, I, I, uh, I don't
agree with it. When, uh,

186
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,590
the academy awards come
out, the, it used to be,

187
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:24,760
I had seen all of the movies that are up
for best picture than it was like, oh,

188
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:29,590
I didn't see that one. Then it was
like, oh, I saw a couple of them.

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,480
Right.
And then it got,

190
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,400
now it's gone to the point where
I've never even heard of any of them.

191
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,700
Yeah. I've never even heard of them.
Yeah. I haven't even heard of him. Well,

192
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:43,090
now there's so much stuff to watch you
or they just got rid of another Oscar

193
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,780
host.
Yeah.

194
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,540
Evidently he tripped somebody in like
outdoor recess it like in 1983. Oh,

195
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,060
that was it. And there was some
sort of getting me in kindergarten.

196
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,310
Kindergarten thing. Yeah.
Yeah. On a final plan.

197
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,150
I don't blame him because
that was a mistake.

198
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,290
That was a mistake that
he made in his past. Yeah.

199
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,350
And tripping is never to be a times you
apologize for it. It's never cool. No,

200
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,430
I think all,

201
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:10,570
I think all mistakes in life should
disqualify everyone from any future

202
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,800
endeavors. If your acumen. Yes, yes.

203
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,340
No mistake should be allowed for in,
in the human condition.

204
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,190
Perfect people. Perfect. People should
host award shows. Perfect. People should,

205
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,230
when Heisman trophies, they should uh, um,

206
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,060
host award shows the savvy people
like us. Perfect. People like us.

207
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,800
So I want to add for younger kids now
because so much of this shit is like on

208
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,560
video and just some of the,
again, they're going to be fun.

209
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:42,550
I think the amount of the population
that won't be able to run for any sort of

210
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,460
office, I just wonder, you know,

211
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:48,730
there's always pendulums and everything
and right now the pendulum is over.

212
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,110
Two people want to, is it pendulum?
A pendulum? You might be right.

213
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,360
I don't know anybody. Geez.
Aaron Pendulum Pendulum.

214
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,820
Oh, I'm getting a nod that I'm
right. Look at that. Look at that.

215
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,740
But once pendulum, well
it's a angel. You know what?

216
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,830
The Florida schools pendulum well there
did you go to Ponce De Leon High School?

217
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,400
I went to pendulum high school.

218
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,630
I went to fend the Hi
Fountain of Youth Junior high.

219
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,480
I went to Christopher Columbus high
school coach should talk about, you know,

220
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,570
politically incorrect in today's world.
You know, another guy who stand where,

221
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,890
where like where all of that new evidence
came. If he did all of that shit,

222
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,710
what did he write it all down?
He tweeted it a toy they went back to,

223
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,640
is this tweet to do you got to do a
sketch about that case on the lumber?

224
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,030
Say go back in, hey, you know, it
was on the Santa Maria, you know,

225
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,900
and it's a lot of time going from Spain
or wherever they left from over to the

226
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:51,030
new world. So we would just sit
back in his cabin and tweet. Uh,

227
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,390
yeah. Uncredible Wifi is,
he went across the ocean.

228
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,090
Um, so anyway, I, yeah, I do. I
went to a Columbus high school.

229
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,530
I forget the point of, I
forget the question and what
my answer is. I don't know,

230
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,760
but I'm enjoying it.
All right,

231
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,220
good talk anytime you can talk about
Columbus Tweeten when he should be captain

232
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,490
on the Santa Maria.
Uh,

233
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,320
that's actually a great premise.

234
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,890
Like how quickly would Hitler get kicked
off at Twitter? The second you got on

235
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,720
Hitler,
you said Queer.

236
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,370
You can't say that. That's a
great sketch. All these people,

237
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,610
and then you've got to have like, you
know, Mother Teresa when she was young,

238
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:44,050
something she did. I don't know.
Who knows? Uh, anyways, what's your,

239
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,160
are you still see you a college football
guy? What was your deal? I played,

240
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,310
I played college ball. That's what
it was. Um, a small division three.

241
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,110
So, um, it was sorta like a school,
Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio.

242
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,850
Loved my years there. Just,
you know, Midwestern school,

243
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,690
just like if you were to film a
movie and a Midwestern campus,

244
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:08,570
this is the perfect place. You
know, just a thousand students.

245
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:13,340
Everybody knew each other and uh,
fix your supreme court justices either.

246
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,510
Okay. Yeah. Right, right.
It was a perfect tablet.

247
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,780
Wasn't underneath what was happening.
So I played football there. Love that.

248
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,710
I actually tried out for
a semipro football team.

249
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,350
When did it happen in those
leaks, by the way? The a F A,

250
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm sure you've heard of that.
No,

251
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,330
nobody has the American
Football Association. Okay.

252
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,220
And uh, they had a, they
were forming this new league,

253
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,690
so there was a team going to form in
Orlando called the Orlando Americans.

254
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,750
They were going to play in
the Tangerine Bowl. Nice.

255
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,660
Have Buddy of mine went up and tried
out and they invited him to camp.

256
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,270
He's a quarterback. He played at
Notre Dame and he said, Reagan,

257
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,890
you should go up there
and try out as a receiver.

258
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,250
I played receiver in college and I'm
like, Guy, I was out of shape, you know,

259
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,020
it was that a year and a half
after college because no, the,

260
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,120
the talent up there is the
kind that you could fit in.

261
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:13,121
So I went up and try it out of this big
mass tryout and he invited me to camp.

262
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,860
Wow.
They invited me to camp.

263
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:19,130
They brought a nine receivers in the camp.

264
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,280
But when,
then we had to try out from there.

265
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,610
They were only going to keep three
receivers. They had like a skeletal squad,

266
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:29,480
like two starters in one backup,
you know, and they cut down to five.

267
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,210
I was one of the five, I was one of the
five left. Nice. And then they, uh, I had,

268
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,640
I did a post corner pattern
and through my hip out and um,

269
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,970
I don't think I would've made it
anyway, but they cut me. Cut me.

270
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,850
I'm just picturing you running in your,
your standup crouch.

271
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,420
Like that's why you threw your hip up.
What year was that?

272
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,030
How will I was to hold?
Are you

273
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,770
um, well I was like 20. No.
Yeah, it was probably 20 to 22.

274
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,020
I already too out of shape.
Yeah.

275
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,380
Well if it is, no, no, I was, I meant that
as like a compliment to athletes item.

276
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,290
I think I had a cousin, uh, played
a little semipro football. Um,

277
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,380
does those leaks still exist?
Is that an actually an actual way into,

278
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:15,270
I feel like it's the CFL or you
walk on and you know, that's it.

279
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:20,271
Like as far as getting into the after
college to try and get into the NFL,

280
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,290
I figured either going to stand out at
the CFL and even then that's a long shot

281
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,590
or you just try to get a
walk on right after college.

282
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,701
Well,
I,

283
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:34,500
I had no aspirations of
making it in the NFL zero,

284
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,453
you know,
like,

285
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,530
but the fact that my buddy thought I
could make this one team, I thought,

286
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:43,140
well this could be a good experience
for a year or two if I could get on the

287
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:47,820
team. And uh, no that, that particular
league doesn't exist anymore.

288
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,770
So what exactly did you do to your
hip? I did a post corner pattern. Yeah.

289
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,640
You know, you see 45 degree
angle and then cut back out.

290
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,750
I had these hip pads that were too
tight and I just remember feeling like a

291
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:05,280
sprawling, oh no. And I have no idea.

292
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,950
Like I didn't have money to go to
a doctor or anything like that.

293
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:12,420
I just couldn't walk. Kind of hard
to make a team when you can't walk.

294
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,153
So

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,730
waiting for that feeling to go away.

296
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:19,150
And then you just thought it still hasn't
gone away. Continued on with your life.

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,640
Yeah. It still hurts. It still
hurts. My knee hurts from football,

298
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,460
you know? Uh, when I was in college,

299
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:30,510
I had a knee thing and they would shoot
me up with cortisone for the games

300
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,320
because we had to keep
this ONH streak going.

301
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,343
Oh yeah.

302
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,130
You know what I mean? And they would
shoot bit with cortisone. It was,

303
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,180
it was amazing because,
uh,

304
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,840
the pain was so intense when
they didn't shoot me up.

305
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:50,730
Like I could barely walk and then they
would shoot me up before the games and

306
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,740
I'm going to field running
around like a deer, you know,

307
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:56,830
like I felt like Bambi like,
but while I'm running,

308
00:18:56,831 --> 00:19:00,820
I'm practically hearing crunch,
crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

309
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,930
It's just twisted my knee up,
you know? And I finally quit.

310
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
I quit college because of the knee.

311
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:09,040
I was worried that I was going
to do permanent damage to it.

312
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,690
Did you want me to still hurts it a little
bit here and there, but uh, yeah. Yeah.

313
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,930
He, one of those weather guys,
Nice. Starts acting up. You're like,

314
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:17,860
this is going to be a twist.

315
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,560
That's my hip. It's going
to be a cold front. Um,

316
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,380
I can tell asteroids when an asteroid is
coming. Oh really? That's interesting.

317
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,180
Yeah. Um, is that your hip or your knee?

318
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,540
My hip is like if there's an
incoming asteroid and mine,

319
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,040
my knee lets me know if there's an
earthquake coming on. Wired bizarre.

320
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,890
You know what I think
here at all things comedy,

321
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:46,030
we could cut a side deal with
the weather channel. You know,

322
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,600
let's cut over to Regan,
anything hurting the Regan report

323
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,110
and here we go. Oh, oh, oh

324
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,230
I feel a magnitude six coming on.
You know,

325
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,480
I really resent to channels that I
used to actually enjoy was the weather

326
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:08,910
channel. I actually used to like watching
it and for some stupid reason enter the

327
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:13,540
discovery channel and both of them, you
know, I dunno. I Dunno what they did.

328
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,040
I don't like how the,
you know,

329
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,200
the discovery channel further like
makes sharks look out like they're just

330
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:24,170
inherently mean things, you know,
with all this shit going. Like,

331
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,360
now we sit there and then whenever you
watch, you know something on sharks,

332
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,090
they're always telling you.
Now people has a misconception about them.

333
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:35,870
But then the whole way they sh they sell
shark week is that jaws vibe, right.

334
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,170
You know,
they put a ski mask on him and stuff.

335
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,780
They always said that they'd been
typecast and I would think with all this

336
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,180
progressive talk out there that
someone would speak up for them.

337
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,110
And then the weather channel,
they went away,

338
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,090
the food network where they used to
just tell you what the weather was and

339
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,630
they'd have some Weirdo and now it's like
all personality driven and they got to

340
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:56,980
make it sound like Jesus is going to
show up every time it fucking rains as of

341
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:58,600
my issues. Those are the things
that keep me up at night.

342
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,130
I would feel that about um, CNN,
headline news, not regular CNN,

343
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,761
CNN,

344
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:08,761
headline news used to be 30 minutes of
just news would the most middle of the

345
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,690
road news anchor. Right. And I'm like,
this is the way it's supposed to be.

346
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,330
Just a guy just telling
you nice and straight.

347
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:19,110
What's going on and now it's
personality driven. The APP,

348
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,810
just like you're talking about these
other gems, angry people, hot chicks,

349
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,370
this person, that person. Yeah. I saw one
the other night, the local La news here,

350
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,220
and they teased this for half an hour.
A guy got cut off on a motorcycle,

351
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,560
went over his handlebars and the highway,
get a couple of bumps and bruises,

352
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:39,280
but was fine. Right? But he filmed it. He
had a little camera on top of his head,

353
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:43,610
so they just kept filming the
footage on the flag itself.

354
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,280
May Am happens. It's this guy splitting
lanes. I mean it's legal out here,

355
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,720
but that's what he still in.
The guy just went,

356
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,090
you know the guy with to change lanes,
didn't see him.

357
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,960
He had went up and over and they're
like, yeah, after eight teased it,

358
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,350
the whole fucking like this.
This is an actual news, right,

359
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,210
that if you ride a motorcycle in La,

360
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,800
you could probably going
to go down at some point.

361
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,500
And he didn't even get fucking hurt. If
he died, I'd be like, wow. All right.

362
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,690
But it wasn't,
it was like a,

363
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,060
it was like the first draft
of a script where it's like,

364
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,680
but you got to raise the stakes.
Can he go?

365
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,700
Can he go over the handlebars into
the oncoming traffic? Can we get some,

366
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,050
can we get some of that? But the whole
thing, and it just led for 20 minutes.

367
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:23,080
They teased it and then I finally see
the footage that I already been watching.

368
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,660
They didn't have any more footage. And
then they interviewed him and you're like,

369
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:28,040
how do you feel? He's like, yeah,
you know I'm all right. Yeah,

370
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,350
I guess it was news because the guy
who hit him walked up to him said,

371
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,800
are you okay? And he said yes. And
then he got in the car and peeled away.

372
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,060
So they had his face looking at
them, you know? So I guess that,

373
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,860
I guess that was the news aspect,
like whether it was a hit and run,

374
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,300
like he looked like he didn't care enough.
The guy who hit him, he took off. Yeah,

375
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,860
I think he did plenty. He did. He
got out. He got out. He said you are.

376
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:54,460
The mistake he made is he peeled away.
That indicates guilt.

377
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,490
What he should have done was just signaled
and got back on the highway and just

378
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:03,190
be a guy. I thought it was
fine. I got out. I asked him,

379
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:07,480
I knew he had the Gopro on. I knew I was
on camera so I didn't do anything wrong.

380
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,020
He had a helmet on offense attorney.
I didn't have a helmet. I was fine.

381
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:13,510
I figured he'd be fine to look.
Look at the side of my car.

382
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,110
I was out here in la one
time watching the local news.

383
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,390
They said we have a breaking news.
Right,

384
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,230
and they had a helicopter footage of a
home who's the garage was on fire and I'm

385
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:33,421
like the only person that would possibly
give a damn about this garage being on

386
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,320
fire is the guy who lives in that house.
Yeah.

387
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,090
At least probably about
our target audience.

388
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,140
Nobody else would care about
that garage band on fire yet.

389
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:48,320
It was breaking news. Well, it used to
be when I lived out here in the 90s,

390
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:51,380
I remember I was just like,
this news out here is a fucking joke.

391
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,180
And then somewhere along the line,

392
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:57,070
national news caught up to what they
were doing out here in la. Cause when I,

393
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,720
I kinda stopped, I don't know
if this is probably a bad thing,

394
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,830
but I kind of stopped watching the
shit like at least seven years ago.

395
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,893
Um,

396
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,310
like right now I'm trying to remember
the name of the vice president and the

397
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:14,390
first one that I thought was Joe Biden,
but that was the last one. Mike Pence.

398
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,910
Mike Pence. Yeah. Okay. Let's see that.

399
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,580
I mean that's literally the backup
quarterback to the United States.

400
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,610
I don't know his fucking name. I
can understand not knowing the, uh,

401
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,570
was it the secretary of
defense? The treasurer, the uh,

402
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,390
well if I know those,
the coordinator of a,

403
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,230
cause they keep changing in the current
administration. So it is hard to keep up.

404
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,400
But usually when they, when they ride
for years, I can remember them all. Oh,

405
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:42,050
is that, what is that? I don't, I
don't pretend to know. All right.

406
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,880
So what else can we talk
about here? Anything? Anything
else you want to promote?

407
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:48,550
You get some standup dates
coming. I'm in a, I'm in a,

408
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,990
I get to where the actors hat
in a show called Loudermilk,

409
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,210
the fairer milk. Fairly brothers Peter
Fairly dumb and dumber and all that.

410
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,120
They've done some things. Yeah.
Well the huge, they're like, well,

411
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,770
the funniest fucking people ever.
Well,

412
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:07,570
Peter Fairly and a guy named Bobby
Mort created a show called louder milk.

413
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,580
It's about substance abuse, dark comedy.
It's on direct TV's audience network.

414
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:14,320
We just got picked up
for our third season.

415
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,870
I play a guy recovering from
substance abuse and uh, I,

416
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,940
I love it.
I never did,

417
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,140
never had an opportunity to do a
lot of acting and a sounds great. I,

418
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,930
it's just so much fun.
What is your character?

419
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:33,880
Addicted to a alcohol quaaludes the
whole thing had a big family and had a

420
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:37,540
falling out with his family and the
whole thing. And uh, but it's funny,

421
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,800
but serious and funny. Mostly funny.
And Ron Livingston please. The,

422
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,520
the main dude.
And it's like yeah.

423
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:48,430
And it's like a group discussion thing,
you know like an AA meeting.

424
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:51,400
But it's about people's, I have
direct TV. How can I see this?

425
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,300
It's on the audience network every
Tuesday night. Audience Network.

426
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:58,200
So is that somewhere in my thing?
If you have directv,

427
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,840
you should have the audience network. It's
just a channel on there. What channel?

428
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,080
I think two 39 to 39 500 500 Jesus Christ.

429
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,650
You weren't even close. Three. I
just thought you this fucking thing.

430
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:14,410
You don't know what channel?
I know it's on two 39 where I live.

431
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,560
Is it on 500 as well? Oh
I don't know. But uh oh on

432
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,140
the bus it's 500 all right.

433
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:25,320
So if you're in a house it's two 39 if
you cause the channels at the same but

434
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:29,100
direct TV, that's what I like
cause I haven't direct TV.

435
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:31,320
You go on the road and I like
going to the hotel. I already,

436
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:36,180
I know ESPN is going to be
206207208. You know, uh,

437
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,670
the red head channel is a 798

438
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,300
I get the ginger report. Let's see if
it's okay to go outside that day. Um,

439
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,750
Jesus Christ, looking, playing
everything close to the vest.

440
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:49,590
What else you got going on?

441
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,990
He had talked to you fuck fucking half
hour before I find out you weren't in the

442
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,480
third season of a show. That's all right.
A lot of people don't know about it.

443
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,820
You know it, it's an obscure, it's hard.
A lot of people haven't seen it yet,

444
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,670
but it's getting a lot of good buzz
and starting to get some traction.

445
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,190
Don't you feel like you almost have
to do three seasons of a show now,

446
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,420
just for the general population to know
that it exists? It's amazing to me.

447
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,150
I mean,
when I started in this business,

448
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,990
if I would have thought that I would be
on a TV show that my friends don't even

449
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:20,040
know about, and I'm not exaggerating,
I have friends who go, oh, really?

450
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:20,874
You're on a show?

451
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,940
And it's like my parents have never
seen the show that I'm on just for the

452
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,990
simple fact that I can't figure out
Netflix like they can from an age.

453
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,820
You just walked up, you just told the
Knob, turned on the TV for five or seven,

454
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:35,100
what do you want to watch? So they're
not going to sit there. I got to do what?

455
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,950
And then they got it.

456
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,680
They can then they got to
type in and search like they
just going to be, I'm not,

457
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,770
I'm not, you know, I'm not fucking
doing that. They, they are, uh,

458
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,700
they are old schools, so, yeah.
Um, I actually talked to somebody,

459
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,380
you've told this story before.
I talked to one night,

460
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:53,040
I was talking to another comedian and I
was telling her how much she liked how

461
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:56,170
much I liked her show she was
take, oh, that's great. Well,

462
00:27:56,171 --> 00:28:00,090
I mean we talked for 10 minutes before
she realized the show was talking about,

463
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,710
had already been canceled and she thought
I was talking about a different TV

464
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,040
show that she was on that I had
never heard of. That's crazy.

465
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,650
Then I told her that I had a TV show
and she had never heard of that.

466
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,521
And I was like,

467
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:15,390
do you understand how fucked I could see
if we both worked at a lumber yard or

468
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:20,010
one of us did, but we're both
in this business. You're like,

469
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,660
you're like shooting, you know, you
don't even know what you're aiming at.

470
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,700
And we're both on beyond the first season.

471
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:30,540
So there is some sort of success to both
that shows that we're on and we still

472
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,120
have. We still haven't heard about them.
Wow. Um, anyways, where are you going?

473
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,960
I saw, um, I had an embarrassing
moment with the Colin Quinn.

474
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,160
It showed tough, tough
crowd and, uh, you know,

475
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,300
I saw him at a charity event or
something like that and said, hey man,

476
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,260
just want you to know I'm loving
you on tough crowd. And he said,

477
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:55,620
it's off the air for like
four years, you know? Oh God.

478
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,460
It would just feel so stupid. You know?
That's, that was the conversation.

479
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:02,530
First Conversation I've had
with Colin Quinn, I s he,

480
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,670
there was a movie out that he
was getting credit for writing.

481
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,840
Uh, oh my God, what the
fuck was it called? It was,

482
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:13,470
it was the one with Damon Waynes
and the Celtic Celtic pride. Okay.

483
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,390
I met him at my first comics come home
and we're literally out in front of the

484
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,670
crowd.
I can't believe I worked with Colin Quinn,

485
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,030
Denis leary and all of these guys.
The crowd's doing a standing ovation,

486
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:27,180
fucking Cam Neely standing there.
I'm like three years into the business,

487
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,320
I can't believe I'm a part of this. And
I see Collin and I'm like, oh my God,

488
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:34,080
that's Colin Quinn from our
remote control SNL. And I'm like,

489
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,240
what do I say to this
guy? So I, and I was just,

490
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,040
oh cause I auditioned for the
movie. So, um, I lied and said,

491
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,500
I saw it cause I didn't see it. I said,
hey man, I really enjoyed Celtic pride.

492
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,470
And he goes, I didn't write that piece
of shit. They took that away from us.

493
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,370
I was like, oh my God. I
said the exact wrong thing.

494
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,870
That's what I get for trying to kiss ass.
Uh,

495
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,030
but I made a mental note to never tell
somebody that I saw movie that didn't see

496
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:05,310
again. And I've broken that. You have to,
in this business, you have to do it. Uh,

497
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,650
speaking, uh, golf, golfing. Did
you say you were golfing with right?

498
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,410
Look with Colin. Is that we have we met
and you met them on a Gulf Chin thing? No,

499
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,100
no, no. Just at a charity show.
It was where I saw him. Jesus,

500
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:18,240
I'm so fucking burnt out. I can listen
to my goddamn guests. Well you, you,

501
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,890
you do you have golf. I gotta
go. I gotta go on this thing.

502
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,490
When is this thing gonna be here? Brian
can comes out to me. He goes, dude,

503
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,660
you got to go on this this three day.
It's like, it's like a spa. Right?

504
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,280
Yet you sober up,

505
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,980
you got chill out and eat nothing but
are a lot of fruits and vegetables and we

506
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,400
golf probiotics. We do hot
yoga, we go back, we have a,

507
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,490
we do hot yoga can kep aligned
again and a lot of meditating,

508
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,790
a lot of meditating. And it's
just so, it's so good for all,

509
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:51,500
all the fellows to get together.
We'll do that.

510
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,270
So when did you gotta be the fall?
When is the next one? Uh, probably May,

511
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,660
but uh, yeah, I'd love to
help you get involved man.

512
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,700
I always feel like whenever I run into
the, the few times that I go on the wagon,

513
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,240
I then that's when I run into you.
I, last time I boost with you is,

514
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,720
was in New York and that was that time.
It was, it was, it wasn't just the guys,

515
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,643
it was men and women.

516
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,550
So they pick like this fancy fucking
place in that waiter came over and you,

517
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:25,040
you ordered like a Budweiser or something
like that again, sorry. I miss here.

518
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,070
We didn't have it.
Uh,

519
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,080
we have as a divinity for the
day and you just staring at him,

520
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:34,000
waiting for him to finish. You're
like, is that a bear we miss?

521
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,250
And you're like, okay,
I'll have one of those

522
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,830
when I love you weren't even trying to be
funny. You're looking at this guy like,

523
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:45,700
is there going to be a fucking
test at the end of this? Um,

524
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,510
and then I saw you more recently at that,

525
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:53,080
a bar in New York and you weren't,
you weren't having cocktails at the time.

526
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,790
And then I felt guilty. I'm
like, I'm like six in here. No,

527
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:01,600
I every once in awhile I just, I, you
know, I shut it down for a little while.

528
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,860
Um, I'm going to hopefully shoot another
special coming up soon and I just don't

529
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,960
want to go through the whole
fuck. I gotta drop, you know,

530
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,590
20 pounds of pizza and beer.
I don't,

531
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,870
I don't feel like doing that this
time around. So I'm like, oh,

532
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:16,660
so doing it during the holiday.
So my game plan is, uh,

533
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,630
I'll be three weeks in on Saturday.
I'm taking one night off,

534
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,810
which is dangerous for me because I'm a
big binge drinker, you know what I mean?

535
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,950
I'm, I'm, I'm goal oriented, you know, I
see a bottom, I want to finish it right.

536
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,740
Then one of these,

537
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,340
these PAF asked people that leave sink
in the dish dishes in the sink. Sorry,

538
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,440
can you speak, um, now,

539
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,630
so I'm going to make a dinner for
my wife and then I'm going to,

540
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,230
we're going to drink a split,

541
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:44,120
a bottle of wine there you can in
the game plan is to immediately go,

542
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,370
okay, back on the wagon. However,

543
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:49,340
one of my buddies from New York
is also in town and he said, hey,

544
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,710
let's hang out Monday something,

545
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,600
well maybe Sunday and Monday
and this is what happens.

546
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,550
Then it becomes Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
right. And next thing you know, you know,

547
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,100
I uh, I love, I think we chatted
about this in the past. I,

548
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,790
I, I get my work done. You know,

549
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:12,791
I work hard and what I do and I
put my nose to the grindstone,

550
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,770
you know what I mean? But giving me the
classic, I work hard, play hard hit.

551
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,420
But when you guys can see that the,
when I did more hand movement,

552
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,580
Trump's got to get this [inaudible]
it's like the thumb and index finger.

553
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:28,460
Everything else is lined up and then
the pinkies up like you get a little tea

554
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,810
cup. But when I, I'm going
to go out, you know, like,

555
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,490
and I'm safe about it. Car Service, the
whole thing, guys together, you know,

556
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:39,080
getting ballistic.

557
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,850
I like those moments or those evenings.
Um,

558
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,940
and it's good. No, I love
those months. You know,

559
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,240
when you get lit up half the year.
I hate the winter.

560
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,630
I don't want to remember it.
That's right. I want to be warm.

561
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,050
That's what hibernation
is all about. Yeah. Um,

562
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,440
so it's probably not a good message
for people out there, but uh,

563
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,930
everybody has to have that
fucking problem with it.

564
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,820
It's like Jesus Christ my advice. That's
my vice. Yeah, that is mine too. So I, I,

565
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:11,210
you know,

566
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,770
I shut it down for a couple of months
and then I slowly start back up again.

567
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:19,730
And then when I just, I just feel like
it's getting out of control of like,

568
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm just, you know, I'm just living
too much of a, a, you know. Okay.

569
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,920
I Dunno. Just too much of
a slothful, they'll say,

570
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,960
because what happens is everything goes
off the rails. It's not just, okay,

571
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:33,680
I'm having too many cocktails. It's
like, I'm also eating a steak and cheese.

572
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,470
You want to fry side salad?
I'll take the fries. Well done.

573
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:40,170
I start doing that shit. So, um, you
know, every once in awhile I just,

574
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,810
I sort of dial it back and uh,

575
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,190
and I dial it back and I get eight
hours sleep and I, I'm just sort of a,

576
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,100
I like it in the morning, but
the rest of the day I'm sad. Hmm.

577
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,000
So you like waking up like having not
yanked the night before and go ahead.

578
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,320
It's found like good flat, you know, eight
hours sleep. Nobody do apologize too,

579
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
but then, you know, once after
breakfast, man, it's just
really, yeah, like the gloom.

580
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:10,040
All right, man. The next
weekend you're in. Yeah, I'm
definitely in for that. Is it?

581
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,840
Well, you're in Vegas, right?
Isn't going to be out there.

582
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:14,450
I don't know if I could do, I don't
think, I think I know it's a good idea.

583
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,830
This next one's in Florida. We do it
in a different place every, every day.

584
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,080
The pick of the year, it's all him. He
on the other side of the fucking country.

585
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,390
I'm gonna, I'm, we'll spring for a
private jet for you can, you know,

586
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,820
can you just book me at a
Magellan's fucking comedy club?

587
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,450
Every comedy club down there always seems
to be like, you know, the Captain Hook,

588
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,460
the barge, the by the, uh,

589
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,680
whatever the fuck else. The
tug boat. Tommy's my tugboat.

590
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,750
Tommy's down in Boca Raton. It's funny.
It's that guy from the Florida keys.

591
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,320
He books, uh, he books almost to Cuba.

592
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,730
Comedy Club, whatever. All right,
sorry. I'm sitting here reading,

593
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,880
trying to make dumb jokes. Um, all
right, so stand up in a way for episodes,

594
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:03,840
Netflix, Christmas Eve. Um, are you a,

595

anything like that? Uh, New Year's Eve,

596
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:12,090
I'm performing finally. I get
you to fucking plug a date. What,

597
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,790
how long does it take me?
20 minutes. He just told me,

598
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,190
cause I didn't plug them on any
other thing. He said, you know,

599
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:21,990
if there's an opportunity, this is Dave,
my tour guy. Smart Guy. Yeah. He said,

600
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,940
you know, part of this is plugging.
He didn't say it that way. He goes,

601
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:30,210
if you can plug your New Year's eve
date, so you're a, I'm going to be here.

602
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:34,430
I am smoothly plugging my New Year's eve
day in Chicago, the Chicago theater. Ah,

603
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,870
New Year's Eve. That's tremendous. But
that I'm not bringing in the new year.

604
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm not on stage doing the countdown.
I always, what time's your show?

605
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,080
Eight o'clock. It'll be over,
you know, like nine 30, nine 45.

606
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,130
But I want people in Chicago knowing that
like you come to the show and then you

607
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:55,210
go to a party and have fun.
I'm not going, you know.

608
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,220
Oh, that's such a let
down. I've done those.

609
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,040
And then you've got to come out and
there's like a DJ still spinning or they

610
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,540
want you to keep doing your fucking yeah.

611
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,160
Joke. No, I can't, I can't,
I can't be, I'm an MC to uh,

612
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,090
the countdown and they've already shut
off the bar is everybody's just standing

613
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,520
there sort of starting to sober up,

614
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,230

and then it's just over there.

615
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,780
The guy get the fuck outta here.
Yeah. Like I would in rules.

616
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,990
I worked this many years at this job so
I can count from 10 to zero backwards,

617
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,690
you know, and I've done that
so many fucking, oh my God,

618
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,180
all those years of doing that, I, I
don't even work new years anymore.

619
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,780
I work a couple extra in November
and December and then I just,

620
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:38,450
I take that night off so I'm going to
take my wife out is what I'm going to do.

621
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,390
There you go. She doesn't know that yet.
Cause I usually a surprise. Yeah, yeah,

622
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,380

So that's what I'm

623
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,520
do. All right, so that's it. Everybody.
Brian, Regan, everybody. By the way, dude,

He's not doing the countdown.

630
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,760
So get some friends to hang, you know,
go to the show. And then afterwards,

631
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:15,440

741
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,030
December 13th, 2010. How the hell are you?
I've had that fucking song in my head.

742
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,360
I heard it on the radio and like
the grocery store, you know,

743
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,120
I was growing going in
there to go buy a ham,

744
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,810
some glaze Jenelle gelatinous shit.
Right.

745
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:57,280
And I was in there and there was this song
on the uh,

746
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,191
the speakers there,

747
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:01,790
the sealant of the grocery store
that I just mentioned I was at,

748
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,090
if you forgot already, you
know, and I'm driving around,

749
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:09,950
I got this big fucking ham sitting in
my grocery cart and elk through the

750
00:46:09,951 --> 00:46:11,420
speakers. Is this, this guy,

751
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:14,880
it sounded like it was from
maybe the fifties you know,

752
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:19,200
it's the holiday season.
Doobie Doobie do,

753
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,330
I can't remember if you went Doobie
Doby do or that's just how I remember

754
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:25,164
hearing it.

755
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,250
I'm trying to give you more lyrics cause
I got to know the name of this song

756
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,270
cause I want to download it.

757
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:35,440
I want to drive around La and 80
degree weather on Christmas, you know,

758
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:40,220
with this stupid look on my face listening
to that song. Other, the rest of it go.

759
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,680
It's the holiday season,
Doobie Doobie. Do Hey,

760
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,850
just take care of Katie and you cook
something like that. I can't remember.

761
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,480
You know how that is, you know
when the, you know the, the, uh,

762
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,020
what is it when they do
that thing where uh, no,

763
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,750
that that elevator music from the 1950s
where they actually took like sorta like

764
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,330
blues progression and I don't
know what they did to it.

765
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,490
So it's almost like still has like
date bet, but that, but there,

766
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,550
but that data,

767
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,760
maybe that's more swing and you
fucking stick it in your cut,

768
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:15,460
something like that. But
obviously it's a lot more, uh,

769
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,850
has a lot more family values two one,
whatever. It's the holiday season.

770
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,790
So please, for the love of God. So I'll
stop singing this fucking song. Somebody,

771
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,640
somebody let me know what the name of
that song is. Okay. And before I forget,

772
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:36,040
which, I don't know how
I would, all right. Um,

773
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,610
you know,
we do underrated overrated every week.

774
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,150
Do you guys remember that from the last
three fucking years of me doing it?

775
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:47,650
Just about every Monday I got one
for you. Underrated. The black Crowes

776
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,030
underrated despite the fact that
the selling out these huge venues,

777
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:57,070
this still underrated.
I went to go see him a Saturday night.

778
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,660
I say as they say in Boston,
it's amazing.

779
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,220
They actually take that word that has so
many continents and they remove all of

780
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:11,221
them like a cancer when you're going
to come on and come over Saturday,

781
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,800
um,
Saturday night at the palladium,

782
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:19,420
the same place where Richard Pryor
tapes live on the sunset strip.

783
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:24,450
I went down and I saw the black Crowes
play truth and salvage company opening up

784
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,040
and the black Crowes played
three hours people three hours,

785
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,380
hour and a half acoustic set.

786
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,910
And then they take a break like fucking
barely 12 minutes and they come back out

787
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:40,990
again. Basically after kicking the shit
out of the crowd for an hour and a half,

788
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,610
they take a 12 minute break,
right? Just to go back, you know,

789
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,450
have a cigarette and a little shot of
Gatorade and they go right back out again

790
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,980
and kicked the shit out of the crowd
for another hour and a half. Uh,

791
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:58,690
it's easily the best show
I've seen in like 10,

792
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:03,490
12 years. And um, I
don't, I just go see them.

793
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,730
They're up in San Francisco. If you're in
the area, they're playing the Fillmore,

794
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:11,980
all this, uh, all this week. And
uh, they, they were unbelievable.

795
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:15,580
And the greatest thing that I liked
about it was everything that you were

796
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,581
hearing was being produced by human
beings that the humans that were on the

797
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:26,350
stage as opposed to all this other
shit that you go to see. Now,

798
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:28,480
I'm not saying these people
aren't talented, but you know,

799
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,300
I've been flipping through the
channels like an old man, you know,

800
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,170
four fingers inside the fucking
waistband and my pajamas,

801
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,390
you know, the guy, you know,

802
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:43,660
the fucking was said married with
children just sitting there, you know,

803
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,620
you got the remote, the other hand
clicking through and you see like, like a,

804
00:49:48,621 --> 00:49:50,980
you know,
these little pop tarts.

805
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:53,380
Even a guy like usher who
is tremendously talented,

806
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,030
the singing and the
dancing and all that shit.

807
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,290
You're hearing all of these instruments
that are not on the fucking stage.

808
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,670
And then you're also hearing like,
I can't say with him,

809
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,990
I can't remember who exactly it was,

810
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:09,991
but like you here at least it's like the
person who's singing with themselves,

811
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,460
they have the track going
and it's like, so I dunno,

812
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,820
musically, socially acceptable.
Now, like back in the day,

813
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:22,180
if you've got busted doing that, that
was like the end of your fucking career.

814
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,740
Everybody's just saying he's the
fucking sell out man. And that was it.

815
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,130
It didn't shit. So the fuck am
I trying to say? It was awesome.

816
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,620
Who unbelievable show. And uh,
recently I finally started,

817
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,790
uh,
downloading us actually some little feet.

818
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,100
It's a band like 20 years ago.

819
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,880
Guys I worked with in this warehouse
with telling me I should get into them.

820
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:51,740
And I finally got around to doing it and
downloaded their greatest hits and that

821
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:55,580
live album, uh, uh,
Christ, what's it called?

822
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,010
Waiting for Columbus, I believe. And uh,
they have a song on there called Wilson.

823
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,950
And I had listened to it and
someone was saying, Oh yeah,

824
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,220
the guy wrote it and that's why he got
kicked out of fucking Frank Zappa's band.

825
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,740
And then he made fucking,
you got with little flock story short,

826
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,660
the Black Crowes ended up,
uh,

827
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,310
they closed out their set
singing that song and it was,
it was, I was just a shit.

828
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,330
It was even the way they ended their set.
They didn't do the big fucking,

829
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:21,164
you know,

830
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,190
you know where they're just sitting there
strumming that one note and the Getapp

831
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:29,140
, Eh, is a fucking drum is sitting there
smashing all these symbols. Thanks.

832
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:32,330
A lot. Can afford you mean great,
good. I didn't even do that.

833
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,920
They played this really cool fucking song
and it ended on this nice just I was,

834
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,310

So if you get a chance to see them,

835
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,990
please go see him. And uh, the
drummer of that band, Steve Gorman,

836
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,690

baseball fans out there to, uh,

837
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,950
or sports fans in general.

840
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,680

the red sox. So please check that out.

841
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,530
And if you're not into sports,
please go see them. At the Fillmore.

842
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,800
I'm sure there are already sold out,
but it was, it was fucking awesome.

843
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,970
So there you go. There's my plug.
I am in a generous mood this week.

844
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:19,400
You know why? Because it's the
holiday season. Doobie Doobie do.

845
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:23,570
And you stick it up. Your
fucking comment. Sorry, I just,

846
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,780
I got a jar this loose in my head.

847
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,710
I'm going to figure out what
it is. So anyways, well,

848
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:35,711
well well a lot has happened since the
last time I did my podcast has an invoice

849
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,170
and girls,
a lot of things have happened.

850
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,990
Does anybody know what I'm
talking about? Just, you know,

851
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,020
isn't that amazing thing about
life that in six short days,

852
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,790
seven days,
if you're into math,

853
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,650
how many fucking things can happen
and just a little seven day period.

854
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,980
If you go back eight days and you
think of what you thought about certain

855
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:08,531
aspects of the world and how different
your opinion is a mere eight days later,

856
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,250
what would be a good example of that ass
shit? I don't know. Let's see. Let's,

857
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:20,420
let's just take your average
fucking Joe from eight days ago.

858
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,590
Like, I don't know. Let's
say like a jets fan and fan.

859
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,370
Eight fucking

860
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,530
days ago.
Huh?

861
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,010
What did, oh my God. I was just
looking at my fucking Mike Recorder.

862
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,110
I thought that whole thing. I thought,
I thought he didn't record it at died.

863
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,270
I taught, I taught, I taught.
He said you wanted one. Um,

864
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,770
I thought the thing is shut off.
Let's continue here. God Damn it.

865
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:48,540
I just fucked up my momentum.
A jets fan eight days ago.

866
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:52,170
What the fuck were they thinking?
Huh? I'm walking around now. People

867
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,650
eight days ago,

868
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,620
those motherfuckers thought that they
were going to win the Superbowl. You know,

869
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,510
probably taught this day we're
going to go into Foxborough

870
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,660
grabbed fucking Tom Brady with
his by his updated mullet.

871
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,970
Slap them around a little bit, put a
couple of more dimples into his chin.

872
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,350
That's what they thought was going
to happen eight fucking days later.

873
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,800
Eight days later.
Right now,

874
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,220
every jet fan in the country eject them,

875
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,630
has their green fucking head between
the knees looking at their fucking green

876
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:35,010
balls, shriveling up, pulling
up into their fucking abdomen.

877
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,350
All right, now here's the deal.
I'm not going to talk shit.

878
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,180
I talked a little bit of Shit.

879
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,380
I had to because of all the fucking
emails I've been getting and not just from

880
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:49,230
jet fans.
That fucking Dick from Philly.

881
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,920
You know who you are when you've sent
me that email. Go Bill. Give it up.

882
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:55,740
Give it up already. You sound like
a more on the jets are a fucking,

883
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,660
we'll have the best team in the
AFC and all that shit. All right.

884
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:01,141
I'm going to say this.

885
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:04,560
Say it real quick cause I don't
feel like I need to say anything,

886
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,030
but I'm a cunt so I'm going to
continue talking about this. Okay.

887
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:12,600
What did, what, what the fuck
did I tell you? What did I say?

888
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,080
Everything I fucking said.

889
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:20,010
I'm not even say that they can't still
pull it together and maybe win the

890
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:20,700
Superbowl.

891
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,970
But to refresh your memory
at the beginning of the
season when I was watching

892
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:28,770
those fucking morons on
that HBO hard knocks thing,

893
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:33,330
running their mouths, that's what I
say. Why are they talking all this shit?

894
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,580
They're talking as if they already won
one, two, three fucking championships.

895
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,720
And you remember what I said?
I said the Patriots,

896
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,830
the fucking Ravens, the
Steelers, the chargers,

897
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,950
or even the dolphins could beat this
fucking team on any given Sunday.

898
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,010
And Lo and behold,

899
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,200
within six days to fucking losses yet.

900
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,530
No. So that's it. I had to
give you one. I told yourself,

901
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,270
all right,
and here's one for you jets fans.

902
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,210
If you think I'm thinking that the
Patriots are fucking going to win the

903
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:16,500
Superbowl and that the defense I saw the
last two fucking weeks is their defense.

904
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,480
Now you're sadly mistaken.

905
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,070
This is why you fuckers get disappointed
every year is because you see,

906
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,100
you see half

907
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,950
a ray of sunlight and you
think, dad, that's what it is.

908
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,920
I still don't like our defense.

909
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,480
All right to fucking great weeks in a row
does not make up for the fact that you

910
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:39,230
shit the bed and let up 24 to 30
points for the first fucking 11 weeks.

911
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,790
So whatever the hell nine weeks,
whatever, I don't know. No,

912
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:47,170
11 weeks we were nine and two.
That's right. The first 11 weeks. So

913
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,773
I don't know.

914
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,540
Who Do you like for some reason I'm
thinking the ravens sitting there all

915
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:56,620
quietly nestled in Baltimore, right?
No one's paying attention to them.

916
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,730
Joe Flacco. I Dunno. I know
we beat them this year,

917
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,310
but I don't know if trying to beat
those guys twice a one year so I'm not,

918
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:07,600
I'm not fucking saying anything.
So there you go. That is it.

919
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,320
And having said that,
how fucking Hilarious,

920
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,950
I really felt as there's something here.

921
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:21,750
I felt really bad for the strength and
conditioning coach who stuck his knee out

922
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,060
and knocked that dolphin guide down.

923
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,320
I felt really fucking bad for that
guy because that was such a classic

924
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:41,080
spur the moment completely
out of character

925
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:46,510
move for it was just the
right set of circumstances.

926
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,770
Had they beat the Patriots suite before,
he wouldn't have done that shit.

927
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,790
And they bounce back and they were beaten.
The dolphins,

928
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:56,290
he wouldn't have done that shit.

929
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:01,000
He's never done anything like that was
just the classic that's spur of the

930
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:04,750
moment. Like it was just fuck
we got killed by the Patriots.

931
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,610
Fuck we're losing this game.

932
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,720
He's a competitive psycho cause that's
how you get to that level, right?

933
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,810
It would just all lined.
I'm telling you

934
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,500
that guy like I don't think he's a
bad guy. I really don't. It was a,

935
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:24,790
it was a piece of shit thing to do,
but you know,

936
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,190
there's so many fucking people in
jail because of a moment like that.

937
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,600
They had never committed a crime their
entire fucking life and just two major

938
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:37,000
shifts happened in their fucking life.

939
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,430
And then an opportunity presented itself
to think about how many times you go

940
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:43,930
down this,
you walked down the street,

941
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:47,200
you see somebody bent over tying
his shoe and your brain just goes,

942
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:49,450
why don't you just go fucking
boot him in the ass? Right?

943
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,050
But you don't because the other
side of you is going, wait a minute,

944
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,940
you can't put this guy in the ass.

945
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:58,960
What if he knows that fucking UFC
shit comes over and fucking, you know,

946
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,990
blows out my eye and I look like
fucking Josh Koscheck over the fucking

947
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:07,300
crosscheck, obviously his
fucking name. Right? Or what if,

948
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:08,770
what if I get arrested for assault?

949
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:12,930
What if I get sued like that voice
just beats down that other voice going,

950
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:15,070
God damn, look at those titties. Why
don't you go home and just grab them?

951
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,910
Just grab those titties.
They're right there. Grab them,

952
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,630
but you don't because you have a job.

953
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,320
She got a family because you're
working towards something and it's,

954
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:30,620
it's going relatively well.
You're on course.

955
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,980
Then what happens?
You know girlfriend dumps Hsa,

956
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,300
you know you lose your fucking job.

957
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:41,301
It starts to unravel and when it starts
to unravel that voice in your head,

958
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,410
you know I should just fucking
kicked that guy right in.

959
00:59:46,411 --> 00:59:51,330
The balls become so fucking loud that
that other voice of reason is now it's way

960
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:54,470
in the back of your head. No,
you don't do that. It hurts.

961
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,500
You can't even hear it anymore and that's
what the fuck happened to that guy.

962
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:02,490
It was just, it was too.
I'm telling you last night,

963
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,850
last night, that dude
was sitting there. Yeah.

964
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,770
Why is this fucking thing saying
on peak and I was a too loud.

965
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:13,130
I'm trying to overcompensate for the
fact that people were saying that my,

966
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,500
my podcast with too quiet. Trying
to overcompensate. There we go.

967
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:23,910
Why is that light sitting there
going peak. Hello. Test one,

968
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,530
two, test one, two. Oh fuck you.

969
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,640
Okay,

970
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,450
so evidently the reason why it said peak
was because I had reached the memory

971
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:38,410
limit from my ls 10 all right. Deleted
some shit. I'm back. So anyways,

972
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,720
the fuck was I taught,
I was talking about that guy.

973
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:44,200
I guarantee you he's not a bad guy.

974
01:00:44,201 --> 01:00:47,860
Last night he was sitting there talking
to his wife. He couldn't even sleep.

975
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,420
His wife or his girlfriend,
you know, she's sitting down
in the corner, you know,

976
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:57,920
holding her knees, sitting in the corner
going, why did you to that? And he's like,

977
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,290
I don't know.
I don't know why I did it.

978
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:06,110
Like Gus Grissom and the right
stuff. It was, there was a glitch.

979
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,200
The hatch just blue. I don't know
why. I didn't know standing there,

980
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,890
we were losing the fucking gay
with a guy came by it. I just,

981
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,970
I only stuck it out a little bit,
man. I just stuck it out a little bit.

982
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:26,070
He's, he's, he just fucking

983
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,980
muttering to himself.
Why did I do that?

984
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,800
Why the fuck? Why did I do
that? That was so fucking stuff.

985
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:40,290
There's guys in prison right now.
Why did that,

986
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:44,640
why didn't I listen to that voice?
Why I paid my taxes?

987
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:47,840
I was a cub scout.
Right?

988
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,410
I fucking made sandwiches for my kids,

989
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:54,870
send them off to school
and then just set one day.

990
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,660
My fucking neighbor. Excuse me. Carl,

991
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,300
can I talk to you for a second?
Um,

992
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,000
I know we've discussed this before.

993
01:02:06,001 --> 01:02:11,001
Is there any way you could just not have
your dog relieve himself on my lawn?

994
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:16,370
And that just happens to be a fucking
shovel and you're just looking at his

995
01:02:16,381 --> 01:02:19,020
mouth. Yeah. Now that you

996
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,950
pedal with the shovel, Bang, you
fucking do it. Then you like,

997
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,850
fuck, get up. Please get up. Please
get up. Did anybody see that?

998
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,710
Bury the shovel man.

999
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,160
And then you just go down that road and
you've never committed a fucking crime

1000
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,690
and then you end up in jail.

1001
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,500
It was just because of that one
diff circumstances were there.

1002
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,710
I don't think that that guy's a
bad guy. I don't, it was just,

1003
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,260
you know,

1004
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,260
the problem is they're
being led by a crazy man.

1005
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,610
Rex Ryan is out of his fucking mind.

1006
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,080
Another thing that I've said
since last fucking year,

1007
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,870
okay, that guy, I don't know
if he's bipolar or fees,
manic depressive. All right.

1008
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,020
But I am a psycho and I can spot another
psychopharm a fucking crossed the room.

1009
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,720
That guy is out of his mind and what the,
you know,

1010
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,440
you gotta buy into your
coach's philosophy. Alright,

1011
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,950
so they bought into his shit.
Talk in fucking

1012
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,610
John Wayne Horse Shit when he was having,

1013
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,080
they didn't realize he was
having a manic episode. You know,

1014
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:39,680
all the coaches sign in that bus as
he's walking up and the depths of his

1015
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:44,220
insecurity saying that, you know,
you don't even deserve to be here.

1016
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,930
He had to so overcompensate for it. He
just, by the time he grabbed that Sharpie,

1017
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,320
his manic episode was so
through the fucking roof.

1018
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:56,040
He just starts writing on
the board. Whooo. So long

1019
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,760
we're going to win the Superbowl.

1020
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:04,790
He did that and he brought all his
players up to this manic fucking level.

1021
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,740
And when you go that high,
you crashed that fucking low.

1022
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,300
And that's what happened in two weeks.
This motherfucker,

1023
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,100
the strength and conditioning
coach, no pain, no gain.

1024
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,590
You got awarded that guy

1025
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:25,220
whose dad was probably like Emilio
Estefan Fez. I have the festivals,

1026
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,030
however the fuck you say his name, his
dad and the breakfast club, word, word,

1027
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:33,210
word. I hate you. You son of
a bitch. That was his dad.

1028
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,390
So he's got that information up
there. He's gotten rex. Ryan's manic

1029
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,760
right in his fucking head.

1030
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:45,960
And here comes this dread lodic
locked jackass running right by a

1031
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,560
sticky nail. Stick your fucking knee
out. And he just, he went with it.

1032
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,880
You saw him. He's trying to fight
it. Is other niece going, no, no, no.

1033
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,480
Stay back here with me and the other
needs like, fuck that. I'm going in.

1034
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,040
I'm fucking go in.

1035
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:07,050
And he stuck it out and
that fucking dude Jesus.

1036
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,990
Did you ever think that you could take
down a professional athlete that easily?

1037
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,450
He looked like he fell out of a car.

1038
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,050
He got kneed in the side of
the leg on the 40 yard line.

1039
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:20,710
He didn't stop rolling until the
fuck a 12 yard line. Okay. Oh,

1040
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,380
can you imagine that? The second he
did that shit, that poor bastard.

1041
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,240
I bet it felt like a cold.

1042
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:34,430
Like he was standing under a fucking ice
water waterfall. That even makes sense.

1043
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:38,420
And then that would be like hale.
I could've just said hail whatever.

1044
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:40,340
It's fucking cold.
And he stand in it

1045
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,540
and I bet he could even feel this fun
fucking from his, his goddamn heart down.

1046
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,150
He probably couldn't feel anything
just going like, oh my God,

1047
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:55,920
what did I just do? Oh my
God, please get up. Please.

1048
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:00,630
Please get up. Oh fuck. Did
anybody see that? Did Wreck?
See that? Why did I do that?

1049
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:03,930
Oh my God. Oh my God. What if I
get fired? But if I get fired,

1050
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:08,730
he fucking went through all of that
shit. That poor bastard. You know?

1051
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,040
But I got to admit,
as a patriots fan,

1052
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,820
I don't ever have to listen to the fucking
jets fans talk about cheating anymore.

1053
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:15,654
Do I?

1054
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:18,960
Okay.

1055
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,290
Is The post going to have that caught
cheating with a little asterisk next to it

1056
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:25,210
for the rest of the fucking season.
Are you green cuts?

1057
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,760
Um, so there you go. Whatever. So that's,

1058
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:32,590
that's this weekend football
that is this week in football.

1059
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:36,370
How about those fucking Minnesota
Vikings with their inflatable roof,

1060
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,850
you know, can you imagine if that happened
during the game? Even with helmets on,

1061
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:45,350
I think somebody could die.
It's a weird thing because it's snow.

1062
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,950
Do you think like, it's just
going to be like, you know,

1063
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:52,070
getting a snow storm over with
in like a half a second. But, uh,

1064
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:55,840
that was probably a good couple
of hundred pounds of snow and a,

1065
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:56,780
I don't know about you guys.

1066
01:06:56,781 --> 01:07:00,920
I don't want a couple hundred pounds of
anything landing on me from the top of a

1067
01:07:00,921 --> 01:07:05,200
fucking Dome Stadium.
Jesus Christ.

1068
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,330
Yeah.

1069
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,140
That was one of the saddest moments I've
ever seen for a professional franchise.

1070
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:16,380
You know, getting ready to play the New
York giants, New York football giants.

1071
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:20,270
How you guys want it? You want
it? They're fucking big blue.

1072
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:25,500
Fucking bring it. The 20 minutes you've
got to call back. Yeah. Listener,

1073
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:30,110
you know about that football game or is
there a way we could do it on Monday?

1074
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,260
Monday would probably work a
little bit better cause uh,

1075
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:38,230
stadium collapsed and
uh, okay. We have to,

1076
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:42,580
we have to get a bicycle pump and we
have to repair it. We'll duck tape. Yeah.

1077
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:43,923
But uh,

1078
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,420
okay.

1079
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:50,000
I figured Detroit's in between your
city and our cities. Okay. Yeah.

1080
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,170
You know, sort of equally
distant and uh, yeah.

1081
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:58,630
And it's just a suggestion. I yeah, just
call me back. Okay. All right. Bye Bye.

1082
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,733
Yeah.

1083
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:08,890
Oh fuck. So anyways, let's, let's
get into the podcast here this week.

1084
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:12,660
So that's it. I'm done
fucking talking shit. Uh,

1085
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:15,350
and I got to tell you something.
I'm going to pat myself on back.

1086
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:16,130
I could have been a lot

1087
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,590
meter. I could have been a
lot meter. And you know what,

1088
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:21,140
I gotta be honest with you. If I
believed in our defense a little more,

1089
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,020
I think I would've been,
I think I would have been.

1090
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,810
How are you doing down there in San Diego?

1091
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:32,090
Paez your team slapped you around enough
this year. Jesus Christ. Whatever you do,

1092
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:35,090
do not bet on the fucking charges. You
don't know who the fuck's gonna show up.

1093
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,980
It's kill or be killed.
Rape or be raped.

1094
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,320
That's what the fuck's
going on down in San Diego.

1095
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:45,890
They're either going to win 41
nothing or lose 56 to eight.

1096
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,640
They got a safety. That's how
they got the eight. All right.

1097
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,810
The two field goals in a safety right is
that another works maybe then went for

1098
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:54,740
a two point conversion.

1099
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,040
I'm just trying to cover all the basis
for the fucking mathletes out there.

1100
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:03,130
All right, let's move. Let's move
on here. Um, Papa, Papa, Papa,

1101
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:05,360
papa bear. Oh, here's something
that somebody sent me.

1102
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,930
They mentioned that they'd
seen Paul Mccartney, uh,

1103
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:14,000
a beetle on. Uh, why don't I just
read the email? What I, let's,

1104
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,810
who's kidding who, let's be honest. Why
don't I just attempt to read this email?

1105
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,580
Okay. Hey Bill. I just
finished watching last night,

1106
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:27,290
Saturday night live with Paul Mccartney
and I think it's time for Paul to hang

1107
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,430
it up for good.

1108
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:33,680
I feel like a bit of an
asshole for thinking it because
we're all supposed to be

1109
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:36,370
in awe of him because he's a beetle.
Uh,

1110
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,970
they let them do four songs last night
because everyone is in awe of him and

1111
01:09:40,971 --> 01:09:41,900
that's the problem.

1112
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,260
No one wants to tell the 68 year old man
with the dyed brown hair and saggy man

1113
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:51,200
boobs that he doesn't have the voice
for a live performance anymore.

1114
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:55,550
I fear getting old and
being irrelevant too.

1115
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,430
But I hope that when
it's my time to retire,

1116
01:09:58,431 --> 01:10:03,431
I can except that I'm not what I once
was and move on to something else that

1117
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:08,180
better suits that stage of my life.
Paul should look to someone like Bono.

1118
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,620
Not that I'm a big Bono Fan, but
I think he's done it right by, um,

1119
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:16,490
imitating Bob Geldof's example of
rock and roll for philanthropy.

1120
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,270
How about a pat on the back for getting
through that sentence without fucking it

1121
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:24,230
up? Uh, Youtube won't draw a
stadium size crowds forever.

1122
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:29,180
So Banos set, set himself up as a jet
setting friend of the world's poor.

1123
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,560
Even if he never gave another
concert of sung another note,

1124
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,520
he'd still have a meaningful, he'll still
have meaningful work beyond his music.

1125
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:41,180
Uh, it's like you were
saying in previous podcasts,

1126
01:10:41,181 --> 01:10:44,660
it's good to have a side business in
case show business doesn't work out best

1127
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:48,530
regards. Um, yeah. Um,

1128
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:51,770
I kind of see what you're
saying a little bit, but uh,

1129
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:54,860
I know a lot of people saw Paul Mccartney
last year on tour and said he was

1130
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:55,880
fucking unbelievable.

1131
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:01,240
And then I also think that the Beatles
right now are a victim of a backlash

1132
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:06,410
because of something that they
didn't create. I think apple,

1133
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,170
not apple is a whatever.
Itunes. That's right. Itunes.

1134
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,660
I got real confused there because they
had apple and then Macintosh has a

1135
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:19,410
fucking apple and that's all it takes
to really just send me flying down the

1136
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:24,150
fucking sideline. Like that. Dreadlocked
son of a bitch. You got tripped anyways.

1137
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,620
Um, I think iTunes has been
trying to get the Beatles catalog.

1138
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:33,430
Obviously it's probably the first band
you would want to start with as far as if

1139
01:11:33,431 --> 01:11:34,450
you wanted to make money.

1140
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,860
They finally got them and they
are from the baby boom generation,

1141
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:43,900
Steve jobs and all those guys. So this
is, you know, this is there Jesus.

1142
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:49,530
So they present the band as their Jesus
and just eventually it's just inevitable

1143
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,760
that it's going to a

1144
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,320
annoyed the generations after.
And not to mention,

1145
01:11:57,321 --> 01:12:01,140
because we weren't born when
they were putting out albums,

1146
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:05,640
it's impossible for us to see how far
ahead of their fucking time they were.

1147
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:07,121
You know?

1148
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:10,150
And that's something I also see in comedy
where I've actually gotten emails from

1149
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:13,970
people going, what's the big deal
with Richard Pryor? You know,

1150
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,090
35 years of people ripping off his shit.

1151
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:23,150
They've actually made, you
know, some of his stuff.

1152
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:27,820
You know, like after 35 years
people finally caught up with them,

1153
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:33,460
you know, so or like an f at
athletic things. Somebody,

1154
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,180
somebody sent me a fucking email
this week. We talking about that a,

1155
01:12:37,181 --> 01:12:38,620
that running back on Cleveland.

1156
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,050
Remember that guy I was talking
about who has the face mass?

1157
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:43,990
Makes them look like the front
of a dodge ram pickup truck.

1158
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:49,410
Someone was saying they thought Jim Brown
of the Cleveland browns was overrated

1159
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,130
and that they are so sick of hearing
about this guy that if this fucking white

1160
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:57,120
dude played back in that era with those
skinny people who played football,

1161
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,640
he would have run all over.
Which uh,

1162
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:03,730
a lot of people say shit like
that and it's complete bullshit

1163
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:05,883
because

1164
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,260
is if he played back then
look, if you want to stick
them in a time machine, yeah,

1165
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,680
he would run all over those guys.
But that doesn't mean he's better.

1166
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:23,110
You know what I mean? That's like,
okay, I have a big test on Tuesday, um,

1167
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,800
the me on Friday,

1168
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:28,070
we'll go back in time after I've taken
the fucking test and then I'll know all

1169
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,840
the goddamn answers.
That's what it's like.

1170
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:31,760
If you take today's athletes
and you put them back then,

1171
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,140
which you have to do is just say,
okay,

1172
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:37,070
if you take that guy and you had him
born the same year Jim Brown was born,

1173
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:43,230
you know, he'd still be what he is
today because of the nutrition. The A,

1174
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:44,840
the level of, of, uh,

1175
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:49,630
just intelligence about sports and
what is possible at that moment,

1176
01:13:49,631 --> 01:13:51,880
the workout equipment in all of that.
But you know,

1177
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:53,680
obviously if you take a fucking guy

1178
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,800
you don't have,
the big flaw in that

1179
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,200
is that kid today is not the Jim Brown
of this era or any fucking error,

1180
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,090
you know? And if you took Jim
Brown from back in the day,

1181
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:08,000
you had him born in 1980 instead of 1940.

1182
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,950
And whenever the fuck this guy was
born and he had access to all this,

1183
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,490
all this information about nutrition,
sports science and all that,

1184
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,140
he would have been much
bigger than he was.

1185
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:19,150
He still would have fucking dominated.
All right?

1186
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:22,570
So that's one of those sports
arguments that they, that,

1187
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,940
that people have when they're like,

1188
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:28,510
they'll talk about Kobe Bryant because
they see Coby doing everything that

1189
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:31,330
Jordan has already done.
They, they equate it,

1190
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:36,331
therefore he's as good as Jordan and
they forget the fact that no one had ever

1191
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:40,300
done that shit until Jordan Jordan
changed the game. All right?

1192
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,860
Same thing with the fucking Beatles.

1193
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:45,700
The Beatles was so fucking
far ahead of everybody,

1194
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,440
but now it's, it's 40, almost
50 fucking years later. Yeah.

1195
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:51,790
Now you're going to look
back on it and have to,

1196
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:54,850
everybody's ripped him off as can be like,
dude, what the fuck was the big deal?

1197
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,740
All right. So there's that. And then
the last thing is I'm sick of people

1198
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:04,360
throwing old people out in
the fucking yard. You know,

1199
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:08,560
like they're your old iPod speakers.
Eh, there's a loose wire. Fuck him.

1200
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:13,270
He's out the Goddamn door. I
think it's bullshit. All right.

1201
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:18,400
I like all people, even that fucking
asshole downstairs. I like them.

1202
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:21,880
I respect him. And uh,
you, you, what it is,

1203
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,720
is you look at them and you see they're
dyed hair and you see their saggy man

1204
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,830
boobs, right? It wrinkled
up tushies. Right?

1205
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:34,860
So you equate that with their level of
intelligence rather than this fucking guy

1206
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:41,650
has walked this planet for
65, 75, 85 fucking years.

1207
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,900
And uh, you know, what's that
expression? As much as things change,

1208
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:49,850
they stay the same stitch in time
saves now with other fucking him.

1209
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,990
I remember expressions,
whatever, you know,

1210
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,050
this guy has seen everything
that you're about ready to see.

1211
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,770
He's already seen it. Okay? He didn't
have a fucking iPod. Who gives a fuck?

1212
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,480
All right. A cunt is
still a cunt. All right?

1213
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:06,100
Some things don't fucking change.

1214
01:16:06,101 --> 01:16:08,350
And this guy has this whole
wealth of knowledge. They,

1215
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:13,120
here's a guy's been playing live gigs for
50 something fucking years. All right?

1216
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:16,150
He can still physically play.
Why wouldn't you want to go see him,

1217
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:22,480
you know, with all his fucking
experience, you know? Yeah. I mean,

1218
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,640
I could see if he was
jumping off the piano,

1219
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:27,010
trying to do splits and
touches fucking toes.

1220
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:30,580
And then he came down and blew out his
knee and they had to give him the fucking,

1221
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:35,080
a Geritol rub right on is blown out
knee then. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1222
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,090
But like I don't like that whole fucking,
it's like,

1223
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,430
it's like a corporate mentality. Why
your skin's wrinkled up. We have no you,

1224
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:47,170
we don't like looking at you beat it.
I Dunno.

1225
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:52,390
I'd still go pay to see the rolling
stones. I would. Why wouldn't you?

1226
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,760
Why the fuck when those got red.

1227
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:59,050
Those guys give me hope that I can sit
there and drag my ass out on a fucking

1228
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:03,880
stage. 80 years old. What's
up with Medicaid, you know,

1229
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,540
out on a cruise ship.

1230
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,730
But I do understand what you're saying
because I definitely want to, uh,

1231
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,160
if I'm on stage

1232
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,930
in my sixties and seventies and sixties
is fine cause I'm still going to be

1233
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:22,640
fucking annoyed and want to be out there.
But in my seventies,

1234
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:24,500
if I'm still on fucking stage,

1235
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,430
I want it to be because uh,

1236
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,700
because I had not because I need the
money because I want to be out there.

1237
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,510
All right. I remember Keith, Richard's
saying like, someone was like,

1238
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:39,710
when are you guys going to hang it
up? He's like, never, I'm a musician.

1239
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:43,940
This is what I do. I will do this
in front of two people or 200,000.

1240
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:48,470
It's what the fuck I do. You want
me to put down my guitar? You know,

1241
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:51,920
he has a great line in his book where
he talks about how much he loves guitar.

1242
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:54,830
I don't know if I said this
last week, Keith, which is,
has this book called life.

1243
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:57,590
It's the fucking shit.
And um,

1244
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,750
he talks about how he loves
guitars so much that to this day,

1245
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,350
like he opens a guitar case
and just the smell of a guitar,

1246
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:10,160
he wants to crawl in there
and close the lid. All right?

1247
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:13,580
So if you ask this guy to
stop going up playing live,

1248
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:17,550
you might as well put a bullet in his
brain. You're killing the man. Okay.

1249
01:18:17,551 --> 01:18:21,230
So having said that,
let Paul Mccartney do is fucking thing.

1250
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,820
Has any been through enough?

1251
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:27,560
I mean that guy truly found the
love of his life. All right,

1252
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:31,160
you fucking dies then.
He's in a bad place.

1253
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:34,970
Like the fucking jets strength coach.
He goes out,

1254
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:38,180
he married some gold digging
whore with one leg, you know,

1255
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,450
which was the classic
fucking misdirection.

1256
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:44,450
Cause I bet the back of his
head, he kept going, you know,

1257
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:48,350
I think she's a fucking gold digger.
And then the other place like dad,

1258
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:51,620
she only has one leg man.
Stop being so mean. Right?

1259
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:54,560
And then he just gave
into that and they go,

1260
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,000
hey, you think if you tried to
trip her, you stuck your knee out?

1261
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,720
Like maybe there was a possibility that
she's athletic enough that her fake leg

1262
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:07,100
would just fall off and she would just
be able to continue hopping down the

1263
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:10,700
sidelines and make a play. Granted,
she'd get a penalty if she,

1264
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:15,350
if she ran out of bounds on her own.
You know,

1265
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,580
that's a question for you this week.

1266
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,500
If that fucking gold dig in more
with the one leg. If she ran down,

1267
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,930
she had a fucking dolphins uniform on,
right?

1268
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,740
She went to the islands and got her hair
braided by some dude in Jamaica. Right.

1269
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:31,040
And she comes flying down the sideline.
If you stuck your knee out,

1270
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:36,530
hit her fake knee. Right.
Knocked her fucking leg off.

1271
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,610
Why am I repeating what you just heard?
Everything I just said.

1272
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:45,590
Do you think that she would
have the ability running
full speed? All right, we'll,

1273
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:48,140
we'll uh, we'll adjust it a little bit.
You tell her you're going to do it.

1274
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,240
You tell her you're going to do it.

1275
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:54,140
You didn't really have legs going to
fucking pop off. Now the fake one.

1276
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,950
Jesus Christ. We think I'm an asshole,
but just shut up. You're dumb whore.

1277
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,440
All right,
I'm going to fucking not shut up.

1278
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,900
I'm going to knock your fake
fucking leg off, sweetheart.

1279
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:07,040
When you're running full speed, if
you can keep your balance. All right,

1280
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:10,090
we'll give you some shiny shit.
You're gold digging whores.

1281
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,630
Do you think she could do it?
That is my question for you.

1282
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:15,820
During the holiday season.

1283
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:19,930
Doobie Doobie do and we knock
off your fake leg. You can't.

1284
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,990
Um, all right, what else do we got here?

1285
01:20:22,991 --> 01:20:27,450
You guys want some youtube
videos for the week? MMM. Okay.

1286
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:29,850
Once again is great as the
black Crowes were. Let's,

1287
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:34,570
let's talk about some fucking
music that, um, I respect,

1288
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,870
but uh, I, I have to shut
it off every time I hear it.

1289
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:44,930
And that is basically the
melancholy singer songwriter.

1290
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:49,790
Put a gun in your mouth
early to mid 70 shit.

1291
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:55,890
You know, did I talk about this last
week? I can't remember. Like Carol King

1292
01:20:58,650 --> 01:20:59,150
[inaudible]

1293
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,200
hey baby [inaudible] is too.
They

1294
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,430
[inaudible] [inaudible] has
died and fucking kill yourself.

1295
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:17,660
View douchebag. [inaudible] fuck it
goes that song. James Taylor, I see.

1296
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,580
He found,
I've seen rain.

1297
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:25,460
My fucking friend died in a plane crash
and I always thought that I'd see you

1298
01:21:25,461 --> 01:21:30,290
once again, Carly Simon. That's the way.

1299
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:35,810
That's the way I've always heard it
should be. I'm telling you right now,

1300
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,920
don't ever listen to that song on a rainy
fucking day. If you put that song in,

1301
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:45,060
you have a 40% chance of doing
something really harmful to yourself.

1302
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:49,540
Joan Baez, diamonds, and rust.

1303
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:55,030
You know, and I have the song. If you
ever one of those songs ever comes on,

1304
01:21:55,031 --> 01:21:58,630
you're in a car and you don't have
control of the radio and you just feel

1305
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:03,130
yourself getting dragged
down this bottomless pit.

1306
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,290
I have the song that is basically like
that in adrenaline injection to the

1307
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:13,070
heart, like in pulp fiction. Just
put on Huey Lewis hip to be square.

1308
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,110
All right?
I can't take 100% credit for that.

1309
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:20,530
Me and a young Joe Derosa.
All right.

1310
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:24,620
The teen idols sensation of the opiate
Anthony Program we're taught was,

1311
01:22:24,621 --> 01:22:27,830
was actually a segment that we'd
love to do on the uninformed shelf

1312
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:32,200
that we do once every nine
years. At this point, uh,

1313
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,170
we were talking about how it's impossible
to be depressed if you listen to Huey

1314
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,170
Lewis and the news put
on hip to be square.

1315
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:43,460
I challenge you not to fucking
get a smile on your face.

1316
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:48,090
It's like trying to hold off a yawn. You
know, you can't do it. It's impossible.

1317
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:51,840
So, uh, I don't know. I don't need a
why I'm bringing this shit up, but like,

1318
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:55,110
I don't know what it is about that music.
I respect it once again.

1319
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:00,130
Get back to the black Crowes thing cause
it's actually human beings producing

1320
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:04,950
all the sounds that you're
hearing. All right. But uh, yeah,

1321
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:10,420
you know Jesus Christ already.
Do those people have any happy songs?

1322
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:16,270
Who's another one? Oh, that that
fucking girl sings in the false set of,

1323
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,090
with a weird eyes.
Joni Mitchell

1324
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:25,510
singing about a paved, paved
the parking lot, pay paradise,

1325
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:30,130
turned it into a parking lot. You
don't know what you got till it's gone.

1326
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,280
I'll write Joanie.
I got it last week was better.

1327
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:38,290
Jesus Christ. You fucking, you know,

1328
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:43,030
I don't know. I did, I it, was there any,
was there a point that was made there?

1329
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:47,710
Other than the fact that
I can't sing? Um, oh,

1330
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,420
here's a music question for this week.

1331
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,620
As you guys also know other than playing
drums, I a I fuck around and guitar.

1332
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,610
Um,
and uh,

1333
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:02,050
I recently bought ACDC flick of
the switch, another underrated,

1334
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:05,350
which I know I did last week.
Underrated ACDC flick of the switch.

1335
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,580
I just want to know what
tuning of those people in are.

1336
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:14,200
They tuned down like half a step because
it's like I listened to the album,

1337
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,480
I shut it off.
Then I go and I go to figure it out.

1338
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:22,420
Let's take the first song for you.
Guitar players out there. Rising power.

1339
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,800
All right. He's doing a pull
off down to a B court. Right?

1340
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,200
But are they tuned down like half a step?

1341
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:33,880
Because last night I'm sitting there in
my jam jams and I got my guitar that I

1342
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:35,680
can't even fucking play.
And I'm like, you know what,

1343
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:38,590
I'm gonna have a little geek moment
by myself that nobody can see.

1344
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,620
I'm going to put on my just
fucking record. I'm going
to play along to this song.

1345
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:46,770
Cause I figured it out the Malcolm
part and it sounded like shit.

1346
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:51,970
And I tried tune it down half assed and
I just could not fucking figure it out.

1347
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:55,600
And beyond the fact that I suck,
can somebody help me out?

1348
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,810
What are they doing there?
I know it's not a drop d

1349
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,860
drop d tuning.
Cause I know what that sounds like.

1350
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:06,280
That sounds like Satan is
your bitch and you got,

1351
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:10,780
you got some errands for for it to run.
I know what that sounds like.

1352
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,690
And I challenged somebody to come
up with a riff in drop d tuning.

1353
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:20,410
That doesn't fucking rock. It's just,
it's just, it's the shit. Right?

1354
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:25,330
But does that tune down half a step that
I, I can't fucking get. Come on man.

1355
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:27,280
You heard how I sing?
Help me out here.

1356
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,390
Help me out or I'm gonna fucking sing
for the rest of this podcast. All right.

1357
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:36,820
It's [inaudible] season. All right.
Wait, let's, let's continue on here.

1358
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:42,850
Um, oh, I got my, uh, I tell you
somebody rear ended my Prius.

1359
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:44,373
You know what I mean?

1360
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:47,830
Which really is like fucking boot in
eight year old in the ass when you really

1361
01:25:47,831 --> 01:25:49,870
think about it.
Um,

1362
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,440
and got it just hard enough where I
couldn't walk away and be like, Eh,

1363
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:58,420
don't worry about it. You
know, my hatchback wasn't
quite closing correctly. Um,

1364
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:00,610
you know what I mean?
Wasn't quite,

1365
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:06,320
didn't quite work on the hatchback area.
Kind of like a girl with a big booty.

1366
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:09,290
You know what I mean? There's always
a little bit of butt crack coming out.

1367
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:10,783
Who's got a tug?
You know,

1368
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,880
that's how you can judge if
you see a girl with a nice ass,

1369
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:15,620
whether or not she's a whore or not.

1370
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,760
If she's constantly trying to adjust
their genes and pull them up, sir,

1371
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:24,230
ass crack isn't coming out of the back
of her pants. Uh, that's a good girl.

1372
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:28,040
That's when you can take home to mom.
Just make sure she wears a dress.

1373
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,710
But if she's just standing there with
like an inch and a half coming out and she

1374
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:37,820
doesn't give a fuck, I can't even
say that she's a fucking whore,

1375
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:40,610
but either that or she's
just accepted who she is.

1376
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:44,330
And for some reason that they don't make
jeans for girls like that. All right.

1377
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:49,400
That's one of those references that
it just was such a visual to me that I

1378
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:51,920
completely forgot what the fuck I
was talking about. Let's go back.

1379
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:56,030
We were talking about
talking about guitar.

1380
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,180
Who gives a fuck? Oh, was
talking about my car. So anyway,

1381
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,660
so I'm getting it fixed this week.
And uh,

1382
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:05,960
so I went down to the rental
car place and it was a usual,

1383
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:11,150
I go down there and I asked for a
fucking, uh, uh, an economy car.

1384
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,930
You know, I don't give a shit. I really
have no pride when it comes to cars,

1385
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,640
even though I fucking love him.
I don't give a fuck.

1386
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:20,570
I'm just so into not having debt
that I, I'm, I'm, I'm a little miser,

1387
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,600
so I get this a con I go down and they go,
well,

1388
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:25,460
the economy car isn't quite ready.

1389
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:28,880
We could give me a free upgrade
to this four door fucking pickup.

1390
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,150
And uh,
then it just became my,

1391
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:36,860
you don't even get outweighs my miserly
ways is, uh, I don't like waiting.

1392
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:39,890
I refuse to wait. So I go,
yeah, fuck it. I'll take it.

1393
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:43,370
And then immediately my girl was
just like, why did she get that?

1394
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:47,330
I can't try that. It's so
big. What am I gonna do?

1395
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:51,500
I'm like, we only got until Monday.
Fucking relax. Plus we got to get

1396
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,060
the Christmas tree this weekend. All
right, well, you know, Dasher red area,

1397
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:02,290
Vic said
Ledson if you want,

1398
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:05,480
how I did that, there was not some
Phil Spector Shit that's called just,

1399
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:09,930
you just spin it around three 60 away
from your mouth and you just keep talking,

1400
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,540
cause back around you like that.

1401
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,900
It's a new recording
process I just invented. Um,

1402
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,420
so anyways, uh, I go, yeah, we
got to go get the Christmas tree.

1403
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:24,710
So for the last two years, I have to
admit something to you people. All right.

1404
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:29,360
I have been going down to get these
fucking Christmas trees and I've been

1405
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:33,290
getting the traditional Christmas tree
and we all know what it looks like.

1406
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,760
All right. It looks like someone on
the biggest loser about four weeks in.

1407
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:41,450
That's what a Christmas tree
spots about that full, you know?

1408
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:48,350
But there's these other Christmas trees
that I noticed, not the scrawny ones,

1409
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:54,250
but they are minimalist Christmas trees
where you can see the entire trunk and

1410
01:28:57,261 --> 01:29:01,530
it's like they still have the branches,

1411
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:05,520
but there it's very like symmetrical.
It looks fucking cool as hell.

1412
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,770
Clean look and Christmas tree, right?
It looks like one of those trees.

1413
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:14,100
And like the doctor Seuss books,
you know?

1414
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,330
So I go, you know what? Fuck this.
I'm going to get something different.

1415
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,200
I liked this tree.
It looks fucking cool.

1416
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:25,770
I think the ornaments are going to hang
off it much better as if you know when

1417
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:29,760
you get one of those full trees,
you know this. Yeah. It's just,

1418
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:32,910
it's a fucking pain in the ass. And
then the end of the end of the Goddamn,

1419
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,370
you know,
Christmas season,

1420
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,760
if you're not a dick and you just don't
throw it out the side of your car,

1421
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:41,430
like a fucking some,
you know,

1422
01:29:41,431 --> 01:29:44,670
some piece of degenerate gambler
that owed you money. I said,

1423
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,660
have it by Tuesday and then you just
throw it out the fucking car, right?

1424
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:52,020
If you actually do it the right
way and you just saw it up,

1425
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,180
it's a pain in the ass and makes it
unbelievable mess this thing, you know,

1426
01:29:57,181 --> 01:30:00,700
it's like, it's like you have a walk into
like, uh, like when I'm out with, with a,

1427
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:05,640
with Nia and we'd go out to one of
her, uh, her clothing stores and um,

1428
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:10,950
if it's like a corporate place,
the place is just jam packed with Shit.

1429
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,860
But if it's like a privately owned,

1430
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:16,770
they go out and they buy
these individual pieces.

1431
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,770
They'll buy a couple of sizes
of each things that they
like. And you go in there,

1432
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:21,990
you pray to God that they
have your size and it's,

1433
01:30:21,991 --> 01:30:24,270
and you go in and it's very minimalist.

1434
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:27,900
That's the sort of Christmas tree
that I bought and uh, you know,

1435
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:30,270
knee as a fashion Easter.
So I thought she would like it.

1436
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:34,800
So I bring this Christmas tree in
and the second she looks at it,

1437
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,180
cause I think she's going to
be like, you know, like I live,

1438
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:42,030
she just have like techno music on like
I'm so far into the fucking future here.

1439
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:47,300
The second she looks at
it all my confidence just
drains out the bottom of my

1440
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:52,200
shoes. And I go, yeah, this is the
Christmas tree. And she goes, oh yeah,

1441
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:58,050
because where's the rest of it? And
I'm like, no, no, that's the style.

1442
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:01,680
That's the style it's supposed to
look like that. I go, doesn't it cool?

1443
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:05,730
I mean it looks like one of those trees
and Dr Seuss, she goes, yeah, she goes,

1444
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:07,080
I think it looks more like that.

1445
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:09,210
That Christmas tree in
that Charlie Brown cartoon

1446
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,470
snow,
I feel like an asshole.

1447
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:18,990
So because I love the verbal abuse that
you guys give me every fucking week.

1448
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:23,700
I'm actually going to be dumb enough
to send a picture of my Christmas tree.

1449
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,800
Now granted it's naked. It's
not all dressed up. It's not
all dolled up. All right?

1450
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:33,600
It's like Charlie's thrawn in that
stupid movie monster that rather than

1451
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:37,860
chastising her for being a murderous cont,
they actually made a movie that said,

1452
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:41,460
maybe guys outta look at themselves and
treat bitches a little bit better before

1453
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:43,590
they go and start killing
you after a blow job.

1454
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:48,210
It wasn't that the message in
the move SMS a gy got so anyways,

1455
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,620
it doesn't have any makeup on,

1456
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:53,130
which I think should automatically
give it a golden globe for being that

1457
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:56,850
courageous. It was so brave. It
was such a brave performance.

1458
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:01,810
I'm just take a look at the Christmas
tree. Tell me what you think.

1459
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,620
I think it looks fucking Badass.
I love it.

1460
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:10,240
I fucking love it. And uh,
I stand by it. You know,

1461
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:14,980
I'm breaking a little tradition here. So,
uh, go on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1462
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:17,320
Take a look at my Christmas tree.

1463
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,650
We'll have a whole section where you can
leave your goddamn comments about what

1464
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:24,580
a moron you think I am. Um,
or maybe you actually like.

1465
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:31,600
Um, and along with that, you can
also look at these youtube videos,

1466
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,340
the youtube videos of the weak people.

1467
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,280
I just felt like I should have had a
theme, some theme music right there.

1468
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,770
At some point,
at some point,

1469
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:41,320
I'm going to have a make enough
money in this fucking business.

1470
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,890
I'm going to make a little studio and
I'm going to have all those little sound

1471
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:49,200
effects, like a real radio show like
Anthi on opiate, Anthony, you know,

1472
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:52,360
he's got all those little buttons he
pushes and ops got all his little buttons

1473
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:57,070
that they push, you know, those
button pushing son of a bitches.

1474
01:32:57,070 --> 01:33:02,020
I want to be one, two, I have
dreams. Um, and when I do,

1475
01:33:02,021 --> 01:33:05,530
I'll have a little fucking theme
music here. Uh, but until then,

1476
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:09,340
you'll just sit there and listen
to the awful silence. All right.

1477
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:12,970
Youtube videos of the week that you
can watch on the MLM, podcast.com,

1478
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:16,660
the official, uh, Fan Webpage,

1479
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:19,270
whatever the fuck you call it of the
Monday morning podcast. All right,

1480
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,810
youtube video. Uh, this is
one of my favorite ones. Uh,

1481
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:27,760
if people puking makes you sick,
please don't watch this. But, uh,

1482
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:29,890
you know,

1483
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:33,790
the great thing of watching a videotape
of somebody puking is you don't have to

1484
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:38,020
smell it. So you can just
enjoy the hilarity that it is.

1485
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:42,280
You know what I mean? It's like
that shit that people, they, they,

1486
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:46,300
the vaporizer with weed, you know,
where it gets rid of everything,

1487
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:49,810
all the toxins that just keeps the
shit that gets you high. This is,

1488
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:53,500
this is the vaporizer version
of watching somebody puke.

1489
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:58,750
Watch this video is this,
this is such, this video
literally made me cry. Laughing.

1490
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,180
Uh, epic beer pong puke. Um, it's just,

1491
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:08,020
it's got it off the,
the, the volume of Puke,

1492
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:13,380
the noises kids making when he's puking
and then the fucking good natured

1493
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,830
attitude that this dude has.
He actually,

1494
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:21,160
he has poise while puking.

1495
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:25,540
I think Mark Sanchez could learn a
little something about this. You know,

1496
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:28,990
a little poison under fire by the way.
One of their offensive lineman got hurt.

1497
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:31,540
Now Watch your run for his fucking life.
All right.

1498
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:34,520
This game management son of a bitch.
Oh,

1499
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,920
you're so right about those
mother fuckers. All right. Um,

1500
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:44,050
all right. Youtube video. Another one.
Uh, this one is just so fucking creepy.

1501
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:50,380
Um, I love this. I want to go
on a date with this woman. Uh,

1502
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:54,490
it's called the best model in the world
and I'm sure a lot of you guys have

1503
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:58,330
already seen this and I'm sure
tosh 0.0 is already put up. Uh,

1504
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:02,780
but it's the best model in the world hand
model and is this woman talking about

1505
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:05,840
being a hand model? And for a
lot of people it's what she says,

1506
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:09,230
but for me it's the way she
just keeps stroking her hands.

1507
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:13,700
I don't know what she's doing,
but it is so fucking creepy.

1508
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,580
I want to go on a date with her.
I want to take her out to dinner,

1509
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,610
have her sitting across from me as I
tell her about how many brothers and

1510
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:23,150
sisters I have and my hopes and dreams
in life as she sits there nodding,

1511
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:26,690
just stroking her hands. And that it
would just, it would really, you know,

1512
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,700
I don't know,
call me a fucking psycho,

1513
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:33,590
but I would really love to just have that
experience. It's on my bucket list. Um,

1514
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,490
ah. Did I spell this right? The next
one is Cammy secret parody, boob apron.

1515
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:41,691
You know that thing,

1516
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:45,370
that commercial they have out there where
a women with the big titties and then

1517
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,300
all their boobs are always
fallen out of their shirt,

1518
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,810
but they don't like wearing something
underneath it to alleviate the problems.

1519
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:55,540
So they created this little napkin
that hooks onto your bra straps. Uh,

1520
01:35:55,700 --> 01:36:00,080
first of all, let's pause and just say
how fucking brilliant an idea that is. Um,

1521
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:03,290
as far as just making $1 million,
you know,

1522
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:08,390
this checks out there who just
have, you know, efficient boobs.

1523
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:12,650
It's trying to think of a nice
way of saying small boobs, um, um,

1524
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,210
comparable, capable titties, right.

1525
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,790
This still going to buy them just because
I like having different colors and

1526
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,770
sometimes I don't want to wear a shirt.

1527
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:24,770
And then those other girls who lie to
themselves about how big their boobs are

1528
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:28,100
and for some reason they've,
they buy a D Cup Bra, you know,

1529
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,770
when they got BEACOPP titties,
I don't know why they do that.

1530
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,370
Kind of like the guy who goes in and
buys the magnum condom and then it slips

1531
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,900
off and he becomes a fucking father for
the ninth time. Uh, yeah, just watch that.

1532
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:43,040
It's a parody of that. And um, this
next one, all I have is a website,

1533
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:47,540
but my, uh, my web guys definitely
going to have it up. Uh,

1534
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:50,720
if you want to watch a video of somebody
who's about ready to get arrested by

1535
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:53,960
the FBI, watch this video.
This guy took one of those, uh,

1536
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,481
um,
you know,

1537
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:59,930
as those nerds who rather than going
out and getting a pilot license,

1538
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:03,030
they go down to an open field
and they just fly like a,

1539
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:07,190
a fake playing around a
model airplane motorized.

1540
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,870
There it is motorized playing around.

1541
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:13,430
This guy put a camera on it and he
flew around the New York City skyline.

1542
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:17,690
Oh yeah. I'm sure this guy isn't
going to get in trouble at all these,

1543
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:19,790
they had the brains to
blur out their faces,

1544
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:22,820
but the dude is talking on the video.
You can hear his voice.

1545
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,473
They're going to get caught.

1546
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:29,240
Some Kuntz gonna recognize his voice that
he went to high school with. You know,

1547
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:31,760
by the way, people, if
you do something illegal,

1548
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,920
if you're going to be dumb
enough to videotape it,

1549
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:38,600
don't put it on fucking youtube and of
all the fucking cities to do it too.

1550
01:37:38,601 --> 01:37:40,670
I mean it's definitely,
the footage is fucking cool,

1551
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,110
but this guy buzzes the statue of Liberty
with this model fucking airplane and

1552
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:50,111
considering the military has those drones
that can fly around and just vaporize

1553
01:37:52,311 --> 01:37:57,090
people, it's probably not a good idea
to have one of those flying around.

1554
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:01,620
I'm going to go out on a limb, so
I'll look for that news. Everybody,

1555
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:06,510
these guys getting arrested in the
next couple of weeks. Um, okay.

1556
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:08,200
We also have the youtube video of the uh,

1557
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:11,160
the jets strength coach
tripping the Dolphin.

1558
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:16,610
If you just want to watch that and just
watch that with my psycho analysis.

1559
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,970
Is that all right? My psycho
psycho analysis of that guy? Uh,

1560
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:26,790
is that it? I think that's it. Those
are the youtube videos of the week.

1561
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:30,330
And what are we up to here
at this point? Ah, by Golly,

1562
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,920
will you look at that 53 fucking
minutes? Um, I know what I need to do.

1563
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:39,150
I need the height. My last
stand up Gig, my last official,

1564
01:38:39,151 --> 01:38:42,300
one of the official one of the year.

1565
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:46,500
I am going to be at the Improv
out here in Bray, California.

1566
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:52,190
Beginning this Thursday and I'm can
conclude on Sunday and it's going to be a,

1567
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:58,650
what's that? December
16th, 17th, 18th and 19th.

1568
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,930
Um, and I gotta tell you my new hour
is, I'm really happy with where it's at.

1569
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:07,230
A sign. I figured something
out somewhere during Seattle,

1570
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:11,640
right through the cobs Gig in San
Francisco and I'm really excited,

1571
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:15,990
really excited to go out
there. So, um, you know,

1572
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:21,870
come on out and see me. How
about some Latino people? Ah,

1573
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:25,340
trying to break into this market
out here. Like I, I don't,

1574
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:27,960
I don't know how to get in
touch with you guys. You know,

1575
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:32,790
I started doing that Rosetta Stone
Shit. I fucking, I quit it. You know,

1576
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:35,760
I really want to learn how to speak
Spanish and I'm realizing that if it did a

1577
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:40,761
little bit of Rosetta stone and I
just had somebody who spoke Spanish or

1578
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:45,090
Mexican, whatever the fuck it is, you skip
call it. Not trying to offend anybody.

1579
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:48,840
I want to know how to do it. I
think it's fucking, I don't know,

1580
01:39:48,841 --> 01:39:51,720
it's a cool language.
I want to learn how to say it.

1581
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,690
Then I can talk to some Spanish
women. Who the fuck am I kid? Alright,

1582
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:58,230
so that's it. I'm going to be there this
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

1583
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:01,800
All right? If he, if he can't
make it there and you're
in the San Francisco area,

1584
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:05,720
I'm telling you, go see the black
rose. Go see them because, uh,

1585
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:08,940
I think they're going to take a little
bit of a break after this tour from what

1586
01:40:08,941 --> 01:40:13,680
I've heard. Uh, you know,
it just fits into my whole,

1587
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:15,600
don't go to the automated checkouts.

1588
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,360
Don't go to see these fucking
auto tune jackasses. Go,

1589
01:40:18,361 --> 01:40:22,830
go see the real fucking deal. All
right there. I'm done with that shit.

1590
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:27,630
And with that, is that the podcast for
this week? I'm coming up a little short.

1591
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:31,740
All of a sudden, am I running out of gas?
You know what it is, is I'm, I'm in a,

1592
01:40:31,741 --> 01:40:36,741
I'm in my vacation mode already
and I'm in a silly fucking mood.

1593
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,950
I got my Christmas tree and I'm going
to be singing out those fucking holiday

1594
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:45,570
songs this weekend on stage
or just society that just
for the podcast listeners,

1595
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:48,210
and I'm not even going to
explain why I'm doing it.

1596
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:52,140
I'll be telling Joe Ganim this guy
can go fuck himself and style today.

1597
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,470
Cs Ed Beagle Bay though. Um,
all right. Who's kidding?

1598
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,680
Who am I going to keep
repeating that fucking joke?
Is that what I'm going to do,

1599
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:00,340
Bill?

1600
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:03,040
Are you pulling the Paul Mccartney right
now and you don't know when to get off

1601
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:06,880
stage according to that one
fucking listener? I think I am.

1602
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:11,050
Did I have any underrated,
overrated, underrated?

1603
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,530
A four door pickup truck
like I rented this week,

1604
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,590
couldn't believe how convenient was
I went to go see the black crows.

1605
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:20,140
I put me in for other
adults in that thing.

1606
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:24,160
We went to go see him and
then the next day I got a,

1607
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:28,630
I got a fucking a Christmas tree
in the back, standing upright.

1608
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:34,510
You know, it's funny when I put it in
the truck, uh, these three people walk,

1609
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:38,200
we're walking down the street. One of them
was some Mexican dude, any in Spanish.

1610
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,890
He said something and started laughing
and I was convinced he was laughing at my

1611
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:42,724
tree.

1612
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:47,470
You know another reason why I would
have loved to gotten through the Rosetta

1613
01:41:47,471 --> 01:41:49,460
stone so I could've said in Spanish,
um,

1614
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:54,280
actually it's not the Charlie
Brown tree or right Hector,

1615
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:58,300
it's supposed to look like that.
Thank you. Very classy is very much

1616
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,760
just a freak them out. You know
what I mean? Cause you know,

1617
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:05,650
nobody thinks a white
do can speak Spanish.

1618
01:42:05,651 --> 01:42:09,430
Like how many times did George Bush catch
somebody's saying something fucked up

1619
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:14,550
as he sat there in his fucking white
elite fucking brown penny loafers with no

1620
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:20,320
socks in his Pete Carroll coach and pants,
right.

1621
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:22,090
Jesus Christ to the Seahawks,

1622
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:26,350
get their fucking asses kicked this
week or what I went to and to this week,

1623
01:42:26,351 --> 01:42:30,010
everybody, I finally went
500. I got something for,

1624
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,670
for gamblers out here that I know
you're all going to agree with.

1625
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:38,430
All right. And, uh, oh
before I say, you know,

1626
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,960
one of the reasons why I didn't do an
extra podcast because a lot of people were

1627
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:43,000
asking me how come right
after the jets game,

1628
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:47,620
you didn't do a podcast making fun
of the jets. That's because I didn't,

1629
01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:51,700
I didn't believe in our defense and I
thought we had a really good chance of not

1630
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:56,410
, uh, you know, of losing that game by a
couple of points just because you know,

1631
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:59,230
when you let a 24 to 30
points, that's what, you know,

1632
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:03,700
that's definitely a possibility.
And a,

1633
01:43:03,701 --> 01:43:05,840
I just thought it would have
been bullshit if I came. Yeah.

1634
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,260
You know what the fuck you,
you fucking lost.

1635
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,900
That's also why I kind of
took it easy on you this week,

1636
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,510
which you probably don't think I did,
but hey,

1637
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,100
I did defend your fucking strength
and conditioning coach, didn't I will.

1638
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:21,580
All right then why don't I just talk
about that and I can't remember what I was

1639
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:23,770
talking about.
Here's one for the gamblers out there.

1640
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:27,850
So I took the eagles last night.
All right.

1641
01:43:27,851 --> 01:43:30,890
Given three and a half against
the cowboys. Had they won,

1642
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:35,730
I would have gone three and one which
I desperately needed instead, you know,

1643
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:37,990
and they drive down,
write down the fucking field,

1644
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:43,420
all right there down by three points and
they can kick a field goal and win the

1645
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:46,960
bet. But because it doesn't matter,
they just want to win the game.

1646
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:49,180
They take a knee and they
run out the fucking clock.

1647
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:52,800
And this is a rule that I think
the NFL should do, you know,

1648
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:57,500
subtly without letting the public now
because they really can't line up with

1649
01:43:57,501 --> 01:43:58,430
gamblers in anything.

1650
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:03,460
I really think that is in a sign of
solidarity for the regular Joe out there.

1651
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:10,020
We actually had the balls to put money.
So believed in your fucking team.

1652
01:44:10,021 --> 01:44:14,580
If you put money on your fucking team
and you have a chance to cover the spread

1653
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:17,850
and the final fucking second, she
should. God Damn it. You should do it.

1654
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:24,140
Andy Reid kicked a field
goal. You're fucking asshole.
Oh, I needed three in one.

1655
01:44:24,141 --> 01:44:27,820
I needed that. So fucking
bad. Now I'm two with two.

1656
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:30,080
I can't pick a game to save
my fucking life. You know,

1657
01:44:30,081 --> 01:44:32,800
it was funny was I took Tampa this week,

1658
01:44:32,801 --> 01:44:35,820
Tampa and Atlanta had
been my goto teams and I,

1659
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:39,550
for some reason Carolina has been
a little Jekyll and Hyde, so I,

1660
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:42,640
the game scared me. It's a divisional
game. I just didn't fucking like it.

1661
01:44:42,641 --> 01:44:46,700
I stayed away and I went with the ramps
because the saints have been Jekyll and

1662
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:48,980
Hyde and I wasn't buying into
this. Oh, here they come,

1663
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:52,730
shit that they've been doing the last
couple of weeks at Sam Bradford has been

1664
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:56,090
shown that he can play at that level.
Yeah,

1665
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,830
hundred percent wrong on that game and
I can tell you this right now to save

1666
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:03,460
yourself a fucking ulcer.
When the team,

1667
01:45:03,461 --> 01:45:07,360
you bet on throws a pick six I don't
give a fuck if it's in the first quarter.

1668
01:45:07,361 --> 01:45:11,180
Shut the game off. It's over the
goddamn 14 point. Turn around.

1669
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:15,650
All right, whatever. I Bitch
Moan and complain enough.

1670
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:19,700
What? Common right up on an hour. I
think that's a good, that's a good,

1671
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:23,310
that's a good number, isn't it?
That's it. God bless all of you.

1672
01:45:23,311 --> 01:45:25,400
I hope you enjoyed the podcast this week.

1673
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,870
Get out there and go do your quads at
Christmas or a Hanukkah is it over yet?

1674
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:32,810
I saw a couple of people driving around
with Menorahs on top of the car is not

1675
01:45:32,811 --> 01:45:37,550
even bullshitting. Um, I thought only
idiots did that with Christmas trees. Uh,

1676
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:42,290
they mocking the idiocy of Christians
or they like, we can be dumb to,

1677
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,240
you know,
like how women do,

1678
01:45:45,550 --> 01:45:50,490
how come only you guys get to box and
have brain damage. We want to do it too.

1679
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,420
You know,

1680
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:57,420
why are women so convinced that
everything guys do is so fucking worthy of

1681
01:45:57,621 --> 01:46:00,050
getting involved in too?
You know, we're dumb.

1682
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:05,980
Just sit back and think a minute.
Just sit back and think a minute.

1683
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:11,160
I want to join the workforce rather than
sitting around hanging out with cute

1684
01:46:11,201 --> 01:46:14,890
little kids. I know it's a job.
What the Fuck's wrong with you?

1685
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:19,840
Wouldn't that be awesome as a guy?
Just think about that right now.

1686
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:22,910
If the roles were reversed,
you know,

1687
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:29,010
and you had the option of just marrying
some rich broad who just go out there

1688
01:46:29,011 --> 01:46:34,011
and just take care of you and all you
gotta do is just keep the house clean and

1689
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:37,940
make a meatloaf a couple times
a week you can just tap out.

1690
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:41,670
Yeah. You know, I'm not
saying you have to do that,

1691
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:45,980
but there's a lot of us out there who
would, yeah, I do that for a couple.

1692
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:48,880
I think I'll be in fucking stay
at home dad for a couple of,

1693
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,830
and just chill the fuck out.
Right.

1694
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:58,990
Getting incredible shape. So sick. All
those broads out there talk. Well, I get,

1695
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,040
I understand what they're out of shape
because they had to carry the baby.

1696
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:04,670
But if you're a guy, there's no fucking
reason why you can't be in shape.

1697
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,470
You didn't have to carry that kid around.
You know,

1698
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,240
you got all day long to work out.

1699
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:17,720
Oh my God. There'll be the shit. I
know what you think of. Oh, these kids,

1700
01:47:17,721 --> 01:47:19,850
they never fucking go
to sleep. Yeah, they do.

1701
01:47:19,851 --> 01:47:24,550
They take a nap every fucking you can
nap with them. You can figure out a time,

1702
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:29,210
you can go out and go buy all kinds of
healthy food and then just chill out.

1703
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:34,900
I would get the fucking NFL package.
I would just whined to my rich wife,

1704
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:39,570
just be a, come on guys, I won.
Yay. Would you, you do like the,

1705
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:43,440
you know they do the little girl thing
when they want something. Oh I just drive.

1706
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:47,670
I just draw. Maybe you'd buy it for
me. I do that with the NFL package.

1707
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:53,610
Right. Do you know, just make it a little
easier when the kids are screaming,

1708
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,520
all right, and I would fucking
tape every goddamn game.

1709
01:47:56,610 --> 01:48:01,610
It would be my mission every week that
I was going to watch all 16 NFL Games or

1710
01:48:02,901 --> 01:48:05,420
whatever the fuck they have. Cup
people have by weeks, 14 games,

1711
01:48:05,421 --> 01:48:06,290
whatever the fuck it is.

1712
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:11,640
And I would sit there like a fucking
defensive coordinator who was waiting for

1713
01:48:11,941 --> 01:48:15,930
the phone to ring, you know, and what's
going to get picked up or some shit.

1714
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,620
And I would just, I would watch all
of those games and I would get a gate,

1715
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,130
I get a,

1716
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:25,730
a padded fucking play room where the
kids couldn't hurt themselves and I just

1717
01:48:25,731 --> 01:48:28,730
fucking get a gate where they couldn't
get out and I just stick them in there

1718
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:30,950
all day and uh,

1719
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:35,120
play amongst yourselves and that I would
just watch all these games and every

1720
01:48:35,121 --> 01:48:38,270
once in awhile I would just throw food
in there. Like they were like, you know,

1721
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,250
animals at the zoo.

1722
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:45,423
Yeah.

1723
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,120
You know,
rather than make it three sandwiches,

1724
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:51,690
I make one big one and I just throw it
in the middle and then just film it like

1725
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:55,790
the discovery channel, you know,
with the pecking order, like the,

1726
01:48:55,791 --> 01:48:58,430
the most dominant male
lion gets to eat first,

1727
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:01,640
then all the other ones sitting
there, you know, Growlin and shit.

1728
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:05,170
Waiting to see when the, when the
biggest one is full, when they can go in.

1729
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:11,890
I think I'd like that. Uh, all right,
that's it. That's a podcast for this week.

1730
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:13,000
Please help me out.

1731
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:16,070
I want to know about that one legged
gold dig and whore running down the

1732
01:49:16,071 --> 01:49:17,540
sideline.
If she could keep going.

1733
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:21,050
I want to know what tuning ACDC is
using on the flick of the switch album,

1734
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,650
particularly. Uh, uh Oh,

1735
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:29,460
it houses on fire and
rising power. And, um,

1736
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:35,160
it'll be funny if it's standard
tuning my ears just that bad. And, uh,

1737
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:38,170
what's the last thing?
Was there anything else?

1738
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:40,720
I know I fucking asked you something else.
I don't fucking know what. All right,

1739
01:49:40,721 --> 01:49:44,850
that's the podcast for this week. Have
a great week. Hope you enjoyed it and go

1740
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,713

1741

Yay.
