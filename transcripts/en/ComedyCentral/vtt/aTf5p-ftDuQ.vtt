00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:08.808
It's time for our next game,
Birds Say the Darndest (BEEP).

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.411 align:start position:0%
Birds are second only to snakes
as the pet of choice for

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.814 align:start position:0%
lunatics.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.315
Like bird (BEEP) on a newspaper,
YouTube is positively splattered

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.984
with pet parrot videos, so I'm
gonna list off two incredible

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.420
yet heartbreaking pet bird
talents, and for 250 points I

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.890 align:start position:0%
want you to guess which one is
real.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.325
First one, does this bird sing
Everybody Dance Now or Bohemian

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
Rhapsody?

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.828 align:start position:0%
Marc.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.129 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Everybody Dance Now.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.831
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Uh, let's find out.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:40.473 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ♪ Everybody dance now ♪
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: So good, so good.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.575 align:start position:0%
(vocalizing)
Oh, uh, can you guys time the

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start position:0%
video-- (vocalizes)
&gt;&gt; ♪ Everybody dance now ♪

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.155 align:start position:0%
(vocalizing)
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: He did...

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:04.464 align:start position:0%
That's amazing.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
Uh, does this next parrot scream
into a cup or (BEEP) into a
bread

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start position:0%
bowl?

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.370 align:start position:0%
Emily.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.738 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Scream into a cup.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Let's see.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; (screaming)
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Every day of my

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:25.184
(BEEP) life I feel like that.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:25.785 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:31.357 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Uh, points.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.793 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; That's the... that's the
truest thing you've ever said.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.395
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: It is, I think it
might be, I think it might be.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.164
Uh, does this next bird say
"Don't touch me" or "No means

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.699 align:start position:0%
no"?

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.402 align:start position:0%
(bell dings)
Emily.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:48.107
&gt;&gt; Uh, I'm just so sad thinking
about the home that this bird

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.511 align:start position:0%
lives in either way.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.412
Like, there's not... there's not
a good way for this bird to have

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.248 size:75% position:38%
learned either of these.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.949 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Either way it's
not... this is a bad

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:59.585 align:start position:0%
environment.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:01.487
&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna say-- I think
optimistically-- "Don't touch

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.257 align:start position:0%
me".

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.159 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Okay, let's...

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.026 align:start position:0%
let's hope, as the lesser of two
evils...

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.394 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.696 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: ...that is the
case.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.331 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Don't touch me.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.939 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.574
Like... "Don't touch me" implies
"when I say this, you're gonna

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:22.441 align:start position:0%
stop."

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.976 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Right.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.244 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; But "No means no" means
"we've al... I've already said

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.046 align:start position:0%
no."

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.014 align:start position:0%
I-I don't like thinking about
it.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.448 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Don't think about
it.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.052
The parrot's fine, he's okay.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think "No means no" is what
Leonardo DiCaprio says to the

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:35.655 align:start position:0%
bear.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:39.425
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yeah, I think so.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
No, that's not... Matt, that was
already debunked by Vulture.

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.295 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; No, it's true.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.563 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
Next one, next one.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
Does this parrot say "You got
it, dude" or "Peekaboo"?

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.936 align:start position:0%
Marc.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.970 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; You got it, dude.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.538 align:start position:0%
Come on.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.539 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Let's see.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.708 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Peekaboo.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Peekaboo!

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.478 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right.

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.381 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry. I know.

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.850
&gt;&gt; All those birds can say that.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.083 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: They're born with
it.
