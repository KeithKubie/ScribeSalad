Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. Like I think Robbie Lawler stopped doing it. I think cowboy, I think, oh these guys, Robbie stopped sparring completely for years while he's fighting for strike force. But then when he moved to a American top team, he started sparring again and it was training really hard and that's when actually he became the welter weight world champion. He's so fucking tough. Like I want to see that ask and fight again cause he, I put my money on Robbie Lawler that he does not care about. He looked better than I've ever seen him as crazy shape. I've gone back and forth about five times on whether or not that was a good stoppage, but Huseman convinced me after we watched the footage that was a bad stoppage. I think Robbie was okay. I think, uh, he just relaxed. He was there. He had, what have I done? I mean how many more seconds, but that bulldog just time or, but yeah, but for Robbie Lawler, I think he was all right.

Speaker 1:          00:48          But it's hard to tell. It's just unfortunate. And again, herb dean is as good a referee as there is on planet earth. There is no one better than him. There's no one better. Herb Dean is as good as it gets. Yeah, he made a mistake, but it's hard to say if it was a mistake because I wasn't even sure it was a mistake. We were not sure better to err on the side of caution because he couldn't hear him. He couldn't talk. But here's the thing, he's only getting choked out like if it's been aspirin, it's only, he's only get choked out if it's Frances and Ghana and he's fucking punching you in the head and you think your unconscious then stopped the fight. Right. But if it's just a choke, like Ben asked her and is not known for being in any way, shape or form of power striker.

Speaker 1:          01:31          No, and he's not hitting them now he's only holding onto his neck and I think that shows have been how tough bad astronauts. Cause he got his head bounced off that fucking, I was like, you're getting crushed here. And he was just like, whatever, I'm going to stick to my wrestling. Yeah, he was getting fucking pounded, but he figured it out and he, even though they disengaged, he managed to get ahold of Robbie again and get them on the ground and get that choke on. Yeah, look, it was, it was fun while it lasted, but he doesn't want to fight Robbie again. I think if I was the UFC I would be absolutely trying to make that fight again. Do you think they will know? I think they want to, that's what Dana White said. But Ben said, why would I want to do that? I already went already.

Speaker 1:          02:12          One quote. I want to do that. But the thing about, you know, like Kamara was saying like, you don't get a choice. Like the UFC is going to tell you who to fight again. Maybe they just offer Ben good amount of money off from Robbie is Robbie is, uh, you know, he deserves that privilege and I think he's easily up there and he can always be the champion again, that got more on his clothes. He looks good. He looks as good as he's ever looked. Yes. It looked amazing. It looked amazing physically. He looked amazing when he was fighting. Um, even more importantly, I think that's the fight that makes the most money because people want to see that. I want to see it. You want to see it. All the real fans want to see it. Yeah. I think I'm doing enough of that in USA. They do sometimes.
