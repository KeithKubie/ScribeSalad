00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.210
I think we were lucky -- or I should
say I was lucky -- that when I started my

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.000
lab I asked a question that perhaps was
a good question to ask.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.100
Why are these T-cells not able to kill the target cell?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.300
And the assumption was that either the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.300
T-cells are not there or they were never
generated.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
The t-cells actually get functionally exhausted

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.640
and that was a paradigm shift, 
because if the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.000
T-cells are there,
that means you can try

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.390
and fix them.
