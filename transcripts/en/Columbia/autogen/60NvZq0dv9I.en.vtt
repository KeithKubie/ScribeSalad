our plans are to continue to work on all
 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.699
our plans are to continue to work on all
these fronts so we had to come up with a

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709
these fronts so we had to come up with a
 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.809
these fronts so we had to come up with a
number of levels ranging from strikes we

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819
number of levels ranging from strikes we
 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.500
number of levels ranging from strikes we
already had for streaming only working

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
already had for streaming only working
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.629
already had for streaming only working
through three other levels ultimately

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639
through three other levels ultimately
 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.330
through three other levels ultimately
the last level was a fully downloadable

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340
the last level was a fully downloadable
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.940
the last level was a fully downloadable
open resource which could be mixed and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
open resource which could be mixed and
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.460
open resource which could be mixed and
mashed so we had at one end of the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
mashed so we had at one end of the
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.589
mashed so we had at one end of the
spectrum something which was fully open

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599
spectrum something which was fully open
 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.020
spectrum something which was fully open
at the other end of the spectrum we had

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030
at the other end of the spectrum we had
 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.699
at the other end of the spectrum we had
something which could only be streamed

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709
something which could only be streamed
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.879
something which could only be streamed
and in the middle we had something where

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889
and in the middle we had something where
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.860
and in the middle we had something where
you could take that two-minute clip say

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
you could take that two-minute clip say
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.930
you could take that two-minute clip say
it's a two-minute clip of cells dividing

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940
it's a two-minute clip of cells dividing
 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.430
it's a two-minute clip of cells dividing
from Innova you could take that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
from Innova you could take that
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.379
from Innova you could take that
two-minute clip but if that had other

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389
two-minute clip but if that had other
 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.659
two-minute clip but if that had other
resources that two-minute clip could be

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669
resources that two-minute clip could be
 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.849
resources that two-minute clip could be
used in another derivative work but only

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
used in another derivative work but only
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.379
used in another derivative work but only
as a two-minute piece you couldn't mix

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389
as a two-minute piece you couldn't mix
 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.909
as a two-minute piece you couldn't mix
and match with in that two-minute piece

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
and match with in that two-minute piece
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.190
and match with in that two-minute piece
whereas the last level you could mix and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200
whereas the last level you could mix and
 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.680
whereas the last level you could mix and
match within them two minute piece so we

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690
match within them two minute piece so we
 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.680
match within them two minute piece so we
had these different levels for these 900

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690
had these different levels for these 900
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.620
had these different levels for these 900
resources so the challenge that we had

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
resources so the challenge that we had
 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.320

so we approach creative comments about
doing an education license so that we

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510
doing an education license so that we
 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.240
doing an education license so that we
could get further assurance and then we

could get further assurance and then we
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010
could get further assurance and then we
can then pass on the assurances to our

unfortunately the CC board rejected that

cited they were concerned about the

cited they were concerned about the
 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.230
cited they were concerned about the
proliferation of licenses and they want

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
proliferation of licenses and they want
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.820
proliferation of licenses and they want
to ensure the Opera operability of

to ensure the Opera operability of
 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.550
to ensure the Opera operability of
licenses that's why we had to stick with

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560
licenses that's why we had to stick with
 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.050
licenses that's why we had to stick with
the four different levels that we have

the four different levels that we have
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.300
the four different levels that we have
because we felt that only in the level

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310
because we felt that only in the level
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.450
because we felt that only in the level
the last level where it's fully mixable

we got which did not have to be limited
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.030
we got which did not have to be limited
to education and then and I really think

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040
to education and then and I really think
 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.400
to education and then and I really think
in a lot of ways it's a loss for us

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410
in a lot of ways it's a loss for us
 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.340
in a lot of ways it's a loss for us
because it creates a huge risk for us to

labor negotiations this has resulted in
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.550
labor negotiations this has resulted in
some real serious thinking about how to

sores so it's cute us up for some work

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690
sores so it's cute us up for some work
 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.969
sores so it's cute us up for some work
that we will now spend a lot of time

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979
that we will now spend a lot of time

in this arena but at this point in time

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840
in this arena but at this point in time
 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.649
in this arena but at this point in time
it's still incredibly complicated so

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659
it's still incredibly complicated so
 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.060
it's still incredibly complicated so
that's kind of the scenario that we had
