Hi. My name is Laura and I'm the undergraduate intern for Emory Healthcare Communications

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.940
Today I'm out on Emory's campus asking undergraduate students like me if they have gotten their flu shot this year.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.820
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot this year?
A: I have not.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.960
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot yet?
A:  Not yet.
Q: OK, are you planning to get your flu shot?
A: Yes.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.660
Q: Have your gotten your flu shot yet?
A: I have not.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.340
Q: Why not?
A: I just haven't really gotten around to it.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.580
Q: Hi. Have you guys gotten your flu shot?
A: No. [Laughter]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.640
Q: Are you planning to get your flu shot?
A: Yes, of course.
Q: Why haven't you gotten it yet? 
A: Time. I just haven't found the time.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.200
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot this year?
A: No, I have not.
Q: Why not?
A:  I just haven't got around to it.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.400
Student: I don't have flu shot yet but I'm planning to get it soon.
Interviewer: Awesome. Way to go!

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:06.000
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot this year?
A: No.
Q: Are you planning to get your flu shot this year? 
A: No. [Laughter]

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.880
Student: I did not get my flu shot this
year because I can't remember the last

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.720
last time I've actually felt like I needed to get the flu shot.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.300
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot this year?
A: No.
Q: Have you ever gotten a flu shot?
A: No.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.439
Q: And ever you ever gotten the flu?
A: I don't think so

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.080
Q: Have you gotten your flu shot this year?
A: I have!

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.640
Q: have why did you get your flu shot?
A: College students are gross! [Laughter]

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.020
So I think that that what we learned today is that Emory students are not on top of their game

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.200
when it comes to getting their flu shot.
But no need to worry, there's still

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.960
plenty of time to get your flu shot this
season.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.520
And as always Emory Healthcare reminds you to get your flu shot every single year.
