00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This question involves the Bay of Syracuse.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, Syracuse is on the water. It is on an island, after all.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It has a bay that looks somewhat like this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but please don't go to Google maps to confirm,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because this is not a great drawing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
On this bay, this bay has a mouth here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and on this northern point here there is a lighthouse,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which I've drawn over here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to determine a way to figure out the width of the mouth of this bay using trigonometry.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's see what we can do.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We can measure the height of the lighthouse or we could ask the lighthouse keeper.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The height of this lighthouse is 25 meters.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I can position myself on the other shore down here,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
get real low to the ground and use a device like a sextant or a quadrant,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is just a device that lets you measure angle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I can measure what this angle is right here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It turns out this angle is 1.30 degrees.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, I think you have the ability to tell me, given this information, this angle, and this height

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
what is the width of the Bay of Syracuse.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That is this distance?

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter your answer here and do it in meters.
