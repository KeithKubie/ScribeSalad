I say on the one hand, I got less scared of
aging by interviewing successful 85-year-olds,

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:24.330
but another way I grew more tolerant of aging
was growing older myself. There are probably

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.300
three to five longitudinal studies that compete
with the Grant Study in length, but what makes

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:43.059
the Grant Study unique is that the men have
given us permission to present their lives

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:53.140
in three dimensions, so that the book is not
only about statistics, but it's about stories.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:02.489
The book is the history of how the men, and
the science, and its author changed from a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:14.610
pre-World War II view of the world to the
way we see it in 2012. I'm very different

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.190
from who I was when I was a 33-year-old whippersnapper studying middle aged men. And the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:34.130
men, of course, are no longer the 47-year-olds but are 90. And because the wonderful thing about

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:45.200
getting older is that you get better with
time--not worse--these stories become inspirational.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.170
If you stay healthy, and your genes are right,
being 90 can be a lot of fun.
