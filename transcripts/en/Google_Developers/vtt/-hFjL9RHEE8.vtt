00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.790
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello,
and welcome to I/O Live.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.500
I'm Florina
Muntenescu, your host.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.490
And I'm here with Haris,
product manager on Android Auto.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.100
Hi, Haris.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.270
HARIS RAMIC: Hi, Florina.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.561
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: So tell me.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.600
What's new for developers
for Android Auto?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.474
HARIS RAMIC: So this is
a very exciting year.

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:31.150
We have all the new sets
of the changes in the API

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.800
for media and
messaging developers,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.550
which is the biggest change
we made in a long while.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.040
For the media, what the
developers can do is,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.350
they're going to be able to
do content browse forward,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.590
which is pretty exciting.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.280
And they're going to have
different sets of layouts

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.840
that they can use to actually
present their content better

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.190
to the user.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.220
For the messaging, we
have new messaging styles

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.726
which is going to
enable them to do,

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.100
for example, group chat and
a couple of different things.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.830
And for all the
thousands of developers

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.130
that we have for Android
Auto, that's pretty exciting.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.171
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Am I
able to already download

00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:02.948
the apps directly in the car?

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.989
HARIS RAMIC: Yeah, so
actually what we have right

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.770
now is we're also showcasing
the preview of the Play Store

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.982
Google Assistant
in the vehicles.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:11.440
So we've announced
today that we're

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.540
going to be shipping some
of these Google services

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.180
with Volvo.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.952
So that's pretty exciting.

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:18.410
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Anything
else that you want to tell us?

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.910
HARIS RAMIC: I would say, keep
developing for Android Auto.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.610
If you're media/messaging apps,
we're excited to work with you.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.250
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Perfect.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.620
Check out the documentation
that we have online,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.360
and start developing
Android apps.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.860
Thank you.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.693
HARIS RAMIC: Thanks.

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:33.703
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: This
is Florina for I/O Live.
