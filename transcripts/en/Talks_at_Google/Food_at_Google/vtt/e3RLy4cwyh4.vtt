[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.940
JUSTIN MANN: Thank you
all for joining us.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.010
I'm here today with
Jeremiah Tower.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.360
He has been called the king of
California cuisine, the winner

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.100
of Best Chef in America, and
he has opened restaurants

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.280
all over the world--

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.640
including, most notably,
Stars, here in San Francisco.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.501
Welcome back.

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:26.952
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Thank you very much.

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:28.305
Wonderful to be back.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.890
JUSTIN MANN: And I'm also
here at Lydia Tataglia.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.940
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Tenaglia.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.619
JUSTIN MANN: Tenaglia, ahh--

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.272
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
You practiced this.

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:34.070
JEREMIAH TOWER:
We've practiced this.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.350
My apologies.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.330
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Tenaglia.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.246
JUSTIN MANN: Tenaglia.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.030
Who has worked on shows such as
"No Reservations, with Anthony

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.105
Bourdain" and "Mind of
a Chef," and recently

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:51.040
has worked with Jeremiah Tower
with "The Last Magnificent."

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.921
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Mhm.

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.420
Yeah.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.295
JUSTIN MANN: Welcome.

00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:54.497
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Thank you.

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:56.800
JUSTIN MANN: So first
question I have for you,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.194
with all the names you have
given throughout your career--

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:01.444
JEREMIAH TOWER: [LAUGHS]

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:02.860
JUSTIN MANN: The
Last Magnificent,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.830
the king of California
cuisine, some, I'm sure,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.651
we can't repeat--

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:08.150
what would you say
is your favorite?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.483
JEREMIAH TOWER: Most of them
you can't repeat, actually.

00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:14.660
[LAUGHS] Well, I loved Godfather
because I loved the movies.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.890
So Godfather of California
cuisine is a good one.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm not sure what it means,
but I like the sound of it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.340
because the films were so great.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.045
But my favorites are the
ones we can't mention here.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:30.580
So therefore, I won't.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.770
JUSTIN MANN: Could you describe
what California cuisine exactly

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.640
is in your mind?

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.390
JEREMIAH TOWER:
California cuisine?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.710
Yes.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.920
Beautifully said by Mario
Batali and Anthony Bourdain

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.390
in the film, you know, when
they're talking about it.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.960
And I loved it when
Mario Batali was saying,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.600
you know, before, a
serious restaurant,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.670
was probably a
French restaurant,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.250
and it had foie
gras, and Dover sole

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.470
and all that sort of thing--
of course the foie gras

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.920
came out of a can.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.500
It was disgusting.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.440
And Dover sole was frozen.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.719
And he said that, what
happened in California--

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.370
he tributes me doing it,
which is very nice of him--

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.620
that we took petrale, we said,
look, we have petrale sole.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.640
We're not going to fly in
frozen Dover sole, which is not

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.589
any good and very expensive.

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.380
We're going to concentrate
on petrale sole.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.820
And then it goes on to
talk about the California

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.210
regional dinner, which was the
moment when America shifted.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.320
And so I took Monterey
Bay smoked prawns,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.210
goat cheeses from Sonoma, from
the goats that we had raised,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.240
and the California farmers
market for all the dried fruit.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.160
So that was the shift to
insisting on ingredients.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.000
It starts with ingredients,
is about ingredients,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.260
and finishes with ingredients.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.430
And that's basically
local, sustainable,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.850
fresh ingredients was the
message of California cuisine.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.310
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Which is so
ubiquitous now, but, back then,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.000
it was not.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.560
And so, you know,
it was really sort

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.950
of the first push
in that direction

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.100
when he wrote that
particular menu

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.661
and attributed all the
farms, and the farmers,

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:16.910
and where he had sourced
those particular ingredients.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.535
And so know you
look at that now,

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:22.260
and you're like, that's
all over the country now.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.636
But that was a first.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.010
JEREMIAH TOWER:
I mean, it sounds

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.920
ridiculous to say
that now because there

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.980
are Whole Foods everywhere.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.930
When we started, there
wasn't one Whole Foods,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.470
and all the things in Whole
Foods were not available.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.970
You know, for someone
your age, that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.594
just sounds like a
ludicrous statement,

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:42.220
and an impossible
statement, but it was true.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.440
Walking every morning
to [INAUDIBLE] to cook,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.800
I would steal [INAUDIBLE]
and rosemary out

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.930
of people's gardens.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.972
I mean, that's the only
place I could get them.

00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:54.430
JUSTIN MANN: So
then, what gave you

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.180
the idea to actually
do this local cuisine?

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.620
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well, you
know, to fill up Chez Panisse,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.594
because, you know,
we had no money.

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.760
You know, I wanted to cook
veal occasionally instead

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.490
of chicken breast every day.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.200
So I wanted to fill
up the restaurant,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.080
so I started doing regions
of France festivals.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.190
So once a month, we'd
do a different region.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.890
Finally, we had done
them all, and Corsica

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.540
was the only one left.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.390
And I didn't even know
where Corsica was, let alone

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.810
had a Corsican cookbook.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.150
And for the first time,
I cooked a terrible meal.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.859
So the next day I thought,
totally ashamed of myself,

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:33.650
and it was a horrible
experience for a chef

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.010
to serve something you know is
not very good, so I thought,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.860
why am I doing this to myself?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.754
I had been gathering
local ingredients

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:44.170
and pretending they were--
cooking them in the French way,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.415
saying they were French.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:46.956
And I thought that's
just ridiculous.

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:50.410
Why would I would I say
Monterey prawns are scampi?

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.790
They're not, and so that, it
was my road to Damascus moment.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.390
And I thought, OK, so I made
a list of all the things I

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.760
could get together to make a
dinner, and did the dinner.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.240
Wrote the menu in English
for the first time,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.030
California wines only
for the first time,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.480
and named the farmers and
the sources and everything.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.060
Of course, that
sounds very grand,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.730
but it was actually to
get a bit off the price

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.730
by naming everybody.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.280
JUSTIN MANN: Is that where the
phrase "elegant simplicity"

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.300
comes in?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.160
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.650
So when you've got some
fantastic ingredients

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.980
like those Monterey Bay
prawns, do as little to them

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.380
as possible.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.236
You buy them, you
store them properly,

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.110
because if you don't,
there's no point having

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.600
those perfect ingredients.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.380
And then cook them as
simply as possible.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.230
Let the ingredients be the
rock stars, not the chef.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.730
For me to say that
sounds ludicrous,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.510
but it's what I believe
and believed then.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.290
JUSTIN MANN: So the
film, "Jeremiah Tower,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.640
The Last Magnificent," where
did the idea for that come from?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.640
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, I
mean the idea, you know,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.490
I've been working with Anthony
Bourdain for many, many years.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.661
And he read Jeremiah's memoir.

00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:08.910
It's called "California Dish."

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.920
Actually, it's just
been re-released

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.180
as "Start the Fire."

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.150
And there's a lot of
new material in there,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.970
and it's a great read.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.090
It's full of incredible
stories, and it's also

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.910
full of a lot of characters
that I've certainly

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.030
come across and have
heard of and know

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.801
from my long journey working
in food and travel television.

00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.550
So connected with a
lot of different chefs

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.820
and the culinary scene, so
I recognized all the names

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.530
in the book, but
I didn't recognize

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.840
the author who had written it.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.480
And I thought that
was somewhat unusual.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.510
So when Bourdain kind of
threw the book on my desk,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.950
he said, read this.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.950
He was really kind of coming
at it from a very strong sense

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.350
of, as he puts it,
his justice button,

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.920
wanting to right a wrong,
feeling that Jeremiah

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.380
had been written out
of an important piece

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.900
of American culinary history.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.570
And when I read the
book, I certainly

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.010
had that question too.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.010
Why haven't I heard of this guy?

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.870
But I was skeptical
about whether or not

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.690
it could actually be a film
until I met him in person.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.110
And there was a sort
of preliminary period

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.200
where I did a kind
of initial interview

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.930
with him that I
thought would last you

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.380
know 30 minutes, 45 minutes.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.930
Instead, we had a
five-hour conversation.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.360
And it was really compelling.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.950
And that's when I
really start to get

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.910
engaged in the idea of
turning it into a film.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.400
Certainly to answer
this question, you know,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.130
who is this guy,
and where is he?

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.310
But really to go another layer
or two deeper, which is who's--

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.240
it's a character driven story.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.900
It's who's the character behind
all of these incredible things?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.680
Where did he get his
memories, his impressions,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.320
his formative experiences?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.040
Why was he able to, without any
culinary training whatsoever,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.050
never went to
cooking school, never

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.600
had stepped foot in a
professional kitchen before,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.830
why was he able to suddenly
just apply himself in this way?

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.270
And that was fascinating.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.420
And I said that was really sort
of the beginning of the journey

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.869
we took together.

00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:30.160
JEREMIAH TOWER: Written of
the role of chance and chaos

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.870
in success.

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.380
JUSTIN MANN: Well,
in the film, you say,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.220
"There's no excuse to not
endlessly continue to try

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.280
and make everything you want as
wonderful as you envisioned."

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.565
Do you think you achieved
this in this film?

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:45.856
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well, I didn't.

00:08:45.856 --> 00:08:47.795
Certainly, Lydia did.

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:49.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.320
Yes, it's a wonderful movie.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.900
At the end of the
first showing, premiere

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.400
was at the Tribeca Film
Festival a year ago,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.150
a woman came up to me and said,
you know, I loved the movie.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.110
In fact, everybody
who has seen the movie

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.590
was telling us
that they loved it.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.110
She said, I love the
movie, but you seem so sad.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.720
I said, honey,
it's just a movie.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.650
Do I look sad?

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.110
No, it's a wonderful movie.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.830
I mean, I saw it for the
first time in a big theater,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.630
dark huge theater
alone with Lydia.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.210
At the end, she said, well,
are you going to hit me now?

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.240
I said, I don't know.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.448
I don't know what I just saw.

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:26.160
I'm in shock.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.630
So it was very odd
to see it, but I

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.730
realized that something
amazing had happened.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.230
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
Yeah, that screening

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.600
was two days before the
Tribeca Film Festival,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.950
so he hadn't seen anything.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.750
And it was, he and I were
sitting in a very big theater,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.030
just the two of us.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.470
My heart was racing and
there was a lot of things

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:55.750
that people that he didn't
know were in the film,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.960
archival footage, which
we can get to in a minute,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.680
that he didn't realize
was in the film.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.170
And so I think it was a shocking
first presentation for him.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.200
It's not what, perhaps,
he expected at all.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.960
And we proceeded to sort of
stumble out of the theater

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.420
and into a bar across the
street, where you we had one

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.640
too many because he
just needed to come off

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.512
of the shock of that.

00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:21.970
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Yes, it was a shock

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:29.400
to see my mother encased in
mink on "The Queen Mary."

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.950
It was a shock for me to see
me at 11 years old foxhunting

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.340
and with all my--

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.370
really, I hadn't seen that stuff
in 50 years, [? almost ?] 60.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.370
LYDIA TENAGLIA: That was
an incredible serendipitous

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.030
finding in the film.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.650
Because we were actually very
late in the editing process,

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.780
and we had shot all
the key interviews,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.716
and we had shot the recreations
that you see in the earlier

00:10:53.716 --> 00:10:55.090
part of the film
because I really

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.250
needed to bring to
life that kind of tone

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.900
and texture of
what he experienced

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.760
when he was so young.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.700
And that was the
work around for that,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.590
just those little tiny memories
of sitting alone in a big hotel

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.690
room by himself or on a ship.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.930
And so that was the
material we had.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.010
And then I got a
call from his nephew.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.180
He was cleaning out
his mom's basement.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.610
It was just one of those
things, and he called me,

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.450
and he said, yeah, you know,
this basement, dark closet, way

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:26.710
in the back, there was a box.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.500
And in that box were
eight millimeter films.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.170
And they were labeled "Tower
trip to Spain," "Young JT."

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.820
Are these useful to you at all?

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.030
And I was like, what
are you talking about?

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.630
I'm like, yeah, they're useful.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.710
He sent them, and you
transfer the film,

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.730
and you see every
story, memory, even

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.480
the recreations we had done
corroborated in that footage.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.360
Suddenly we had
that real element,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.220
that real archival
material to deal with.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.010
And it was, then, how
do we marry these two

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.630
elements together so that
they kind of work organically?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.030
And I mean, I look
at the recreations,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.260
I think some of them
work better than others.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.020
They were shot on green
screen and in a black box,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.320
and then we created
the backgrounds.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.330
And some of those
backgrounds are

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:23.000
composited with real archival
footage from those films.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.500
JEREMIAH TOWER: The
eight millimeter

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.560
on a huge screen with modern
sound, very interesting.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.110
But my favorite recreation
is the little kid.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.430
How old was he, Lydia?

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.380
LYDIA TENAGLIA: He was, I think,
seven or eight, the actor.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.463
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yeah, he
was sitting at this table

00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:39.470
was a big croquembouche.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.956
Croquembouche are
profiterole stuffed

00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:44.080
with whatever, caramel
cream, in this case, covered

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.980
with spun sugar or caramel.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.700
So about this tall.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.510
And when you're a little
kid, as I well remember,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.799
that thing seemed
eight feet tall.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.090
And it's right in front of him.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.464
And he looks at
it, and he starts

00:12:55.464 --> 00:12:57.050
to pull out a profiterole.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.980
And he pulls the caramel and
he's looking at his fingers,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.784
and then he puts in his mouth.

00:13:01.784 --> 00:13:03.950
And then he shoves a whole
one, and then he looks up

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.300
at the camera like that.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.450
You know, as a wow.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.540
That, for me, told
the whole story

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.123
of the first half of the film.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.030
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.230
Yeah, there is-- that
little boy we cast

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.155
was extremely adventuresome,
because we had him eating.

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:21.440
If we had him eating like
eggs in aspic and all sorts

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.940
of things you'd find--

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.360
JEREMIAH TOWER: He
looked happy doing it.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.290
LYDIA TENAGLIA: He did, he did
look very happy doing it, yeah.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.164
JEREMIAH TOWER: Lobster
and artichokes with--

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.029
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah.

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:32.570
JUSTIN MANN: So with
that, how was it

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.940
going back and hearing
all those former friends,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.890
coworkers, schoolmates
talking about you,

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.570
and how was it talking
with them, trying

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.239
to get them to be in this film?

00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:46.780
JEREMIAH TOWER: They all think
they're psychoanalysts so they

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.670
blab it on and on and on.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.380
But it was Lydia who did it,
so you should talk about that.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.400
LYDIA TENAGLIA: He had left
San Francisco and just quite

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.020
frankly in very Greta Garbo-like
fashion, sort of left everyone

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.820
behind.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.090
And those were very good
friends of his, particularly

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.575
the friends from Harvard.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.810
And they hadn't
really seen or heard

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.470
from him in quite some time,
I mean, almost 20 years.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.660
So they immediately
responded when I reached out

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.390
for their participation.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.790
And then what became
very apparent,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.430
the bulk of those early
acquaintances from Harvard,

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.170
they really missed him.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.110
And it was so clear,
forget Chez Panisse,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.420
forget Stars, forget all of
what he did very publicly.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.300
His friends talked
so beautifully

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.830
about just the impression
he made on their lives, that

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.950
being in his company and
that time in their history

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:54.975
at Harvard in the '60s.

00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:55.588
JEREMIAH TOWER: It's
because I cooked

00:14:55.588 --> 00:14:56.640
them omelets every night.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.515
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah.

00:14:57.515 --> 00:15:01.840
[LAUGHS] But I think
his friends Cathy

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.490
and Michael Palmer said
it, being in his company,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.390
it was audacious.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.860
There was an
audaciousness there,

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.390
that it was very compelling,
charismatic to be around.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.400
They really, really,
really missed him.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.440
They hadn't heard from
him in a long time.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.500
So we just had a
screening the other night,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.600
and I called all those people.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:29.700
And they came, and it was this
fantastic emotional homecoming

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.990
of these old friends.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.261
That was really
beautiful to see.

00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:37.550
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yes, friends
from 1961, for heaven's sakes.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.800
Cathy Simon, who is a
San Francisco architect,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.990
and Michael Palmer, famous poet.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.390
But they were my roommates.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.700
Well, Michael was my
roommate in Harvard College.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.730
And I would cook, even
in my Adams House room,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.120
there was a hotplate
in the closet.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.010
And I would cook omelets
in there and chicken livers

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.830
in 100 year old Madeira, which
I got from my Russian uncle.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.380
And Michael talks about
institutional food

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.930
and our reaction against it.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.660
So we moved off campus
so we could cook.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.120
And Cathy's a brilliant natural
cook, so we went for it.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.170
I remember nights in Cambridge,
Massachusetts in June

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:24.460
just before school, college
was over, 90 degrees.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.210
And so I cooked a goose.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.280
We had cold goose
and Chateau d'Yquem.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.120
Not bad.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.540
So of course they remember me.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.040
JUSTIN MANN: Well,
it's interesting,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.248
because in that part where
you're talking about, back

00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:43.560
in Harvard, you talked about
how your cooking was almost

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.140
like your revolution
against like everything

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.780
that was going on at that time.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.960
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well,
that was graduate school,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.300
and I finally had a little
house in Somerville,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.370
which was a dumpy
neighborhood in those days.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.290
But I had a big kitchen,
so I could cook.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.890
And as an antidote to graduate
school, that's what I did.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.550
Then I had downstairs
some friends,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.079
and then the revolution came
along, so I spent a lot of time

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.980
bailing SDS members and
revolutionaries out of jail.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.869
And then we would go back to my
apartment and pour champagne.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.160
They all said, Jeremiah,
you've got to get off your ass

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.140
and be a revolutionary.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.940
You can't live like this in
the midst of a revolution.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.520
I said, are you enjoying
your champagne and caviar?

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.377
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:31.710
And they kept coming back,
and then finally my apartment

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.410
was full of six or
eight people staying

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.490
there to evade the police
and the arrest warrants

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.104
while I cooked.

00:17:40.104 --> 00:17:41.520
And then there was
that one moment

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.720
in the film when we talk
about the moment I did turn

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.860
into a revolutionary.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.276
JUSTIN MANN: The
Molotov cocktail.

00:17:46.276 --> 00:17:47.830
JEREMIAH TOWER: The
Molotov cocktail,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.330
which we'd been
drinking Dom Perignon,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.930
so we filled it up with
gasoline and put a rag in it.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.340
LYDIA TENAGLIA: A rag, it was
an Hermes scarf, actually.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.240
JEREMIAH TOWER: An
old Hermes scarf.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.323
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Not a rag.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:00.940
It was an old Hermes scarf.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.730
JEREMIAH TOWER: We got
in a friend's Porsche 911

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.950
and drove up to the
architectural school

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.600
with Margot Fonteyn, and
Richard [? Cragen ?] from--

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.850
LYDIA TENAGLIA: [? Krillya. ?]

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.860
JEREMIAH TOWER: And
[? Krillya ?] and I threw--

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.200
I though, OK, this is my moment.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.340
I've really got to
be a revolutionary.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.250
So I threw the bottle at the
architectural school, which

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.530
I thought was a very
cool thing to do.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.980
And it bounced back because
it was a Dom Perignon bottle.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.430
Never make a Molotov cocktail
in a champagne bottle.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.110
That's my lesson.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.970
And it bounced back at
me, and I jumped aside,

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.210
and it rolled down the street
in front of the Fogg Museum

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.930
and landed in a storm
drain and exploded.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.650
And in the scene in the film,
I think, right, that's enough.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.360
That's enough revolution.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.006
Back to dinner.

00:18:48.006 --> 00:18:49.380
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
He was a royalist

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.394
amongst the revolution, I
think, is what it seems.

00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:55.435
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well, all
revolutions eventually,

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:56.430
you produce--

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.300
I mean, the French
Revolution in Talleyrand

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.430
who had the second or
first most famous chef ever

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.470
in the Western world.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.120
Antonin Careme was his chef.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.409
So one minute you're
storming the Bastille,

00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:12.700
and the next minute you've
got a palace and the world's

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.436
most famous chef.

00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:17.944
There's a little bit of
that in every revolution.

00:19:17.944 --> 00:19:19.360
JUSTIN MANN: So
it's surprising it

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.310
didn't work because in
the film you come off

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:31.200
as a super professionist, so
what is professionalism to you,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.547
if it's not making the
perfect Molotov cocktail?

00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:36.380
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well,
that's the same thing.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.255
If you're going to make
a perfect Dover sole,

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:40.060
you might as well
make whatever you do,

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.310
try and do it
perfectly, otherwise

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.560
there's not much point.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.870
So of course, I made the
perfect Molotov cocktail

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.340
even if it didn't work.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.530
It was the perfect
looking Molotov cocktail.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.310
JUSTIN MANN: So there's
also this big motif

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.555
in the film about you being
like a director of a play

00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:01.180
at your restaurants
and all that stuff.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.096
JEREMIAH TOWER: Right.

00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:03.980
JUSTIN MANN: And you
being the head of it,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.600
pulling all the strings,
and also main character.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.770
How did that make you feel?

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.815
Is that like the, I
guess, the high point

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:16.630
of just pulling all the strings,
being the puppet master?

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.338
JEREMIAH TOWER: Oh,
yeah, in a restaurant

00:20:18.338 --> 00:20:21.210
like Stars, which will
see a Saturday night shown

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.090
in the film, when
it's all working,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.670
it's a little taste
of what it must

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.690
be like to be Pavarotti
getting a 20-minute standing

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.700
ovation at "La Scala."

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.760
I mean, you just
get that high that--

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.200
no drugs can really approximate
that wonderful feeling.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.904
Everything is
working, everything's

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:44.320
working in your
mind and your body

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.720
and your emotions
and your senses.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.140
It's a very, very special
feeling when it's working.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.790
Of course when it's not,
it's just the opposite.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.680
So yes, I mean, Stars
had an open kitchen

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.820
and was across from the
bar and the dining room,

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.730
and you could see
everything happening.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.780
So whether it was a naked
homeless person streaking

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.200
through the restaurant,
that would be a bad moment

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.250
for most restaurateurs.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.960
I would go out and say, could
we have some applause please?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.860
And so everyone was like,
wow, this is so exciting.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.420
Or it was Nureyev coming
in after the "King and I"

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.090
and doing a grand leap in the
middle of the dining room,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.430
then coming over
and bending me over,

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:32.290
and giving me a kiss
down to my tonsils.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.310
That was special.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.190
And everyone would
stand up and applaud.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.360
So there were those
moments at Stars.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.800
You'd turn everything
into theater.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.300
JUSTIN MANN: In
"Table Manners," you

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.970
said that food is not the most
important part of the party.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.180
So which-- you did
say that in your book.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.750
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yes,
yes, yes, and I'm right.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.170
JUSTIN MANN: So what should we
expect when we go out and dine?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.300
JEREMIAH TOWER: All
great dining experiences,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.020
whether it's a hamburger
at Zuni or a pizza

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.170
or a four hour meal at your
favorite Michelin restaurant,

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.065
should be a balanced experience.

00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:09.440
There's no point
having good food

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.070
if the service is no
good, and vice versa.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.620
I mean, if the place
is incredibly hot,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.090
who cares how good
everything is?

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.020
It all has to be the same.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.700
The look, the lighting, the
flowers, if there are flowers.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.130
The food and the service
should all be on one level,

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.710
whether it's a pizzeria or a
Korean BBQ joint on the corner

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.380
or in a place like
Stars, otherwise

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.900
it doesn't make much sense.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.910
And so therefore there's
nothing pretentious

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.710
about a three-star
Michelin restaurant

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.430
if they get it right.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.290
If they get it as right as
the Korean BBQ on the corner

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.004
that get it right.

00:22:48.004 --> 00:22:49.420
LYDIA TENAGLIA: I
know he despises

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.830
all the psychoanalysis
in the film,

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.700
and his friends psychoanalyzing.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.749
I mean, just from
my perspective--

00:22:56.749 --> 00:22:58.540
and he's going to laugh
at this, I'm sure--

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.290
but I think there's a memory
that from very early on when

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.840
he was 11, 12 years old,
his mother would frequently

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.380
throw these sort of lavish
parties and cocktail gatherings

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.886
and garden parties
with lots of people.

00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:15.010
JEREMIAH TOWER: In England.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.450
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
In England, yeah.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:22.170
And she loved to
socialize in that way.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.110
JEREMIAH TOWER: Drink.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.026
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Drink.

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:26.410
And so there was a lot of
heavy drinking going on.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.367
His mother had a--

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:30.200
JEREMIAH TOWER: She was
a roaring alcoholic.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.033
LYDIA TENAGLIA: She was
a roaring alcoholic.

00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:36.864
So I think there's this memory
in the film, where she'd

00:23:36.864 --> 00:23:38.780
have one of these parties,
and then of course,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.830
have one too many.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.630
And then the food, which she had
been overseeing up to a point,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.920
sort of fell by the wayside.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.080
And so that he jumped in,
and as he says in the film,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.340
it was almost out of
shame, that he didn't

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.590
want the party to go awry.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.850
He would leap in and help with
the food and the people who

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.430
were cooking back there,
and sort of finish off

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:07.820
the poached salmons, and make
sure that you didn't lose face.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.610
I thought that was a very
important memory for the film.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.860
It was almost like
from very early on,

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.800
there was this sense of
the show where go on,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:22.040
or just kind of adopting the
central character of master

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.820
of ceremonies.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.950
And it was sort of
ingrained in him

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.620
very early on, so that
when eventually he

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.560
did go to Chez Panisse and
then created Stars, which

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.780
was his own vision,
that sense of being

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.800
the kind of central character
pulling all the strings

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.740
and keeping it all together,
I think was very, very

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.910
ingrained in him from early on.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.847
That's $100, please,
for that session.

00:24:49.847 --> 00:24:52.180
JEREMIAH TOWER: I'll just
take the copyright, thank you.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.850
LYDIA TENAGLIA: OK.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.640
JUSTIN MANN: So a lot of the
film deals with your past

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.000
and Chez Panisse and Stars.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.310
But the current
part is the filming

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.990
when you were at
Tavern on the Green.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.110
JEREMIAH TOWER: Right.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.850
JUSTIN MANN: What
was it like having

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.174
that filming going on while you
were the head chef over there?

00:25:10.174 --> 00:25:12.340
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well, to
have that filming going on,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.800
it taught me patience
for the first time,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.610
because Lydia's motto
is never give up.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.800
And that's mine too, so there
were some interesting moments

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.630
about what had to be given up.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.390
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
Interesting moments.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.840
There was a lot of hand
in the face at that point.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.690
That Tavern chapter
happened after the fact.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.810
I set out to shoot a film that
explored his early childhood,

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.560
Chez Panisse, and
Stars, and it was really

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.100
going to be bookended by Mexico.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.750
And so the last
thing we had to shoot

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.820
for the film, because
everything else was shot,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.730
was the four days in
Mexico, where I wanted

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.270
to get a sense of
his life there,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.550
and what I call
self-imposed exile.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:00.610
And that shoot was planned,
and we had bought the tickets,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.720
and the scenes we were
going to shoot were set.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.162
And then he emailed
me and said I'm

00:26:08.162 --> 00:26:10.120
going to have to push
that by a couple of weeks

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.830
because something's come up.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.220
And I said, OK,
what's the something?

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.885
He said something, I
have a schedule conflict.

00:26:17.885 --> 00:26:19.870
Well, of course,
he didn't tell me

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.941
he had moved to New York,
gotten an apartment,

00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.940
and he was starting a job
at Tavern on the Green

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.590
as executive chef.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.500
And so I sort of discovered
with the rest of the world

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.020
because there are a lot
of headlines at that time

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.340
that he was coming in to take
over, that this had happened.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.510
And then again, much like
the eight millimeter footage,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.670
my stomach did a
somersault. What

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.440
do we do with this chapter?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.550
Now, we've suddenly moving
into a kind of produced,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:54.760
constructed, retrospective
into a different kind

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.060
of shooting paradigm,
which was follow doc,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.800
I don't know what's
going to happen here.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.980
Now, I'm suddenly
spontaneously following.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.530
So that was a little
bit of a conundrum.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:09.420
And I showed up on
day three of the job

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.410
at Tavern much to his dismay.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.490
Because I think he thought that
we were finished at that point.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.686
JEREMIAH TOWER: You just
admitted you were finished.

00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:19.200
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
We were finished.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.250
JEREMIAH TOWER: Thank you.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.840
LYDIA TENAGLIA: I
pushed my way in,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.370
and I started
following him around.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:27.610
And then I thought maybe
this could actually

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:33.130
be interesting to see him
coming out of the wood work

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.860
at such a--

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860
JEREMIAH TOWER: Old age.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.110
LYDIA TENAGLIA: --seemingly
late point in his career.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.630
I think it was really
fascinating because I saw him.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.850
He just rolled up his
sleeves, and he kind of

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:46.970
dove into the kitchen.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.330
The kitchen was very green.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.480
And he had a lot of
impediments, lot of challenges,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.200
and he just got to work.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.559
And you could see all the things
that were so present and strong

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.350
with him in all of
those different chapters

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:06.970
of his life being applied to
this particular situation.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.970
Simultaneously, you could see
that there would eventually

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.960
be conflict because he was not
in control of all the strings.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.295
He was the back of
the house and then

00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:17.670
there was the
front of the house.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.850
And so if there's
not synergy there,

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.130
there's going to be
conflict and chaos.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:28.790
And I could see that
happening pretty early on.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.100
So I stuck with it.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.500
That was three months
worth of shooting

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.200
that could have been a whole
other film in and of itself.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.740
And then once that kind
of ended the way it did,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.400
which is, if you haven't seen
the film, it doesn't end well.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.640
It was just trying to
figure out creatively

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.230
how the Tavern material
actually fits in.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.620
then we sort of, after
many, many iterations, kind

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:03.010
of used it as a backdrop to tell
the ending of the Stars story.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:08.060
So the different chapters of
why Stars eventually unraveled.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.650
Tavern sort of just became
a kind of punctuation point

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.170
to tell that story.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.410
And then at the end, he leaves
New York goes back to Mexico,

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:21.430
so then we shot Mexico, and
then the film was finished.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.300
JEREMIAH TOWER: No
earthquake in New York

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.311
was Tavern as it
was here for Stars

00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:28.810
and the closing of
the Civic Center,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:32.950
which was very
difficult. But I love

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.460
the moment in the film at Tavern
about the cocktail napkins.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.040
JUSTIN MANN: I was
going to say that.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.539
That was the beginning of the
end, was the cocktail napkins.

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.710
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yeah, I mean,
when I was complete 100% owner

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.500
and in charge of every
conceivable part of Stars,

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.000
I mean.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.150
I bartended once
a week at lunch.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.740
I did the flowers for six months
to find out what was involved

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.380
and how much it should cost,
et cetera, so I did everything.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.900
And then one day at
Tavern, I realized

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.740
they weren't using
cocktail napkins.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.890
And you know, a cocktail
napkin is not just convenient

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.220
for the customer to sign to
the managers and to the owners

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.040
or whoever is looking that the
customer is gotten service.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.330
So cocktail waiter or waitress
goes over, takes an order.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.640
You put down a cocktail
napkin, so if I'm

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.370
looking around the bar, and
I see someone without one,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.530
I know that they
haven't had service yet.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.425
So they're very useful that way.

00:30:25.425 --> 00:30:27.550
And I realized that there
were no cocktail napkins,

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.972
and I went over to
the bar manager,

00:30:29.972 --> 00:30:31.680
and said, where are
the cocktail napkins?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.980
And he said, well, we have
to go to an op meeting, which

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.310
would be a week away,
then they'd discuss it

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.380
all at the operations meeting.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.460
And then would go to committee,
then it would be a memoed out.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.585
So we're talking 10
days away before you

00:30:47.585 --> 00:30:50.800
serve fucking cocktail
napkin, as I say in the movie.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.430
I said, get me the
cocktail napkins.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.160
Do we have them?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.660
Yes.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.470
Well, get me the cocktail
napkins and use them now.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.810
So that's what I was facing.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.830
So at Stars, I would just say,
bring me the cocktail napkins,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.900
and five minutes
later, they'd be there.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.500
But 10 days away before they--

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.680
I didn't get that at all.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.860
LYDIA TENAGLIA: It caused
tensions, to sum up.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.120
JUSTIN MANN: Well, you
did get an amazing email

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.240
from one of the sous chefs
saying that you almost

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.500
did what you'd envisioned.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.520
You were so close.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.494
What was it that you
were envisioning?

00:31:28.494 --> 00:31:30.660
JEREMIAH TOWER: Well, it
was like a big ocean liner,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.710
speaking of psychoanalysis.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:36.420
It was like turning "The
Queen Mary" back on course.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.390
The metaphors are perfect
for a huge restaurant.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.680
And we nearly did.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.290
And as the sous chef
said, we were just

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.320
so close to pulling it off,
pulling the team together.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.850
And there's the interview
with the office manager

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.070
who was so pleased
with the new menu,

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:00.070
and it's all coming
together finally.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.660
And then we had the lamb
moment with the owners, who

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.560
had taken me out to dinner
to get to know me and talk

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.790
about the food.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.280
And the chef member
of the partnership

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.850
said, is it true that lamb
has both white and dark meat?

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.340
And I said, well, only
if it has feathers.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.170
And they got really pissed off.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.720
I thought they were joking,
but they weren't joking.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.290
So a week or 10 days later,
"The New York Times" review

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.820
came out, and it
was 50-50 at best.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.030
And so they said they were
incredibly embarrassed by that,

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.670
because now they couldn't
really-- when they went

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.534
to school with
their children, what

00:32:38.534 --> 00:32:39.700
would they tell the parents?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.010
And I'm thinking,
wait a minute, we're

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.570
at a meeting to discuss
adding 300 more seats.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.069
In one day, we'd add 300 more
seats for the summer season.

00:32:50.069 --> 00:32:51.610
So I had done this
an enormous amount

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.200
of work with
schedules and budgets

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.365
and menus and everything.

00:32:55.365 --> 00:32:56.740
And all they wanted
to talk about

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.514
was how embarrassed they are in
front of the parents at school.

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:04.180
And they said, so
what we're going to do

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.305
is take over the food to
make sure it quote unquote

00:33:06.305 --> 00:33:07.590
"make sure it's perfect."

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:12.210
And I thought, white
meat in lamb, perfect?

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.660
I thought, uh oh.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.390
They've got a real problem,
so I just took my files

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.907
and dumped them, and said, I'll
see you, I'm going to lunch.

00:33:19.907 --> 00:33:21.740
LYDIA TENAGLIA: And
then he never came back.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.110
JUSTIN MANN: There was a quote.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.610
Somebody said it
was said by you,

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.010
but you actually never said it.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.737
You long for the crowd, but you
know the guillotine is close.

00:33:33.737 --> 00:33:34.820
JEREMIAH TOWER: Oh, right.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.655
JUSTIN MANN: Yes.

00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:38.225
Is that something you say and
something you think about?

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:39.600
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Well, I mean, you

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.210
work for one of the most
important company in the world.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.880
You should know the guillotine
is out there, always

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.220
waiting to come down.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.220
You're probably as safe
as anybody in the world,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.720
working for Google.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.030
But yeah, there's always
that because people--

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.390
anyone who is successful, there
are people trying to drag you.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.520
It's like a basket
full of crabs.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.880
One tries to get out and
the others all haul it back.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.380
There are always people who
would like to pull you down.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.659
In fact, I had--

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.960
thank god, the chief of
police was my best pal

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.420
and had free lunch
every day at Stars

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.940
because there were
some incidents where

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:25.550
people were trying to get
at me in a very violent way.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.449
So I know.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:34.420
LYDIA TENAGLIA: I understand
the impulse, actually

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.037
to get at him in a
very violent way.

00:34:36.037 --> 00:34:38.120
JEREMIAH TOWER: Who's
killing the great chefs when

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.000
it was on here, things
got sort of exciting.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.080
First, [? Maus ?] had
died, was killed, murdered.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.500
And then somebody near my
house wearing chef whites

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.522
had a chef's knife stuck
through the top of his head.

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:52.980
That's what Lydia
is talking about.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.900
That's what she
wanted to do to me.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.120
So successes can
be a rocky road.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.430
LYDIA TENAGLIA: But he has
actually a really beautiful

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:12.490
motto about, that saying
that I think the measure,

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.674
and I love that.

00:35:13.674 --> 00:35:15.340
JEREMIAH TOWER: The
measure of your life

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.490
are the risks you
take along the way.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.280
I like that.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.360
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, and
I think he, in many ways,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.960
his life and his career
is embodied by that motto,

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.450
or that motto embodies
that narrative for him,

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:39.230
because every step of the way,
he just kind of threw himself

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.020
in somewhat risky situations.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.240
And you know, sometimes you
fail, sometimes you win and--

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.830
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Pick yourself up.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.880
Last week, in New York, a young
culinary student talked to me.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.170
He said, I'd like your advice.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.290
I don't know whether
I'm going to go

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.750
to culinary school or medical
school or something else.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.460
I said stop, stop right there.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.740
Forget both.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.910
Just look around you, be
open, and take the best thing

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.980
that you like that comes along.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.640
Try it out.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.070
If it doesn't work,
you pick yourself up

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:11.990
and do something else.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.650
But if you really--

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.820
it's like a relationship.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.920
You can't go to a
party, and say I'm

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.711
going to meet the person
I'm going to spend

00:36:17.711 --> 00:36:18.890
the rest of my life with.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:22.550
When you have that attitude,
everybody runs a mile.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:26.420
And so that's what I meant
about that the role of chance

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.560
in success.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.520
When you see something come by
and you really are interested,

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.610
but your mind say, oh, no, no,
that's too risky or something,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.870
just grab it.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.160
It'll drag you along.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.630
It may dump you, or just
may take you to the top.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.970
JUSTIN MANN: So going to
that, about the person who

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.610
is going to culinary school, you
had some amazing chefs at Stars

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.740
that went on to do so
many amazing things.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.610
Took a 15-year sabbatical, went
back to Tavern on the Green.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.460
What differences did you
notice in the newer generation,

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.184
the younger generation of chefs?

00:37:02.184 --> 00:37:03.850
LYDIA TENAGLIA: That's
a great question.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.410
JEREMIAH TOWER: It was
after I had left there

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.630
that Mario Batali
and Anthony Bourdain

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.330
and lots of other chefs said,
well, Jeremiah, you didn't have

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.540
any Mexicans in the kitchen.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.000
Are you crazy?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.630
I said, what?

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.040
What are you talking about?

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.410
I said, oh, I think I know
what you're talking about.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:24.960
There was the 22-year-old
white suburban cook

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.980
who was about to plate
the fettuccine with cream

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.879
and everything, and if his phone
rang and he took his phone out,

00:37:31.879 --> 00:37:32.670
it was on the line.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.086
He was supposed
to plate the food.

00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:36.750
I mean, the pasta's there dying,
and he pulled out his phones.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.090
I walked up and said,
what are you doing?

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.350
Cook that again
quickly and plate it.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.946
And he had his phone in his
hand, he looked at me like,

00:37:43.946 --> 00:37:46.110
do you have a problem?

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.690
I said, yeah, you.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.150
You and your work ethic.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.180
So when I got to the
kitchen, I realized

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.870
that they didn't know how
to make chicken stock.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.000
So that was a bit of a surprise.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.320
And then I did get some Mexicans
in, legal ones, I have to say.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.150
And then the kitchen
really came together,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.010
started to come together,
because of the work ethic.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.220
LYDIA TENAGLIA: I mean, Anthony
Bourdain, who I've worked with,

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.670
he's worked in so
many restaurants,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.670
and he's written
about this extensively

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.830
and very beautifully
and poetically

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:27.950
that the entire, certainly
kitchen scene in Manhattan when

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:32.720
he was growing up, it was really
helmed by these incredibly

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.390
talented Mexican chefs, who
were more often than not

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:42.742
acknowledged as being the
real engine in the kitchen.

00:38:42.742 --> 00:38:44.450
In fact, the last
restaurant he worked in

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.930
before he took off
as a television

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.380
personality, the
guy who took over

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.100
after him was his sort
of long time sous chef.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.830
And he has written
about this guy,

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.440
and sort of written about
that whole scene, really

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.710
as a commentary towards
issues that we're

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.580
having with immigration.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.210
I won't go there, but I
think it's a really, really

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.210
important point.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.380
And I think to
Jeremiah's point, when

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.200
he made these critical
hires, you see people

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.180
with an incredibly strong work
ethic, who learn the job very

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.590
quickly, push the
whole agenda forward,

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:33.050
And it's a remarkable,
very talented workforce.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.020
And I think when he
first got to Tavern,

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.580
it was a very,
very green kitchen.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.100
And somewhat undisciplined
and all that.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.270
So that was actually a
really critical turning point

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.680
when he made those hires,
because the whole kitchen

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:56.184
started to kind of coalesce
very, very strongly.

00:39:56.184 --> 00:39:58.100
JEREMIAH TOWER: My opinion
about hiring people

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.500
is if people come to
the kitchen and say,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.900
I've been a sous
chef at Le Bernardin,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.390
or you should hire me, I'm
going to be your sous chef,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.240
and I'll have a BMW,
thank you, in six months.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.290
My point is, do you know
how to peel tomatoes?

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.720
Do you know how to make
chopped up tomatoes?

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.620
So the point is, if you
have the right attitude,

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.840
it doesn't matter you
don't know how to cook.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.620
As long as you want
to do it, and you

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.400
have the right attitude, I
can teach you everything.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.840
But if you've got
a bad attitude,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.180
I don't care how
well you can cook,

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.740
you're just going to be a pain
in the ass in the kitchen.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:37.920
So that's my approach
to hiring people.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.560
And we had a woman downstairs
who did the lettuce every day

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.260
for five years, Tibetan.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.890
And she just, there was
never a squeak out of her.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.060
And so then, I said, OK,
you have to come upstairs

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.480
into the light and the fame.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.260
Come upstairs, and she
said, no, I don't want to.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.900
And then we had
a Chinese busboy,

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.040
from the whole time I
was at Stars, Chang, who

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.590
never said a word to
anybody and ended up

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.220
owning half of Chinatown.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.770
I was really, I thought,
boy, I'm working my ass off,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.760
and now you're
multimillionaire busboy.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.360
So all of that makes
up a team that's

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:25.130
really sort of vibrant
and fun to work with.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.020
JUSTIN MANN: So one
of the last things

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.660
that it said in the film
is, "Let the flesh grow old,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.340
crumble.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.810
What are my great expectations?

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.730
What have I done?"

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:38.564
What's next for you?

00:41:38.564 --> 00:41:40.021
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Well, first of all,

00:41:40.021 --> 00:41:41.840
I have to say that
was from my notebooks

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.740
when I was 19 and
full of Mescaline--

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.070
--looking out on a
winter day in Boston,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.535
that seemed like a very
cool thing to write down.

00:41:52.535 --> 00:41:54.710
But I gave those notebooks
to Lydia thinking,

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.960
oh, that's a nice thing to do.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.860
I hadn't read them in 50 years.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.590
LYDIA TENAGLIA: I did.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.770
I read all of them,
and I highlighted.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:08.900
I didn't mean to interrupt, but
at one point when the film was

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.627
coming together, I felt like
we needed his narrative voice

00:42:13.627 --> 00:42:15.210
in there, but I
didn't want it to feel

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.420
like sort of
pedestrian narration

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.170
from one point to the other.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.950
Let the other voices
we interviewed

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:29.280
kind of propel the actual nuts
and bolts of the story along,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.550
but then when we heard from,
him it had to be something else.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.760
And I would sort of struggle
with that for a while.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.430
And then I remembered
these journals

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.240
that he handed them to me, it
was like maybe the second week

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.890
of our starting the process.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.640
So I'd go back and
look at these journals,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.692
and they were journals he
kept from the age of 18, 19.

00:42:50.692 --> 00:42:52.650
JEREMIAH TOWER: From a
drug-ridden 19-year-old.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.230
LYDIA TENAGLIA:
Yeah, and they were

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:58.790
full of existential
angst, and just

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.730
sort of memories about
that period in your life

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:05.770
where you're up against
trying to define who you are.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:10.470
And there were just a lot
of lines in those journals

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:15.450
that I felt had relevance
to these story points.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.850
And so I used those.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.820
I remember the day we did
the narration session.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.279
He was like, what
the fuck is this?

00:43:23.279 --> 00:43:24.570
I'm like, those are your words.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:25.420
You've got to--

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.180
JEREMIAH TOWER: You've
got to read them.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:26.970
LYDIA TENAGLIA: You've
got to read them.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:27.910
JEREMIAH TOWER: No, I'm
not going to read them.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.894
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah,
he's like, what?

00:43:29.894 --> 00:43:31.560
JEREMIAH TOWER: But
that one's very cool

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.800
because it was written
when I was very young,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.390
and now I'm very old.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.680
And the cut in the film
is what have I done?

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.075
Yet is what I
should have written.

00:43:43.075 --> 00:43:43.950
That's what it meant.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:44.730
What have I done yet?

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.480
I've done nothing.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.700
I'm 19, going crazy.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.090
Mescaline is wonderful,
but what have I done?

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.030
And so the cut is then
straight to a shot

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.570
of the sign for Chez Panisse and
the Stars logo and everything,

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:01.700
so it was a brilliant placement.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.962
And I haven't answered
your question.

00:44:03.962 --> 00:44:05.170
JUSTIN MANN: No, you haven't.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:05.961
JEREMIAH TOWER: No.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.660
Well, let's see.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.200
I'm working on--

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.680
"Table Manners" came out in
October, and "Start the Fire,"

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.520
basically the script for this
movie, "The Last Magnificent"

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.160
came out last week.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.190
And I'm working on another
one called "Flavor of Taste"

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.040
which I'll probably
sell as an e-book

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.110
because it's a lot
of photography.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.870
And I'm going to start
my speaking career.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.900
Earlier this year, I
gave a talk to 100 CEOs

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.780
of the hospitality business
in the United States

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.210
in Las Vegas and Key West.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.210
And it was all about
my story, but also

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:49.480
the role that chance and
chaos plays in big success

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.800
and how to do it.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.990
And I got a standing
ovation for both of them.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.390
I thought, wow, boy, Key
West and the Four Seasons,

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:57.040
I can do this.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.350
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah,
and I know lots of people

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.010
have been coming to
him for consultancies.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.070
And it's interesting
because he can sort of

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:18.520
go into a hotel or a restaurant
and sort of see immediately

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.120
what needs to be adjusted and
tweaked and shifted in order

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.009
to set the ship back on course.

00:45:26.009 --> 00:45:27.550
JEREMIAH TOWER: I'm
not immediately--

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:28.860
10 minutes, give me 10 minutes.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.694
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah,
10 minutes, 10 minutes.

00:45:31.694 --> 00:45:33.860
I'm not trying to be your
PR agent here or anything,

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:37.060
but I think he has that ability.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:43.570
So I'm looking forward to seeing
what happens next in his story.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.275
There's a lot percolating there
beneath the surface of that.

00:45:47.275 --> 00:45:48.650
JEREMIAH TOWER:
It's interesting,

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.390
you working for Google,
because, I mean,

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.360
there's obviously
a culture here.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.170
I mean, everyone in the world
talks about it all the time.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:00.910
My point to the CEOs was,
you know, I can walk into--

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.540
I mean, I walked recently
into the little boutique hotel

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.010
here in San Francisco
that set the stage.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:10.720
It was the first
perfect boutique hotel,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.340
just off Union Square.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.570
And I walked in and the
doorman was on his phone.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.220
Fine, I can open my own
door, not a problem.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.120
I walked past the concierge,
and he was on his phone,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.470
never looked up.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:26.057
So I thought, right,
I'm going to test this.

00:46:26.057 --> 00:46:28.390
I walk past reception, the
two people were on the phone,

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.490
never looked up,
never said hello.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:33.070
So I thought, right, OK,
how bad can this get?

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.500
I walk into the dining
room, down the steps,

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.040
and the waiters were in the
back talking to each other,

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.130
never looked my way.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.130
And I thought, wow,
I mean, whoever

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.890
the owner is here is long gone.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.840
And my point was, you
don't have to have the--

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.810
I can tell if there's
an owner in the hotel

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.055
or restaurant in minutes
because of the feeling.

00:46:53.055 --> 00:46:54.430
But it's not just
the owner, it's

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:58.724
the owner who has imbued
the managers and the staff

00:46:58.724 --> 00:47:00.640
with the culture of
excellence, or whatever it

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.420
is they're trying to achieve.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.637
You guys are living
examples of it.

00:47:06.637 --> 00:47:07.720
So that's what I'm saying.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.060
That's what Lydia
is talking about.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.580
And now especially in
places like Mexico,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.230
where the young rich kids open
restaurants, and then go back

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.070
to the south of France, you can
tell that there's nobody there.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:24.430
It's the waiters that are
running the restaurant.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:27.285
So that's what
we're talking about.

00:47:27.285 --> 00:47:32.110
So the big challenge is the
training to make a team.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.440
Without a team, you
can't do anything.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.856
You can be the most brilliant
chef, owner, whatever,

00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:40.480
superstar chef in
the world, but if you

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.190
don't have a team who has
the same head as you do,

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.205
then it'll come to nothing.

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:49.740
Did that make any sense?

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.710
JUSTIN MANN: Sure does.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:52.210
Thank you.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.261
Well, that's all I have.

00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:54.760
I was wondering if
anybody out there

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.160
has any questions for you guys,
if you're willing to take some.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:57.380
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yes, absolutely.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.505
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, sure.

00:47:58.505 --> 00:47:59.147
Yeah.

00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:00.730
JUSTIN MANN: Yes,
that's how would you

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.682
define your accomplishments
to a young chef starting out?

00:48:03.682 --> 00:48:05.640
AUDIENCE: Or not even
accomplishments, but just

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.150
the legacy you'd like to leave?

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.009
JUSTIN MANN: Or your legacy.

00:48:09.009 --> 00:48:11.050
JEREMIAH TOWER: Legacy is
a very interesting word

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.740
because I don't really
care about legacy much.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.770
I'm not sure.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.544
I know what it means,
but I don't really care.

00:48:17.544 --> 00:48:18.460
I know what I've done.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.460
As you see it in the film
and read in the book,

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.126
"Start the Fire," I
know what I've done.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.680
It was fun, and I'm going
to continue to have fun,

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:37.070
but legacy, I mean, she
just made the legacy.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.090
So then I can relax
and forget about it.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.870
LYDIA TENAGLIA: But I
would go back to the motto

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:51.710
because I think that was his
sort of defining philosophy.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:52.980
The measure of your life is--

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.605
JEREMIAH TOWER: --the
chances you take.

00:48:54.605 --> 00:48:56.200
LYDIA TENAGLIA: The
chances you take.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.130
He, time and time again,
just sort of threw himself

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:07.070
in without any kind
of second guessing.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:12.200
And to walk into a kitchen
and sort of sell yourself

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.464
as the executive
chef when you've not

00:49:15.464 --> 00:49:17.630
gone to culinary school,
never worked in the kitchen

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:22.280
before, really his
experience came

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:28.790
from reading culinary tomes,
Escoffier, and Alice B. Toklas,

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:31.965
and he just went for it.

00:49:31.965 --> 00:49:33.590
JEREMIAH TOWER: She's
talking about how

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:35.420
I got the job at
Chez Panisse, which

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.550
was because they were
desperate for somebody,

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.650
and I was desperately broke.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:43.470
I had $25 left to my
name, and San Francisco

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.970
wasn't very expensive
in those days,

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:51.450
but still, I need more than
$25 to get through the day.

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.020
So I could have
thought, you know,

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.020
I can't, I don't know
anything about this,

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.240
turn around and leave.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.330
And I didn't, and
that's what I mean

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:01.950
about just taking a chance.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:05.070
You can always run for
it, sooner or later.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:10.920
But when I sold Stars to a
Chinese group and then took off

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.290
I made a list, what are
all the things I wanted

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.450
to do that I had
never done, and what

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.340
is it that still scares
me as much as running

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.066
a restaurant, which
is pretty scary?

00:50:20.066 --> 00:50:21.690
And the only thing
I could come up with

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:25.260
was sharks because of my
childhood in Australia

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.900
and some experiences
in the water with them.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.000
So I said, OK, I'm
going to go scuba diving

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.820
and dive with
sharks, big sharks,

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.280
bigger than the
customers at Stars.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.750
And so you'll see at the
end of the film diving

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.260
with that manta.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.010
My girlfriend, who just
wouldn't-- days swimming out

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.120
on the Pacific, she
would follow me around.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.810
And the whale shark was bigger
than this room, twice the size

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.570
of this room, swimming along.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:04.130
I mean, yeah, the feeling
of your nether parts

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:10.160
rising and shrinking
is the same as opening

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.550
for the day in a
restaurant like Stars.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.410
JUSTIN MANN: Has there
been a recreation

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.950
of Stars and that atmosphere
that you've been to any time

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:20.940
recently?

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.390
JEREMIAH TOWER: Yes,
recreation, certainly Balthazar

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:29.250
in New York, the Brasserie,
probably Mario's,

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:33.010
because Mario Batali work at
Stars, and it started there.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:38.780
Del Posto in New York,
that great big restaurant.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.670
Actually, it's Mario who says
every restaurant he's done

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:42.750
has a bit of Stars in it.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:46.970
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, Mario,
and I've worked with Mario, too,

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.390
for many years.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:54.030
And we did a great
interview with him for this.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:58.830
And as a young kind of
just starting out chef,

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.815
he would frequent Stars
all the time as a customer,

00:52:01.815 --> 00:52:04.020
sit at the bar, et cetera.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.930
That was a very incredibly
revealing comment that he made,

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:10.770
that in some way, shape, or form
all the restaurants that he's

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.940
created have been
modeled in some aspect

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.930
after his experience at
Stars, that that left such

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.030
a strong impression on him.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:25.110
And last night there was
this kind of small screening,

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:29.760
and I think unbeknownst to
Jeremiah, the person that

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.950
organized it invited people
who were patrons there

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:38.280
and chefs that had worked with
him in the kitchen when they

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.440
were very young, and
Denise Hale showed up,

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.130
and it was sort of this
gathering of people.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.250
And it was stuff that I
had heard along the way,

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.530
but it was concentrated
in one room last night.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.640
And when they stood
up after the screening

00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:00.590
and sort of made comments
about the incredibly strong

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:04.310
impression that that
restaurant and that experience

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:09.410
left on their lives, it
was so powerful to hear,

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.520
because Mark Franz, in the film,
says, when I think about it,

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.980
it doesn't even feel real to me.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.270
It feels like I'm
replaying a movie.

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:21.350
It's so romantically placed
in my mind, the energy

00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:29.660
and the confluence of different
tones and textures and energies

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.147
that happened in
that restaurant.

00:53:32.147 --> 00:53:33.980
To answer your question
with my perspective,

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.270
I don't think that
really exists now.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.210
I mean, what does
exist is we're all

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:44.782
familiar with the idea of
restaurants as the scene.

00:53:44.782 --> 00:53:46.865
You know, you go and you
hang out at a restaurant,

00:53:46.865 --> 00:53:48.450
and everybody's a foodie now.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.630
And everyone's taking
pictures of their food.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:55.010
And everyone knows where
the latest cool opening is.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.380
So that's fairly ubiquitous.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:02.540
But the energy that is described
from all those people, of Stars

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.930
at that time, from the
mixture of high-low

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:12.320
and just sort of a feeling
of like the entire experience

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:20.150
being one seamless burst
of incredible energy.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:22.610
I don't know if that
really exists anymore.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:25.427
There is a romantic--

00:54:25.427 --> 00:54:26.885
certainly, the way
they describe it

00:54:26.885 --> 00:54:30.440
is a very sort of romantic
remembering of that time.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.690
JEREMIAH TOWER: But everyone
tells me in San Francisco

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:37.370
that there isn't a place like
it, but Balthazar in New York

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.970
probably gives that
kind of energy.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:42.950
And I taught them a
little bit of Stars.

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.740
I said, I'm coming here
three days a week, four days

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.960
a week when I lived in New York.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:52.453
And you know, I don't
want to wait in line.

00:54:52.453 --> 00:54:54.850
Let me tell you what
we did at the Stars.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:57.150
So when I'd come in
and they would see me,

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.870
and I would pretend to give my
name to the host or hostess.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.630
And then I would walk around
the other side, go to the bar,

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:06.046
pick up a glass of
champagne, and the host

00:55:06.046 --> 00:55:08.670
would walk around the other side
and meet me on the other side,

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.590
and miraculously
there was a table.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:15.240
But it didn't look like I was
butting ahead in the line.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.200
That was a very Stars thing.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:22.170
JUSTIN MANN: It's a
very Godfather moment.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:23.654
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, totally.

00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:26.070
JUSTIN MANN: I'd like to thank
you guys again for coming--

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:26.560
JEREMIAH TOWER: Thank you.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:26.860
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Yeah, thank you.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.380
JUSTIN MANN: --and
making an amazing film--

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:28.550
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Thanks.

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.200
JUSTIN MANN: --that everyone
should definitely see--

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:30.450
JEREMIAH TOWER: Great.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.250
JUSTIN MANN: --because it's so
much fun and so interesting.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:33.750
Wonderful,

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:34.080
JEREMIAH TOWER:
Thank you very much.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.163
LYDIA TENAGLIA: Thank you.

00:55:35.163 --> 00:55:38.130
Yeah, thanks for having
us, really appreciate it.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.330
JEREMIAH TOWER: Thank you.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.980
