00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.340
Imagine you’re putting together your dream
home.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.240
Maybe you’re after a mansion on the rolling hills
of LA, or a mountain-top ski lodge, or a beautiful
cottage somewhere in the countryside.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.460
Whatever it is, unless you’re willing to
give up a lot of modern conveniences, you’ll
want electrical power in your home.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.980
It took scientists and engineers hundreds of years
of experimenting with electricity to get us to a point
where we can use it for our benefit.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.220
Along the way, electrical engineers had to make choices
about the materials they used to stop, start, and change
the flow of electrical current as it was needed.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.040
And although we may take it for granted,
getting power to your new house will involve
some pretty clever thinking.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.220
Electrical power is carried in a material
by the flow of electrons – charged subatomic
particles found in all materials.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.500
Most electrons are bound up in atoms not doing
very much, but certain materials allow electrons
to flow through them, carrying charge.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.030
That flow is what we call an electrical current,
and it’s measured in units called Amperes.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:16.320
In diagrams, you’ll see that current is shown to be
flowing from positive to negative, which might seem
kind of confusing, since it’s opposite to the direction
the electrons are flowing.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.820
But it becomes much easier to decode if you
think about current as a flow of charge.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.540
As electrons flow toward a positive charge,
their destination becomes more negative, and
their source becomes more positive.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
Essentially, charge is flowing in the opposite
direction to the electrons.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.800
For our purposes, though, we just need to
know how easily electrons flow in the material.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.860
When they’re able to flow in a material with a voltage
applied to it – meaning it’s connected to something that
can generate an electric current, like a battery –

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.660
we say the material conducts an electrical current.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.920
The degree to which a material can conduct
the flow of electricity is called its conductivity.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
Then there’s resistance, which describes how much
a material resists the flow of current through it.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.960
It’s inversely proportional to conductivity,
meaning that when one increases, the other
decreases proportionally, and vice versa.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:13.040
Resistance is measured in units called ohms,
represented by the capital Greek letter omega, so we
talk about conductivity in units of inverse ohms
– that is, 1 divided by ohms.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.680
For electrical engineers, conductivity is
often a good thing, like for the material
inside an electrical wire.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.240
We want that to carry a flow of electrical
power to our devices.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.260
As for the casing around that wire, if we
don’t want our electrical current escaping
into unwanted materials,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.520
we’d better make sure that the casing’s
material doesn’t have a lot of conductivity.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.940
In electrical engineering, we can broadly
categorize materials into three types based
on their conductivity:

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.600
Conductors, which, as you might expect, have
high conductivities.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.440
Insulators, which have extremely low conductivities

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.840
And semiconductors, which are somewhere in
between.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.180
For now, we’ll be concentrating on those
first two.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.140
Metals, like silver, copper, gold, or aluminum,
are good conductors.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.080
You’ve probably noticed that a lot of electrical
circuitry is made of metal.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.420
Their conductivities are nice and high at
around ten million inverse ohms per meter.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.700
On the other end of the scale, insulators
barely conduct electricity at all.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.100
Those are materials like plastic, glass, and
rubber.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.880
As an electrical engineer, which type of material
appeals to you usually depends on how much
conductivity you need.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.380
So it’s going to be important to consider
that when figuring out how to get power to
your dream home.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.120
Chances are, we’ll have to transport the
electrical power over long distances – far
from a power plant.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.560
Of course, the electricity grid has to supply
other users too, like businesses, factories
and other homes.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:38.900
It takes a lot of material to supply electricity to
an entire nation or continent, so we need to make
a sensible decision about the cables we use to
carry power throughout the grid.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.560
Our material has to be highly conductive, to transport
as much of the required electrical current as possible,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.240
and high in tensile strength to ensure that it lasts for
a long time hanging between transmission towers.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.700
And, like so many materials in electrical
engineering, it needs to be ductile so we
can shape it to our needs.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.780
The good news is that there is a material
that fits the bill!

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.640
Copper is ductile, and has a high tensile
strength, and best of all, is very conductive.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.560
Job done, right?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Well, the bad news is that copper is too expensive
to make a power grid from.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.760
Cost is one of those pesky engineering considerations
that’s hard to get around!

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.160
Instead, transmission lines are typically
made of a cheaper metal: aluminum.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.280
Aluminum has a high conductivity – although
not quite as high as copper – and is lightweight,
so it’s less likely to sag over time.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.100
But despite this, it’s not strong enough
to support the tension power cables are put
under for extended periods.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.240
Well, no worries.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.660
We’re not restricted to using just one material!

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.380
And steel has a very high tensile strength.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.920
So if we take strands of conductive aluminum
and arrange them around a core of high strength
steel strands,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.900
the cable can transmit lots of power while
the steel provides extra strength and support.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.300
Which is exactly how power cables are designed.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.600
But just because copper is expensive for power
grids, doesn’t mean it’s not used at all.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.160
With all that power now being supplied to
your house, you probably have some electrical
appliances that you’d like to put in there.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.020
Copper will have an important role in those
appliances!

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.340
In smaller quantities, copper is useful in
electronic circuitry, especially since it’s very
easy to shape, weld and solder.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.360
The purer the copper, the better it is for
conducting electricity.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.940
Perhaps one of the most important examples
is in printed circuit boards, or PCBs.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.760
PCBs are boards that allow for complex
arrangements of electrical components to be
connected and arranged on small scales.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.300
And they’re absolutely everywhere!

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.800
Any modern electronic items in this dream
home, from televisions to microwaves or even
a digital clock, will contain a PCB.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.880
If you’re watching this on your phone or
your computer, there’s a PCB already hidden
away in the circuitry of your device.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.840
And it’s copper, with its marvelous conducting
properties, that provide the tracks on those
boards, connecting all the tiny components inside
your devices together.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.920
High conductivity isn’t the be all and end
all of electrical engineering though.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.400
Stopping an electrical current from going
where it shouldn’t is just as important as
helping it flow where it should!

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.020
Consider the wiring in the walls of your dream
home.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.920
As with the wire we considered earlier, insulators
like plastic or rubber will be vital to stop the currents
from flowing out of the circuit and getting where they
shouldn’t.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.420
But even within that circuit itself, materials
on the lower end of being conductors are often
super important.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.300
You might have noticed that your new place
doesn’t really have much lighting yet.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.040
That’s where low conductivity conductors
can help us!

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.620
See, when we apply a current in a low
conductivity conductor,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.820
the electrons, which are carrying the current,
can’t zip past the material’s atoms quite as easily
and carry all the electrical energy through.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.540
Instead, the material’s resistance causes the
electrons to convert some of their electrical energy
to heat, and in some cases, even light.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.280
Which means low conductivity conductors
give us a way to generate heat and light from
an electrical current.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.580
So, resistance isn’t always futile;
sometimes it’s rather useful.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:59.480
The amount of power lost to a resistor to generate
heat and light is given by the square of the current
multiplied by the total resistance of the material.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.180
Under the circumstances they’re typically
used in, it’s also helpful for low-conductivity
conductors to have some other features,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.180
like a high melting point and mechanical strength.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.460
They still need to be ductile, though, so
we can shape them into a wire.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.380
So it’s also handy if those materials are
resistant to corrosion, have a long lifetime,
and are inexpensive – ideally.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.880
Not asking much, are we?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.440
We do have some options, though.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.420
Tungsten, for example, is a metal that’s
typically extracted from chemical compounds
in ores or tungstic acid.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.520
It’s name comes from the term “Tung sten”,
meaning “Heavy stone” in Swedish.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.180
And that’s a pretty apt name for it!

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:43.680
Tungsten is heavy; by density it’s so similar to gold
that counterfeiters sometimes cover a slab of tungsten
with a bit of gold to make fake solid gold bars!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.200
But it also has the highest tensile strength and
melting point of any metal on the periodic table.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.020
That makes it perfect for drawing into long,
thin wires – better known as filaments.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:02.100
And here’s the important thing: tungsten
is quite a low conductivity conductor, with twice
the resistivity of a material like aluminum.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.960
So it also does a great job of generating
light.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.240
Tungsten filaments can handle extremely high
temperatures, up to two thousand degrees Celsius!

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.000
Which means a filament can give off a lot of
light before hitting a temperature where it melts.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.600
Unfortunately, though, we can’t expose it to the
atmosphere, since oxygen reacts with the tungsten to
form tungsten oxide, which burns out the filament.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.940
So instead, we encase it in glass, and surround the
filament with an inert gas like argon or nitrogen so it can
continue to shine when we put a current through it.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.410
If you feel like you’ve just had a light-bulb
moment you’re completely right.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.040
We’ve literally just described how incandescent
light bulbs work!

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.900
Admittedly, more modern light bulbs, like
LEDs, are much more efficient and better
for the environment.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.080
But tungsten’s ability to withstand the
destructive forces of electrical contact are
still pretty useful elsewhere.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.640
For example, tungsten can handle being
bombarded by electrons –

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:02.180
those electrons cause it to emit electromagnetic
radiation in the form of X-rays, which is how X-rays
are generated in hospitals!

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.960
Another low-conductivity conductor that shows
up in electrical engineering is carbon,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.420
which is used in things like resistors, electrical
contacts, and battery cell elements.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.370
So we have light, but can we provide some
extra heat?

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:20.160
A dream mountain-top ski lodge, for example,
definitely needs a way to keep you extra nice
and toasty in the winter.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.360
Well, one low-conductivity conductor, nichrome,
is up to the task.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:32.760
It’s a metal alloy that’s mostly nickel and chromium,
and because it’s on the lower end of conducting,
when we apply a voltage through it, it does a great
job of heating up.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.540
That makes it perfect to function as the heating
element in an electric heater or furnace.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.220
And with that, we’ve got the electrical
essentials covered for your dream home!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:51.620
Of course, if you want a device like a computer
in your new place, we’ll have to take a look at the
intermediate materials on the spectrum that
ushered in the computer age: semiconductors.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.740
But that’s a story for the next episode.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.720
Today, we looked at the materials electrical
engineers work with.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.500
We looked at how high-conductors help us transport
electrical power and form the basis of circuitry,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.280
how insulators stop flow from going where
it shouldn’t,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.140
and how low-conductivity conductors can
be used to generate light and heat.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.580
Crash Course Engineering is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios, which also produces Space Time.
