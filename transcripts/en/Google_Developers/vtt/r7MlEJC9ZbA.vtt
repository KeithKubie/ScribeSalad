Hedrington:
My name's Ben Hedrington.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.968
I work for Best Buy
in the web development space.

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:11.534
I build lots
of different applications,

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:15.033
and a lot of times I like
to prototype things

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:18.000
and get ideas
out there visually.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.667
So what I've done is I've built
a few applications

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.934
on App Engine

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:28.901
that help visualize
social media for Best Buy

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:30.901
and for others,

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.300
allowing you to see
the different trends

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.067
or the people that are
talking about you.

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:38.167
As well as I built
another application

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:41.000
that takes a lot of the voices
of Best Buy associates

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.100
and brings them together
on Twitter.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.267
Those two apps are called
Spy and ConnecTweet.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:52.868
And for me App Engine's
just about speed to market,

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:54.367
getting things out there,

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.133
trying things,
testing things,

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.934
succeeding or failing.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.801
So that's what I do,

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.901
use App Engine to get out
there really fast,

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:06.200
try something,
and see where it ends up.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
man: So you mentioned
that App Engine--

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.567
you chose App Engine.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.934
Were there any specific
aspects of App Engine

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.601
that affected that decision?

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.067
Hedrington: Yeah.

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:19.167
As far as what affected
my decision to use App Engine,

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.334
it was the instantaneousness
of App Engine that--

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:23.801
You know, there--

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.400
I didn't need
to go get a server.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.868
I know how to provision
a server.

00:01:26.868 --> 00:01:28.467
I know how to build a server.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.334
That's not needed anymore,
right?

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:32.467
It's not--it's not--

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.200
The creativity part of it is
what I wanted to get out there.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.634
I wanted to build something
that you could see.

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:39.467
So, you know, having
to spin up a server,

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.701
install software,
manage software,

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.834
you know, make sure
that everything

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.601
was staying up and staying,
you know, well-positioned,

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.934
it didn't make sense
for what I was doing.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.901
And the things I learned
about App Engine

00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.400
once I started using it was it
kind of lended me towards

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.367
building in a scalable manner.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.000
I had to learn Python
at the time,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.367
which was fine.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.934
I love Python now.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.267
And because of the way
App Engine's created,

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.334
you have to follow
some design patterns

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.501
that lend towards scalability,

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.601
and I think that
that's helped going forward

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.234
as the app's been picked up
more and more,

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.133
that I didn't have
to go rebuild things

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:17.968
or redo things.

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:20.501
It kind of just lives
on its own out there,

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:22.734
open for use.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.601
man: Do you have any
kind of interesting war stories

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.067
about developing
on App Engine?

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.100
Hedrington:
Um, I don't--

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.100
I don't think I have
any interesting war stories,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.300
but I think any developer
who does kind of prototyping

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.801
and quicker stuff
always dreads

00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:41.534
when they need to show that
to somebody.

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:43.334
Or another for instance,

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:47.467
the one app I have called Spy,
it actually runs

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.534
in a lot of the C level
executives' offices at Best Buy.

00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:52.801
They full screen it
on a monitor,

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.267
and it just kind
of ticks through

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.901
the different social things
being said about Best Buy.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.834
And that's one of those things
that's like,

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.334
it's something I built quick,

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:02.167
and it wouldn't really
hurt my credibility too much

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:03.667
if it stopped working,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.601
but it would make me feel bad
as a developer, right?

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:07.934
That I've got something
sitting in an executive's office

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.367
that's not working.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.267
And I think App Engine has
satisfied a lot of that to me.

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:14.767
You know, the infrastructure's
always up.

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:16.734
As long as my code's
relatively solid,

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.534
it's just gonna
keep running and ticking.

00:03:18.534 --> 00:03:20.100
I mean, the interesting thing
about the app

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.667
is it's a real-time app,

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.601
so it's constantly updating.

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:25.534
And, you know,
it'll sit and run

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:27.267
on that computer
in their office

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:28.634
for months at a time.

00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:30.167
And I think
that that's nice.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.200
You know, it lets you
sit back a little bit

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.167
and not be worried you got to
sneak in their office

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.200
and refresh the machine
if it breaks

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.601
or anything like that.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.300
So that would be
one for me,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.100
just that confidence factor

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.501
when you're gonna
go demo something

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:46.434
that you threw together
relatively quickly

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.234
that it'll still be there,
still running

00:03:48.234 --> 00:03:49.968
and still working.

00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:52.067
man: Okay, so it has kind of
affected the way

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:53.834
you think about production.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.067
Hedrington: It does.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.734
You know, I'm--

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:58.968
A lot of what I think
that we do

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:01.701
and some of the other folks
that you guys will talk to

00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.033
from Best Buy,

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:04.601
we try to just
bring new concepts

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.667
and visualize them
to people.

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.701
So yes,
you can release.

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:10.167
You can release hourly.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.200
You can release daily
if you need to.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.901
You know, it's there.

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.567
And the way the web is moving,

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.400
it's much, you know, faster
and more iterative.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.734
So, you know,
getting comfortable with that,

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:24.300
with smaller type activities
is good.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.234
So, you know, that's somewhere
that I'm already at.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.434
But I think doing
these type of things

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.033
helps others see that.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:34.167
You know, there is a need
sometimes for, you know,

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:36.801
month-long, year-long
development processes,

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:39.434
but there's also things,
especially in the web space

00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:41.601
where you can move
much faster,

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.234
deploy to production,
you know,

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.701
and really get out there.

00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.934
man: So do you have, like,
a future wish list

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:49.434
for App Engine?

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:50.968
Hedrington: Yeah.

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:53.534
You know, some of the stuff that
they're already talking about.

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:56.000
A future wish list for me

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.934
would be, you know,
the background processing.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.000
One of my apps that
I haven't talked about yet

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.534
called ReTweet Radar

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.334
pulls a lot of things
from Twitter

00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:07.367
and kind of extracts
different concepts from them.

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:11.234
So what it does is it needs
to go do that quite often,

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:14.200
and since there's
no background processing today,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.567
I have to kind of
force that to happen.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.267
So that's a big one for me.

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:21.567
Otherwise, you know,
I'm generally pretty happy.

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:23.434
I would have said
when I started,

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:26.300
"Oh, it'll be nice when you guys
roll out new languages."

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.968
But really, for what I've
learned of Python

00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.734
and what I like about Python,

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:32.434
I'm probably gonna
stick with it.

00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:35.601
You know, I didn't go
jump on the Java bandwagon.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.367
I've done it in the past,

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:39.300
and, you know,
maybe I will someday.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.834
But, you know,
I was actually--

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.667
I think I talked
about this a lot

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.067
when I started
using App Engine--

00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:47.100
I was happy about
the constraints of App Engine.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.100
They made me think harder
about what I was trying to do

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.234
and how I went
about doing that.

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:54.801
And I appreciate that.

00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:56.801
And you can tell there's
some engineering behind that.

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.868
So, you know,
that's about all.

00:05:59.868 --> 00:06:01.601
man: Well, thanks a lot
for coming in

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:02.934
and talking to us.

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.200
Hedrington: All right.
man: all right.
