00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
I don't think they're likely to turn out
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889
I don't think they're likely to turn out
to be true because we heard a lot of the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
to be true because we heard a lot of the
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990

same predictions before the World Cup in
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420
same predictions before the World Cup in
South Africa four years ago now the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
South Africa four years ago now the

South Africa four years ago now the
World Cup in South Africa was viewed as

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
World Cup in South Africa was viewed as
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620
World Cup in South Africa was viewed as
a big risk because here was a country

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
a big risk because here was a country
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570
a big risk because here was a country
that had severe problems with crime and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
that had severe problems with crime and
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280
that had severe problems with crime and
there never had been a World Cup in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
there never had been a World Cup in
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.100
there never had been a World Cup in
Africa before so the question was how

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
Africa before so the question was how
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.450
Africa before so the question was how
would the soccer officials and the local

would the soccer officials and the local
officials deal with all of the potential

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
officials deal with all of the potential
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620
officials deal with all of the potential
risks and things could go wrong in a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
risks and things could go wrong in a
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660
risks and things could go wrong in a
country like South Africa well it turned

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
country like South Africa well it turned

out that those fears were broadly
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730
out that those fears were broadly
exaggerated because it was a fantastic

probably less crime going on during the

things are a bit different because

for a big payoff from the World Cup in

South Africa on the map for a lot of
people and perhaps in the long term they

would see something out of it in terms
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.740
would see something out of it in terms
of tourism or at least a restoration of

time in Brazil though I think that we're

confidence that could really get this
economy going in the past we've seen a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
economy going in the past we've seen a
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.960
economy going in the past we've seen a
pattern where countries that host the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
pattern where countries that host the
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.940
pattern where countries that host the
World Cup don't necessarily make off

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
World Cup don't necessarily make off
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770
World Cup don't necessarily make off
that much better economically but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
that much better economically but
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.240
that much better economically but
countries that win the World Cup

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
countries that win the World Cup
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.070
countries that win the World Cup
do seem to get a little boost over the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
do seem to get a little boost over the
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.530
do seem to get a little boost over the
next few years so this could be just the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
next few years so this could be just the
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.120
next few years so this could be just the
confidence boost that the Brazilian

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
confidence boost that the Brazilian
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.490
confidence boost that the Brazilian
economy needs however to win it they're

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500
economy needs however to win it they're
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.140
economy needs however to win it they're
gonna need to make it through some

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150
gonna need to make it through some
 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.660
gonna need to make it through some
really tough teams so I don't know if my

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
really tough teams so I don't know if my
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.490
really tough teams so I don't know if my
money's on Brazil but for the sake of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
money's on Brazil but for the sake of
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410
money's on Brazil but for the sake of
the Brazilian economy it would be great

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
the Brazilian economy it would be great
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.890
the Brazilian economy it would be great
if they came through
