and you might say well what's your

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190
and you might say well what's your
 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.100
and you might say well what's your
evidence that those differences in

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110
evidence that those differences in
 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.749
evidence that those differences in
personality aren't culturally

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
personality aren't culturally
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.099
personality aren't culturally
constructed in the evidence for that

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
constructed in the evidence for that
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.990
constructed in the evidence for that
quite clear you go online you can look

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
quite clear you go online you can look
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.180
quite clear you go online you can look
up the Scandinavian studies go online

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
up the Scandinavian studies go online
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.799
up the Scandinavian studies go online
and look up gender differences in

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
and look up gender differences in
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.200
and look up gender differences in
personality cross culturally you'll find

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
personality cross culturally you'll find
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.609
personality cross culturally you'll find
the relevant studies they've been done

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
the relevant studies they've been done
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.290
the relevant studies they've been done
with tens of thousands people and what

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
with tens of thousands people and what
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.240
with tens of thousands people and what
they showed we're clearly is that in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
they showed we're clearly is that in
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.700
they showed we're clearly is that in
those societies where the mostly be done

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
those societies where the mostly be done
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150
those societies where the mostly be done
to move smooth the social world into a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
to move smooth the social world into a
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370
to move smooth the social world into a
position of radical equality and so that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
position of radical equality and so that
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109
position of radical equality and so that
would probably be the Scandinavian

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
would probably be the Scandinavian
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999
would probably be the Scandinavian
countries because they've got more than

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
countries because they've got more than
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889
countries because they've got more than
that more about in any other country the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
that more about in any other country the

that more about in any other country the
personality differences between men and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
personality differences between men and
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.740
personality differences between men and
women maximise they don't minimize they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
women maximise they don't minimize they
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080
women maximise they don't minimize they
maximize and I'll say that again

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
maximize and I'll say that again
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.319
maximize and I'll say that again
in the countries where the most has been

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
in the countries where the most has been
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.020
in the countries where the most has been
done to equalize the playing field

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
done to equalize the playing field
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.990
done to equalize the playing field
between men and women men women get more

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
between men and women men women get more
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.630
between men and women men women get more
difference rather than more the same so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
difference rather than more the same so
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459
difference rather than more the same so
for all your social constructionist so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
for all your social constructionist so
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900
for all your social constructionist so
their audiences is probably not that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
their audiences is probably not that
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.340
their audiences is probably not that
many of you because you wouldn't come

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
many of you because you wouldn't come
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.889
many of you because you wouldn't come
and hear me talk socially you're

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
and hear me talk socially you're
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.810
and hear me talk socially you're
actually drawn yeah

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820
actually drawn yeah
 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:15.620
actually drawn yeah
well the thing is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
 
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160
 
so these so one of the things you might

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
so these so one of the things you might
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980
so these so one of the things you might
have is that it's all the same to me

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
have is that it's all the same to me
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260
have is that it's all the same to me
subsets like when I was looking into

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
subsets like when I was looking into
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359
subsets like when I was looking into
this to begin with in this river started

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
this to begin with in this river started
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070
this to begin with in this river started
probably 25 years ago looking at

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
probably 25 years ago looking at
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380
probably 25 years ago looking at
differences in personality between men

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
differences in personality between men
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.350
differences in personality between men
and women you know it's all whether they

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
and women you know it's all whether they
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.180
and women you know it's all whether they
were fundamentally biological biological

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190
were fundamentally biological biological
 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.539
were fundamentally biological biological
or fundamental sociological or what

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
or fundamental sociological or what
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670
or fundamental sociological or what
makes produced the differences you know

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
makes produced the differences you know
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.910
makes produced the differences you know
of you and the most logical hypothesis

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
of you and the most logical hypothesis
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.060
of you and the most logical hypothesis
really hypothesis as utilize the society

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
really hypothesis as utilize the society
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.649
really hypothesis as utilize the society
that the men and women would become more

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
that the men and women would become more
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870
that the men and women would become more
the same that is not what happened and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
the same that is not what happened and
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340
the same that is not what happened and
so we've actually what the social

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
so we've actually what the social
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260
so we've actually what the social
constructionist hypothesis with regards

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
constructionist hypothesis with regards
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.870
constructionist hypothesis with regards
to gender differences in incest and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
to gender differences in incest and
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.100
to gender differences in incest and
personality we'll put that to the test

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
personality we'll put that to the test
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.469
personality we'll put that to the test
in a very intense way and the social

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
in a very intense way and the social
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.779
in a very intense way and the social
constructs this people won't fail so

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789
constructs this people won't fail so
 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.760
constructs this people won't fail so
it's very strange because no one would

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
it's very strange because no one would
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.320
it's very strange because no one would
really believe that right if you make

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330
really believe that right if you make
 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.150
really believe that right if you make
this make society more the same you men

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
this make society more the same you men
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190
this make society more the same you men
and women get going on so what's up with

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
and women get going on so what's up with
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680
and women get going on so what's up with
that well the answer seems to be is that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
that well the answer seems to be is that
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.479
that well the answer seems to be is that
there's fundamentally two sources of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489
there's fundamentally two sources of
 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.840
there's fundamentally two sources of
variability in personality right there's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850
variability in personality right there's
 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.819
variability in personality right there's
perhaps more but you can categorize them

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829
perhaps more but you can categorize them
 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.890
perhaps more but you can categorize them
as broccoli genetics and gruffly so see

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
as broccoli genetics and gruffly so see
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.350
as broccoli genetics and gruffly so see
barking well you take out all the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
barking well you take out all the
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.750
barking well you take out all the
sociological differences between the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
sociological differences between the
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.060
sociological differences between the
landscape in which men women rated all

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
landscape in which men women rated all
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.039
landscape in which men women rated all
you have left are the biological and

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049
you have left are the biological and
 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.770
you have left are the biological and
genetic differences so they maximize the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
genetic differences so they maximize the
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.229
genetic differences so they maximize the
left examine without the data analysis

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
left examine without the data analysis
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.630
left examine without the data analysis
it really sounds and this is what

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
it really sounds and this is what
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.289
it really sounds and this is what
demands for equity also 1215 reasons

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299
demands for equity also 1215 reasons
 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.479
demands for equity also 1215 reasons
what the master equity order offices

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
what the master equity order offices
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.099
what the master equity order offices
between men and women should not be over

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109
between men and women should not be over
 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.190
between men and women should not be over
well partly because it's wrong to

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
well partly because it's wrong to
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.599
well partly because it's wrong to
overlook the journey with differences

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609
overlook the journey with differences
 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.370
overlook the journey with differences
between men upon it's not good for them

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
between men upon it's not good for them
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.860
between men upon it's not good for them
and it's not good for the women so what

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
and it's not good for the women so what
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.479
and it's not good for the women so what
are the things you see in Scandinavia

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
are the things you see in Scandinavia
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.920
are the things you see in Scandinavia
for example it is an overwhelming

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
for example it is an overwhelming
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.050
for example it is an overwhelming
preponderance of female nurses and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
preponderance of female nurses and
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.240
preponderance of female nurses and
there's an overwhelming preponderance of

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
there's an overwhelming preponderance of
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.660
there's an overwhelming preponderance of
male engineers and actually the data on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670
male engineers and actually the data on
 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.890
male engineers and actually the data on
on personality differences there's the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
on personality differences there's the
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.870
on personality differences there's the
standard traits which all continues go

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
standard traits which all continues go
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.540
standard traits which all continues go
through how to do that

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550
through how to do that
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.090
through how to do that
quickly is almost difference in trade

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100
quickly is almost difference in trade
 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.890
quickly is almost difference in trade
conscientiousness between men and women

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900
conscientiousness between men and women
 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.540
conscientiousness between men and women
if you break it down into the opspecs

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550
if you break it down into the opspecs
 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.390
if you break it down into the opspecs
women are bit more orderly than men but

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400
women are bit more orderly than men but
 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.090
women are bit more orderly than men but
there's no difference in adult business

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
there's no difference in adult business
 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
there's no difference in adult business
and then with regards to openness which

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770
and then with regards to openness which
 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.550
and then with regards to openness which
is the intelligence creativity dimension

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560
is the intelligence creativity dimension
 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.230
is the intelligence creativity dimension
overall there's no difference between

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240
overall there's no difference between
 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.760
overall there's no difference between
men and women but if you bring it up

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770
men and women but if you bring it up
 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.470
men and women but if you bring it up
into the aspects then the differences

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480
into the aspects then the differences
 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.060
into the aspects then the differences
are actually quite pronounced so what

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070
are actually quite pronounced so what
 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.250
are actually quite pronounced so what
you have is that openness to experience

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260
you have is that openness to experience
 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.740
you have is that openness to experience
is the technical truth and it's roughly

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750
is the technical truth and it's roughly
 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.390
is the technical truth and it's roughly
breaks down into something that's sort

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
breaks down into something that's sort
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.190
breaks down into something that's sort
of like Priya's creativity and instead

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200
of like Priya's creativity and instead
 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.500
of like Priya's creativity and instead
of interests versus interest in ideas

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510
of interests versus interest in ideas
 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.680
of interests versus interest in ideas
and what you see is that women are third

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
and what you see is that women are third
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.900
and what you see is that women are third
the standard deviation higher demand in

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910
the standard deviation higher demand in
 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.620
the standard deviation higher demand in
terms of creativity and aesthetic

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
terms of creativity and aesthetic
 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.570
terms of creativity and aesthetic
aesthetic for polygamy let's say and men

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580
aesthetic for polygamy let's say and men
 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.770
aesthetic for polygamy let's say and men
are month or the standard deviation

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780
are month or the standard deviation
 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.110
are month or the standard deviation
higher than women in terms of interest

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120
higher than women in terms of interest
 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.000
higher than women in terms of interest
in ideas and it's not a trivial

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010
in ideas and it's not a trivial
 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.430
in ideas and it's not a trivial
difference and it makes a difference so

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440
difference and it makes a difference so
 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.200
difference and it makes a difference so
but the biggest difference between men

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210
but the biggest difference between men
 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.900
but the biggest difference between men
and women else turns out this is almost

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910
and women else turns out this is almost
 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.370
and women else turns out this is almost
one standard deviation which is a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380
one standard deviation which is a
 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.080
one standard deviation which is a
walloping difference you never see that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090
walloping difference you never see that
 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.090
walloping difference you never see that
in social science and math the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
in social science and math the
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.699
in social science and math the
difference is on difference between

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
difference is on difference between
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.159
difference is on difference between
difference in interest and the masculine

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169
difference in interest and the masculine
 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.110
difference in interest and the masculine
interest roughly speaking is in things

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120
interest roughly speaking is in things
 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640
interest roughly speaking is in things
and then female interest roughly

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650
and then female interest roughly
 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.800
and then female interest roughly
speaking is in people and that's what

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810
speaking is in people and that's what
 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.250
speaking is in people and that's what
underlies the difference is saying in

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260
underlies the difference is saying in
 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.450
underlies the difference is saying in
interest preference between things like

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460
interest preference between things like
 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.340
interest preference between things like
nursing and psychology and social work

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350
nursing and psychology and social work
 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.960
nursing and psychology and social work
in that and that sort of thing and

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970
in that and that sort of thing and
 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.340
in that and that sort of thing and
engineering and because engineering is

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350
engineering and because engineering is

the evidence that that's sociological

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259
the evidence that that's sociological
 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.830
