SPEAKER: Winner of the 2017
Olivier Award for Best Musical,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.160
and based on the iconic
film, "Groundhog Day,"

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.830
this is the new Broadway hit
that Entertainment Weekly

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.840
calls "a wonderfully inventive
show with dazzling energy,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.952
creativity, wit, and heart."

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.910
And New York One says,
"this is a Groundhog Day

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.570
to celebrate with Danny Rubin's
wryly humorous book, Matthew

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.120
Warchus's inventive direction,
and Tim Minchin's clever songs,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.972
the forecast for this Groundhog
Day looks pretty bright."

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:34.430
Let's roll you a
little commercial,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.970
get you in the mood.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.495
[? - ?] There's a new
best musical on Broadway

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.930
that you'll want to see
again, and again, and again.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.560
The New York Times
says, "I loved it."

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.240
"It's a miracle on Broadway."

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.030
"Groundhog Day."

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:54.922
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.390
ANDY KARL: Well, that was fun.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.644
Everybody enjoy the commercial?

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:03.810
That was a short commercial.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.940
Got anything longer?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.060
I mean, hi, everybody.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.706
I'm glad you're all here.

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:12.330
We're going to sing
some songs for you.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
This first song from
the show is called--

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.720
well, it's not the
first song in the show.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.520
It actually happens
on day three,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
after Phil has repeated the
day the third time, completely

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.570
freaked out, looks for
help, can't get any.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.950
So what's the next idea?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.420
Let's get drunk and deal with
this by putting all of it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.440
in a bottle.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.330
So he goes to this bar.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.290
I play Phil Connors.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.415
I'm Andy Karl.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:39.540
RAY LEE: I'm Raymond J Lee.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.569
I play Ralph.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:41.860
JORDAN GRUBB: I'm Jordan Grubb.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.517
I play Gus.

00:01:43.517 --> 00:01:44.850
ANDY KARL: They're the barflies.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.060
JORDAN GRUBB: Yeah.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.930
RAY LEE: Yeah.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.180
JORDAN GRUBB: We're
the local yokels.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.430
RAY LEE: Yeah, so we're drunk.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.020
And he comes and
hangs out with us.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.800
It's a fun scene.

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:54.450
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.760
JORDAN GRUBB (SINGING):
I wake up hung over.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.620
I go to bed smashed.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.110
Like an alcoholic hamster on one
of them little wheelie things.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.560
Every evening the same,
every morning the pain.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.590
I start drinking at 10.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.960
Hell, by noon I'm
not feeling things.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.720
And nobody cares what
I'm talking about.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.800
RAY LEE (SINGING): Oh shit, I
just got throw up in my mouth.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.676
JORDAN GRUBB (SINGING):
Just swallow it, man.

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:26.883
RAY LEE (SINGING): I'm trying

00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:28.640
JORDAN GRUBB (SINGING):
Just swallow it.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.260
Your opinions or your vomit,
either way they're unwanted.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.360
And I think I had a point
there, but the point

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.840
is it don't matter.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.315
Because it's pointless
having points anyway.

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:49.240
Nobody cares what I say.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.982
Nobody cares what I do.

00:02:51.982 --> 00:02:54.355
And what's the
point in bothering

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:56.800
BOTH (SINGING): --if no
one else is bothered.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.685
I was born in this town.

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:00.770
And I'm going to die here too.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.470
I wake with a headache.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.680
I take a piss.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.850
I often miss.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.960
I often get a little
bit on the floor.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.845
I eat a piece of toast that I
found toasted in the toaster

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:20.740
then I go to get my jacket
by the rack by the back door.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.330
And then I get into my truck and
drive a block to Raphie's shop.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.330
It's always shut.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.810
I pick him up and drive
us up to Running Rock

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.310
and shoot some cans,
and crack some cans,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.320
and shoot the breeze about
the weather, or a sports team,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.840
or a car.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.778
And after that the bar.

00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:48.590
Nobody cares what I say.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.424
Nobody cares what I do.

00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:53.490
Yeah, what's the
point in bothering

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.170
if no one else is bothered?

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.460
I was born in this town.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.322
And I'm going to die here too.

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:03.258
ANDY KARL: Wait a minute.

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:06.240
There's no tomorrow tomorrow.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.309
We can do whatever we want!

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:11.243
BOTH (SINGING): We can
do whatever we want!

00:04:11.243 --> 00:04:12.710
ANDY KARL: I'm driving.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.688
JORDAN GRUBB: Woohoo!

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:15.644
ALL (SINGING): I
wake with a headache.

00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:16.500
I take a piss.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.209
I often miss.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.500
I often get a little
bit on the floor.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.490
I sometimes try to clean the
mess I make from my mistakes.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.406
But for who's sake am I making
all this effing effort for?

00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:31.262
I wake up each morning
in the same damn day.

00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:35.610
There seems to be jack
shit that I can do or say.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.560
I got no voice.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.510
I got no vote.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.941
I've got no way to
change a goddamn thing.

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:42.690
JORDAN GRUBB: Uh, I
think that's the pigs?

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.815
ANDY KARL: Who gives a fig?

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:50.328
ALL (SINGING): Nobody cares what
I Do Nobody cares if I'm alive.

00:04:50.328 --> 00:04:53.935
Utterly uninfluential, no
regrets, and no potential,

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:56.860
every turn inconsequential.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.160
ANDY KARL: Let's drive!

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.390
ALL (SINGING): Nobody
cares what I say.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.050
Nobody cares about my life,
utterly uninstrumental,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.934
no insurance, no intent.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.393
RAY LEE: Actually,
I've got dental.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.267
JORDAN GRUBB: Really?

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:12.190
Well, that's nice.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.038
And I'm not sure
what the point is,

00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:15.430
but the point is
it don't matter.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.240
ANDY KARL: Oh, I see him.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.220
RAY LEE: Oh, mister.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.670
ANDY KARL: I think he's
gonna swerve first.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.080
ALL (SINGING): Nobody
cares what I do.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.490
Nobody cares if I'm alive,
utterly uninfluential,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.880
no regrets, and no potential,
every turn inconsequential.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.590
ANDY KARL: Utterly
repercussion-free.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.928
JORDAN GRUBB: Though
arguably not for that tree.

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:40.856
RAY LEE: I think I
pooped my dungaree!

00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:44.272
ALL (SINGING): No
consequence at all.

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:47.511
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:48.510
ANDY KARL: Nobody cares!

00:05:51.947 --> 00:05:55.580
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
OK, I think I'm up next.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.080
My name is Rebecca Faulkenberry.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.080
I play Nancy Taylor in the show.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.210
And in one of the incarnations
of Phil's Groundhog Day,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.810
I am a one-night stand for him,
after he learns that I'm Nancy

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.380
Taylor--

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.830
Lincoln High, Mrs Walsh's
class, for any fan of the film.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.870
And so that's how you
kind of meet me in Act I.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.820
And then, surprise,
in Act II, I get

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.730
to open it with this
song, which kind of gives

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.200
you a bit more insight
into who Nancy Taylor is.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.966
So this song, I play
Nancy in the show.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:31.590
And put on your
thinking caps for this.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.624
It's called "Playing Nancy."

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:37.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.460
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY (SINGING):
Well, here I am again,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.780
the pretty but naive one,
the perky-breasted, giggly,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.540
one-night stand.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:55.560
Is it my destiny to be
a brief diversion, just

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.535
a detour on the
journey of some man?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.610
I'm not really one for asking.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.795
I'll play whatever
role I'm cast in,

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:16.960
will smile with perfect
teeth, and grimace underneath.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.410
I learned back in my teens,
there's no point in protesting.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.190
If you look good in
tight jeans, that's

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.010
what they'll want
you dressed in,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.700
once you're known
for low cut tops.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.060
It's pretty hard to stop.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:45.460
It isn't easy to break
free of playing Nancy.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.990
I don't really remember.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.510
I guess I chose to be here.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:03.830
I wasn't quite aware that I
was put here to be stared at.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:10.480
But this world I chose to
live in is mostly run by men.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.185
So you take what you are given
just to feel the love again.

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:24.171
So throughout the endless week,
and all through the weekend,

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:31.631
you will find me
here, playing Nancy.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.010
And look, I know
this person fits me.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.215
I'm pretty good at being pretty.

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:48.150
And I'm grateful, I
mean to say, there

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
are worse roles you could play.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:57.920
And I'd rather be up dancing
than sad against the wall.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.856
It's better to be leered
at than not desired at all.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.820
Who am I to dream of better?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:18.688
To dream that one day,
I will be something

00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:26.098
more than just collateral
in someone else's battle.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:34.417
I will be something
more than Nancy.

00:09:44.644 --> 00:09:47.566
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:09:51.462 --> 00:09:53.069
- Very nice, very nice.

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:54.360
BARRETT DOSS: So we're up next.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.140
I'm Barrett Doss.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.110
I play Rita Hanson in the show.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.040
So she is Phil's
associate producer, played

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.530
by Andie McDowell in the movie.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.690
And so after some time
in the second act,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.670
Phil has kind of reached
the end of his rope

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:17.700
and reveals finally to Rita
what he's been going through.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.510
And whether or not she believes
him, I guess we don't know yet.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.730
But she offers her, sort of
her interpretation of what

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:31.110
she would do if she were in the
position that he's been put in.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.020
Anything else, Andy?

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.720
ANDY KARL: That
sounded great to me.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.630
BARRETT DOSS: Oh thanks.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.540

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.010
BARRETT DOSS
(SINGING): Sometimes

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.240
it's like I'm stumbling
forward, hustled forward,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.548
jostled from behind by time.

00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:55.470
And sometimes it's like
I'm being dragged, yet

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.980
always lagging, trying to
keep in time with time.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.890
But if I could stop the
clock for just one day,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:14.060
if I could freeze a
moment for a moment,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:21.650
rest before the measure's over,
hold the beat for just one day,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.048
If I could wind
it back and start

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:29.024
afresh, just a day
to catch my breath,

00:11:29.024 --> 00:11:32.422
to make mistakes
and set them right,

00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:35.742
to lay the calming of the night.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:44.640
If I had my time again, I
would do it all the same.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.200
They say, but that's insane.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.324
Wouldn't you want to
make a couple of changes?

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:53.850
Regrets, I'd not
even have a few,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:01.270
if I could do this thing
that you say you can do.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.776
I always dreamt of
learning how to dance.

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:06.288
ANDY KARL (SINGING): Some
days I go out without pants.

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:08.038
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
It's so exciting--

00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:10.643
ANDY KARL (SINGING): I
slept with 90% of women--

00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:13.018
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): --a
new beginning every morning--

00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:14.512
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
--in Punxsutawney--

00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:15.508
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
--to have the time

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:16.504
to strive for more.

00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:19.492
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
--between 18 and 84.

00:12:19.492 --> 00:12:22.480
And one dude when I was bored.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.472
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
If I had my time

00:12:24.472 --> 00:12:29.794
again I'd take the
path less trodden,

00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:33.506
avoid the crap I trod in
and read a lot of books.

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:35.654
ANDY KARL (SINGING): I've
stolen 18 million bucks.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.570
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
And I would worry less

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.247
about my looks.

00:12:38.247 --> 00:12:40.330
ANDY KARL (SINGING): And
I guess I'll do it again.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.830
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): Next
time I would be a lot more zen.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.790
And I would punch a
lot of men If I had--

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.490
BOTH (SINGING): --my time again.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.640
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
If I had my time again,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.460
I would do it all the same.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.820
They claim that
that's ridiculous.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.654
Surely you'd want to
make a couple of fixes.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:03.140
All those boxes left
unchecked, all the

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.614
dreams you left neglected,
you'd go back and put it right.

00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:12.610
I'd always fancied
learning how to climb.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.961
ANDY KARL (SINGING): I once
masturbated seven times--

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.627
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
I'd study math--

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:17.621
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
--in the bath--

00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:19.609
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
--in search for meaning.

00:13:19.609 --> 00:13:20.603
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
--in one evening.

00:13:20.603 --> 00:13:22.094
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
And I'd run uphill.

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:23.585
ANDY KARL (SINGING): It
wasn't fun, but still--

00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:25.076
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): I'd
learn to paint, just to know--

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:27.561
ANDY KARL (SINGING): --a man
my age, it's nice to know--

00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:28.555
BOTH (SINGING): I can.

00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:31.040
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
It's nice to know I can.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.513
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
If I had my time again,

00:13:35.513 --> 00:13:39.489
I'd sample all the
samples, look at things

00:13:39.489 --> 00:13:40.980
from different angles.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:48.932
I would not do it all the
same if I had my time again.

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.960
ANDY KARL: Now an
interlude of music.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.850
There's a tilt-a-whirl on stage.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.351
It's pretty fantastic.

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:56.824
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah.

00:13:56.824 --> 00:14:02.225
ANDY KARL: Five revolves, it's
getting your money's worth.

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:04.189
BARRETT DOSS: High
tech, just like Google.

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:12.045
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
If I had my time again,

00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:17.312
the things I'd handle better,
I would send my unsent letters.

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:19.270
ANDY KARL (SINGING): I
have started 700 fights.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.550
And if you knew
the endless nights

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.550
that I have wasted getting
wasted, contemplating

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.801
different ways to suicide.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:27.134
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): I
would write, and I would ride.

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:27.730
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
And I have tried

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.190
every food, and every
trick, and every choice,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.370
and every cheat
a thousand times.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.478
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
And I would bring joy

00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:32.745
to other people's lives.

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.645
ANDY KARL (SINGING): And I
did eat about a dozen donuts

00:14:34.645 --> 00:14:36.000
and I don't know
why, and I don't know

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.615
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING):
And I would learn piano.

00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:38.656
ANDY KARL (SINGING): Why.

00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:41.746
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): And
I would make a lot of friends

00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:44.710
if I had my time.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:52.120
BOTH (SINGING): If I had my time
again, I'd open all the doors.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.358
I'd never look behind before.

00:14:54.358 --> 00:14:56.566
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): And
oh, the things I'd taste,

00:14:56.566 --> 00:14:58.048
the things I'd try.

00:14:58.048 --> 00:15:00.470
ANDY KARL (SINGING): Oh I, I
was completely dead inside.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.770
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): And
misery, I could prevent.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.511
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
But today I'm like 85%.

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:08.493
BARRETT DOSS (SINGING): And I
would make a lot of friends,

00:15:08.493 --> 00:15:12.469
if I had my time again!

00:15:12.469 --> 00:15:14.954
ANDY KARL (SINGING):
Again, I have had it.

00:15:14.954 --> 00:15:17.439
I have had my time again.

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:19.924
Again, I have had it.

00:15:19.924 --> 00:15:20.918
I've had--

00:15:20.918 --> 00:15:22.409
BOTH (SINGING): --my time again!

00:15:34.317 --> 00:15:35.900
ANDY KARL: So our
last song, don't go.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.010
BARRETT DOSS: Wait, [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.700
Q and A, Q and A, Q and
A, Q and A, Q and A.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.950
SPEAKER: Q and A, we're talking.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.970
ANDY KARL: We do a Q and
A, and then we do a song?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.761
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
We don't have a song.

00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:45.070
We might have a song.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.170
BARRETT DOSS: He's never
sung that song before.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.004
ANDY KARL: I was gonna
go a capella with it.

00:15:49.004 --> 00:15:51.169
SPEAKER: Bring your chairs
up to the red lines here,

00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:52.580
folks, spike marks.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.220
So we got visual spike marks.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.780
You've heard of
those before, yeah?

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.280
All right.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.520
BARRETT DOSS: Our floor, our
stage is covered in them,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:15:59.750
at the theater.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.680
It's like confetti.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.850
- How do you keep
them all straight?

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.680
You said five revolves.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.221
So for those who
don't know, revolves

00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:06.710
are like the turntables, the
spinning things on the stage.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.850
And I thought, I was impressed
with "Hamilton" the first time

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.990
I saw two on stage.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.951
And I was like, oh
great, "Hamilton," yeah.

00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:14.450
And--

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.630
BARRETT DOSS: What
is "Hamilton"?

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.580
- This little thing.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.540
ANDY KARL: Never heard of it.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.880
- "Hamilton" day.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.060
And, but you guys have five.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.375
So there's an outer,
and then a semi outer,

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:26.750
and then inside,
and then there's

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.270
three in the middle that
are like doing their things.

00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:34.280
There's so much I want to
talk about this, part of which

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.780
is the set design
itself, which I

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.780
want to also bring
in the guy who

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.290
wrote the original
screenplay from the movie,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.052
and the book for this
show, Danny Rubin, which

00:16:45.052 --> 00:16:46.760
should appear, boom,
on screen right now.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.995
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: Ah, magic!

00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:50.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.300
ANDY KARL: We've
actually, we've been

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.430
watching him right here
watch us the entire time.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.276
He's been singing every
song along with us.

00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:57.520
It's been the weirdest thing.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.920
BARRETT DOSS: He's been down
there drinking water and doing

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.420
all sorts--

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.614
DANNY RUBIN: I just love
hanging with you guys.

00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:04.030
BARRETT DOSS: Just
like old times.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.530
SPEAKER: It's like literal
dance interpretation

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.339
for all the lyrics.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.500
That's always fun to do.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.109
So Danny, can you speak real
quick to what the process was.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.240
How did this ever
get from your mind

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.369
onto the page in the
first place in '93,

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.069
with the late, great Harold
Ramis, you co-wrote, and then

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:25.490
now to on the Broadway stage?

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.690
How did this whole
process start?

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.166
DANNY RUBIN: Well, I was
looking for an idea for a move.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.050
I was a screenwriter.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.440
And I needed to write a movie.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.862
My agent said, you need
to write another one.

00:17:34.862 --> 00:17:35.362
I said OK.

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:38.591
And I was just
brainstorming ideas.

00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.215
And that's how I came
up with that one.

00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:41.890
And I wrote the script.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.286
And I sent it out
into the ether.

00:17:44.286 --> 00:17:45.850
And Harold Ramis found it.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.370
That's how we wound up
working together on the film.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.400
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.101
And then--

00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.351
DANNY RUBIN: You said quickly.

00:17:51.351 --> 00:17:53.806
I can tell [INAUDIBLE]
much longer.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.130
SPEAKER: No, that is great.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.650
And then, so fast forward
over almost 25 years later.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.816
First off, is anybody not
familiar with the story?

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:03.940
Everybody here knows, good.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.890
All right, phew.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.410
All right, for anybody watching
online, pause right now,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.440
go watch the movie, come back,
listen to the soundtrack.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.850
All right, how did
it get to the stage?

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.610
How did you make a
musical out of this?

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.130
DANNY RUBIN: For years and
years, really very soon

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.337
after the movie came
out, I was thinking, boy,

00:18:23.337 --> 00:18:24.670
this would make a great musical.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.650
And I'd like to do that.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.150
And so I spent many years taking
notes, meeting with people,

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.754
having ideas.

00:18:31.754 --> 00:18:32.670
I wasn't in any hurry.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.290
I was just starting
to collect things.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:39.910
It finally reached critical
mass after about 15 years.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.000
And all through that
time I was getting calls

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.003
from people in the
theater world saying,

00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:47.336
hey, I just had this great idea.

00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:49.600
Wouldn't "Groundhog Day"
make a great musical?

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.350
I said, yeah, let's
talk about it.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.890
And after years of doing that
and having never really hitting

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.310
the right people at the
right moment, Matthew Warchus

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.177
called me up and said, hey, do
you think "Groundhog Day" would

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:04.010
make a good musical?

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.020
I said, absolutely, great idea.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.080
And then introduced
me to Tim Minchin.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.864
And we were off and running.

00:19:09.864 --> 00:19:13.432
SPEAKER: So how did Tim then,
how did Tim get attached?

00:19:13.432 --> 00:19:14.890
DANNY RUBIN: Because
he and Matthew

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.364
are attached at the hip.

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:18.445
And when you get one,
you get the other.

00:19:18.445 --> 00:19:19.320
SPEAKER: Fair enough.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.732
And then for all of
you on stage now,

00:19:21.732 --> 00:19:23.440
it was originally
workshopped, of course,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.330
or not even workshopped
in one [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.960
It went up like full
production in London.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.017
Were any of you involved in
that production out there?

00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:32.600
ANDY KARL: Me.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.039
I went in as the American,
came out the American.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.705
SPEAKER: You didn't
change nationalities

00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:37.580
while you were there?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.060
ANDY KARL: No, no, no,
though London is lovely.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.330
And they really embraced
the musical there.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.140
It was very well-received there.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.020
So that was fun.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.150
And it was a
fantastic experience.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.634
We spent most of the time--

00:19:53.634 --> 00:19:54.800
I was there for five months.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.920
And most of that time
was actually figuring out

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.590
how those five revolves work.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.160
Because what Matthew
Warchus is is

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.880
sort of a mathematician who
can also give you emotions.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.950
So it's two things at
once that are happening.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.760
And the floor moves within
an inch of its life.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.810
And it's very important.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.030
It actually, it
affects our story.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.570
The way that it revolves
is kind of like a clock.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.940
So every day, rewind--

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.780
SPEAKER: Symbolism.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.342
ANDY KARL: --every
day moves forward.

00:20:24.342 --> 00:20:26.050
And when the end of
the show, it changes.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.640
And then every revolve
revolves alone of itself.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.350
So it tells stories.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.090
And it makes it very cinematic.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.580
And it's a beautiful
show to watch.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.330
But that took a lot
of time to figure out,

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.480
and also just making sure
that the scenes worked out

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.330
the way they did.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.400
I think they discovered
a lot of things there.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.830
And then we came here.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.330
And with this incredible cast,
refined it even more to really

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.090
sort of eliminate
the things you don't

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.532
need with a show, which
is what you find out

00:20:54.532 --> 00:20:55.490
as you're doing a show.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.300
It's like, you know what?

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.008
We don't need it.

00:20:57.008 --> 00:20:59.410
We're telling that with
movement or whatever.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.850
But the show moves fast.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.040
But it's also tells
an incredible journey

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.760
within those 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.343
SPEAKER: And then
for the rest of you,

00:21:06.343 --> 00:21:09.550
how did you get attached
to the New York production?

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.220
BARRETT DOSS: Auditioned.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:18.280
I mean, I had auditioned
prior to it moving to London,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.720
but I had to put that--

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.540
sadly, even I couldn't continue
with my audition process

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.700
because I got a different
job, which was very fun.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.562
But you know, but I
just cross my fingers

00:21:26.562 --> 00:21:28.270
and hoped that it
would come back around.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.100
And it ultimately did.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.900
And I went back and
auditioned again.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.150
SPEAKER: Back around.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.443
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah, right?

00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:34.740
SPEAKER: Symbolism.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.000
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah,
and I auditioned again.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.630
And this time, it
actually all worked out,

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.980
which was really great.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.980
Andy forgot to say he also left
London and then came back here

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.630
and won an Olivier
Award afterwards

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.450
for this role, which is
amazing, along with the show.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.020
So yeah, yeah.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.230
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.370
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Yes, same with auditions.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.510
They did have round of auditions
in May, April, May of last year

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.250
before they did the production
in London, and had some offers.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.855
But that's always loose in
this business, as far as,

00:22:07.855 --> 00:22:10.230
it's an offer, but is the show
actually going to come in?

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.430
And are they going
to change the parts

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.085
so that in four or
five months' time,

00:22:13.085 --> 00:22:14.460
it's not what you
auditioned for,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.376
so you don't actually
have that offer anymore?

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:20.337
So I got my, quote,
unquote, offer in May,

00:22:20.337 --> 00:22:22.170
and then waited until,
I think it's probably

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.650
in October, November to
get an official offer.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.150
But for those months
I was like, OK,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.040
it did really well in London, so
that has good potential for it.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.270
OK, it's changed producers.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.240
Oh, but they still
have the money.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.250
So OK, it's happening.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:33.374
OK, do they have a theater?

00:22:33.374 --> 00:22:34.380
OK, they have a theater.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.500
OK, I haven't got an
official offer, though.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.300
They're doing re-auditions.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.674
But they didn't
audition my part.

00:22:37.674 --> 00:22:40.160
OK, so, and you kind of go
through all these actor things,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.020
but so yeah.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.750
JORDAN GRUBB: I feel like I
was one of the last people

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.320
to join the company because
I had friends auditioning

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.810
all summer, and like in
May and stuff like that.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.460
And I was out of town.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.390
And I couldn't get in.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.860
And I just thought,
oh man, I would

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.480
love to be a part of this show.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.280
I mean, I loved the
movie growing up.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.400
And I had heard it was
amazing over in London.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.739
So then I had resigned
myself, like, I wasn't going

00:23:04.739 --> 00:23:06.030
to have any work in the winter.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.488
Because usually all that stuff
auditions in the late summer

00:23:08.488 --> 00:23:09.150
and the fall.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.480
And then November rolled
around and like a thing

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.190
for my track opened up.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.010
And I was lucky.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.180
And like, by January
was starting rehearsals.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.930
But that just shows
you how quickly things

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.660
can change in our business.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.470
ANDY KARL: And I got
to say, I mean we had--

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.240
he's one of our swings,
which is a task in itself,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.760
because as I said, this is
a very complicated show.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.590
Everything is timed out.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.260
The characters
are very specific.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.250
I think you had to cover
three roles in the same show

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.830
the other day, where he
was like the Sheriff,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.970
but also Buster
combined, and then

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.470
throwing like shirts on me,
and doing all these things

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.080
that only like five
humans usually do.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.450
And to this show,
it's such a credit

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.670
to have you here with
the show, just watching

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.520
what you did the other day.
and also appearing here today,

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.830
in place of some
of our other cast.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.870
So it's fantastic.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:07.980
We need you.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.850
Thank you.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.559
Thank you for auditioning
and being here.

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.558
JORDAN GRUBB: Thank you.

00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:13.620
I definitely have gotten
like 500 more gray hairs

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.090
a week from it.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.624
But I'm happily going gray.

00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:17.290
I love the show.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:17.910
RAY LEE: What's
happened too, where

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.290
like he's in costume for one
character and you're like,

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.590
lalala, it's going
to start, half hour.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.457
Places, actually
something happened.

00:24:24.457 --> 00:24:26.040
You've got to get
to this costume now.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.956
We're going to hold the
show for five minutes.

00:24:27.956 --> 00:24:30.060
He's in a whole other
costume, switching gears

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.350
and doing his other track.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.780
And this show is tricky
because you're always

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.660
constantly moving,
because the floor moves,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.220
your spike marks move.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.900
So you're just like hunting
for stuff on the floor.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.870
It's incredible what
our wonderful swings do.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.112
SPEAKER: And Ray,
how did you get it?

00:24:46.112 --> 00:24:47.570
RAY LEE: I was the
same with Becca.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.770
I auditioned at the
same time as her.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.040
They actually were like, OK,
you can go for Ralph or Gus.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.030
Which part do you
want to go in for?

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:55.905
I said, I need a job.

00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:57.821
So I'm going to try and
go for the tenor part.

00:24:57.821 --> 00:24:59.970
Because everyone's going
to go for the lower track.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:05.060
Went in, squeezed my balls, sang
those high notes in the room.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.435
And then I found out I
got like a soft offer.

00:25:07.435 --> 00:25:09.060
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Yeah, soft offer.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.893
RAY LEE: Soft offer.

00:25:09.893 --> 00:25:11.840
SPEAKER: A softer,
you got a softer.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.675
RAY LEE: And like with Becca,
I was doing another gig

00:25:14.675 --> 00:25:16.960
so I was out of town, but
constantly was on Twitter,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.760
on message boards.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.110
Like, people like the show.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.210
People like the show, OK great.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.450
You're trying to find
like clips online.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.650
And then I got the
official offer in November.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.424
And here I am.

00:25:27.424 --> 00:25:30.090
SPEAKER: So I want to go back to
the costumes for a second, too.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.940
Because Ray, you are not only
this character, this redneck

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.580
character, Ralph,
but you are Phil,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.750
but you are Phil,
Phil the Groundhog.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.300
So yeah, this giant--

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.940
that suit came from London.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.814
RAY LEE: Yes, it did.

00:25:45.814 --> 00:25:47.190
SPEAKER: It was made in London.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.320
What is that like
wearing that groundhog,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.220
in and out with the costume
changes too, because,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.060
and it's hot and cumbersome.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.990
RAY LEE: It is hot.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.140
You can't really see.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.410
But oh my gosh, I've
got my show body back.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.619
I'm looking good this summer.

00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:01.201
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Sweating it out.

00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:02.810
RAY LEE: Sweating it out.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.200
Do not burp in that costume
because it's disgusting.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.256
You'll hotbox yourself.

00:26:06.256 --> 00:26:08.130
BARRETT DOSS: How many
costume changes do you

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:08.770
have in the show, Ray?

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.103
RAY LEE: I have the second most.

00:26:10.103 --> 00:26:11.320
I have 25 costume changes.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.110
SPEAKER: Whoa.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.050
RAY LEE: And Travis, who plays
Jeff in our cast, has 29.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.500
He has the most.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.297
SPEAKER: Because you're reliving
the same moments in the show

00:26:19.297 --> 00:26:20.130
over and over again.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.504
Danny, are you
allowed to tell us

00:26:21.504 --> 00:26:24.280
how many times the day
repeats in the show?

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.596
There's like conspiracy
theories about how many it is.

00:26:26.596 --> 00:26:28.470
There's no definite
answer that I could find.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.219
DANNY RUBIN: I had to
sign something where

00:26:30.219 --> 00:26:34.376
I'm not allowed to disclose.

00:26:34.376 --> 00:26:37.470
The truth is, in my mind
it doesn't really matter.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.200
It was just an
awful lot of days.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.725
And I wouldn't want to end the
internet parlor game, in trying

00:26:44.725 --> 00:26:46.770
to count how many it would be.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.930
SPEAKER: So more than
10, less than 100.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.160
We'll just leave it
about right there.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.660
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
More than 100.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.618
SPEAKER: More than 100?

00:26:53.618 --> 00:26:54.270
You think so?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:54.500
Wow.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.040
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: I think
people go into like, how long

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.248
does it take to learn French?

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:58.800
How long does it
take to learn piano?

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.300
How long?

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.170
And people go-- that's, I think,
where all the conspiracies come

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:02.370
because--

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.760
SPEAKER: Well, because there's
like montages within montages.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:04.970
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: Yeah.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.140
SPEAKER: Yeah, so showing
that time has passed.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.020
Yes, that is, yeah,
it's incredible.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.730
And so all of you are not
only doing 100-plus days

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.790
in the same show, you're also
doing the same show eight times

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.810
a week.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.340
Do you ever get tired?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.696
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:27:21.696 --> 00:27:23.550
ANDY KARL: Tired right now.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.800
What the hell am I doing here?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.924
It's 1:30 in the afternoon.

00:27:25.924 --> 00:27:27.321
I should be sleeping.

00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:29.320
SPEAKER: How do you deal
with fatigue like that?

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.200
How do you keep it fresh, I
guess, within the same show,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.840
literally, when you're doing
the same scene over and over?

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.840
ANDY KARL: I mean, everybody
in the show moves constantly.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.650
There's not, it's
really an ensemble show.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.040
I'm out there talking and
carrying some of the stories

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.260
along with some of
the text and stuff.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.270
But everybody is
telling the same story

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.395
because we're repeating
and all that kind of stuff.

00:27:50.395 --> 00:27:52.830
So we're all exhausted.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.220
But it's such a great journey.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.310
Every single night, people
are on their feet cheering

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:05.100
this show on because not
only is it hilarious,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.470
it also goes very dark.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.380
It goes very deep.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.760
It goes into the heart.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.700
And when you touch
people there, then

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.210
it becomes effected in a
way that you can't really

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.210
describe to somebody other than
just standing up and saying,

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.510
yes, that's the emotion.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.750
But I think that's
what gets us through.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.407
And also, I think
we love what we do.

00:28:25.407 --> 00:28:27.240
BARRETT DOSS: And we
enjoy working together.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.340
I think that's something
that's really come out

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.830
of all of the really,
really hard work

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.770
that our incredible ensemble
has done, and Andy's done.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.279
And it's really
a group of people

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.570
that has learned to love each
other through some really

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.190
difficult challenges.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.100
We've come up against
some stuff with this show.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.890
And it's really been an
amazing journey so far.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.270
But just as far
as our show goes,

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.960
it's also an interesting, for
everyone other than Andy who

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.360
gets to move sort
of chronologically

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.420
through this repeated day,
sort of chronologically

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.150
through this repeated day, his
journey sort of goes A to Z.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.077
And the rest of us,
I think, the way

00:29:02.077 --> 00:29:03.660
I look at it, anyway,
for my character

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.160
is, I get to sort of--

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.680
my journey goes AB,
ABC, ABCD, ABC--

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.780
And so I get to sort of
reveal more about my character

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.440
to the audience through the
show, but in a different,

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.500
sort of a different way.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.625
So you get to watch two
different ways of following

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:23.784
the same, or many different
ways of tracking the same story.

00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:25.200
RAY LEE: And for
the ensemble too,

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.850
each day starts
off very similarly.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.006
But there's also these little
differences, with choreography,

00:29:31.006 --> 00:29:32.130
and harmonies, and rhythms.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.410
And so they'll be like
the second repeated day,

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.660
I'll be on stage, being
like, Becca, what day is it?

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.520
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: I
did that to you yesterday.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.220
I was like, where am I?

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:38.485
Where am I?

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:38.750
Where am I?

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.040
What day?

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.160
Day two.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.690
RAY LEE: It's day two.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.870
It's day two, go now.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.010
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.370
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: Well,
the show is exhausting.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.870
Like, I find in a
show, or the ones

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.730
that I've done before,
a lot of the time

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.890
it's really tiring at first
because it's very new to you.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.300
And then your body kind
of gets used to it.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.591
And your brain gets used to it.

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:54.107
So your energy
kind of comes back

00:29:54.107 --> 00:29:55.440
during the day and other things.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.332
I'm still so tired on this one.

00:29:57.332 --> 00:29:58.290
It's an exhausting one.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.770
And then also just not wanting
to embarrass yourself on stage

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.840
makes you just not be tired.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.840
Because if you're tired and
you lose it for a second,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.310
you will end up in
the wrong place.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.530
And you'll get hit
by a person, and then

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.450
a set piece, then
you'll be on stage going

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.837
ah, which I've done like twice.

00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:13.545
So it forces you.

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.628
JORDAN GRUBB: And what I
was going to say is like,

00:30:15.628 --> 00:30:20.480
I, swinging the show,
I cover 11 guys.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.260
So, and I've been on for,
well, after next week,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.710
I'm going on for you,
that'll be my eighth.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.190
So I have to say, this
is the kind of show

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.320
that you can't just go on for
someone and think, oh, well,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.990
this is my easy track.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.690
Like, every single
person is in scene work.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.380
Every single person is an
intricate, fully fleshed-out

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.999
character in that
town, which is why

00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:43.290
I think the show is so special.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.370
Because there's no
one on stage just

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.740
like dancing and doing
wings in the background.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.240
It's like it's a--

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.605
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
That's a tap step.

00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:49.560
JORDAN GRUBB:
--vibrant community

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.000
of all these
different characters.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.470
And that's the
cool thing, which I

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.389
hope you come see it
if you haven't seen it.

00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:55.680
You'll see every single person.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.190
It's so specific
and individualized.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.650
So that keeps me on my toes,
because I'm like someone

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.030
different every night.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.760
But yeah.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.910
BARRETT DOSS: And some
of our more fervent fans

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.220
will notice if you
miss something.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.624
It's like, oh, god,
they caught me.

00:31:12.624 --> 00:31:14.790
SPEAKER: Andy and Barrett,
obviously the both of you

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.248
have some pretty
big shoes to fill,

00:31:16.248 --> 00:31:18.330
in terms of the maybe
preconceived notions

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.660
that people have when
they come see the show,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.562
with Bill Murray
and Andie McDowell.

00:31:24.562 --> 00:31:26.520
When you two are filling
this role, when you're

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.228
creating your own
character on the stage,

00:31:28.228 --> 00:31:31.075
did anything that already
existed in the movie

00:31:31.075 --> 00:31:31.950
influence you at all?

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.840
Or did you start, either
of you start totally fresh?

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.650
ANDY KARL: The
movie is hilarious.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.090
You're welcome, Danny.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.920
But it's also just, like,
I've seen it a million times.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.640
And I'm sure many of
you here have as well.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.300
I think, and when
I first heard they

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.240
were doing a musical of it,
I was like, oh, come on man.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.920
You're not going to
be able to top that.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.800
Then I heard the people
that were creating,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.180
including Danny, who's
the original screenwriter.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.600
And then Tim Minchin and Matthew
Warchus, who did "Matilda."

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.870
So that's a really sort of
interesting couple of guys

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.940
who are gonna, they're
all going to be thinking.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.300
They're all thinking either
outside, inside the box,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.890
around the box, making a box,
thinking that it's going to be.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.480
And so that attracted
me immediately.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.280
I was like, OK, so,
I'll look at the script.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.140
And if it's just going to be
the movie, I can't really.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.125
I'll just be like, fine, but
it's not going to be my role.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.500
There's could be
a million people

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.720
who are going be better
than me at doing that.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.370
But it's its own beast.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:37.350
And that's what's really
great for us is that it's--

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:41.420
the journey of Phil
Connors is epic,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.100
one of the more epic roles
written in musical theater,

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.095
I find.

00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:48.990
And that's so attractive
because you get to relay so much

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.240
of yourself within a show.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.570
And there's so much to
pull from and use on stage.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.040
And I just love what they've
done with Rita as well.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.520
They've expanded her presence.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.450
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah, I think they
did a wonderful, wonderful job

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.360
with the female
roles in this show.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.120
We get to, we get to
have a voice in a way

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.900
that, I think, in the movie, you
don't get the benefit of what's

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.320
happening in Rita's
head while she's

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.210
watching him go through
whatever he's going through.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.250
She's not privy to it.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.080
So getting sort of
an inside picture,

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.930
I have a very long
extended song and scene

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:33.450
sequence with Andy called, "One
Day," where you really get to,

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.610
you get an inside shot of what's
going on with her emotionally.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:43.020
And it provides a
really great base

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.990
to work from for the
rest of the show.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.760
And Andie McDowell is wonderful.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.410
But I really love being--

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.990
I don't think of
my character Rita

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.242
as the same as her
character Rita at all.

00:33:54.242 --> 00:33:55.450
And she came to see the show.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.300
And I don't think she
felt that way either.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.180
I think we were able to
sort of separate ourselves

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.540
because it became a different
character in some ways,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.429
when Tim and Danny
expanded her inner life.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.384
ANDY KARL: I haven't
seen Bill at the show.

00:34:10.384 --> 00:34:11.550
SPEAKER: I was going to ask.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.190
ANDY KARL: If he's Googling
right now, please come see.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.209
Come on, man.

00:34:15.209 --> 00:34:17.310
BARRETT DOSS: I sort of
hope he's like snuck in,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.250
and like he's going to end up
on stage one day, accidentally,

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.144
like wearing the Groundhog
suit or something.

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:24.060
He just like walks in.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.630
ANDY KARL: It's
gonna be fantastic.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.639
But that's, but also I
think he and the writers

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.530
of the original movie
brought the funny.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.409
And the funny is
still in this show.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.062
I find it goes even
funnier because what you're

00:34:37.062 --> 00:34:39.270
watching on stage, how are
they going to make the day

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.340
repeat without it being corny?

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.170
It's all about, it's slick.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.400
And it's funny.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.610
And it's intros to new
days, which become--

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.300
which is interesting.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.215
The audience is ahead and
knows what's happening.

00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:53.340
The day is going to repeat.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.770
But they're never
ahead of how we're

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.210
going to do it, which
I find beautiful.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.870
Like I don't know how you
guys wrote that and made

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.940
that happen.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.510
But it's knock 'em down,
like really funny first act.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.260
Second act goes a little dark,
because he's living that day

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.400
over and over again.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.570
Where do you go from there?

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.850
They've explored
that territory of how

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:19.372
someone deals with reliving this
same day over and over again.

00:35:19.372 --> 00:35:21.080
Because it can be fun
for a little while.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.831
And then it gets to be a drag.

00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:23.830
And then what do you do?

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.840
And then how is he
going to snap out of it?

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.870
And luckily Rita is
there to give him

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:31.480
another way to look at things.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.400
SPEAKER: Talking
about that a second,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.880
I wanted to ask all
of you what you all

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.310
thought the actual
interpretation of the show,

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.720
what it all represents?

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.650
I was reading online.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.590
There were so many,
again, theories.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.930
And hopefully Danny
will, if he's allowed to,

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.150
depending on what he's
signed, could tell us

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.560
what it actually means.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.390
My, I mean, is it purgatory?

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.590
Are you Jesus?

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.365
Is this something
happening with--

00:35:55.365 --> 00:35:56.990
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Jesus, that's it.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.270
SPEAKER: Yeah, just Jesus.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.950
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
You guessed it.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.360
SPEAKER: Like what's going on?

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.252
Anybody, tell me what you think?

00:36:03.252 --> 00:36:04.885
ANDY KARL: I want
to hear that guy.

00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:05.510
SPEAKER: Danny?

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.498
DANNY RUBIN: [LAUGHTER]
Yeah, the groundhog is Jesus.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.690
I think that the story
speaks for itself.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.210
In a way, I don't have to
explain any of the themes,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.410
because everybody comes to
the show with themselves.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.477
And it connects in some way.

00:36:24.477 --> 00:36:26.185
Everybody has a
different interpretation.

00:36:26.185 --> 00:36:29.550
And every single one seems
stronger than the last.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.310
I have no reason to
define it differently.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.630
It's a very big--

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.750
it's just the story of this
person going through this epic

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.090
life all in one day.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.256
And I think we all relate to
it within our own language,

00:36:41.256 --> 00:36:43.380
so whether it's from a
philosophical point of view,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.100
or a religious point of view,
or just a humanistic view.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.929
It is something
that we all share.

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:50.720
SPEAKER: Well said.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.220
All right.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.550
That was a vague an
answer as I expected, yes.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.542
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.542 --> 00:36:56.957
DANNY RUBIN: I'm a pro, man.

00:36:56.957 --> 00:36:58.790
SPEAKER: Actually that
wasn't the first time

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:59.930
you've been asked.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.000
We have a mic in the
middle of the room here.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.650
If anybody has
questions for Danny

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.140
or the cast here on
stage, please line up

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.537
and ask those questions, or
get ready to ask questions.

00:37:09.537 --> 00:37:11.120
For-- you were going
to say something?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:11.995
ANDY KARL: Or a song.

00:37:11.995 --> 00:37:15.290
SPEAKER: Or a song, if
you want to sing, yeah.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.740
Give your track to the
techs in the back and yeah.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.751
I want to talk quickly--

00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:21.500
something, Barrett,
you said a second ago,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.120
about that women have a
voice in this, more than,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.070
more so in the movie.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:29.570
And that touches
on, like the first--

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.436
I talked to a friend
before I saw the show.

00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:32.060
And she saw it.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.980
She was like, I don't
know if I really like it

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.900
because it was so sexist.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.700
And then I talked to her
again after I saw it.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.900
And she said, you know, the
more I thought about it,

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.580
the more like Phil, he
just redeems himself.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.140
You go from one
extreme to the other.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.570
And then on top of
all of that, there's

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.200
this new character of Nancy
that didn't exist in the movie.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.780
Like, I guess, Danny, what
was the point of putting,

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.220
why did you put Nancy
into this version?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.880
DANNY RUBIN: Well, Nancy
was in the movie, of course.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.490
We just expanded her, giving
her a voice, a point of view.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:14.270
I think we were trying
to get the audience

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.770
to go on Phil's journey.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.385
And by-- we think we've
taken the measure of how

00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:22.860
Phil is going to
progress, and how

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.550
the show is going to progress.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.520
And right at the beginning
of Act II we do a full stop

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.200
and say, oh, you know what?

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.650
You were just like Phil.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.560
You were assuming you
understood everything

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.020
about this character.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.070
And you knew what she was about.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.165
And we're going to
show you that you

00:38:39.165 --> 00:38:41.810
can look at her as a
real person now, not just

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.718
as a prop in Phil's story.

00:38:43.718 --> 00:38:45.485
And we get that from her.

00:38:45.485 --> 00:38:46.985
And you hear the
whole audience sort

00:38:46.985 --> 00:38:50.475
of feeling this collective
guilt, like yeah,

00:38:50.475 --> 00:38:51.820
I kind of ignored her.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.800
I forgot she was a person too.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.695
And it has a big emotional
impact in driving you

00:38:57.695 --> 00:38:58.528
into the second act.

00:38:58.528 --> 00:39:00.020
That's what that was about.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.920
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
There's this wonderful--

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.980
just going with that, with the
audience kind of feeling this

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.409
guilt of like, oh, I didn't--

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.200
why is she singing?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:06.740
And we don't need her.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.720
And then you hear the point
of the song, of saying,

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.400
you didn't look at me as
anything more than this.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.440
And they go, oh, well,
that's what I was thinking.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.160
That's the whole point
of why the song is there.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.110
But there's this beautiful
like, douche trap,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.160
I like to call it, in the first,
like, two lines of the songs,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.870
when occasionally, on a
rowdy audience, because like,

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.870
well, here I am again,
the pretty but naive one,

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.560
the perky-breasted,
giggly, one night stand.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.210
[? SPEAKER: ?] Yeah!

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:27.320
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
I guess the word breast

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.130
is very exciting for people.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.020
And so sometimes a
dude or something

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.132
will be like, yeah, or woohoo!

00:39:33.132 --> 00:39:35.034
I'm like, cool,
just wait a second.

00:39:35.034 --> 00:39:36.450
You're going to
feel, you're going

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.890
to feel really bad about that.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.960
SPEAKER: And so it's, the song
is called, "Playing Nancy."

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.120
You're singing it as Nancy.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.400
But Rebecca is singing.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.604
Who is, who, is
mouthing these words?

00:39:49.604 --> 00:39:51.020
Where are these
words coming from?

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.890
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
You know that when

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.630
you were asking about how
many days are in the show,

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.052
and Danny was saying it's
really open to interpretation.

00:39:56.052 --> 00:39:58.010
I think this show is so
open to interpretation.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.843
I think that's what's
so great about theater

00:39:59.843 --> 00:40:02.060
and art in general, is that
like you'll read a book,

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.860
or read something, and you
go, this is what it was about.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.000
And the metaphors,
and someone else

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.705
will get something
completely different.

00:40:06.705 --> 00:40:09.080
And I had someone at stage
door the other day, he's like,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.550
see what you were doing there.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:11.170
I got it.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.030
I was like, did you?

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.330
What was I doing?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.450
He's like, because,
you're Nancy singing it.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.500
But it's really Rebecca.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.490
You're singing it.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.190
And oddly enough, in
my performance of it,

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.860
I have never done it
as myself, because just

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.464
as an actor, that would
feel very bizarre for me.

00:40:27.464 --> 00:40:29.630
I mean, it's bizarre enough
to break the fourth wall

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.910
and talk directly to
the audience in a show.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.500
But I can do that as Nancy.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.140
If I turned around as Nancy
and then was like, hey guys,

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:36.650
what's up?

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.191
It's like, Rebecca
Faulkenberry here.

00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:40.790
I'm going to tell you my
story, which is not my own.

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.429
I mean, I can
certainly, very much

00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:43.970
relate to this song
in a lot of ways.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.230
But it's not my own words.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:46.170
It's not my own story.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.330
So I can't do it as myself.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.371
I have to still do
it as the character,

00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:51.620
even though I totally see
that interpretation of being

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.140
able to do it as
the actor and how

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.550
it could relate to an actor.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.740
But I've never
done it as myself.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.410
But a lot of people will,
yeah, a lot of people

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.045
will see and be like,
you were doing yourself.

00:41:03.045 --> 00:41:06.870
I'm like, no, but I'm glad that
that meant something to you.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.300
RAY LEE: And how many
times do you like,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.740
people expect to
be a certain way,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.530
or expect you to be this person,
and you play along to it.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.890
You know what I mean?

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.960
How many times do you
go home and just kind of

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.800
want to be yourself?

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.500
But you don't have the
people that you can really

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.120
be that with.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.260
So I love that song.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.067
I think it calls out, I
don't know, just people.

00:41:23.067 --> 00:41:24.650
BARRETT DOSS: But
I'd also like to add

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.350
that I think the female
characters in the show have

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:32.180
what I find, personally,
often lacking

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.770
in female roles in
musical theater--

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.410
that there's an incredible
amount of self-awareness.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.180
So when she is sort
of breaking down

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.350
her own experience
of her life, or Rita,

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.960
I get to do that in
"One Day," primarily,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.890
and also in "If I had my
Time Again" in a lot of ways,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.950
it feels less about how people
are-- well, in your case,

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.600
it's how people are
experiencing you,

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.570
but how you get to react to that
and process that information.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.730
And for me, in "One
Day," it feels very much

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:03.800
like I get to comment on
my experience of men--

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.320
or of relationships,
rather, not even just men,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.290
but of relationships
as my character,

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.530
as opposed to how they feel
about me, which I don't think

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.770
gets to happen that often.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:18.500
So there's what feels
very real about it,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.230
and what I identify with, as
far as Rita and Nancy goes,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.250
is that we all have this
inner life as human beings.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.440
And sometimes it feels
good to just let that

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.220
out and share that with people.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.760
And it often feels like,
in musical theater,

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.090
women get flattened, become
very two-dimensional.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.761
SPEAKER: A question here.

00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:39.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
first, I want to say

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.551
thank you very much for coming.

00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:41.280
I love the show.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.239
It's really great.

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.660
[? BARRETT DOSS: ?] Thank you!

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.394
AUDIENCE: My question, I guess
it's maybe for Andy, London

00:42:46.394 --> 00:42:48.560
versus New York, did you
find there were differences

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.310
in terms of like what
the audience wanted,

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.040
what the audience expects?

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.440
ANDY KARL: The reaction
was actually very similar,

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.760
which I found interesting.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.770
I was told that
audiences in London

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:03.990
don't stand up at the end,
or they're very, very nice.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.730
But they went bananas for it,
which I was like, all right,

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:07.550
man!

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.490
International success!

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:15.590
I think because it's
so, like Danny said,

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.350
it tells such a human story
that everyone can relate to,

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.630
it's like, it singles
out every single body,

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.360
every single person in the show.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.570
And they see it for
how they interpret it.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:30.052
And it's so effective that way.

00:43:30.052 --> 00:43:32.260
And I think that's what's
so important about the show

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.340
and how it makes London
very similar to here.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:42.140
There was no cross-continental
divide about have they

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.660
seen the movie or not.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.190
And I see a lot of people here
who haven't seen the movie.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.523
And they come to the stage door.

00:43:47.523 --> 00:43:49.370
And they're just blown
away by the story.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.690
And I think it
works well, so far.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.920
I don't know about Australia.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.900
I don't know about Germany.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.108
But who knows, maybe
it'll work there.

00:43:59.108 --> 00:44:00.980
BARRETT DOSS: I think
Tim's from Australia.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.391
SPEAKER: Next question.

00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:04.890
AUDIENCE: I'd also like to say
thank you so much for coming.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.710
I love the show.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.130
My question is, my
sister's in ninth grade.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.150
And her dream is to be
on stage professionally.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:19.200
Do you have any advice for
someone in that position?

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.110
BARRETT DOSS: I've said
this a few times recently.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.180
It's really, I don't
know if she's a singer,

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.471
or if she's interested in
musical theater specifically,

00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:32.051
but when I've met younger people
at the stage door, I'm always--

00:44:32.051 --> 00:44:33.300
who are into musical theater--

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.730
I always say, please
don't forget your acting.

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:37.140
Do not forget your acting.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.880
It's like incredibly important.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.232
I think it's easy to
forget when you get a lot--

00:44:43.232 --> 00:44:44.940
this going to sound
really shady, but I'm

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.940
going to say it anyway--

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.900
a lot of like pop stars
who come in to [? show, ?]

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:54.300
it like it's really easy to miss
out on telling real stories,

00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.330
and understanding how to
recreate basic human emotion,

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.490
in place of riffing
and doing all of that,

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.780
all those vocal gymnastics.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.440
But acting is so important.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.260
And that's something
that I would

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.860
encourage her to keep in mind.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.390
SPEAKER: Anybody else?

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.470
JORDAN GRUBB: I'd say
embrace what you do,

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.740
what you think is
better than anybody.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.540
Because in this industry,
I feel like there

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.370
has to be something
that makes you special.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.786
Because there's
so many people who

00:45:24.786 --> 00:45:26.527
can act, and sing, and dance.

00:45:26.527 --> 00:45:28.110
But there has to be
something that you

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.510
do in particular that
you bring to the table

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.620
that nobody else does.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.840
And I think in my first
few years of living here,

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.040
I kind of had a
crisis of confidence,

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.020
and a crisis of self, and tried
to be this person I wasn't.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.900
And the minute I started
embracing my individuality,

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.720
and saw what I did that was
different than everybody

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.630
else, that's when the
jobs started coming.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.930
Because I think the
authenticity, in our business,

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.860
is important.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.944
And I think it stands out.

00:45:53.944 --> 00:45:55.609
RAY LEE: Like,
piggybacking off of that,

00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:56.880
don't let anyone box you in.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.140
If I had listened
to the people that

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.610
wanted to box me to a type,
with the certain types of shows

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.849
I could have done, I wouldn't
be on the stage right now.

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:06.640
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Yeah, going with all,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.940
I mean, it's a hard business.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.970
Everyone knows that.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.350
I remember when
I was auditioning

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.309
for colleges and stuff.

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:13.891
You go into every
room and they always

00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:16.270
say, if there's anything else
you love, anything else you

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:17.620
can think of doing, go do that.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.300
I'm like, that is so uninspired.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.709
Why would you say that
to a group of artists?

00:46:21.709 --> 00:46:23.500
And it wasn't until I
got into the business

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.180
I was like, oh, that's
why they say it.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.196
Because truly, it's a very
difficult thing to do.

00:46:28.196 --> 00:46:30.320
And I even when my sister
was starting, I was like,

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.530
can you see yourself
auditioning, not booking

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.260
one job, and waitressing
for at least two years

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.880
and having nothing
out of college?

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.540
Can you do that and still
enjoy that and think,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.220
but for the possibility that
after two years or maybe longer

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.136
I could get something?

00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:45.070
Because people go,
yeah, I could do that.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.000
But that won't be me.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.999
Because I'm going to book
something as soon as I

00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:48.520
audition.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.800
And you really have to go
through those scenarios.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.320
And if after you think of all
that stuff, you still love it

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.510
and you can't see yourself
doing anything else,

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.370
then you just figure
out who you are.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.160
You embrace what you do,
learning how to act, especially

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.060
for musical theater.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.260
And you just have to like go.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.490
And yeah.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.382
SPEAKER: Very good.

00:47:06.382 --> 00:47:07.090
ANDY KARL: Do it.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:07.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.631
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:11.920
Danny-- oh, one more question?

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.609
Yes, sorry.

00:47:12.609 --> 00:47:13.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.630
I saw the show a few weeks ago.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:16.780
It was really great.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.315
One of my favorite
sequences was the sequence

00:47:19.315 --> 00:47:21.940
at the beginning of Act II, when
you're trying to kill yourself

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.023
a bunch of different ways.

00:47:23.023 --> 00:47:24.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.470
If you see it, it's amazing.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.847
So I was just wondering if
you could reveal a little bit

00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:29.680
about how you do it.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.600
Because you climb
up a ladder, and you

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.750
appeared downstage
like two seconds later.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.291
[? BARRETT DOSS: ?]
Reveal the magic?

00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:37.720
ANDY KARL: Yeah, can't
reveal the magic.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:43.570
But it is a great number that
took a long time to figure out.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.110
And it's funny because it's
like, one of the harder songs

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.970
I do in this show,
but I'm constantly

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.580
crawling, and
jumping out of bed,

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.300
and I'm appearing on one
stage, and then appearing

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.650
on another side of the stage.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.420
Because it's a day that
happens really quickly.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.920
And it happens every
time I kill myself.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:09.077
And then I wake up in bed
again, alive, to my sadness.

00:48:09.077 --> 00:48:09.910
It's just beautiful.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.050
And Paul Kieve, who is another
person we should talk about,

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:19.450
he is our magician for
the show, illusionist.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.910
He figured out a
lot of stagecraft,

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.560
and staged distraction.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.160
And it's fun.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.770
And you would think that a
suicide number is not funny.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.500
It actually is
pretty damn funny.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.160
And the song is called "Hope."

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.100
So is that an
oxymoron, I believe?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.130
And that's Tim
Minchin's brain at work.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.040
And then the way they staged it,
Matthew Warchus, and how big it

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.230
is, and horrible it is.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.630
And then you have to go--
that's what's really great

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.160
about it is that,
going through that

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.670
is really funny and horrible,
and then coming out of that,

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.010
realizing that that's
not the answer.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:00.250
On to the next
day, what do I do?

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.410
But I'm glad you
liked that number.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.576
RAY LEE: And that was one
of the first numbers, too,

00:49:04.576 --> 00:49:06.281
I think we learned it.

00:49:06.281 --> 00:49:07.780
And Andy was always
like, just wait.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.150
Like, wait, like this got
such a reaction in London.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.940
And we're like OK.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.010
And then once we
started performing,

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.010
it was so cool to see the
audience kind of freak

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.030
out and just kind
of cheer for it.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.339
So it's a fun one.

00:49:18.339 --> 00:49:19.130
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.370
Danny, what's next for you?

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.544
What are you writing?

00:49:21.544 --> 00:49:22.710
DANNY RUBIN: Lots of things.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.544
I'm trying to do things that--

00:49:24.544 --> 00:49:27.001
I live here in Santa
Fe, New Mexico.

00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:28.880
And there's so many
talented people here.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.070
I'm working to
write things that I

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.370
can do with people
in my own community,

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.472
without needing to go to
New York or Los Angeles.

00:49:37.472 --> 00:49:40.370
Which I enjoy when it
happens, but I thought

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.017
I'd spend a couple
years just trying

00:49:43.017 --> 00:49:44.184
to do things closer to home.

00:49:44.184 --> 00:49:46.183
SPEAKER: That's why we
invented Google Hangouts,

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:48.270
so we could bring you in
to these types of events.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:49.745
Yeah, so for the
rest of you here.

00:49:49.745 --> 00:49:50.120
DANNY RUBIN: Well done.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.539
SPEAKER: Oh, thank
you, thank you.

00:49:51.539 --> 00:49:54.080
For the rest of you here, what
is the one thing-- we're just,

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.538
real quickly, we're
short on time--

00:49:55.538 --> 00:49:57.170
what is the one
thing that you all

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:58.970
hope audiences
take with them when

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.350
they leave after every show?

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.320
ANDY KARL: A really good time
and a head full of thoughts.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.410
That's my favorite thing, people
going home thinking about it.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.630
And not only were
they entertained,

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:20.068
but they were asked to
examine their own life.

00:50:20.068 --> 00:50:22.372
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah, I mean, I--

00:50:22.372 --> 00:50:24.080
JORDAN GRUBB: I was
going to say, I mean,

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.050
that they, if you look
around in this year's season,

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.850
we're one of the, really
the only comedies,

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.190
if not the only
comedy of the season.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.355
So, and I used to get upset
when I would see people

00:50:33.355 --> 00:50:33.980
after the show.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.577
And they'd be like, it's so fun.

00:50:35.577 --> 00:50:37.160
And I'd be like, no,
I want you to say

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.530
it's like the best thing you've
ever seen in your whole life.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:40.280
But you know what?

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.570
It is fun.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.921
Like, if you leave
there and you are happy,

00:50:43.921 --> 00:50:45.920
and you are feeling good,
I mean that's theater.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.540
That's why you go
to the theater.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.280
So if you're having
a fun time and you

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.200
leave us feeling better
than when you came in,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.325
like, mission accomplished.

00:50:52.325 --> 00:50:54.741
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY: Yeah,
good theater should affect you

00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:56.570
in some way, whether
you go away and it's

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.945
leaving you
pondering life stuff,

00:50:57.945 --> 00:50:59.444
or you go away and
you think, I just

00:50:59.444 --> 00:51:00.950
laughed for two
and a half hours,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.719
or that just made me cry because
it made me contemplate my life,

00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:07.260
and where I've gone, and am I
living each day to the fullest.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.136
If it affects you in
some way, and you're not

00:51:09.136 --> 00:51:10.926
sitting there bored
out of your mind, which

00:51:10.926 --> 00:51:12.680
I guarantee you will
not be at this show,

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.828
then it's done its job.

00:51:13.828 --> 00:51:15.786
RAY LEE: And we do
diversity right on Broadway.

00:51:15.786 --> 00:51:16.950
REBECCA FAULKENBERRY:
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.860
RAY LEE: So I'm
very proud of that.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.514
We aren't all token characters.

00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:21.680
We are not token characters.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.770
We are people.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.820
And I always tell people,
come see what we're doing.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.960
BARRETT DOSS: Yeah it's--

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.650
and just to piggyback on that,
I agree with what all of us

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:32.266
have said so far.

00:51:32.266 --> 00:51:34.640
But I do think that our show,
something that really makes

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.600
our show special is not
only gender diversity, age

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.780
diversity, race diversity,
size diversity, we really

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.160
have created--

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.980
this cast is filled with some of
the most talented and hilarious

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.350
actors I've ever worked with.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.150
And every single one of
my castmates I feel like

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.850
could carry an entire
show on their own.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:59.394
But everyone gets this moment
to be a part of a group.

00:51:59.394 --> 00:52:01.310
And together we make
something really special.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.860
So I hope you will come
see it and enjoy it.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.130

mind, could you close us out

I don't know.

Yeah, talk about diversity and
then the six-foot-two white guy

gets up here and starts to,
jeez, close out the show.

BARRETT DOSS: We know what
the show is about, Andy.

00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:46.340
ANDY KARL: I think
that's actually--

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.250
it's really interesting
to do that part of the,

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.886
have that happen.

00:52:50.886 --> 00:52:52.760
There's people I wish
would come see the show

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.910
and just get a little
clue into a moment

00:52:55.910 --> 00:53:00.590
like this, which is, this last
song is called "Seeing You."

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.440
And Phil has had
his full journey.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.890
He's gone through
being a jerk, and being

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.500
really horrible to
people because he doesn't

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.660
want to be in this town.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:13.460
Then being stuck in this
town with all these people.

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.630
And how terrible is that?

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.100
And then taking
advantage of that

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.990
by being with someone like
Nancy for night after night.

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:22.970
And then realizing
that's not the answer.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.410
There's got to be something new.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.080
And then going to
that dark place

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.150
and just wanting to end it all.

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.340
And he can't end it.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.650
Then he starts then,
then he actually

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.330
has Rita to give them a
clue into saying, well,

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.660
actually maybe
you're the lucky one.

You get to live
something new every day.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.940
It's everybody
else that's stuck.

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.370
And that's sparked
something in his brain.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:50.600
Then he becomes altruistic,
and helps people in the town.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:55.310
And through all this that his
accumulated through this show,

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:58.580
he realizes that everybody
has become a part of his life

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.590
and made him a better person.

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:04.580
And he's able to see that
every day, in some nuance,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.620
in everybody.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.840

"Seeing You," by Tim Minchin.

I don't know how he came
up with these lyrics.

took right onto a
northbound highway.

Was it really only yesterday?

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:50.870
If I had known what
now I know, maybe I

00:54:50.870 --> 00:55:01.930
would have taken a moment,
maybe looked over my shoulder,

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:05.200
maybe shed a tear.

sometime late this morning.

Think I ignored the warnings.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:38.640
I've spent a lifetime
seeking signs, reading lines,

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.583
trying to forecast the future.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:53.145
Always staying a day ahead,
well, that was the idea.

00:55:53.145 --> 00:55:55.141
But I'm here.
