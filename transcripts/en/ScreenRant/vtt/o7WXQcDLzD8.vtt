00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.730
When films are released worldwide, they become
subject to a great number of cultural norms

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.299
and values. And not every project can appeal
to all audiences across the globe. Sometimes,

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.150
a country deems a particular film so offensive
that they are left no choice but to ban it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.770
from their theaters. But is that a reasonable
reaction? Here are Screen Rant’s Movies

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.529
That Were Banned for Crazy Reasons

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.529
The Interview

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.120
More memorable for its controversy than its
comedy, The Interview turned out to be one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.809
of the weirdest Hollywood debacles in recent
memory. The story of an American talk show

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.249
host being tasked by the CIA to assassinate
North Korea's head of State was sure to turn

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:53.139
some heads, but things got out of hand very,
very quickly. North Korea banned the film,

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.659
apparently ordering that anyone in the country
caught watching a bootleg copy would meet

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.199
a firing squad or a prison sentence. But that
only scratches the surface of the fallout:

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.230
the movie was also on its way to being banned
in the United States. Claiming to have hacked

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.610
Sony's computers as punishment, the so-called
"Guardians of Peace" threatened terrorist

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.930
attacks upon movie theaters which showed the
film on its Christmas Day release. When theater

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.700
chains began to cancel showings, Sony resorted
to digital sales so the movie wasn't a total

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.630
loss, and in the end, The Interview screened
without incident, but it was still a bizarre

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:51.749
footnote 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:02:02.210
for what was a mainly mediocre comedy.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.520
E.T. – The Extra Terrestrial

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.900
Steven Spielberg’s E.T. is one of the most
successful and beloved films of all-time thanks

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.400
to its touching story of friendship that enthralled
viewers of all ages. But it wasn’t the best

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.060
pick for family night in Scandinavia. Children
under 11 in that country were barred from

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.040
seeing it because the Swedish Film Board said
it portrayed adults as “enemies of children.”

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.480
It’s true a majority of the grown-ups in
E.T. weren’t exactly friendly towards Elliott

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.500
and his pals, but this seemed a bit rash and
cost youngsters a thrilling moviegoing experience.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.831
After all, all stories need a villain.

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:36.831
2012

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:37.831
Everyone has different tastes in film, and
some people only like to watch movies that

00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.831
make them happy. Some take that to the extreme,
which is what happened when North Korea banned

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:39.831
the disaster flick 2012. 2009 was the year
of Kim Il Sung’s 100th birthday, and to

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:40.831
keep the party atmosphere alive in the country,
they did not want anything negative being

00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:41.831
shown at their movie theaters. Yes, the destruction
of the world can be distressing to watch,

00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:42.831
but 2012 was just a big dumb action movie
that nobody – except the North Korean government

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:43.831
– took seriously. Makes you wonder what
films they did show.

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.831
The Simpsons Movie

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.831
The Simpsons are known for their irreverent
style of humor, but who could have predicted

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.360
they’d start a political controversy? When
The Simpsons Movie was premiering in 2007,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.580
Burma banned the project from screens because
the family’s skin was yellow. Apparently,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.955
red and yellow are the official colors for
the National League of Democracy, which was

00:02:55.955 --> 00:03:00.220
the biggest threat to leader Aung San Suu
Kyi’s political party at the time. No matter

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.400
what your beliefs are, it’s hard to argue
that The Simpsons Movie was making grand statements

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.099
in favor of Burmese democracy, so we’re
still trying to get our heads around this.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.909
Blue Jasmine

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.329
Audiences were drawn into Woody Allen’s
Blue Jasmine due to a mesmerizing performance

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.940
by eventual Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, but
moviegoers in India couldn’t see what all

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.330
the awards buzz was about. The country banned
the film because characters are shown smoking.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.939
A law in India requires an anti-smoking PSA
to be shown on the screen for films that depict

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.910
smoking. Allen refused to amend his project,
and it wasn’t shown. We’re all for taking

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.010
down big tobacco and improving our health,
but this was taking it a little too far. It’s

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.980
not like Blue Jasmine tried to promote the
benefits of cigarettes, which would be something

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.030
else entirely.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.030
Borat

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.989
Sacha Baron Cohen was going for serious shock
value when he starred in the comedy&nbsp;Borat,

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.159
and shock he did. His portrayal of an insensitive
and anti-Semitic news reporter exploring America

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.700
offended audiences around the globe, including
Russia, where the fake Kazakhstan punchlines

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:10.219
weren't met with laughter. The country refused
to show the film in theaters, feeling several

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:15.519
scenes "offend viewers' religious or national
sensibilities." Germany also attempted to

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.030
get&nbsp;Borat&nbsp;banned, citing defamation against
the very-real gypsy populations within their

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:30.000
borders.&nbsp;Borat&nbsp;may have been a hit in America,
but the humor obviously didn't translate worldwide.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.511
Those are our picks for movies banned for
crazy reasons. Are there any we missed? Which

00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:38.540
banned films have you scratching your head?
