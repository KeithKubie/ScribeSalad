00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.030
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:07.730
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.400
I'm just checking in on you.
Hey Bill,
dude.
What the fuck?

4
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.700
Why are you checking in on is so fucking late this week,
dude,

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.440
what'd you have a fucking hernia?
Is that what happened?
What did you,

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.510
did you get hit by a car?
Uh,
no.
I,
I,

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.290
it's been the most difficult podcasts I've ever had to record you guys.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.020
I need a start up for my emotions.
Um,
honestly,

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.750
<v 1>honestly,
uh,
uh,</v>

10
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.530
<v 0>I don't know what happened.
I fucking,</v>

11
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:46.531
I got real busy and then I recorded the podcast and for some reason there was no

12
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:51.400
audio.
I can't figure out what the fuck I did to mine.
Oh,

13
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:56.330
I did something.
Oh,
freckles did something.
So this is my second attempt.

14
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.910
The last attempt was,
believe it or not,

15
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.190
I believe was on Thursday hours on Wednesday.

16
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.700
I swear to God the dog ate my homework.
That's literally what I'm [inaudible]

17
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.420
<v 1>telling you in a podcasting way.
Um,
so I'm back to a,</v>

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.320
one of my original mixers here.
Thank God I didn't throw it out.

19
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.670
Thank God I'm a bit of a pack rat you guys.
No,

20
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:18.190
actually I didn't want to throw it out because I was going to give it away to

21
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.670
somebody.
What I wanted to do.
That was the thing I was going to be like.

22
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:22.121
Do you mind?

23
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:26.770
You realize the amount of times a semi known comic said the word cunt into this

24
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:28.060
mixer,
mixer,
mixer.

25
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:32.470
And I thought it'd be worth something to somebody that they would take it.
Um,

26
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.620
but I never got around to doing that.
And thank God I had a backup mixer.

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.190
All right.
That's the level that I'm bawling at right now.

28
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.403
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.420
<v 1>you got to mix it,
buddy.
I got a mixer and a backup mixer.</v>

30
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.600
What the fuck do you got?
You know,
if they still had MTV cribs right now,

31
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:48.434
I would be on it.

32
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 1>Lifestyles of the rich and famous,
they have one and a half mixes.</v>

34
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.670
Um,
all right,
it's Saturday,
Saturday.
All right.

35
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.640
In more freckles has been,
uh,

36
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.470
alcohol free for nine miserable fucking weeks.
It's actually,
you know,

37
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:10.420
something,
I'm at the point now,
I don't even give a shit.

38
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:14.680
I don't think I think about it occasionally,
but now when I think about it,

39
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.740
I think,
but why would I go back to that?
Huh?
Oh,

40
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:22.741
Billy booze face sitting back and joy and himself after a long day of hard work

41
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:28.330
of performing words that other people wrote.
Do you guys realize,

42
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.310
realize how hard it is to be an actor sometimes to just show up and say things

43
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.710
that people already said for you on a piece of paper.

44
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.620
Um,
that's one of the reasons why this week's a little crazy.
A,

45
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.470
I got a little acting gig over the next,
uh,
week or so,

46
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.400
and I'm on general hospital.
Um,
no,

47
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.880
and I'm not allowed to say everything.

48
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:54.490
You're not allowed to say now because you've got all these fucking cops.

49
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.850
Everybody tries to figure out what you're on and then they start,

50
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.040
I don't know what they do.
And somehow they know

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 0>what you're doing before you even shoot it.
That's like the level of technology.</v>

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.420
Okay.

53
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.350
If you actually say what you're acting on and somebody's listening to you on a

54
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:11.710
podcast has a drone with one of those Gopros,

55
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.570
somehow they will know what senior doing the next day before you are before you

56
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.404
do.

57
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

58
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.220
<v 1>Speaking of drones,
do you know that the next level of Uber,</v>

59
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.550
the next level of lift,

60
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.700
the next level of fucking is early to fucking,
there's only two of them.

61
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.100
You either take lifter waste.

62
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.540
It's like back in the day when there was VHS or Beta and everybody chose VHS.

63
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.880
So think about that.
The next time you're going to get in a car with a stranger.

64
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.603
<v 3>Huh?</v>

65
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.680
<v 1>Um,
there's a bunch of weird movies coming out now that I don't understand.</v>

66
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.130
You know,
there's a fucking documentary right now in,
in,
in,
uh,

67
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.560
in Sundance.

68
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.303
<v 3>It's,</v>

69
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.290
<v 1>I,
I can't,
I glanced at it quickly.
I think it said it was four hours long.</v>

70
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.520
It can't be four hours long.

71
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.180
It's a documentary about two now adults who said when they were kids,

72
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.100
they allegedly got molested by Michael Jackson.
Now I gotta ask you this,

73
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.030
why the fuck would I want to sit down and watch that?

74
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.920
I'm going to sit there with a bucket of popcorn and some fucking junior mints.

75
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.840
All right,
let me hear the worst story that can happen to a kid,

76
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.630
you know,
and you know,
some people say,
oh,
they just do it for my,

77
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:35.940
I don't know what the fuck happened.
I wasn't there,
but let's,
you know,

78
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.510
true or untrue.
I don't want to listen to those stories.

79
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

80
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.530
<v 1>What kind of a fucking person wants to fucking sit down?</v>

81
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.543
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.470
<v 1>You go to the movies,
you know you're going to get something to eat</v>

83
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.190
and just sitting there at the camp.
Oh,

84
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.570
what do you feel like indulging in before we listened to this horror?

85
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.403
<v 3>MMM.</v>

86
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.550
<v 1>I Dunno,
but I go back to,
I think when I saw Schindler's list,</v>

87
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.050
I believe I was eating popcorn.
I mean that this certain movies,

88
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.153
they should not,

89
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.020
you should not be sitting there stuffing your face with food,
right?

90
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.980
We now have a documentary about the genocide in Rwanda and out of respect for

91
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.680
the victims than are you fat Americans?

92
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.270
Will be allowed to eat over the next two hours.
Aw,
everybody fucking groans.

93
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.490
Hashtag hypoglycemic.
Um,
anyways,

94
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.310
so they,
they uh,
getting back to the drones,

95
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.130
the next level of Uber is that they're actually gonna have,
I swear to God,

96
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:43.360
like unmanned

97
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.090
<v 0>drones,</v>

98
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.290
I guess none of them really mad right now that you can get into like a life size

99
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:49.501
one,

100
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:54.501
like a human size one and you get in this fucking thing and you fly all over the

101
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.720
traffic.

102
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.310
<v 3>Like,</v>

103
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v 1>like I do when I fly one of the Helio type copters and I have to tell you this,</v>

104
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.650
you are out of your fucking mind.

105
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.630
If you remember the Lasik eye surgery when that first came out,

106
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.170
do you remember that?
And they'd be a couple of fucking people go,
oh my God,

107
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.980
I can see it to the future.
But like one out of every 15 would be like,
Mike,

108
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.520
why don't you,
I'll never see again.
Yeah.

109
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.260
This is going to be the first week of Lasik eye surgery version of that.

110
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.090
I want to know how in the fuck the FAA is going to fucking sign off on that one.

111
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.890
You know,
God damn well there's,
it was a glitch.

112
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.970
The hats just blue.
You're going to have the Gus Grissom fucking,

113
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.560
something's going to happen.
You know,

114
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.610
it's bad enough that you're going to have the person up there careening down or

115
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.530
falling down to the death.

116
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.600
You can be sitting there fucking watching NFL football up.

117
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.330
But DAP at at bed,

118
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:08.300
having a fucking hipsters gonna fall through your goddamn ceiling.

119
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.480
Tight jeans and all,
you know,

120
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.430
Hitler youth fucking fade with the A,

121
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:20.160
I know how to make shoes by,
by hand.
Beard that he thought he's going to have.

122
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.510
It's going to come fallen right through your fucking ceiling.

123
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.800
I don't know.
You know,
you know,

124
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.010
you'd think if fucking people like Elon Musk are trying to figure out a way to

125
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:39.011
drill through the Goddamn earth and now they're going to have unmanned,

126
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.280
unmanned people,
unmanned people,
unmanned devices,

127
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:48.200
flying people around up there.
Why you think it's some people at some point,

128
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.551
Jesus Christ,
the kids speak,

129
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.250
somebody would address the fucking population problem

130
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.360
signs.
You have too many people.
Uh,

131
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.690
we're going to have unmanned drones flying people over densely populated areas.

132
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.950
Hey everybody,
you have cell phones,
you have laptops.

133
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.993
How many times?

134
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.070
What's the longest they've consistently worked before you had to refresh it

135
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.120
or shut it down or restart it or take it over to the apple store.

136
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:27.890
So one of the geniuses can be like,
oh,
I find them,

137
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.030
I found the problem.
People in aviation,

138
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.260
you can't hit a refresh button.
Okay.
Yeah.
They refresh.

139
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:40.340
They refreshed by hosing off wherever the fuck you crash landed.

140
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.000
Let's refresh this scorched earth.
Um,

141
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.490
and then it will be like,
well,

142
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:51.491
should they installed the horror struck today when to hipsters from several acre

143
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.280
.

144
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.280
We're trying to get from silver lake out to Santa Monica to go to a craft beer

145
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:03.390
tasting fucking festival,
whatever the,
whatever the fuck it is they do

146
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.620
to go to a pocket watch convention.
Yeah.
And then not follow it through.

147
00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:12.580
Some fucking,
you know,
on,

148
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.810
you're not paid in a month.

149
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.820
Air traffic control is fucking a irony struck today.
Um,

150
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.090
I dunno.
Audio,
you're out of your fucking mind.

151
00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:25.580
And I also got to think it's going to be at least 300 bucks per trip.

152
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.190
That'll become some elite thing and then there'll be like,
you know,

153
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:32.760
we have to have affordable,
unmanned drones.

154
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.580
Why are you saying unmanned bill?
You know why?
Because man learned how to fly,

155
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.750
not women.

156
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.900
And I'm sure when Hollywood does the fucking next bio pic of Orville and Wilbur,

157
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.570
it'll be like,
well why can't it be Orval in Wilma?

158
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.440
And they'll make one of them a woman and they'll make some sort of backstory

159
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:57.240
that one of them actually identified as female just so they don't get yelled at

160
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:02.190
on Twitter or villain Wilma.
We're very proud of this,

161
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:07.050
that the real story of fucking Devil's island,
whatever the fuck they call,

162
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:08.160
wherever they,
they actually,

163
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.250
where they learned how to fly is like some devils something or other.

164
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.970
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

165
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.780
<v 1>no,
I'm sure there's some Jesus fucking group out there.
Jesus Freak Group.</v>

166
00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:19.610
We'll just talk.
Okay.
That's why you tell you right now let's swap.

167
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.130
Flight is evil.
Ain't you ever read the story of ICARUS?

168
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
They flew too close to the sun and his and his winged is wing base caught on

169
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:34.780
fire and he went all the way back down to earth and he continued to fall to

170
00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:39.430
earth through the earth into the pits and the flames of hail.

171
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.423
<v 3>Okay.</v>

172
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.180
<v 1>Um,
I dunno what I'm talking about and I don't give a shit.</v>

173
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:48.050
I'm just contractually obligated here to give you guys some sort of an effort

174
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:52.130
for 30 minutes.
Okay.
That's what you get.
Not to me.
Oh by the way,

175
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.860
speaking of efforts Sunday,
tomorrow,
Sunday,
whatever,
fuck,

176
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.890
January 27 2019 this is the,

177
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.920
this is the soft open of a sports world without football for the next six

178
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:10.840
months.
This is the one
via giphy.
You know,

179
00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:14.170
God bless Espn,
God bless Fox sports.

180
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.530
The way the way they're going to be keep yammering on on Sunday is if something

181
00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:22.510
sports wise is actually happening in football.

182
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.040
Look down here at the trade at cap and
Rob Gradkowski is,

183
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.630
is touching his left hand to his right fucking clean.

184
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.251
Rob,

185
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.690
you find it harder to reach to the right one with your left hand or the left one

186
00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:40.660
with your right hand.
I'm sorry,
rob.

187
00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:43.150
Gronkowski he's not answering questions right now.
I mean,

188
00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:45.160
who the fuck is going to sit around and watch that?
All right.

189
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:47.590
They used to at least have the goddamn pro bowl.

190
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.750
They had something going on.
Um,
but that's it.
People.

191
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.500
There's one more week event,
AFL football and there's only two teams left.

192
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.200
All right,
one left.
So you have to ask yourself,

193
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.130
who are you inviting to your Superbowl party?

194
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.013
<v 3>Huh?</v>

195
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.150
<v 1>Are you going to have the balls</v>

196
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.370
to fucking only invite sports fans?

197
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.600
I guess if your team isn't in it,
why do you give a shit?
Why not be social?

198
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.860
You know what I mean?

199
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.760
Why not have a bunch of people come over who don't give a fuck?

200
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.260
They're just there for the burgers that the radios,
the fucking hot dogs,

201
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.540
this stupid dips,
that fucking thing that somebody made that nobody really likes.

202
00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:39.900
But they bring it every year and everybody's got to take at least one fucking

203
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.060
bite out of the thing.
Maybe.

204
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.840
<v 0>Oh,
it's even fucking better than last year.</v>

205
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:47.763
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

206
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.220
<v 1>I think I'm thinking,
I'm toying with the idea of having people over.</v>

207
00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:55.550
It's going to be a select few.
All right.

208
00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.300
And they will come in in unmanned drones and hopefully not fall

209
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.900
<v 0>through the fucking roof of my house.
That's what I'm hoping.</v>

210
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.090
That's what I'm hoping happens.
Now,

211
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.230
why the fuck is this?

212
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:14.260
This seems like the sound is down low on this one at Jesus Christ.

213
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.390
Who knows who the fuck knows?

214
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:20.140
I just want to thank all the brave men and women who make the mixers out there

215
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:24.070
who are fighting for my freedom and defending this country against terrorism.

216
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.290
How's that dude?
How much longer is this government shutdown going to lay?

217
00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:31.540
This is like the most fucking petty Goddamn like,

218
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.880
<v 1>and I don't understand too why if the government shuts down.
Okay.</v>

219
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.510
Uh,
air traffic controllers and people like that,
they don't get paid,

220
00:13:41.511 --> 00:13:46.340
but politicians continue to get fucking paid.
I bet.

221
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.890
I'll tell.
I'll go out on a limb here.
I'll bet.

222
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.760
Because there was some sort of legislation that a fucking politician paid

223
00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:56.600
somebody to come up with and they all fucking agreed.
Yeah.

224
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.310
They all agreed to be like,
yes,

225
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:02.960
we will continue to get paid those fucking filthy cuts.

226
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.340
I still don't understand how somebody could actually be a Democrat or

227
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:10.190
Republican.

228
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.450
When you watch behavior like this feed actually just fucking sit there,

229
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.110
you know?
I mean,
I don't,
I'm going to sit here and I'm going,

230
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.780
what I'm going to do now is do whatever every fucking cunt does,

231
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:25.430
which is I'm going to state the obvious without a solution,
you know,

232
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.090
and act like I am above you.
All right?
That's what I mean.
I do that in general.

233
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.250
Just part of being a form of,
part of getting on stage,

234
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.200
part of being back and waiting for your name to be called and feeling that rush

235
00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:43.910
of excitement that can only be described as someone else who has taken the
stage.

236
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.880
Um,
you know,

237
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.890
when you speak into a this,
this,
you just feel like you know things.
All right?

238
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.120
And I apologize to all of you poor people out there who never in your life where

239
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:04.121
you ever know the thrill of not reading and simply turning on a device,

240
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.230
speaking into a microphone,
recording yourself.
You know,

241
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.860
I feel bad for you.
You know,
I respect all of you.
You know,

242
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.830
you put your pants on one leg at a time,
you know Joe six pack Shuggie.

243
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.170
You get through at least four beers before you physically abused the woman in

244
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:25.790
your life.
You know the regular joes out their lunch pail Larry,

245
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.260
right?
Ham Hock Harry,
you know fucking,

246
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.700
<v 2>yeah,</v>

247
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.670
<v 1>Capri Sun,
Sandra Capri Sun.</v>

248
00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:38.470
Where the fuck did I pull that out of that?
I don't know.

249
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.740
I know I never got into those fucking juices back in the day.

250
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.880
I'll let fucking weird shit.

251
00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:46.030
People used to eat over those things during lunchtime.

252
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.580
30 fucking years ago in the cafeteria I'd go to,

253
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.130
it would literally be what they call fruit rollups.

254
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.380
You said this shit fruit rollups and I swear to God it looked like wax.

255
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.550
These people would just fucking just be,
I don't know what it was.
It was,

256
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:04.551
it was some sort of fruit infused flavor with like a pound of sugar.

257
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.810
And then,
uh,
I dunno,

258
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.990
earwax from fucking workers in a third world plant or some shit.

259
00:16:12.991 --> 00:16:15.510
I don't know what it wasn't.
Kids would sit there and eat.
I mean,
you know what?

260
00:16:15.511 --> 00:16:19.650
Nobody died.
Nobody died.
And,
and,

261
00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:22.650
and the world was actually was in a lot of ways,
was it better place?

262
00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:27.010
I'm not saying we were as progressive
as we are today.

263
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

264
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.450
<v 1>Some would argue overly progressive.
And when I say some,</v>

265
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.730
I would say a lot of the voices in my head would say,

266
00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:40.500
I think we're going a little too far with this shit.
You know?
Oh,

267
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.440
you start giving actors shit for acting.

268
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.240
Why are you pretending to be something that you're not at?

269
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:52.130
Because it's acting that that is what acting is.
Okay.
If you,

270
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:56.720
if you take an acting job and you just act what you already are,

271
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:01.610
that's not really acting,
which is why so many people have done a decent job,

272
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.460
be in what they are on sprayed and then everybody thinks they can act.
Oh,

273
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:09.840
I can act
acted Zzz.

274
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.390
Remember when that chick from hall,

275
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.040
that crazy drug addicted chick from whole played the crazy drug addicted chicken

276
00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:17.681
that fucking way.

277
00:17:17.681 --> 00:17:21.060
She was unbelievable as it crate that crazy drug addicted chick I couldn't

278
00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:23.160
believe about,
well she played a crazy drug addicted check.

279
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.010
Let's say every crazy drug addicted woman can then go on screen and there is a

280
00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:30.750
certain level of fucking town.
Okay.

281
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:35.751
But don't put yourself on the same level that my left foot guy guy walks around

282
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:39.440
acting like a in for a fucking year before he's actually Abe Lincoln.
Okay.

283
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.260
Then you're going to just come in and play a heightened version of yourself.

284
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.570
What am I doing right now?
I am describing my acting career.

285
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.750
Um,
anyways,
how much time is that?
Oh Jesus Christ.
It's like fucking,
you know,

286
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.670
it's hilarious.
It's like five 50 in the morning and I got up to go to the gym.

287
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.320
I got to,
I got the acting Gig also happens today.
I just have a later call time.

288
00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:07.860
So I was like,
I'm going to get up and go to the gym.
All right.
Cause I'm uh,

289
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.870
trying to get myself back in shape here.
Right.

290
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.380
So you remember the old Jimson I go to the gym everyday.

291
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.230
It's just become pop me life.

292
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.550
And if you don't want to be a fatty,
you go to the gym every day.

293
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.260
You can have a big body.
I called Jerry so I don't go every day.

294
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:26.850
I take one day off.
All right.

295
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.340
I figured even if the Lord needed to take one day off when he was creating the

296
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:35.130
universe is I'm sculpting

297
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.573
<v 3>this</v>

298
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.460
<v 1>flower covered colored body.</v>

299
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.633
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

300
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.100
<v 1>Do you know how you know something?</v>

301
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.330
All of these minorities out there with their pigment bitch moaning and

302
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:53.720
complaining.
I asked you this as a privileged white male,

303
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.710
do you understand how difficult it is to get shredded when you were as

304
00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:00.260
transparent?
Is me?
Okay.

305
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.490
I could be in just as good as shape as some Hawaiian.

306
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.450
Okay.
But because I am so pasty,

307
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.860
the world is never going to know it.
And do you understand how difficult that is?

308
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:17.180
For me,
when I walk out into the world,
it's like,
Hey,

309
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.870
I have a couple of abs too.
You just can't see them.

310
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.450
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

311
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.460
<v 1>I want to get that Janet Jackson,
stomach makeup.
We just said,
you know,</v>

312
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:29.800
get one of those people that,
you know,

313
00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:33.490
when you almost have abs then they just spray paint him in.
I want to do that.

314
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.310
Right.
And then I'm going to do,

315
00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:40.690
put it on a half shirt and do my dance cover of miss you much.

316
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.130
Uh,
miss you.
Oh,
hi miss you.

317
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.530
But I really miss you much.
Um,

318
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.170
I remember I had a crush on her when she was on different strokes.

319
00:19:54.171 --> 00:19:58.390
I didn't like her when she was on,
uh,

320
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.300
good times.
You know what I mean?

321
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.200
And that cause she was younger with baby fat and you know,

322
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.150
cause we're basically the same age.
It was because she was broke.
Okay.

323
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.060
And I'm not,
I'm not trying to get with some,
yeah,

324
00:20:13.061 --> 00:20:17.530
she was living in the projects then.
I liked her better when she was,
you know,

325
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.060
on different strokes,
you know,
interacting with super rich white people.

326
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:25.690
Then then me as a little white kid could relate like,
oh,
all right,

327
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.293
<v 3>okay.</v>

328
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.330
<v 1>Oh,
now the world don't move to the beat.
Just one drum.</v>

329
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.900
What might wrap you may not be right for some.
Um,

330
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.173
all right.

331
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.350
That was inadvertently one of the funnier things that I've said on this podcast,

332
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.330
but I'm sure someone will take it in the wrong way.
What are you saying?

333
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.870
You can't fall in love with someone because they live in the projects,
projects,

334
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:03.670
projects.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
That is how privileged I am.

335
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.440
You know,
if women can go into these fucking single buys,

336
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:12.370
these meat markets in one of their first questions they ask you when you run

337
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:16.060
into them is what do you do for a living?
You know?

338
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

339
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.270
<v 1>How much fucking cake are you putting on the table?
They're swinging Dick.
Why?</v>

340
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.220
Why can't I choose?

341
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.713
<v 3>Okay,</v>

342
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.870
<v 1>why can't I choose my TV crushes?</v>

343
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:29.723
<v 3>Huh?</v>

344
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.100
<v 1>That's how I was.
I was an elitist with my TV crutches,
crushes,</v>

345
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.580
you know,
fuck all those bitches on the Waltons.

346
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.800
But I would fuck anybody on Falcon crest and cloning the man.

347
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.680
Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drug.

348
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.560
Bunch of rich white people throwing each other in the pool in evening gowns.

349
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.513
I've never seen that one.

350
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Is that when Joan Crawford in Morgan Fairchild had their infamous catfight,

351
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.223
you know

352
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.190
that I think gets reenacted on floats during the gay pride parade in every city.

353
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.720
Isn't that what they isn't that required?

354
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.880
They have to have one stereotypical thing.
All right.

355
00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:12.890
Gay People,
gay men,
let's,

356
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.330
let's do what straight people think we're into.
Let's,

357
00:22:17.331 --> 00:22:21.830
let's appease them so we can try to be a little more mainstream this year.

358
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.840
Oh Man.
That different strokes on when,
when it gets in your fucking head,

359
00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:29.300
you just can't get it out,
you know?
But it's enjoyable.

360
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.130
Everybody's dead except the due to play in Willis.

361
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.470
That's kind of sad.

362
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.540
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

363
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.490
<v 1>I guess I died next.
I think I'm the same age as Willis Willis drumming.</v>

364
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.730
But booboo will is driven.

365
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.480
He's owned the only one left alive.
Yes,
he is.
You know something.

366
00:22:51.481 --> 00:22:55.380
That's what I do when I watch me TV.
I try to see like,
who's the only guy left?

367
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.240
Oh,
that's a great fucking trivia thing.

368
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:04.070
Name TV shows where there's only one series regulars still alive.

369
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.840
Different strokes.
The Beverly hillbillies.
Why am I ain't gonna hang on.
Whoa,

370
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.540
Whoa,
whoa.
Hang on.
When I wow the fucking,
uh,
the dude.

371
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

372
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.100
<v 1>You know,
that's how you right now,
that's how that shows you right now.</v>

373
00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:19.730
How hard show businesses.
You know what I mean?
Cause in the real world,

374
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.090
women outlive the men.
All right?

375
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.850
But this business is so fucking difficult

376
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.353
<v 3>that</v>

377
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.490
<v 1>I said,
that doesn't make any sense.
Does it?</v>

378
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:31.930
<v 3>Okay,</v>

379
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.900
<v 1>well,
let's see.
Well the one chick overdosed and then the housekeeper,</v>

380
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:38.230
she was like 93 when they started shooting that she fucking crushed it.

381
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.360
She had a great act and career.
You know,
she had two shows that made syndication.

382
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.010
She was on

383
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.843
<v 2>a,</v>

384
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.750
<v 1>she was on,
uh,
the facts of life,
right?
You take the good,
you take the bad,</v>

385
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:56.540
you take them both in there.
You have the facts of life.
You know,

386
00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.930
do you know why that song was at that tempo?

387
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.530
Because when you really just slow that down,
that doesn't make any sense.

388
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.840
You take the good,
you take the bed,

389
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.580
you take a both and there you have the facts of life.
It's like,
wait,
what?

390
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:16.390
That doesn't mean anything,
but you speed speeded up,
take the go to take the bed,

391
00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:18.880
you take a boat and there you had the facts that like,
oh,
that's catchy.

392
00:24:18.881 --> 00:24:22.960
I don't feel like thinking the facts of life.
Um,

393
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:25.750
I know what you thinking.
Hey Bill,
you're wife is black.

394
00:24:25.751 --> 00:24:27.910
We ended Tuesday on that show.
No,
I was not.

395
00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:32.350
I like Joe Joe the mechanic.
I liked her riding the dirt bike,

396
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.900
the fucking tomboy.
I like Blair at first.
You know,

397
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.670
at first I like Blair,

398
00:24:39.671 --> 00:24:43.210
but there was just something so fucking wholesome about her.
After awhile.

399
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.760
I was just like,
yeah,
Jesus Christ.
Can you imagine the fucking look?

400
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.200
She be given me a weekend to this.

401
00:24:50.201 --> 00:24:54.010
Do you like how I'm entertaining the fact that a young freckled me could

402
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:57.790
actually dated Blair from um,

403
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.970
oh is that fucking show.
I just set it the facts of life.
All right.

404
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.030
I don't have any of you to talk about somebody to tell you about my TV crushes.

405
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.390
All right.
Back in the day.
Um,

406
00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.280
I would occasionally watch Charlie's angels because even back then I was so

407
00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:19.280
sexist
that I,

408
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:23.890
I couldn't get over the fact that I was watching these,

409
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.070
these women all made up running down the alleys,

410
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.450
tackling these fucking guys into trash cans.
You know,

411
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.280
having said that,
I obviously like Farrah Fawcett,
right?

412
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.470
But I was a Kate Jackson Fan.
She was sort of the first Demi Moore,

413
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.480
I feel,
you know,
the fucking Brunette with the smokey fucking voice.

414
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.240
And then the best was when she was on the rookies,
Baghdad at Butoh.
Do Bob,
uh,

415
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.310
that add add,
add,
add bad at it.
You know,

416
00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:56.230
when I would love to have on the fucking podcast,

417
00:25:56.231 --> 00:26:01.231
I would love to have the trumpet player from the 1970s who fucking just got in

418
00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:08.260
with whatever studio and played half of those theme songs.
Dude,

419
00:26:08.261 --> 00:26:13.261
if you weren't a fucking horn section living in la in the 70s.

420
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.540
Right?
And you just fucking,

421
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:20.980
and then they had all those cop shows you were working every fucking week.

422
00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:22.510
You in that Bongo player,

423
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.200
the Bongo player was just crushed every time you fucking chased.

424
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:28.720
The suspect down a fucking alley.

425
00:26:28.721 --> 00:26:31.240
They always were playing the congas and the bongos.
Right.

426
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.720
And then whenever they had the theme song for the show was the fucking horn

427
00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:39.440
section.
Uh,
uh,
banana.
A banana trumpets.
Yeah.

428
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.733
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

429
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.280
<v 1>right.
Fucking horn players crushing it.</v>

430
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.900
Walking around with polyester shirts with on Dowdy and naval.
Yet you medallion,

431
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.040
you little coke spoon,

432
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.023
<v 3>right?</v>

433
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.030
<v 1>Don't go to bed with a price on your head.
No,</v>

434
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.930
don't do it.
Um,
all right,
bill,

435
00:27:10.931 --> 00:27:14.560
what are your predictions for the Superbowl?
You know me,

436
00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:18.490
I never think my team's going to win.
I hope they win,

437
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.940
but I'll tell you right now,
they're going to have their heads.

438
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.020
Fuck,
love these rams of Los Angeles that I already make fun of those fucking,

439
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.180
those 30 something douchebags who in the rams jerseys who were crying.

440
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.470
They were getting all emotional and they're fucking girlfriends were comforting

441
00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:40.620
them.
When the rams beat the sites,
it's like,

442
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.570
what the fuck are you credit such a typical Foti fucking La Douche bag?

443
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.440
It's like the rams had been back for three years.
They left in the 80s.

444
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.410
You're fucking 30 years old.
You don't remember these fucking people.

445
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.420
Oh my God,

446
00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:00.190
<v 5>God,
I've been waiting since I was 26 and now I'm
29.</v>

447
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

448
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.260
<v 1>Now the world don't move to the beat of just one drum.</v>

449
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:10.740
Your team just moved back.
Stop with the crocodile tears.

450
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:13.260
That's the wrong expression.
Stop with your phone.
He fucking tears.

451
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.730
Those were actors.
That's where they weren't in the NFL,
of course,

452
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:22.170
has to show them,
look how happy we make people.

453
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.200
And now let's take a veteran out of the crowd and charge the marines money for

454
00:28:28.201 --> 00:28:32.400
it.
Ladies.
Gentlemen,
how about a round of applause for this hair?
All that.

455
00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:37.110
We're now charging the military a fee for a commercial act.

456
00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:38.370
A likely support.

457
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.690
Let's bring out the American flag everybody and whore out people's patriotism so

458
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:47.100
we can make more money.

459
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.820
Let's settle this class.
Action.
So with former players,

460
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.420
that comes down to about $38 per player.

461
00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.860
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

462
00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.490
<v 1>Um,
oh Geez,
I'm getting cynical.
29 minutes.
Ah,
we made another one.</v>

463
00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:06.650
You know what?
I got to read a little advertising here.

464
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.710
<v 3>Um,
I can be broken my own mother fucker.</v>

465
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.620
That's how I,
I,
I justify my crush,

466
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.770
my elitist crush on Janet Jackson.
All right,

467
00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:28.790
here we go.
He looks everybody Helux.
Yeah.

468
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.510
<v 1>Hey man,
you ever wake up in the morning with a raging hot?
No.</v>

469
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.270
You ever wake up in the morning with regrets and what you'd done?

470
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.360
Do you know what I did this morning?
I woke up this morning,

471
00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:43.361
I had a dream that one of my relatives was on a boat that sank with like 200

472
00:29:47.011 --> 00:29:51.300
fucking people and they were all missing and somehow I was in the ocean but

473
00:29:51.301 --> 00:29:52.530
still in my house.

474
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.590
And I found my loved one and they picked her up and she was face down and when I

475
00:29:59.401 --> 00:30:04.050
turned her over,
she started crying and was coughing and she was still alive.

476
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.580
And I came in and I think I talked shit.

477
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.400
I talked the other rescuers I said beat that.

478
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.870
And then I realized she was still alive and I started crying.

479
00:30:15.871 --> 00:30:18.510
And then I really just started wailing,
crying.

480
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.710
And I walked by my mother and she just went,
Jay says,
Bill,

481
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.470
like I was crying too much.

482
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.910
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

483
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.490
<v 1>I don't even get supported by drapes.</v>

484
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:39.770
I'm replaying the terrible decisions you made the previous night over and over

485
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:42.290
and over.
The kicking,
the sweating,

486
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:47.350
the yelling or whatever else you did to piss everyone off to piss everyone in

487
00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:49.730
the bedroom off.
Well,
guess what,
Bud?

488
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.920
Depending deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.

489
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:59.510
I like how these people try to write this dialogue like the weight I talk.

490
00:30:59.511 --> 00:31:02.870
So now I have to take my head away from the microphone and read literally what

491
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:06.200
they wrote.
But bill,
buying a mattress is so high.

492
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.910
Where would I ever begin?
Well,
you're in luck buddy.

493
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.500
A lot of buds and buddy here.
It's written by Jeff Spicoli.
What's your problem?

494
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.740
Bird.
Because Helen's helix sleep.

495
00:31:18.741 --> 00:31:22.790

496

498
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.590

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.120

505
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.680
<v 3>Ah Ah,
ah.
It</v>

506
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.480
<v 1>doesn't feel right.
We don't want our bag and my broad,</v>

507
00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:16.980
it just doesn't feel right in my cock,
you know?

508
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.040
Well what kind of balls do you have?

509
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:25.310
I got those medium size ones but for some reason they weigh down my ball sack as

510
00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:27.540
if it's not a quality ball sack.

511
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.500
You know like I feel like if I had a quality ball sack the weight of my balls,

512
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.580
they wouldn't be mid thigh.
It actually makes me know,

513
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.380
do they in plastic surgery?

514
00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:40.910
Am I going to see one of the male Kardashians go down there and get a ball tuck,

515
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:41.810
a ball sack Tuck,

516
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:43.883
<v 3>you know,</v>

517
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.450
<v 1>do you have a wrinkly ball sack?
That is so 2018,</v>

518
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.930
come on down and get botox,
Gabby a balls,
botox.

519
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.420
Just listen to what these women have to say.

520
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.030
I never used to lick my husband's balls,

521
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.820
but now that so smooth and not Harry,

522
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.200
I'm down there every night taint.
Um,
all right.

523
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.860
That was my nod to David Cross and Bob Odenkirk.

524
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.090
One of the hardest I've ever laughed in a sketch show

525
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.580
is when they did that fucking sketch about the guy with the giant tape in the

526
00:33:14.581 --> 00:33:19.410
porn industry and how they went.
It was,
it was not that sketch.

527
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.180
I didn't even hear that sketch.

528
00:33:21.181 --> 00:33:26.010
It's the way they went into that sketch where they had like a Batman style
fight.

529
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.020
I can't really remember what happened,

530
00:33:28.021 --> 00:33:30.480
but like you know they were doing the freeze frame on the,
on the,

531
00:33:30.481 --> 00:33:35.100
on the punches they go pow bef you know,
Slam.

532
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.210
And then the last one,

533
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:41.310
this dude look like he kicked the guy in the balls and it just said taint and I

534
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:43.110
was fucking screaming,

535
00:33:43.111 --> 00:33:46.920
laughing because taint was in the white world,

536
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:50.910
a very not known reference at that point,

537
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:55.680
if I remember correctly.
That came out of the African American community,

538
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.823
<v 3>you know,</v>

539
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.630
<v 1>taint pussy tape balls.
It's the taint.
Right?</v>

540
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.460
And that was new to white people.
And I was not ready for,

541
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.880
I think Patrice told me that one.
And I wasn't ready,
uh,

542
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.620
for that to be coming out of that show.
And I was screaming,
laughing,

543
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.250
and my lady at the time who was Caucasian,

544
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.610
she didn't know what I was laughing at,
but I was left.
You know,

545
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:24.430
when somebody laughed so hard,
even if you don't get it,
you start laughing.

546
00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:27.010
That's basically what happened.
And you know what just happened there?

547
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:31.210
You just listened to 34 minutes of my bullshit.
I got you again,
motherfuckers.

548
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.050
All right.
That's the podcast.
Have a great weekend.
You can't,

549
00:34:35.051 --> 00:34:35.884

<v 9>It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,</v>

561
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.760
January 24th,
2011.

562
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.450
How the hell are you?
How are you doing?
Did you have a good week?

563
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.150
Was the world nice to ya?
Uh,
this is a big day for me.
Everybody.

564
00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:58.050
This is my 100th day when I said I was knocking off the booze because I was

565
00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.750
starting to have a big bloated face.
I was like,
fuck this.

566
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.690
I gotta I gotta you know,
gotta get on the treadmill.

567
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.760
I got knock off the booze and I was trying to beat my previous record of going

568
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:13.670
75 days and this time I said,
fuck it.
I'm going for an even hundred.
And uh,

569
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.490
the goal has been achieved.
Javed chief Javed.
Um,

570
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.400
I'm psyched.
I did it.
And a,

571
00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.000
tonight I'm going to the Bruins la kings game down at the staple.

572
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:29.100
Pheta the most unfriendly fan fucking play she'll ever go to.

573
00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:34.470
It's the haves,
the really haves and the have nots.

574
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.220
I broken it down for you before you got all the corporate seats down low.

575
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.350
Sit next,
Diane Cannon.
Jack Nicholson and fucking sissy space sick.

576
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.540
Whoever the fuck else is down there,

577
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.990
all those Douche bags sitting there with their fucking faces yanked back,

578
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.880
you know,
by the way,
how long has Jack Nicholson had going bald for?

579
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.590
It's just fucking unbelievable how long it took for that guy to go bald.

580
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.700
He lost one hair a day since 1972

581
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.370
so do you ever notice that there's certain people,

582
00:37:09.371 --> 00:37:14.330
it just takes for fucking ever,
unless they seamlessly went into a toupee,

583
00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:19.360
but he's bald.
No,
but you know,
being someone who's balding myself,
you know,

584
00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:22.630
I pay attention to that type of shit and I pay,
pay attention.

585
00:37:22.631 --> 00:37:25.660
All these motherfuckers,
I see the receding hairline,

586
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.960
then all of a sudden it's not there.
The next movie.
And I was like,
there you go.

587
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:29.943
Look at that guy.

588
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:34.720
He went out and he got himself sort of a scalped in a user friendly way,

589
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.940
and then they receded the front.
I going out like that.
My goal in life,

590
00:37:39.941 --> 00:37:42.250
I want to look like a Clint Howard.

591
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.670
<v 10>Okay,
Woo.</v>

592
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.570
<v 9>It's not going to end good for me.
Uh,
yeah.
So I went a hundred days,</v>

593
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.970
100 days.
Uh,

594
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.230
when a hundred days add a yes.
And I don't know,

595
00:37:57.231 --> 00:38:00.250
I'm afraid I'm scared everyone.

596
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:04.730
I'm afraid to start drinking again because I noticed that I,

597
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.640
I just pick up where I left off.

598
00:38:07.641 --> 00:38:11.540
Like I really learned about addiction during these last hundred days.

599
00:38:11.541 --> 00:38:16.490
I realized how much shit I was,
uh,
you know,
not,
uh,
addicted to,

600
00:38:16.491 --> 00:38:20.290
to a level that it was like,
you know,
I was coming home and slap it.

601
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.380
My girl around,
you know,
getting on all fours,

602
00:38:24.381 --> 00:38:26.870
growling at my dog as I peed on the stereo.

603
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.660
And then the next morning like I didn't do any time.
I don't remember that.
Huh?

604
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.350
Well maybe I wouldn't drink if you weren't such a cunt,
you know,

605
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.850
I wasn't doing stuff like that.
I was just out having a good fucking time.

606
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.310
I like beer the way I like cake and cookies.

607
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.040
There's really no reason.

608
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.810
There's no reason to have cake or cookies says no nourishment that your body

609
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:53.740
needs.
You don't need that much fucking sugar.
But a,
I like it.

610
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.770
I like the fucking rush,
you know,

611
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.010
is sitting there feeling gloomy.
I hate myself.
What am I doing?

612
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:08.650
Remember when I was young and I just go out and play Frisbee and it was fun,

613
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:12.820
man.
It was simple,
right?
You get older,

614
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.710
you got all this debt,
you got all those bullshit,

615
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:18.820
everybody's fucking Nag and you,
you get the blues.
So you go out,

616
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.940
you get a slice of cake,
right?
Feeling like shit.

617
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.770
Six bites of cake lady.
You're like,
dude,
I am fucking awesome,

618
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.020
right?
You've got that sugar rush going.
So that's what I realized.
I am a,

619
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.770
I have a number of addictions.
I am addicted to sugar.
Not In like a,
you know,

620
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.740
I need an intervention,
but like I fucking crave it.

621
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.080
But if I lay off it for four days,

622
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.040
when if I don't eat any sweets for four fucking days,

623
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:48.490
when I look at a doughnut or a piece of cake,
it's like laughable.

624
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.700
Like why the fuck would you eat that?
Look at it.
He at that,
that at,
at,
at,

625
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.200
at that,
there,
it doesn't even look like real food.

626
00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.460
You know when you're off,
when you're fucking,
when you've kicked sugar,

627
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.120
when you look at a glazed doughnut,
just sitting there all fucking sweaty.

628
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.520
It just looks,
it looks horrible.
It's like why would you do that to you?

629
00:40:10.521 --> 00:40:13.500
So you know,
you look at all the frosting on a cake,
you,

630
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.720
you make that face like he just sucked on a lemon like Jesus Christ.

631
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.570
Enough already that at fucking cut downstairs just slammed the door cause I'm

632
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:26.600
being too loud.
I don't care.
Douchebag.

633
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:31.520
I fucking love old people,
but I hate that motherfucker downstairs.

634
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.980
I fucking hate that guy.

635
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.460
I hate that he's got that classic old person smell.
He does it.

636
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.130
He has a unique smell.
You know what he saw?
He smells like a,
like a fucking,

637
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.650
if you lit a wet dog on fire,
okay,
if you did that,

638
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:53.220
that's what he smells like.
Fucking miserable motherfucker.

639
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:59.130
This goddamn Docker's the original Docker's fucking army navy store shop and

640
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.460
douchebag.
Fucking miserable.
Cont giving me the stink eye.

641
00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:08.030
Every time I walk up the fucking walk a can't stand the guy fucking hate him

642
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.230
there.
I hate them.
I don't give a shit.
Right.
I die.
I'll fucking,
you know,

643
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:17.960
I'll argue that one in the afterlife.
I'll sit right there.
You know,

644
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.490
you drank it drove.
Yes,
I did.

645
00:41:19.491 --> 00:41:23.870
Guilty as charged and treated a lot of women like shit.
You're absolutely right.

646
00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.870
Guilty as charged.
And you had a,

647
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:30.560
you had a poor opinion about the old man downstairs.
Well,

648
00:41:30.561 --> 00:41:33.890
let me tell you something.
Jesus,
you try living above that cunt.

649
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.050
<v 0>Go Talk to your dad.
He made them,
Ooh God.
Oh,
shut up.
You fucking hippie.</v>

650
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.740
Oh geesh.
Um,
so anyways,

651
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.320
so tonight I am going to,
um,
I'm going to go watch the best of the,

652
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.770
of the,
of,
of the four sports,

653
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.630
the four major sports hockey is the best God damn sport out there.
All right.

654
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.440
And uh,
I know a lot of you won't realize that because you never played it.

655
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.610
You never went to a game,
hence you don't know what you're talking about.

656
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.470
You know,
it'd be like me making fun of line dancing.
I've never done it.

657
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.100
You know,

658
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.060
I've never gone out and bought a pair of wrangler jeans that were fucking $8 and

659
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:15.680
nine sizes too small for me.

660
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:20.681
So they cuffed my fucking balls and got out there and stuck my hands in my

661
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:26.030
pockets and did this little fucking,
that little,
oh my God,

662
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:27.830
that fucking line dancing.

663
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.510
Can there be a mass suicide amongst line dancers?

664
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:36.290
Could that just fucking happen in the middle of one of your fucking corn ball?

665
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.130
Stupid ass fucking country music

666
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.500
is country music is,
I don't even know what it's for.
It's for like pod people.

667
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.080
There's absolutely no soul in it whatsoever.
There is aunt.
All right,

668
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.270
they're angry.
Redneck listening to this,

669
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:57.770
punching the dashboard or your Chevy s 10 all right.
There isn't.

670
00:42:57.771 --> 00:43:00.410
It fucking sucks.
And that line dancing,

671
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.210
we sit there with your fucking thumbs in your fucking pocket and you do that

672
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:08.480
little I'm do.
I'm,
I'm actually,
I'm in Dallas,
Texas this week,
so let's,

673
00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:12.800
let's go for big air in this one.
We do that then you're fucking,
I wish,

674
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:16.250
I wish this was a vodcast,
which I'm not doing by the way.

675
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.660
So stop fucking asking me.

676
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.840
The great thing about this thing is you can listen to it while you're doing

677
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:22.190
other shit,
right?

678
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:27.620
Are you or are you not doing other shit right now?
Well,
all right then,

679
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.280
are you or are you not pretending to be working right now?

680
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.210
Looking at spreadsheets,
right?
You want to fucking plane,

681
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.270
Huh?
What are your choices for food?

682
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.550
Aren't you doing that as you listen to this when they quit your fucking bitch

683
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.640
and all right,
so anyways,

684
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:47.410
they do that stupid thing where they banned they're fucking knees and the,

685
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:52.340
and I can't even think of the fucking music by
[inaudible] the Gig,
the Gig.

686
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.210
You right.

687
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.320
None of the music goes and then they do that little thing where they just one of

688
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.560
their,
one of their feet right there,
right foot.
We'll say the right foot.

689
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.630
It's just pivoting on the heel and the toes of face forward and then to the side

690
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:07.250
and then back to the front.
Ah.

691
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.520
Then they do that little thing where they bring their fucking foot up and they

692
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:13.790
spanked the bottom of their foot.
All of them.

693
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.530
He will kills me about those people is they actually think that Jesus loves
them.

694
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.350
I got news for you.
Rednecks.
Jesus is looking the other way.
He's embarrassed.

695
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.080
He's combing his fucking hair into his face.

696
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.640
When he watches you people lined dance.

697
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.360
He is looking that chicken the ring.
Um,

698
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.210
yeah.
So speaking of which I'm going to be,

699
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:38.450
I completely forgot what the fuck I was talking about.
I know.
Yeah.

700
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:43.340
I'm going to go into the hockey game tonight.
La Kings first,

701
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:46.890
the Boston Bruins,
the La Kings,
which who actually have a really good team.

702
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:48.510
I liked that.
I liked that dude.

703
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:53.511
Simmons is fucking fastest health and a Kolbe attack.

704
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.410
Um,
border.
It's the greatest fucking game.

705
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.280
And I've actually been playing hockey recently.
Ice Hockey,
the real fucking deal.

706
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:05.460
And I'm excited.
Guess what?
I learned how to do this week,
42 years of age,

707
00:45:05.461 --> 00:45:09.930
not married,
no kids.
I learned,
finally learned how to stop on both sides.

708
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:16.540
But you know,
it's funny,
I have,
I have to go buy some more hockey stuff.
You know,

709
00:45:16.541 --> 00:45:17.830
it's funny.
Out here in La,

710
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.340
I have to drive all the way down to like Orange County just to find someplace

711
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:26.200
that will sell hockey stuff.
Uh,
but I have to,
even though I suck at this sport,

712
00:45:26.201 --> 00:45:30.640
I just,
I'm just an old man and like it takes about four days.

713
00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:34.030
That's how deep the bruises are.
After I'm done falling on the ice.

714
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.950
And like four days after I play,

715
00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.600
I look like I've been beaten with a fucking bamboo cane.

716
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:46.950
I had a brutal one when I was in fucking Atlantic city last weekend doing the

717
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.350
Miami Heat tour of comedy.
Um,
by the way,
um,

718
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.760
the Atlantic city was so successful.

719
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.880
I just got an email today for an offer up in a fox woods for April 30th.

720
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.340
So I will let you know as soon as I find out.

721
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.680
I might actually have an update right now.

722
00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:09.940
Wouldn't that be amazing right here on the fly as you listened to the Monday

723
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:13.120
morning park?
It's a fuck.
Let's just keep the flow of this podcast going.

724
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.700
I think this was,
I think that's one's gonna be,
it's gonna be a good one.

725
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.150
We're almost 11 minutes in,
things are going well.

726
00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:23.200
For some reason the voice seems way too loud on this thing.

727
00:46:23.201 --> 00:46:27.220
What's going on with this anyways,
um,
yeah,

728
00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:32.221
so I fell on my fucking right ass cheek and hip last time he played before

729
00:46:32.231 --> 00:46:35.960
Atlantic City and uh,
it's one of those seals.
I kept pushing on it going,

730
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.950
I can't believe that didn't bruise.
It's,
it hurts when I touch it.

731
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.480
When I pushed my thumb into my little fucking a right butt cheek,
it hurts.
Right.

732
00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.140
And then like four days later I'm in Atlantic city and I'm showering and I

733
00:46:49.211 --> 00:46:53.950
looked out and it looked like somebody threw a can of grape soda at me.

734
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.710
Uh,
so I will be getting all of the hockey stuff,

735
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.520
which I really didn't want to do because,
um,

736
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.600
I don't want to put it out there that I think I know how to play hockey because

737
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:12.410
I don't,
I just enjoy it.
It's fucking fun.
It's a fast game.

738
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.390
The only equipment I wear is I wear a helmet for my big fucking head and I wear

739
00:47:17.391 --> 00:47:22.310
the full cage in the front because,
uh,
I don't need any hockey scars,
you know,

740
00:47:22.311 --> 00:47:25.430
with the sticks and all that shit.
Why,
why would I do that to myself?
You know,

741
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:30.130
like I'm going to win a cup.
I need to sacrifice.
Oh,
speaking of which,

742
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:34.510
I should probably wear a cup too,
right?
No lifting.
Um,

743
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.470
hang on a second.
We're going into the inbox.
Did I get anything?

744
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.980
Did I get anything?
Nothing.
You motherfucker.

745
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.270
So anyways,
yeah,
so this,
so tonight actually tech,

746
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:50.320
technically I can start boozing.
This is the 100th day,

747
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:52.030
but I gotta be honest with you,
I'm not going to do it.

748
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:55.960
I think I'm going to try to see how long I can go with this.

749
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:57.400
I'm going to wait until there is an a,

750
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:02.430
there was a specific event where boozing makes sense and uh,

751
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.730
then I'm going to knock it off.
Then I'm going to pose,
make people,
what am I,

752
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.840
what am I going to do?
Honestly,
I am,

753
00:48:10.841 --> 00:48:13.150
I never going to have a beer for the rest of my life.

754
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.450
I don't know how those people in Aa do it.
That's like,

755
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:19.900
I have a weird sort of like respect for people in Aa.

756
00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.130
And I also have a,
uh,
a disdain for them

757
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.570
because,
uh,
I went to a couple of Aa meetings,
uh,
not by choice.
Um,

758
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:35.560
the judge told me I had to go
as part of your sentence.

759
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.900
Um,
and I went there and uh,
yeah,
I didn't like it.

760
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.450
I kind of liked it.
I liked sort of the room,

761
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.450
kind of like the only aspect of church that I like.

762
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.780
I like going to church because it reminds me not to be a complete piece of shit.

763
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:53.620
But other than that,
all that stuff about hippies walking on water,

764
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:58.210
talking to bushes,
it just sounds like an acid trip.
And uh,

765
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:01.330
it just,
it's just stupid and there's always a fucking leper.

766
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:04.180
How many fucking lepers were there back then,

767
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:10.350
Jesus Christ get tell me you wouldn't have a fucking giant stick back in the

768
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:16.090
day.
Just for the lepers,
you know,
ugh.

769
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.320
Jesus Christ said,
fucking smash them right in there.
Get the fuck away from me.

770
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.680
You fucking leper.
What would Jesus do?

771
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.470
He has the ability to cure himself.
I don't.
All right.

772
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:33.400
Don't you think that that maybe that's why he was such a good shit because he's

773
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:37.900
the son of God.
He knows he's going to heaven core seats doing the right thing.

774
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:43.020
It's so fucking easy to be a good shit when you can walk on water and touch

775
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:46.750
something and it gets cured.
Of course he's going up and shaking your head.

776
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.580
You fucking freak.
Get away from me.
I can't do that.
You're a leper.

777
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.360
Fuck off Dow.
Go cry to the son of God.

778
00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.600
Um,
so anyways,
yeah.

779
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:06.250
So I would go to these,
these,
these meetings,
these meetings and uh,

780
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:08.700
you know,
I dunno.
I,

781
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.740
I believe in addiction and then other times I just think,

782
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.890
I don't think all those people addicts,
I think some of them,
they are just weak.

783
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:19.030
I can't stop myself.
It's like you don't have

784
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:24.810
like your brain tells you arm to move and pick up something and put it to your

785
00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:25.740
lips.
Right.

786
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.700
Did you guys like alcoholics?
You guys become like such an alcoholic,

787
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:33.590
like the bottles actually talking to you.

788
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.370
I had a fucking buy into that shit.

789
00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:42.820
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

790
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.160
<v 0>You know God damn fucking pussy alcoholics.</v>

791
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:52.450
All right.
Go drink a case of beer.
I understand it.
Puke it up.
All right.

792
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.400
And then take,
you know,
a week or two off.

793
00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.050
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

794
00:50:56.050 --> 00:51:00.970
<v 0>You don't do it every night.
You know,
actually I'm full of Shit.
I,</v>

795
00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:04.450
I 100% believe in that,
that addiction thing.
And I actually believe a,

796
00:51:04.451 --> 00:51:06.070
I actually now,

797
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.390
I now understand after watching the biggest loser every season,

798
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:14.170
I now realize,
yeah,
it is,
it is an addiction.

799
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:20.230
Because every one of those people has some sort of psychological reason as to

800
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:24.110
why they do it.
But wait a minute,
I'm not fat,

801
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.900
but I'm out of my fucking mind.
Yeah,

802
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.140
yeah.
So fuck them.
Yeah.
Right.
All right.
Sorry.
I had to work that out.

803
00:51:32.141 --> 00:51:34.300
Fuck those fat fucks.
Eh,
fuck dumb.

804
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:40.290
I get sad and then I eat 24 cakes.
Well,

805
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.300
how come nobody gets sad and they do set ups.

806
00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:49.430
What's the deal?
I actually,
some people do that.

807
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:54.070
That's one of the last shows they'll do a gym addictions.
You know,

808
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:58.420
they'll do something like that cause I think they're out of boring jobs to try

809
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.770
to make exciting.
Have you seen that?

810
00:51:59.771 --> 00:52:03.940
They actually have a show out there right now about people mining for gold.

811
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.080
You know,
I mean,
mining for gold,
obviously they still do it,

812
00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:09.310
but it's like big business now.

813
00:52:09.311 --> 00:52:13.810
They have these sophisticated machines that cut the tops off of mountains and

814
00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:15.840
then they grind them down like you did with you.

815
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:19.980
A number two pencil in second grade trying to get down to the eraser.

816
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.770
Right?
Okay.

817
00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:28.600
But nobody with a big bushy beard is squatting down like a Chinese gambler next

818
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:32.560
to a fucking river with the Goddamn dinner plate trying to find gold.

819
00:52:32.561 --> 00:52:36.220
But Lo and behold,
they found 10 douchebags who are doing it.

820
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.290
And they decided to make it a show and they decided to fucking have what film

821
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:45.580
these guys arguing each other and play this something dangerous is happening.

822
00:52:45.581 --> 00:52:50.260
Music underneath it.
And I'm sick of it.
All right?
Fuck minors.
Fuck people who,

823
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.010
uh,
make cakes for a living.

824
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:58.030
If fuck those Goddamn crab fishermen get out,

825
00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:00.940
nobody is making you go on that Goddamn boat.

826
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:07.490
Fucking idiots going out there,
risking your lives,
have a flounder,
you know,

827
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.640
just say what you do out loud for a living.

828
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:16.840
Just say it out loud a couple of times to yourself.
I go on a fucking tugboat.

829
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:22.920
Okay.
And I,
I,
I risked my life

830
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.010
to get,
uh,
to get king

831
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.460
<v 9>crabs.
So rich people have something crunchy to eat.</v>

832
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.930
Go Fuck yourself JP Morgan,
you want crab?
Go get it yourself.

833
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.860
What are you fucking options?
Actually,
you know,
so I'm gonna make a fun.

834
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.650
I actually respect those guys cause I have a tremendous,

835
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.960
tremendous fear of the ocean.

836
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.130
A huge fear of people who go out and swim in the ocean.

837
00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:56.840
You're out of your fucking minds.
You're out of your fucking minds.

838
00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.010
I know I've said this before on the podcast,
but you know what I'm going to say.

839
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.570
And again,
I don't give a shit.
I'm edgy.
I'm crazy.

840
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.210
They should make a show about me and my podcast and the dangers of it.
You know,

841
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:14.300
then me and Neil will have fake arguments.
Um,

842
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:16.700
<v 11>yeah,</v>

843
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.210
<v 9>you know,
we'll have shit like plugs or something will go wrong,
you know,</v>

844
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:24.110
I don't know.
I don't have what we're,
where's my Olympus Ls Ted?

845
00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.040
I taught you were going to have it,
then they'll cut to me,
you know,

846
00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:30.920
so I went to go do the podcast and uh,

847
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.900
I couldn't find the Olympus Ellis 10 ditto.
I mean,
I,

848
00:54:35.901 --> 00:54:38.780
I got to get this podcast done by Monday or I don't know what the fuck's going

849
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.530
ahead.
If you notice that,
like I think the Orange County choppers,

850
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:47.830
they basically created the template for all those reality shows and now

851
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.050
everybody does that shit.

852
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:55.370
The exact same thing that would happen on that fucking motorcycle show.

853
00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.760
Uh,
where the,
where the sun would be like,
Eh,
and then we had a problem,

854
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.960
me a the carburetor,
it didn't fit for the carburetor wasn't here.

855
00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:05.300
And then the bar,
uh,
like the,
the dad comes here,

856
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:07.270
<v 12>Yo,
what's going on?</v>

857
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:09.200
<v 9>The carburetor isn't here.
Where are you reading</v>

858
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.850
<v 12>Cobra?
Then he gets on their show.</v>

859
00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.100
Mikey's fucking scared.
Well,
no,
why you will fucking cub Raiders.

860
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.650
<v 9>How fucking jacked is the dad on that show?</v>

861
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:28.800
He could squeeze my entire family to death if he got excited enough.
Um,

862
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:32.410
so now they do that shit like it makes sense on the chopper show,
right?

863
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.670
Bunch of mechanics.
They,
they're wearing their greasy Dickies.

864
00:55:36.671 --> 00:55:38.740
They got butt cracks hanging out death.

865
00:55:38.741 --> 00:55:41.320
They're going to yell and scream at each other.
Right?

866
00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.840
But the fucking idiots making cakes.

867
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.310
<v 0>So we get a job,
uh,
we have to make a cake for the firehouse.</v>

868
00:55:49.311 --> 00:55:53.690
And I decided to do a cake that was shaped like a fire hydrant.

869
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:58.720
I wanted to do a fire hydrant motif with the little a Dalmatian,

870
00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.880
you know,
peeing on the fire hydrant.
But Michael was like,

871
00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.180
I don't think that we should bring a urine into something that's going to be in

872
00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:09.290
your mouth.
It was typical Michael just shitting on my creative process.

873
00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.410
<v 9>Oh,
kill yourselves.
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares about you and your fucking cakes.</v>

874
00:56:15.411 --> 00:56:19.610
And I like cakes.
Yeah.
Do you guys didn't know that about me?
Did Ya?
Let's see.

875
00:56:19.611 --> 00:56:24.611
How will you with 20 minutes in here 20 minutes into the podcast.

876
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.910
Um,
should I do it?
Should I do it?

877
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:33.550
Know I'm going to be a class act here.

878
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:38.560
My condolences to the Chicago bears fans and the fans in New York jets.

879
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:43.780
Uh,
the true fans,
the true sports fans,
the ones that don't talk shit,

880
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.750
the ones who are cool,
the ones who you know,

881
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:50.020
you can actually have a conversation about football with my condolences.

882
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:54.250
Go out to you.
Uh,
believe me as a fan of Boston teams for my entire life,

883
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.420
I know what it feels like to be that fucking clothes and a get kicked in the

884
00:56:58.421 --> 00:57:00.010
seeds against them.
My condolences.

885
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:04.510
Congratulations to the Steelers and the Green Bay packers.

886
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:08.500
And uh,
I would like to open this dialogue.

887
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.920
This is something that bugs me about a NFL football is,

888
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:15.723
is this,

889
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:20.290
I don't get why in every other fucking major sport.

890
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.260
They count championships from 100 years ago.
Like,
well,

891
00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:27.050
let's look at the red sox.
They,

892
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.900
they won the championship and like 1908 or something.
When they had crazy legs,

893
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.520
McGee was playing fucking third base with his giant Ebenezer fucking mustache.

894
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:38.920
They count those,

895
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:44.100
the red sox count five world series titles that we went from 1918 and before

896
00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.050
fucking Montreal Canadians.

897
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:51.140
They Count Stanley cups that they won during that time too.
All right.

898
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.511
The Yankees,

899
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.720
they count all their pre depression era during the depression or whatever.

900
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:57.970
That's right when they started,
when they count all of those,

901
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.880
the fucking Celtics count,

902
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.680
there's from the 60s the fucking Lakers count their championships,

903
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.120
their first two or three it wasn't even the NBA.

904
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:15.130
Those are BB eight championships.
Their first four out of five championships.

905
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.080
We're one before the 24 second shot clock even existed when you could win a

906
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:25.081
basketball game like 17 to 12 they count those.

907
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.260
So my question for spots for sports fans is this,

908
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.770
why don't they count Nfl Championships?

909
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.900
Why do they only count Superbowls?

910
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.150
Because when you just can't super bowls.

911
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:44.230
The Pittsburgh Steelers are are the Yankees that Canadians are the Celtics of

912
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:49.150
football.
But it's bullshit.
It's fucking bullshit.

913
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.830
Because the Green Bay packers have won like 12 or 13,

914
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.070
um,
NFL titles and Superbowls.

915
00:58:57.071 --> 00:59:01.150
They won three Superbowls in like another eight or nine NFL titles that for some

916
00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:02.230
reason they don't count.

917
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.630
The Pittsburgh Steelers were in the NFL when Green Bay was winning all those

918
00:59:07.631 --> 00:59:10.660
titles.
So they had a shot at winning them.
You know,

919
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:12.840
it's as much as I give the Canadian shit going,

920
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:16.000
I you dominated a 16 league,

921
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:18.040
which isn't really true.

922
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.860
They were going tit for tat with the maple leafs until 60,

923
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.290
but the Bruins were in that original six.

924
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:26.210
So we should have dominated and we didn't.

925
00:59:26.211 --> 00:59:29.690
So that's why I shut the fuck up when it comes to that conversation.

926
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.950
So can anybody out there tell me,
why don't they count NFL titles

927
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.080
like I,
I don't,
I don't get that.
I don't get it.
That would be,

928
00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:43.470
if you didn't count that in baseball,
you would have missed out on Babe Ruth,

929
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.630
Mickey Mantle,
Joe Dimaggio,
none of that.
None of that would count.

930
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:54.350
Bill Russell wouldn't count.
It's fucked up.
I think it's bullshit.

931
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:58.520
And I think it's,
I think the,
I like,
I want to go to work.
I love sports history.

932
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:03.670
I want to go to an eagles game and I want to see 1960 NFL champions and I'm not

933
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.950
Kevin Eagles fans,
Shit.
I'm just,
they,
they should have that up there.

934
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.320
The Cleveland browns won it in like a,

935
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:13.760
I don't like 63 or 64 with Jim Brown.

936
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:19.170
The bears won one with Mike.
Uh,
Mike Ditka and uh,

937
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:23.670
what's his face there?
A Dick Butkus right.
They want it.
Uh,

938
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:28.280
the Green Bay packers won a few.
Then the cults with Johnny Unitas,
you know,

939
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:31.640
the ones that they won the greatest game ever fucking played Yankee stadium

940
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.480
giants first.
The colts,
1958.
The overtime fucking victory.
Right?

941
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.250
They don't count any of that shit.
It's,

942
01:00:41.251 --> 01:00:44.480
it's disrespectful to the athletes that played.

943
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:49.800
Those were the best of the best,
at least white guys for,

944
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.960
for most of those years.
But seriously,
there was only one professional league.

945
01:00:53.961 --> 01:00:57.590
So the talent pool was even greater than,
and they don't,

946
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.220
they don't count it.
And I think it's fucking bullshit.

947
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:06.221
And I'm hoping that somebody talks about that considering you have the most

948
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:10.520
successful teams since the Super Bowl era,

949
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:15.530
and then you have playing the most successful team in NFL history.

950
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:21.460
They have one in every area except for the seventies and eighties.

951
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.110
I guess they didn't want a championship in the 2000,
but they,

952
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.040
but they've been competitive or whatever,
you know,
I don't know.

953
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.510
Speaking of which,
you know,
he guys realize that right now Brett Farve

954
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:39.080
is getting sued.
Some of this shit.
This is how fucked up the world is right now.

955
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:44.270
Brett Farve is getting sued by the,

956
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.930
uh,
by two [inaudible] because he tried to get a,

957
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.580
some sort of sexual favors afterwards and they're,
they're,

958
01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:57.400
they're suing for that.
Do you understand that?
The,

959
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.560
let me say that just one more time.

960
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:03.150
Brett Farve is getting sued by a miss Seuss tumor.
SEUSS's does that.

961
01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:06.450
I said,

962
01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:11.320

964
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.110
there's sewing it.

965
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.040
<v 2>Could</v>

I just,</v>

967
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.060
it's fuck it was that will you know what that's like?

968
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.260
That's like me showing a comedy club because I got heckled.

969
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.600
It comes with the job.
There was not any much shoes,

970
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.850
any female my suits out there that listens to this podcast.

971
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.640
Are you honestly going to tell me that?

972
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:46.710
That you've been Robin guys bags in their legs and the chest and all that and

973
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:51.270
you've,
no one has ever asked you for fucking hand job at the end of it.

974
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.310
It fucking comes with the territory.

975
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.970
That's like being a cop in suing the city cause you got shot at all,

976
01:02:59.071 --> 01:02:59.904
right?

977
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:06.110
You fucking put hot oil all over a guy's body and you rub everything but their

978
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:11.340
dick.
I mean,
give me a fucking break.
You got damn cock tease is yeah.

979
01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:13.500
People are gonna ask you to rub one out.
Okay?

980
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.600
And if you had a shred of fucking decency,
you do what?

981
01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.630
You complete the Goddamn job.
All right?

982
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:22.980
Because you're sign says full body massage.
All right,

983
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.340
last I saw my dick is still part of my body.
All right?
You know what the hell.

984
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:29.350
You know what?
Miss Susie is,
I like,

985
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:33.600
they like the fucking quarterback who can't get it done,
you know,

986
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.970
just always comes up a little bit short.

987
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:37.830
They should fucking interview them afterwards.
So,
you know,

988
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:41.700
like what happened in there?
Eh,
you know,
I just didn't just didn't get it done.

989
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:44.490
You know,
it was like right there,
all I do is just reach out and grab it.

990
01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:48.750
And I just,
uh,
you know,
we didn't want it.

991
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.730
We didn't want it as much as they wanted it.
Um,
that's just like,

992
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:57.000
just,
that's such a classic,
uh,
piggyback lawsuit.

993
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:01.470
It's like once that first stupid whore,
um,

994
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.010
you know,
gave Brett Farve Shit.

995
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.330
This is very interesting that I've noticed about horse.

996
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.550
Once one comes out of the woodwork,

997
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.670
then all of a sudden 20 come out of the woodwork,
you know,

998
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:18.720
and then they always try to paint it as well.
We were too scared.
We were scared.

999
01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:19.554
Fuck you.

1000
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:23.700
You where you're trying to make money and you're trying to build on the momentum

1001
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:27.960
of the other case.
That's the female version of pulling a train on somebody.

1002
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.580
You know,
the guy version is,
you know,
you and 80 or friends,

1003
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.030
bang the same girl.
The female version is,
you know,

1004
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:41.031
you're a fucking whore and you're just waiting for a whore to sue a guy that you

1005
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:45.810
fucking banged and then you fucking,
you,
you draft in right behind their lawsuit.

1006
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:47.183
Okay.

1007
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:51.150
Like one of those fucking fairies that rides in that bike race out there in a,

1008
01:04:51.151 --> 01:04:55.850
in uh,
in France that just pissed some people off.
Actually.

1009
01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.360
Do you realize that the level of cardio that you need to compete in that sport

1010
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:03.540
is 10 times that of a professional hockey player?

1011
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.340
That's when you know you're watching a sport that no one gives a shit about.

1012
01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:10.710
When you have to really start bringing up like science,

1013
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:18.310
they did a study,
the heart rate of the average highlight player.

1014
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:23.200
Oh go fuck yourself.
Why don't you take that highlight thing?
It just fucking cup.

1015
01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:26.650
You're nuts.
You're Tate in your asshole and carry yourself out of here.

1016
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:29.350
Why don't you do that?
Does that make sense?

1017
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:33.730
Is that what they do with the highlight sticks
or is it shaped that way?

1018
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.340
It's sort of a,
a,
you know,

1019
01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.770
a user friendly bike seats that you can rock up and down on.

1020
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:46.930
You know what,
I think it's time to read some questions for this week.

1021
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.340
I'm going to say I've,
I've exhausted all improv skills at this point.
Oh,

1022
01:05:51.341 --> 01:05:52.690
first thing I want to tell you guys,

1023
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.330
can you guys do me a huge favor if you're on Facebook?
Um,

1024
01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.830
there's some douchebag pretending to be me on,
uh,
Facebook.
Uh,

1025
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:04.990
just don't add the guy.
He has a Celtics logo.
I don't know what he's doing.

1026
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.030
He's not doing anything malicious.

1027
01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:11.740
He's just pretending to be me and it's really weirding me out.
Um,

1028
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.470
I mean,
I don't know what he thinks he's good.
I mean,

1029
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.840
I can't get laid off of Facebook,
so I don't know what this,
well,

1030
01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:20.440
maybe he's got better typing game than I do,
you know,

1031
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:24.130
but I just don't want that shit to be added to my file down there in Houston,

1032
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.350
you know?
All right.
There's a lot of question out there about,

1033
01:06:29.351 --> 01:06:33.160
you know,
things that happen within society specially,
you know,
this,

1034
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:36.580
this is something that I think a lot of white people need because not because

1035
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:40.510
we're more racist than anybody else,
we just get just the,

1036
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:45.511
the consequences of us fucking up is so much harsher than other people because,

1037
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.960
uh,
you know,
we are the gold standard when it comes to racism.

1038
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.050
We are in the driver's seat right now.

1039
01:06:55.051 --> 01:06:58.440
We have been in the driver's seat for awhile,
basically beating that.

1040
01:06:58.441 --> 01:07:03.180
If we are ignorant assholes,
it has way more effect than when other people are.

1041
01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:07.200
You know,
back in the day when other people were running shit,
that's the thing,

1042
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.460
whoever's on top,
if you're thinking ignorant,
uh,
that's what,
that's why,
you know,

1043
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.610
if you're on top and you're thinking ignorant shit,

1044
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.300
you have to be called on it because,
uh,

1045
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.720
just cause he cause he effect that you can have,
you know what I mean?

1046
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.100
Like if somebody from Bangladesh fucking hates me,
that's such a stupid example.

1047
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.430
Okay.
That,
that's not a race of people.

1048
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:33.430
I don't even know what Bangladesh's and I gotta be honest with you.

1049
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:36.970
I don't even know if that's a city or a country.
Bangladesh.

1050
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.160
Have you ever seen that on the prices,
right?
Yeah.

1051
01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.300
I want to showcase showdown where selling Yoda,

1052
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:47.880
Bangladesh and some white trash person like myself,

1053
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:51.210
sister with a confused look on their face.
Like I don't know where that is.

1054
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.800
Is that where the terrorists are?
I don't want to go there.
Whatever.

1055
01:07:55.830 --> 01:08:00.300
Like a Filipino people fucking hate me.
That doesn't affect my life.
It doesn't,

1056
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:04.290
I'm not going to go and do a job interview at,
at,
you know,

1057
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:09.570
Walmart is not run by Filipinos.
You know what I mean?
You know,

1058
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.410
not saying there's anything wrong with Filipinos.
All right.
See what,

1059
01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.190
see what I have to do with this white person.
They'll say,

1060
01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:17.340
I'm saying I do about Filipino because we clear here.
I don't know.

1061
01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.190
I've never had issues.
I to have a lab of gasoline.
I'm a fucking all that shit.

1062
01:08:21.191 --> 01:08:25.100
You gotta go to the Jerry Lewis voice there lady.
Um,
so yeah,

1063
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:29.000
people have questions.
So here we go.
And I think all races to chime in,

1064
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:30.950
the questions that you have,

1065
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:33.750
if you have feelings about a different race of people and you just think you're

1066
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.040
thinking something funny,
there's nothing malicious,
but is this offensive?

1067
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.980
Is it racist?
This is,
this is the new topic.
Okay.

1068
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.840
And if you feel that I answered these questions like the ignorant white man that

1069
01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:49.700
I am,
uh,
call me out on it.
I'm here.
So here we go.
This first one,

1070
01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.090
uh,
Bill,
is it racist to call Indians?

1071
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.850
Dibbled Dabbous and I'm talking about the Asian ones,

1072
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:02.570
not native Americans.
I'm,
I'm guessing by Debit Dab as you mean

1073
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.930
[inaudible] [inaudible] with the bull.
You're saying like that Debbie Dabu.
Um,

1074
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:11.840
is it racist?
Probably,

1075
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.940
but it's fucking funny.
So that knocks it down a little bit.

1076
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.920
This is what I feel that makes something like racist.
It's like,

1077
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.040
like the reason why,
uh,

1078
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:29.390
that one isn't as offensive is because we haven't,

1079
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.190
we never enslaved them.

1080
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:36.410
That's the reason why white and black shit is so sensitive is because of the

1081
01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:40.490
shit that we did to him.
But we haven't really fuck with those people.
You know?

1082
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:44.850
So
if the black version of that was,
is it,

1083
01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:49.730
is it offensive to black people?
Hey man,
mother fucker or whatever.

1084
01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.390
Yes.

1085
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:54.980
That would be offensive if you did some sort of mocking of the way they spoke.

1086
01:09:54.981 --> 01:09:56.030
Yes.
That would be,

1087
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:01.820
that would be offensive if some CEO was giving a speech and I was driving a,

1088
01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:06.821
actually I was having someone else drive my town car and we drove by a group of

1089
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:12.110
a young mother fuckers and uh,
they proceeded to walk forwards.
Yeah,

1090
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.940
you'd have to apologize.
So I guess,
yeah,

1091
01:10:13.941 --> 01:10:17.120
I guess technically new Manabu like that would be,

1092
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.960
that would be offensive.
Is it racist?
Um,

1093
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:29.060
this is what I really,
I really,
it's hard for me to say because [inaudible] had,

1094
01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.950
it's what's in your heart,
you know,
cause I make fuck I really,

1095
01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:37.850
I make fun of,
of everybody,
you know,
I mean,
I play a game out here,
uh,

1096
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:41.600
when someone is make,
let me ask you,
I've got questions for you.
Is this racist?

1097
01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.760
I have a game out here when I ride around with Nia and she does not approve of

1098
01:10:46.761 --> 01:10:50.000
this to keep her in the clear,
she does not approve this.

1099
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:55.070
When somebody makes a more chronic move in front of me,
you know,

1100
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:59.180
driving,
you know,
just makes a fucking horrific move.

1101
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.180
I play a game called old or Asian

1102
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.580
and you have to guess when cause I'm going to pass the person cause I got to see

1103
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:11.510
what they look like.
You know,
whenever somebody does something fucked up,

1104
01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:13.180
some comedians do great joke about that.

1105
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:17.460
You just want to see what the fuck they look like.
Right.
Uh,
that's the game.

1106
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:22.290
Older Asian.
So as I speed up my little hybrid to try to pull parallel to them,

1107
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:25.080
I always say,
what do you say?
You,
what are you going with all the ration?

1108
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.590
What do you got?
Older regime.
She goes,
I'm not playing this game.
That's Maine.

1109
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:31.350
And then I was gone.
I'm going to go with old and then I pull up,

1110
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.370
oh it's fucking Asian.
You know?
Or Oh I nailed it.
It was an old guy.

1111
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.210
So,
uh,
is that racist?
I'm sure it's offensive,

1112
01:11:40.211 --> 01:11:43.030
but within the context of my own car,
you know,

1113
01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:47.350
I'm not yelling at anybody and I got to admit,
you know,

1114
01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:50.260
there's a lot of truth in the fucking game.
Yeah.
Jesus,

1115
01:11:50.261 --> 01:11:54.700
I'm gonna have to apologize next week on the podcast.
So I would say that,
uh,

1116
01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.430
Indian people,
why don't you chime in?
I would say that,
yeah.

1117
01:11:58.431 --> 01:12:02.620
That they would find that they would find that offensive.
Um,

1118
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:08.770
is it racist?
Let me see if I can use it in a sentence here.

1119
01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:14.960
Hey,
uh,
you know,
I called up customer service and uh,
you know,

1120
01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:18.110
one of those stupid dub was answered and tried to tell me that his name was

1121
01:12:18.111 --> 01:12:22.150
Steve and act like he was in Kentucky.
But I,

1122
01:12:22.151 --> 01:12:24.020
I know that he was actually an India,

1123
01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.950
cause what he talked to you is go double double words.
How can I help you?

1124
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:32.820
Um,
is it racist?

1125
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.180
Probably.
You know what,

1126
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:42.020
something bad has to happen between white culture and,
uh,
or,

1127
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:46.460
or western culture and Indians.
So,
you know what I mean?

1128
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:50.930
It's like a,
it's like you're playing a team and there's no rivalry.

1129
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:57.160
Like patriots verse jets this year was like a whites and blacks.

1130
01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:00.010
It was bad.
It was a lot of hate,
you know,

1131
01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:04.960
but like patriots verse like the Fucking Lions,

1132
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:09.690
you know?
Yeah.
There's gotta be some shit targets.
It's knocked out,

1133
01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.430
but it still hurts if somebody says something mean.
I don't,

1134
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.460
I really don't.
What the fuck I'm talking about?
All right,

1135
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.490
let's move to the next one.

1136
01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.760
The next one on the new controversial topic on the Monday morning podcast.

1137
01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.750
Is it racist?
All right,
here we go.
Um,

1138
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:34.120
Bill,
I had an interesting experience today apparently involving me as a racist.

1139
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:39.130
I was walking with two of my coworkers who are both black.
Old G is,
here we go.

1140
01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.160
Um,
we were going to go get some lunch.

1141
01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:46.270
One of my coworkers who I'm also friends with,
uh,

1142
01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:53.080
did a little high five fist bumps shuffle with one of the female six security

1143
01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.820
guards at the front desk.

1144
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.940
Knowing both of them and how they interact with one another.

1145
01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:03.800
I kind of made a in passing comment to the tune of man,

1146
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.970
you guys in your handshakes while obviously laughing,

1147
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:13.450
laughing while obviously laughing at just how choreographed it was in more or

1148
01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:16.420
less picturing them in a studio or something,

1149
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:20.950
working out the logistics to get the fucking handshake.
Perfect.
Anyways,

1150
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.750
we all laughed and moved on and we got our lunch.
All right,

1151
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:28.150
so nothing wrong yet.
So you're cool with these people.

1152
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.110
You made a joke and everybody laughed.
No problems,

1153
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:37.390
no problems so far.
Um,
however,
after coming back through secure,

1154
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.010
uh,
back through security,

1155
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:43.810
I noticed the security guard stopped me and Kinda had a scowl on her face.

1156
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.760
I thought she was mad at me for something,

1157
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:50.761
but it turned out she was mad at this other lady who was black because she

1158
01:14:51.731 --> 01:14:55.120
overheard my comment and was telling,
uh,

1159
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:59.500
that security guard that she couldn't believe I had the nerve to say something

1160
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:04.420
like that.
And I should be ashamed also to the point where she could,

1161
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:05.500
um,

1162
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.310
almost to the point where she could actually go complain to the human resource

1163
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.060
people because she was offended,
um,

1164
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.430
et cetera without even considering that.

1165
01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:20.020
Maybe just maybe I was talking about the security guard and my coworker and not

1166
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:21.940
all black people now.

1167
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:26.890
It being corporate America in all I'm sure rather than even face the possibility

1168
01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:28.000
of any bad press,

1169
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:32.260
they'd rather just sweep me out the door and completely ruined my re any

1170
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.790
reputation I may or may not hold at the company just to save their own asses.

1171
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.940
I feel I did nothing wrong and had no intentions of ever doing anything wrong.

1172
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:42.843
Anything wrong,

1173
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.720
I'm not going to go on and on about how I kiss black babies and try to

1174
01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.360
rehabilitate inner city schools because I don't,

1175
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:54.510
but I'm certainly not some corn fed rebel flag waving ignorant product of what

1176
01:15:55.271 --> 01:15:56.410
might be incest.

1177
01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.850
I guess my question is do we really have to walk on eggshells when we are just

1178
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:05.851
making casual conversation that just any that just any con can pick apart,

1179
01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:12.850
select the context that they might think it is in and then start crying foul.

1180
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.690
Basically.

1181
01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.230
I would have liked to call that woman a con and told her to go fuck herself.

1182
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.890
Well,
let's just say I was already kind of worried about my job.

1183
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.950
I'll write,
see,
um,
yeah,
I think this is,

1184
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:31.980
this is the classic one where you were fucking around the other two people knew

1185
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:33.551
you were fucking around,

1186
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:38.020
but that one person decides to get offended and then you have to go on TV and

1187
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:38.680
apologize.

1188
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.680
Which personally I think is the wrong move because when you apologize now it's

1189
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:48.610
like you're,
you're admitting that you meant it in a bad way.
I mean,

1190
01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.290
the apology I would do there and say,
look,
you know,

1191
01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:52.900
I'm sorry that you didn't understand that I was joking,

1192
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.450
but I'm not going to sit here and apologize like I have any,

1193
01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:00.310
any sort of ill will come in your way,
you know,

1194
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:05.080
but I,
but just to avoid the problem in the future,

1195
01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.430
uh,
white people do not use the expression you guys or you people

1196
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:15.670
when talking about black people,
that's just,
it's just not going to,
you're,

1197
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.570
you're setting yourself up for someone to get offended.
And,
um,

1198
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:25.950
there's a weird sort of a push poll going on with that whole,
uh,

1199
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.290
you guys in new people thing where,
um,

1200
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.610
with somebody white says that there becomes this concern of,

1201
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:41.810
um,
that you're separating.
You're separating like,
yeah,
you know,

1202
01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:46.550
you people over there with how you live your lives and where over here,

1203
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:49.820
black people have that weird relationship with white people where they're like,

1204
01:17:49.821 --> 01:17:54.400
you know,
can you stop stealing our fucking music and our culture?
Eh,

1205
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:59.390
but then like,
if something,
you know,
hey,
let's pave the streets,
you know,
well,

1206
01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:02.060
make sure you do it in our neighborhood.
We're all in this together,
right.

1207
01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:05.360
All of us together.
You know what I mean?

1208
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.590
So let's set weird sort of fucking push pull thing going on.
So yeah,

1209
01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:14.570
just avoid,
uh,
avoid the whole fucking,

1210
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:18.970
um,
yeah,
you fucked up.
You did fuck up,

1211
01:18:18.971 --> 01:18:22.840
but you left yourself open for a sucker punch by saying you guys,

1212
01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.080
you know,
uh,
that's,
I guess that that's what it is.
I don't know.
That's,
that's,

1213
01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.590
that's my,
I basically a white guy telling a white guy how he fucked up.

1214
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:36.940
So black people feel listened to this thing.
Uh,
please,
please help me out here.

1215
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:39.490
Did I basically get it right?
Is that essentially it?

1216
01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.710
And I know most people wouldn't get offended.
Uh,
but that,

1217
01:18:43.711 --> 01:18:46.320
that's one of those things like that girl getting offended and then you've got

1218
01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:47.800
to worry that you're going to lose your job.

1219
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:52.950
It's like those fucking piggyback whores who massage guys for a living.

1220
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.660
You know,
some of those messsage state,

1221
01:18:55.690 --> 01:19:00.190
they'll actually come to your house and give you a full body rubbed down with

1222
01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.170
oil.
Okay.

1223
01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:06.430
And then have the fucking nerve to get upset that you try to get a hand job,

1224
01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.510
<v 0>the end of it,
you know,
give me a fucking break.</v>

1225
01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:16.380
Why don't you fucking misuse broads man the fuck up and start rubbing one out?

1226
01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:20.590
Is it that God damn hard,
no pun intended.

1227
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.900
Is it that fucking difficult
to just fucking,
you know,

1228
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:31.510
it's like you're revving a motorcycle.
That's it.
That's all you gotta do.

1229
01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:35.980
Up and down,
up and down with that dead fucking oil.
You in and out.

1230
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.850
You want that house on the hill,
sweetheart?
There's a price to pay.
All right.

1231
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.450
<v 9>Now when a quarterback who owns every fucking record,</v>

1232
01:19:45.451 --> 01:19:49.680
good and bad in the Goddamn universe,
asked you to rub one out.
God Damn it.

1233
01:19:49.681 --> 01:19:53.900
You fucking rub one out.
Well maybe you don't blog in this business sister.

1234
01:19:53.901 --> 01:19:56.630
That's right.
Stare at your fucking manicured toes.

1235
01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.880
Pedicured whatever the fuck you supposed to say.
Um,

1236
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:04.100
Jesus Christ mean spirited.
Alright,
so there you go.
That's the new,

1237
01:20:04.101 --> 01:20:07.920
that's a new topic.
Is it racist?
And I would to hear,

1238
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.560
um,
some honest comments from a non white people about their thoughts.

1239
01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:19.080
You know
the fucked up ones too.
Okay.

1240
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:23.550
Cause I've watched enough spike Lee movies to think that evidently it's just us.

1241
01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:27.240
But I've hung around enough people from different races to realize,
oh yeah,

1242
01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.070
everybody's like this.
Everybody has their little fucked up thoughts.

1243
01:20:32.071 --> 01:20:34.920
You guys ever see that Broadway play?
They got that song.
Everybody.

1244
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:38.880
Everyone's a little bit racist.
What does that the alphabet city one,

1245
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:41.400
whenever the fuck it's called.
I actually enjoyed that,

1246
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:44.970
actually went to a Broadway musical and there was puppets in it and I had a

1247
01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:49.200
great time.
How about that?
What does that say about me?
Um,
all right,

1248
01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.070
let's get on with advice.
Advice for this week.
All right,
advice bill.

1249
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:57.230
Let me set this one up for you cause it gets a little complicated over there.
Um,

1250
01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.470
I went to a New Year's Eve party with my best friend of 13 years.
Oh Jesus.

1251
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.500
Oh by the way,
this guy uses so many fucking names.

1252
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:08.670
I'm just going to use the names.
All right.
I know I don't name names,

1253
01:21:08.671 --> 01:21:09.540
but fuck this guy.

1254
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.840
There's like 15 fucking names and then he goes back to the first name,

1255
01:21:12.841 --> 01:21:17.100
back to the seventh name.
So fuck it.
I'm naming names.
All right,
so here we go.

1256
01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:22.050
I'm suspending that rule much like they suspended the salary cap and NFL

1257
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:25.770
football this year.
Same Way.
All right.
All right,
Bill.

1258
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.670
I went to a New Year's Eve party with my best friend of 13 years mark.

1259
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:35.460
I got really drunk and hooked up with my friend John's ex girlfriend,

1260
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:39.330
Anna John and Anna had dated for two years.

1261
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:44.570
John broke up with Anna back in September rather harshly and immediately started

1262
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:49.570
banging other girls and,
and I also work together.
Oh Gee.

1263
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.600
And we've become good friends.
Here we go.
So hooking up seemed inevitable.

1264
01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:00.600
Our friends have even joked about it.
Hey,
if you guys like fucked each other yet,

1265
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:05.790
you guys want to get wings.
Um,
anyway,

1266
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:10.860
I had been dating this girl Sarah since October.
We never got too serious.

1267
01:22:10.861 --> 01:22:15.270
We kind of agreed to take a break when she left to go to London for spring

1268
01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:16.104
semester.

1269
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:21.600
Mark's girlfriend who happened to be a cunt is best friends with Sarah.

1270
01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:24.300
All right.
Are you like me?
Are you're already lost?

1271
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:26.820
Are there too many fucking names here?
Let's go back to the beginning.

1272
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:31.920
Mark and I got really drunk.
No,

1273
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:35.190
I went to a newsy party of my best friend mark.

1274
01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:38.220
I got really drunk and hooked up with okay.
Marks.

1275
01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:40.950
His friend John has the ex-girlfriend.
All right.

1276
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.600
It was like a fucking mini series they had to show you clips from last week.
Um,

1277
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:50.130
so anyways,
he's dating some current named Sarah.
They agreed to take a break

1278
01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:52.500
and the girl,

1279
01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:57.450
you're taking a break with his best friends with your friend's girlfriend mark.

1280
01:22:57.510 --> 01:23:01.590
Okay,
I got it.
All right.
I'm up to speed here.
So at this party and an eye,

1281
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.670
this is John's ex and an I get pretty drunk and start making up.

1282
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.700
None of our friends were there except for

1283
01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:16.740
Mac Mac site and got upset you fucking pussy and just had to leave.

1284
01:23:18.670 --> 01:23:20.470
Oh my God.
Really?

1285
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:25.240
Like some 15 year old girl.
Exactly.

1286
01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.350
Anna and I went to her place and proceeded to do some stuff.

1287
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:34.360
We didn't bang that night,
but oral sex and whatnot was traded and we passed out.

1288
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:37.750
We both agreed that nobody needed to know what happened.

1289
01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:40.930
I went to Mark's house later,

1290
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:46.300
New Year's day and said nothing happened with Anna and I and I,

1291
01:23:46.301 --> 01:23:49.720
and by the way,
we just made out.
I figured that was enough for him to know,

1292
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:52.810
not to tell anyone,
especially his fucking girlfriend.

1293
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:57.220
Neither of US brought it up for the next four days and it seemed like everything

1294
01:23:57.221 --> 01:24:01.750
was fine.
Couple of days passed out of nowhere.

1295
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.840
Mark asked me if I was going to tell John that Anna and I made out.

1296
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.020
I was sort of taken aback as you should have been

1297
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.240
sort of taken aback by the question,
but I told them I hadn't planned on it.

1298
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:21.560
He said he wouldn't tell John if I didn't because he didn't want to be a bad

1299
01:24:21.561 --> 01:24:22.880
friend.
All right,
good man.

1300
01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.870
I told him that it wasn't a big deal that we just made out and he was being a

1301
01:24:26.871 --> 01:24:29.690
huge bitch.
That was a bad move on your part.

1302
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.630
Even though he was being a huge bitch.
You shouldn't have said that.
All right.

1303
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:37.340
Because he's acting like a fucking chick right here and hell has no fury like a

1304
01:24:37.341 --> 01:24:40.550
woman scorned and you just score in that fucking bitch man right there.

1305
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.120
All right,
so you can guess where the fuck this is going.
Okay.

1306
01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:50.020
And then asked him if he told his girlfriend about it and of course he said yes.

1307
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.050
When I asked him why the fuck he did that,
he said,

1308
01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:59.230
because I needed to know if I should tell John Jesus Christ.

1309
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.710
I proceeded to call him a bitch.
Good man.

1310
01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.000
And let them know how much of a bitch move it was to tell his girlfriend.

1311
01:25:08.001 --> 01:25:12.590
Especially since he acted like everything was fine for four days.
Yeah,

1312
01:25:12.591 --> 01:25:15.830
this guy is beyond a pussy.
This is the kind of guy who like,
you know,

1313
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:18.470
does he like Bake Brownies?

1314
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:23.090
See One of those guys who like doesn't mind going shopping with his fucking

1315
01:25:23.091 --> 01:25:25.460
girlfriend.
You know,
it's funny that I just said that I actually,

1316
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:29.090
I'll bake brownies in a fucking second.
I'm such a fucking hypocrite.
All right,

1317
01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:30.230
let's,
let's finish this.
All right.

1318
01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.850
Nobody needed to know about what happened and now he told his girlfriend,
Sarah,

1319
01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:41.030
um,
uh,
this isn't my fault.
Once again,
he fucked up the sentence.

1320
01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.570
Nobody needs to know about what happened and now he told his girlfriend Sara

1321
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:48.410
would definitely find out.
I knew Sarah wouldn't care about me.

1322
01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:51.950
Drunkenly hooking up with Anna,
but it's still something she didn't need to know.

1323
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:54.020
Oh,
Sarah is the fucking Twat and went to Europe.

1324
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.190
Somehow I was able to leave mocks house without beating the shit out of him.

1325
01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.390
I called John who was spending winter break in El Paso and told them what's,

1326
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.253
what happened.

1327
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:07.940
He said he didn't really give a shit and agreed it was fucked up for mark to say

1328
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.000
anyone,
anything to anyone,
especially as girlfriend.

1329
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:16.001
When I told mark he could have asked anyone else about whether or not his bitch

1330
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:17.990
ass should tell John what happened.

1331
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:23.060
He said he asked his girlfriend so he could get a serious opinion as if being

1332
01:26:23.061 --> 01:26:26.300
told to keep your fucking mouth shut.
You little girl from either one of you,

1333
01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:28.310
either one of our tenants.

1334
01:26:28.311 --> 01:26:32.720
So close guy friends wouldn't have been a serious enough opinion anyways.

1335
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:36.140
I just needed your validation and how much of a bitch mark was about the whole

1336
01:26:36.141 --> 01:26:37.070
thing.
Also,

1337
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:41.450
Anna and I decided to start sneaking around and are banging each other.
No harm,

1338
01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:42.284
no foul.

1339
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:47.480
Feel free to add onto the story of him and you read any podcasts.
Yeah,
Dude.

1340
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:50.480
Yeah,
that's,
yeah,
that guy right there at that guy.

1341
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:54.590
You need to cut out of the loop.
Okay.
That is,
um,

1342
01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.170
that's it.
You,
you forfeited your fucking guy card.

1343
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.580
It's over.
You can't be trusted.
You think like a woman,

1344
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.170
which is fine.
There's nothing wrong with thinking like a woman,

1345
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:13.520
but just go hang out with a bunch of women now.
What a fucking,

1346
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:15.343
ugh.

1347
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:20.450
Do the amount of shit that has gone down that I have fucking,

1348
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:23.000
I am so buried in me that I don't even remember it.

1349
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.610
The Mount of fucking shit

1350
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:33.080
is ridiculous and I don't even bring it up when it's me and just the other dude

1351
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:38.240
who did the,
the dirty shit.
I'll fucking bury it in a second.

1352
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:39.650
I know exactly how to do it.

1353
01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:44.370
When I meet your fucking wife or your girlfriend.
I'll fuck yeah.

1354
01:27:44.410 --> 01:27:48.500
Fucking look you right in the AIAA,
sweetie.
How are you?
You look great.

1355
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:51.110
You've been going to the gym at that.
Fantastic.

1356
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.870
I'll tell your guy is such a sweetheart.
God Damn it.

1357
01:27:53.871 --> 01:27:55.650
The other day there was a cat stuck in the trees.

1358
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.040
The first guy up to even wait for a letter,

1359
01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.820
a just started climbing up there.
What a swell guy.

1360
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:06.230
Even if it's a Dick,
even if it's a fucking Dick,

1361
01:28:06.231 --> 01:28:08.750
what I'll then do is I'll just avoid his girlfriend,

1362
01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:10.940
but I'm not fucking bring it up to that guy.

1363
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.380
Really needs to go get his fucking tubes tied.
What a fag.

1364
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:21.260
All right.
Two
youtube videos of the week.

1365
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.380
Youtube.
Um,
all right.

1366
01:28:24.381 --> 01:28:29.360
This one is fucking absolutely insane.
And if this was made by white people,

1367
01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:33.440
this would actually be considered racist on some level,
but it was actually made,

1368
01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:37.700
I don't know if it's Japanese,
Chinese people,
whatever the name of the video is,

1369
01:28:37.701 --> 01:28:38.534
how to poop.

1370
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:46.400
And it is an animated cartoon teaching children how to,
uh,

1371
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:51.430
go poopy in the toilet and it is fucking insane.

1372
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:54.860
It's fucking insane.
It's great.

1373
01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:00.460
If you really have a problem in your life that is just weighing on you and it's

1374
01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:04.050
sucking the energy out of you and you just need to clear every thought from your

1375
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:06.390
brain.
Please watch how to poop.

1376
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:09.160
Just go to the M podcast.com we've got all these videos.
This is,

1377
01:29:09.170 --> 01:29:13.830
that's the official fan site of the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,

1378
01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.930
just please go and watch this thing.
It's fucking awesome.
Uh,
we got really good,

1379
01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:22.770
I got three really good youtube videos this week.
The next one is,
uh,

1380
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:28.410
this guy made a federal reserve music video that you have to see.

1381
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.760
It's a,

1382
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:34.080
he's doing basically assigned parody of the police's a song.

1383
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:36.240
Every breath you take,
it's fucking great.

1384
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:39.210
The guy actually has a really good voice.
This is fucking funny as hell.

1385
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:43.620
Now the great one.
And then the last one is,
uh,

1386
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:48.760
it's just a highlight video of Jim Brown and there's so many,
um,

1387
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:53.810
fans that say Jim Brown is overrated and he couldn't play in today's NFL.

1388
01:29:55.210 --> 01:29:57.540
You just look at this highlight reel,

1389
01:29:57.570 --> 01:30:02.550
the balance and the power that this guy has is,

1390
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:07.470
it's unfucking.
He,
he's like running sideways half the time or running backwards,

1391
01:30:07.471 --> 01:30:11.850
just plowing over people.
The combination of balance of power is like,

1392
01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.450
it's,
it's foreshadowing to Earl Campbell,

1393
01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.000
Earl Campbell's the only guy I've seen with like runs like this.

1394
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:22.890
And for everybody who thinks Jim Brown couldn't play,
now you're,

1395
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:26.580
you're 100% wrong and I know what you're gonna do.

1396
01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:29.520
You're gonna look at how tall he was and how much he weighed and say he would

1397
01:30:29.521 --> 01:30:33.570
get crushed in today's NFL.
That's the wrong way to look at it.

1398
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.510
If he took Jim Brown and you put them in the modern era,

1399
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:41.700
which you have to do is also give them all the modern trade,
uh,
nutrition,

1400
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.940
all the modern sports science and all of that.

1401
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:49.800
So he would look like today's NFL football with his,
with his skills,

1402
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.740
his God given strength and balance,

1403
01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:56.610
and he would fucking tear up the goddamn league.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1404
01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.200
I don't want to hear another argument.

1405
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:02.790
I'm sick of people bringing up fucking guys from nowadays where they're taken

1406
01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:06.690
fucking horse Trancle tranquilizers and you tell him he would have dominated in

1407
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.690
1950 I would have dominated in 1950.

1408
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:14.990
Somebody 50 years from now could dominate the NFL right fucking now bigger.
Yeah.

1409
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.710
It's called advancement.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1410
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.230
Morons.
Alright.
Overrated.
Underrated for this week.
Overrated.

1411
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:30.260
Every minority and woman in commercials playing the straight man to the dumb

1412
01:31:31.051 --> 01:31:35.520
white guy.
I'm not racist or misogynistic in the least bit,

1413
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.690
but enough is enough.
Uh,
dude,
that's fucking hilarious.

1414
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:41.970
And that's another thing that uh,

1415
01:31:41.971 --> 01:31:44.880
that's not minorities or women's fault.

1416
01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:48.240
That's because of all the fucked up shit white people have done and we don't

1417
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:50.430
want to get sued.
That's why they're doing it.

1418
01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:54.480
Not because they're trying to be sensitive to other sexes or other races.

1419
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:58.170
They just make the white guy be the stooge and all these fucking commercials

1420
01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.320
cause they don't want to get sued.
But yeah,
it's starting to get annoying.

1421
01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.500
There's always like the black guy shaking his head as the fucking white guys

1422
01:32:06.501 --> 01:32:09.160
slamming himself in the face with like a fucking rake.

1423
01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:14.530
That's not the way you though it.
Um,
that was actually a man,
woman one,

1424
01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.620
remember that one where the woman's sit there at the computer and that their

1425
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:22.240
husband is outside fucking,
he's got to go.
There's a beehive,

1426
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.860
any stake taking like a broom handle and he's shoving it up the fucking beehive.

1427
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:30.400
And then he gets stung and she's sitting there rolling her eyes like,
ah,

1428
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:34.050
my husband,
he's a fucking retard.
Uh,

1429
01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.880
and they do that between men and women and race and the fucking,
uh,

1430
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:43.270
the white dude always has to be the moron.
But I mean,
you know,
it is what it is,

1431
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:47.920
but you know,
you should be happy white person who wrote that,

1432
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:52.390
that they had that.
That's the way they balance it out.
You know,

1433
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.960
you're still winning,
so quit your fucking crying.
All right.

1434
01:32:55.990 --> 01:33:00.990
Also overrated in real life and not what I see on TV is the female carpenter or

1435
01:33:03.071 --> 01:33:05.170
construction worker I get,

1436
01:33:05.171 --> 01:33:10.171
I get that you've got to make up and try harder for all the bullshit you deal

1437
01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:14.320
with.
For Fuck's sake.
Crack a smile for once in your life.

1438
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.210
I really don't know what he's bitching about.

1439
01:33:16.211 --> 01:33:20.710
Their female construction workers don't smile enough.
Um,
alright.

1440
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:25.000
Underrated the PJ's Eddie Murphy was brilliant and the claymation was the shit

1441
01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:27.330
back in the day.
Why the fuck don't,

1442
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:32.050
why the fuck that show isn't on DVD is a crime to all comedy.

1443
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:37.051
One of the few shows that is actually better with closed caption on a number two

1444
01:33:37.961 --> 01:33:39.130
real musicians.

1445
01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:43.420
Anybody remember these people that naturally play actually play their

1446
01:33:43.421 --> 01:33:46.180
instruments and none of that fucking auto tuners,

1447
01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:50.950
sampling machine and turntables,
all of those are not fucking instruments.

1448
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.510
Um,
wow.
I mean,
you know,

1449
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.910
I've actually come to a place where I can,

1450
01:33:57.911 --> 01:34:01.510
I can understand the brilliance of being able to take pieces of,

1451
01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.250
so I think the way that the Beastie boys did it on Paul's Boutique where you

1452
01:34:06.251 --> 01:34:10.030
took like 10 or 12 different samples,

1453
01:34:10.031 --> 01:34:13.300
looped them together and created a new song.
I mean,

1454
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:18.260
there is there that is a talent,
you know,
turn tables.

1455
01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:22.540
That's just,
I don't get that shit.
That's just,
I don't understand that.
Um,

1456
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:27.300
I'm too fucking all to get that and I don't get,
I don't get mashups.
I've,

1457
01:34:27.301 --> 01:34:28.560
I bitched about that before.

1458
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:34.030
Mashups are the emperor's new clothes of music.
Okay.

1459
01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.490
All you have to do is pick two songs that are the same temple.
Okay?

1460
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:40.720
Same beats per minute.

1461
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:44.770
Then the lyrics will fit on that other one.

1462
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:49.520
Then all you have to do is just one that where the lyrics fit the mood of the

1463
01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.440
new music.
You're putting it over.
That's not that fucking difficult.

1464
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.140
If he got sad sort of music,

1465
01:34:57.110 --> 01:35:01.190
pick another sad fucking song and just stick that music under those sad lyrics.

1466
01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:05.420
As long as the tempo is the same and yeah,
it's going to work out.

1467
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:11.870
Daddy took jingle bells and blended it with Santa Claus is coming to town.

1468
01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.793
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1469
01:35:15.330 --> 01:35:18.070
<v 9>What else do we got?
A road trip.
Road trips with you.</v>

1470
01:35:18.071 --> 01:35:21.780
Fucking bug buddies never gets old.
That's,
that's absolutely true.

1471
01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:26.430
That's why the hangover was such a great fucking movie.
A real lemonade.

1472
01:35:26.431 --> 01:35:28.830
Not that coke and Pepsi packaged garbage,

1473
01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.210
but real shit with fucking pulp and flavor.
I like this guy.

1474
01:35:33.211 --> 01:35:37.020
This guy's into old shit.
You know a pen and paper.

1475
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:39.390
Not This fucking laptop horse shit.

1476
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:44.760
I don't remember my laptop ever crash and I've actually said that.
Um,
all right,

1477
01:35:44.761 --> 01:35:47.010
that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody,

1478
01:35:47.011 --> 01:35:51.210
I hope you had a great week.
Um,
and once again,
I'm looking forward to,

1479
01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.150
<v 0>to the,
uh,</v>

1480
01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:57.700
the Steelers Greenbay championships and do me a favor bring up all green bay's

1481
01:35:57.701 --> 01:35:58.570
NFL titles.

1482
01:35:58.571 --> 01:36:02.380
I would really like to try to start an underground debate about that because I

1483
01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:07.381
want them to start counting NFL titles and I want to see NFL franchises fly

1484
01:36:07.631 --> 01:36:11.770
those NFL championship flags.
You want it,
you know,

1485
01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.300
I didn't think the AFL one should fly those flags.
It's part of the history.

1486
01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.680
You're a fucking nerd.
Like me.
I liked that type of shit.

1487
01:36:20.681 --> 01:36:23.980
I'm actually reading a book right now called the greatest game by Richard
Bailey.

1488
01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:27.880
Ah,
somebody gave me this book and uh,

1489
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.710
it's actually about the Bucky dent red sox.
Um,
that one,

1490
01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:34.540
one day playoff game.
And you know,

1491
01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.780
that's a great thing about the red sox finally winning a world series and

1492
01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:38.703
they're wanting another one.

1493
01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.850
I can actually sit back and read this book and it is,
um,

1494
01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:48.540
it's a fucking great read.
It's a great read.
I recommend it.
All right.
That's it.

1495
01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:51.090
That's a podcast for this week.

1504
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:25.080
Oh,
we in Tarrytown music hall on the 17th of February,

1505
01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.460
Miami beach.
We have a new theater.
Um,
they had me booked in another one,

1506
01:37:29.461 --> 01:37:32.010
but they had already booked another act there,
so they had to switch it up.

1507
01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:37.200
I'm actually going to be at the new World Symphony Theater,
uh,
on 17th Street,

1508
01:37:37.201 --> 01:37:41.340
Miami Beach,
Florida on the,

1509
01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.330
The Tower Theater in Philadelphia.
The guy.

1510
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:45.810
I've got a bunch of new dates on the website,

1511
01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:49.860
tower theater in a Philadelphia on April 9th.

1512
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:54.540
And um,
this is the last one here.

1513
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:59.160
I'm going to be at the paps.
Fuck.
Ah,
Jesus Christ,
the linkedin work.

1514
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.490
I would be at the,
you know,
I was having such a great podcast too.

1515
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:06.900
On April 22nd I'm going to be at the PABST theater in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

1516
01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:09.960
Um,
and right off the bat,
I just want to tell you,

1517
01:38:09.961 --> 01:38:13.150
I'm blown away about how many tickets sold the first day.
Uh,

1518
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:17.460
Milwaukee was one of those cities where I was like,
you know,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1519
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.890
I Dunno if I'm gonna sell tickets there.
You know,
it's not like New York.

1520
01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:27.780
It's not Chicago,
it's not La,
you know,
so it's not one of those kinds of cities,

1521
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:32.220
but I don't,
it doesn't strike me as a gator dad kind of city either.

1522
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.080
It's one of those middle ground ones.

1523
01:38:34.081 --> 01:38:35.730
So I don't know where the fuck I'm going to fit in it.

1524
01:38:35.731 --> 01:38:39.600
So I want to thank everybody in Wisconsin who went out and bought tickets.

1525
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:41.993
<v 11>MMM.</v>

1526
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:43.560
<v 9>Especially,
Oh,
you know what?</v>

1527
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:48.000
Somebody sent me a fucking email if I can just from Escanaba Michigan saying

1528
01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:51.060
they were coming all the way down because they remembered back in the day.

1529
01:38:51.061 --> 01:38:55.740
I played a college up there and the upper peninsula of Michigan and they said,

1530
01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:57.463
uh,

1531
01:38:57.750 --> 01:39:02.750
I went up in front of 17 people in a cafeteria and evidently I killed.

1532
01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:07.170
So the fact that I actually put on a show in front of 17 people,
see how it,

1533
01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:11.430
see how that new comedians,
if you're listening to this podcast,

1534
01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:14.880
those fucking shows matter.
Years later,

1535
01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.540
they'll actually show up if you give them hell in front of 11 people doing a

1536
01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:24.240
nooner in the upper peninsula,
Michigan.
I actually fucking remember that Gig.

1537
01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:27.540
I did a couple of gigs up there though.

1538
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:29.550
That's an amazing group of people who live up there.

1539
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:33.210
I like how they embrace winter.
They really have no choice,

1540
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:38.130
but they actually get real fucking a snow storms.
You know where you come out,

1541
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:40.200
you open your door,
you know,

1542
01:39:40.201 --> 01:39:43.140
and you get buried by like nine feet of fucking snow.

1543
01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.860
You're walking down the street on your snow shoes and you're stepping over like

1544
01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:51.330
frozen elk.
Right.
You know,
and they just stay.
Just stay.
Embrace it.

1545
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:53.140
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1546
01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.670
<v 9>As opposed to all the pussies down here,</v>

1547
01:39:54.671 --> 01:39:56.350
every time there's four inch is a fucking snore.

1548
01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.590
Every god damn fatty is running down to the fucking supermarket.

1549
01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:03.640
Like they're going to starve to death.
I just want one news guy.

1550
01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:08.650
During all that insanity,
we're going to get six to eight inches.

1551
01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:09.971
It's like,

1552
01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:14.470
do you realize six to eight inches of snow it that would barely reach the

1553
01:40:14.471 --> 01:40:16.420
average person's up to their calf.

1554
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:22.350
And considering you can last about 35 days without food as long as he had,

1555
01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:27.280
as long as you have water.
Okay.
And Snow is water.
Stick it in your mouth.

1556
01:40:27.281 --> 01:40:31.390
See what happens.
All right.
You gotta be fucking fine.
All right.

1557
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.310
So sit tight.

1558
01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.693
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1559
01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.290
<v 9>All right.
Their sport.
That's what I wanted to say.
I want to,</v>

1560
01:40:39.291 --> 01:40:42.650
I want them to just fucking sit there and watch the weatherman losing his

1561
01:40:42.651 --> 01:40:43.484
fucking mind.

1562
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:49.010
All excited that he's the focus this week on the Goddamn fucking newscast.
Right?

1563
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:52.250
Or that night or the newscast.
And then when they go back to the anchor,

1564
01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:55.630
who's fucking co-anchor cause he's the god Damn Alpha male.

1565
01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.840
I want them to dress down that fucking that goddamn a weatherman,

1566
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:07.120
four inches of snow.
Jesus Christ.
I could stick my dick in that.

1567
01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:11.470
You could still see the shaft.
The fuck are you talking about?
Go Fuck Yourself.

1568
01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.810
All right,
that's it.
That's a podcast for this week.

1569
01:41:13.811 --> 01:41:16.050
You guys have a great weekend yet.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1570
01:41:17.230 --> 01:41:18.063
<v 11>Don't take any shit.</v>

1571
01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.433
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1572
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.960
[inaudible]
