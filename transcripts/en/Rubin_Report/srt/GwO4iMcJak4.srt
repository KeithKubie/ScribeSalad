1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] joining me today is the
president of the Hertzel Institute in

2
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:07,801
Jerusalem,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:12,450
the Director of the John Templeton
Foundation project in Jewish Philosophical

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:16,620
Theology, and the author of several books,
including the virtue of nationalism.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,160
Your arm has xone. Welcome to the
Rubin report. Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,994
It's great to be here.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,420
I am glad to have you here because as
I said to you in the green room just a

8
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:24,871
moment ago,

9
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,800
you're one of about 12 people that I
see on Twitter that doesn't completely

10
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,760
enrage me. You actually make a little
bit of sense on that Twitter machine.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,260
That's the highest compliment.
I can positively pay any of that,

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,170
that that's a pretty serious compliment.

13
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,660
And I don't know how many
people would agree with you,

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,930
but I'm glad finally to meet with
that background. That's that.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,580
That's wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So,
okay. So before we get into the book,

16
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,500
and it's called the virtue of nationalism,

17
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:54,420
and just even just saying
the word nationalism sort
of sets bells off for a lot

18
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,090
of people. So we're gonna,
we're going kind of, uh,

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,130
quantify and qualify what
that word actually means.
Uh, you were born in Israel,

20
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,800
you live in Jerusalem. Now. Tell me a
little bit about your background. Well,

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,320
in between the being born in Israel and
living in Jerusalem, I actually, you can,

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,910
you can hear the, my Irish
American education not to
fully Israeli accent. Yeah.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,090
So I, I grew up in, uh, in
Princeton, New Jersey and, uh,

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,850
went to school there. I
met my wife there, uh, uh,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920
did a doctorate at Rutgers and you're
buying in political theory and um,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,780
and then, uh, Julian,
I moved to Israel. We,

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,790
uh, I worked for a while for net
to now for a few years, uh, quite,

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,350
quite awhile ago already.
Uh, and then set up a, uh,

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,600
a conservative think tank
called the Shalom Center,

30
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:50,601
which did about 20 years of of work trying
to figure out what Israeli and Jewish

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,590
conservatism would, would be
like. We have nine kids and,

32
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:59,220
uh, which is probably the, the,
the, the biggest achievement.

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,980
And I've been kind of pulled back.
You've,

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,970
you've noticed in the last few years
pulled back into American and European,

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,050
uh, issues, because, you know, for,

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,740
for most of my life I felt like Israel
was the front lines and that, you know,

37
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,050
that that's where I was really needed.
And these days,

38
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,380
like for the first time in my
life, I feel that, you know,

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,200
America and Europe are actually kind
of in worse shape than Israel is.

40
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,000
So what do you mean by that?

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,160
How was Israel at the front lines where
that's now shifted is really used to be

42
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:34,080
a, uh, I mean, it still is to
an extent a, a, a strong and uh,

43
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,370
I'm sorry, as a small and
struggling country, um,

44
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,070
in, in a sense like the,
the edge between, uh, the,

45
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:47,340
the order of the Western world
and kind of kind of, uh, uh, uh,

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,260
chaotic bedlam and ended a little, uh, uh,

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,520
needed a lot of help in order
to strengthen itself. Uh,

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,950
America looked fine for
most of that time. And, uh,

49
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,820
today I think the situations almost
flipped where Israel is the strongest that

50
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:08,590
it's ever been. And in a lot of ways,
uh, as, as, as defeated many of its,

51
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,270
uh, of the problems the dog
did in the last generation. Um,

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,630
and, uh, and America's fraying and,

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,800
and the UK is fraying. And, you know,
I don't have to tell you, I mean,

54
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,740
it's not like, uh, Israel is, is, is
going to do well if, if, you know,

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,320
the entire west kind of disintegrates.
So,

56
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,850
um, so I've spent the last
few years, uh, and that,

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,980
that's how we know each other
through, through, through,
through Twitter and, and,

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,780
uh, uh, writings that are
directed and trying to, uh,

59
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,670
to help American,
the UK and other,

60
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,570
other western countries with the issues
that I think are facing them now.

61
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,810
So we're going to spend most of the
interview, obviously talking about issues,

62
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:57,130
but nine kids living in Jerusalem,
what's living in Jerusalem? Like,

63
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,340
I feel like it's probably,
maybe not, probably, maybe,

64
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,370
maybe exactly the most misunderstood
place on planet earth for good reason.

65
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,560
Oh, Gosh. I mean it's, it's, uh, in,

66
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,340
in some ways it's just a
dream, you know, I mean, I, I,

67
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,640
I walk on Friday night with
my, uh, uh, we have, uh, uh,

68
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,270
twin twin 10 year olds,
and I walk with them to synagogue.

69
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,160
We walked down the hill to synagogue and,
uh, and you can see the whole city from,

70
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,330
from where we are, cause it's
kind of on a hill. And, um,

71
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,150
and uh, you know, for,
for, for a Jew it's some,

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,460
it's really kind of a miracle that after
a couple of thousand years in which my

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,870
ancestors were,
were praying,

74
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,650
please God bring us back so that one
day we'll be able to, you know, to,

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,600
to see the Jews returned to Jerusalem
and we actually get to see it.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,860
So it's, it's incredibly
moving and it never loses its,

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,690
it's magic. But, um, you know, on
the other hand, it's also, you know,

78
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,190
it's also a very real place in, in,
in, in a very real political location.

79
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,990
And, um, uh, today everything
is basically, you know,

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,700
quiet and peaceful and Jerusalem pretty
much all the time. But, um, you know,

81
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:23,170
just if you go, go, go back
just to the mid two thousands,

82
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,161
uh,

83
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,210
we had a period where there were literally
bombs going off in the cafes and the

84
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:33,100
buses of, of the city every
day. And, uh, and when, uh,

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,580
Israel invaded, uh, Bethlehem, um,

86
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,970
to put in an end to
this, my, my wife and I,

87
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:44,260
then we were living on the southern
part of the city. And, um, you know,

88
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,790
we walked hand in hand up to a hill
from which we could see the, the, uh,

89
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,800
Israeli armor entering the city and the,
the tanks shooting.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,350
And W I mean,
it's like what you see on television,

91
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,070
except we just sat there and watched
it with it, with our own eyes. Um,

92
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,370
so, uh, you know,

93
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:09,320
we had six months at that time in which
we had helicopter helicopters patrolling

94
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:14,030
over our house every night. And,
uh, and so it's both things.

95
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,870
It's both. Um, the, it, it,

96
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,220
it's both the front lines
of civilization and, uh,

97
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:25,790
and you can feel the fragility of,
you know, what we've built. We can,

98
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,070
you can feel that it's fragile.
And,

99
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,040
and know that nothing is certain
about what's going to happen next.

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,080
On the one hand, on the other hand,
it, you know, you on a daily basis,

101
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:40,630
you're connecting to a history of
thousands of years and to, uh, you know,

102
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,600
biblical hopes and aspirations
that you know, that for, for,

103
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,240
for people in, in America, it's mostly
school books, but for, you know,

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,250
the things that you learned as a kid in,
in,

105
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,050
in school or in Sunday
school or someplace, but, uh,

106
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,420
or you hear from your grandparents. But
here we're really doing it will really,

107
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,640
uh, recreating, uh, uh, a Jewish
country after thousands of years. So,

108
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,780
uh, it's, it's the highest and the lows
and, and it's an extraordinary life.

109
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,950
Do you think in a weird way
that the threat of bombings
or terrorism or whatever

110
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:18,460
else is going on or the general seemingly
existential threat because it's such a

111
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:23,020
small country actually helps the
ingenuity that comes at Israel?

112
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:27,310
Because I remember I was there a few
years ago during the stabbing sprees and I

113
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:32,080
went right into the old city of Jerusalem
and you know, my mom was texting me,

114
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,400
you know, you, you don't have to go there.

115
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:37,600
And I just went right in and I remembered
there was a certain tension, you know,

116
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,590
it was kind of looking around,

117
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,070
but I went into the Arab quarter and I
walked through the gate and somebody had

118
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:45,580
just been stabbed there the day
before and I thought, you just,

119
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,010
you just have to keep going.
If people can live like this,

120
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,640
I can certainly do it for one day of my
life, for a couple of hours in my life.

121
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,560
Yeah. I, I, first of all, I'm,

122
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,970
I'm real pleased that you did that. You
know, a lot of people just get scared and,

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
and, and, and, you know, seeing
something, seeing something on television,

124
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:07,810
sing some violence and then deciding
you're going to live your life.

125
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,290
You're going to decide where you're going
to go and what you're going to do and

126
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:16,020
what you're going to save because you
saw something on TV and got scared. I,

127
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,380
I mean, I understand it, but, but I
don't think it's the best way to live.

128
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,000
And,
um,

129
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,810
well you can also see that these
people live on top of each other.

130
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,790
These quarters are right
on top of each other.

131
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,630
And I had CANASTA and the Arab quarter
and I had falafel in the Jewish quarter

132
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:34,320
and everyone's existing and not killing
each other. I mean, that's the truth.

133
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,450
Truth,

134
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,090
right? They, uh, they do.
Uh, but our, you know,

135
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,570
our future depends on, on, you
know, countless little act of,

136
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,620
of, you know, of bravery like that.
Like, I'm not going to be deterred.

137
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm going to go eat,
I'm going to go eat that fell off.

138
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,820
I'm going to lead a normal life here.

139
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,570
That's what builds the normal life is
people like you saying that. So, uh,

140
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,470
it's, uh, there really is a, uh,

141
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,470
a daily effort which, um, uh,

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,480
which is built on countless small
acts of, uh, uh, of bravery.

143
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,870
And, uh, um, there,

144
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
there's a ton mutek a famous telemetric
saying how it's in the can that be slim

145
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,250
that, uh, the land is only, um, one, uh,

146
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,990
through hardship. And these are little
tiny hardships that, you know, some, some,

147
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,650
some something scared you,
something feels field feels uncomfortable,

148
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:34,690
but you're going to do the
right thing anyway. It's good.

149
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,700
It's good to live that way.
It's good to live, not afraid.

150
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,400
Well said. All right, so let's talk
about nationalism because as I said,

151
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:46,430
if you just say the word nationalism
or if you say I'm a national list or

152
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:47,264
anything like that,

153
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,290
the connotations or the implications
are that you're somehow racist.

154
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,450
You're Zena phobic, all of
these things. So first off,

155
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,320
can you just define at least in
your view what nationalism is?

156
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,990
Sure. Um, I, I actually, I, I grew
up in a nationalist house, you know,

157
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:06,910
meaning like, like many Israelis
doing, it's not just Israelis, um,

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,230
people in India, people in
Ireland. There's a lot of
countries in the world where,

159
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,980
where people still remember that a
national movement is, uh, is, uh,

160
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,660
a struggle against empire.

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,280
And so it's a struggle for freedom
and it still has good connotations.

162
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,320
Um, so in, in those kinds of
traditions, uh, which I draw on in, in,

163
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,700
in my book, nationalism is
understood to be a, uh, uh,

164
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,080
a principled stand point that
sees the world is governed best,

165
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,880
uh, when it consists of
many independent nations.

166
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:44,770
So each nation will have its own laws,
its own traditions, it's own, uh,

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,040
language and religious,
uh,

168
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,080
customs and will live
independently without being
forced to live a certain way,

169
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,700
uh, by, by, by, by other nations.
Mine, right? And this is,

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,770
this is basically how we've viewed the
world for the last hundred years or so,

171
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,340
right?
I mean,

172
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,940
most relatively sane people that there
are countries and they have borders,

173
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,830
they're different units. They can
negotiate together, right? But, but, but,

174
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,440
but it's not, uh, um,

175
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,370
it's this way of viewing the world is
about three or 400 years old in its

176
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:24,540
current version. In the book, I
actually argued that, uh, that,

177
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,230
that this is a biblical ideal, right? You,

178
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,540
you don't find the Greeks or the Romans,
uh,

179
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,680
painting a picture of a
world of independent nations
that that vision of a world

180
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:38,760
of independent nations is a, is
something that inherits a, I'm sorry,

181
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:43,170
that that enters our
inheritance, uh, from, uh,

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,810
from Hebrew Bible. And then it
appears throughout, you know,

183
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:49,010
throughout Western history
in various forms in, uh, in,

184
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,150
in various parts of
Christian Christian history.

185
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:56,151
So in its current form that the feeling
of a just world of free world is one of

186
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,710
competition among independent
peoples. Um, it, it's about,

187
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,740
depending on how you count, it's about
three or 400 years old. The first,

188
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,410
the first country in Europe to, to, um,

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,030
to explicitly declare
independence is, uh, is, uh,

190
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,180
England and 1534, um, uh,

191
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,250
Henry and read the eighth says,

192
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,290
we're not even formally going to be
part of the holy Roman empire anymore.

193
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,920
We're just, we're just independent.
We're doing our own thing. And that,

194
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,540
that model was picked up by,
uh, by the Dutch, by the Scots,

195
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,680
by the Swiss, by the French,
by various others. And, uh,

196
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,990
and then becomes kind of the basis for
a, uh, an ordering of the world where,

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,640
where this became more
and more the intuition.

198
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,510
Of course there were plenty of plenty
of empires during those times in lots of

199
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:50,260
injustice. And, and I, I don't want to
turn it into like some kind of, you know,

200
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,400
utopia or something wasn't,
but slowly the,

201
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,170
the idea that there's something good
about allowing nations to, to, to,

202
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,220
to go their own way and to be free,
that that did become the common,

203
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,900
a common sense view and still was
up until up until World War II.

204
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,280
I think it was really only
in the 1960s that, um,

205
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,720
that academics and intellectuals
really turned against,

206
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,240
against this idea and began arguing
that nationalism is just, you know,

207
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,850
is just an evil. Right. So
what shifted then in the 1960s?

208
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,660
Because when you talk about nations with
borders that can decide what they do

209
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,380
within their borders and that people
can have a nationalism that they can be

210
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,050
proud of that is in xenophobic
or racist or the resident,

211
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,010
I think that makes sense to most people.
Right. I, it is, you said common sense,

212
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,810
it strikes me as common sense.

213
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:45,400
So what happened in the 60s was that sort
of a latent period after World War II,

214
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,540
that these ideas bubble
up through academia. It's,

215
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,490
it's all about the trauma of World
War One and World War II. It,

216
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,070
it's all about that. And um, the, uh,

217
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,690
beginning immediately after
World War II, um, there were, uh,

218
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,700
Marxists and there were liberals who
said, ah, look, Hitler's a nationalist.

219
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,110
And it's true that Hitler called
himself a nationalist. I mean, it gets,

220
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,400
are called himself a nationalist,

221
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:15,970
but he's actually an imperialist
because from the very beginning,

222
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,170
his goal was not for Germany to,
you know, to, to be independent.

223
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:24,010
His goal was for Germany
to become, as he said, uh,

224
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,830
Lord of the Earth,
mistress of the globe.

225
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,130
So Hitler's not, not, you know,

226
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,530
our traditional idea of a national piece,

227
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,580
understanding of rationalism right
there. Right. Because if he had been, uh,

228
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,910
if just if you had been a nationalist by
the strict definition that he wouldn't

229
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,890
have wanted to do anything
outside. Right. So,

230
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:44,050
so he would have been
terrible for Germany,

231
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,240
but not necessarily a s, uh, starting,

232
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,610
uh, world war with France and England
and Russia and everybody else.

233
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,250
It would have been terrible
for Germany anyway, but,

234
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,330
but you can't call him a nationalist.
According to my tradition,

235
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,640
if his dreams aspiration is not the
freedom of his people, his dream,

236
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,230
you know, among other peoples,
his aspiration is to, is
to rule the globe. Right?

237
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:14,060
Was expanding. Okay. So, uh, so
imperialism versus nationalism,

238
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,740
that's for people who are nationalists
instead of critics of national for people,

239
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,690
our nationals. That's the big
divide. Um, is, are you looking,

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,800
are you willing to give the respect of
self determination to many nations like

241
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,130
your own, um, or, or are, are, are,

242
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,990
are you really just looking to conquer
the world? So after World War II, um,

243
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,310
various, uh, uh,

244
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:45,310
anti nationalist theories that hadn't
succeeded in getting traction up until

245
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:48,560
then got a huge boost from the fact that,

246
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,500
that Hitler was a national socialist.
And,

247
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:56,450
and that when he spoke about imperialism,
use the word nationalism and, um,

248
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,230
and um,
the,

249
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,570
the academic intellectual culture,

250
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,670
let's say it was still
still producing defense of,

251
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,990
of nationalism against imperialism
still through the 1950s.

252
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,880
But by the time you get to the
1960s, you get, um, Ellie Kaduri is,

253
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,830
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a famous
pro imperialists scholar who,

254
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,160
um, uh, wrote a book called nationalism,

255
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:29,060
which is kind of an anti
nationalist manifesto that, um,

256
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,170
blames nationalism for both World
Wars and a and says it's on,

257
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,700
it's unworkable for all
of the arguments that,

258
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,010
that are familiar to people
today are already in Kaduri.

259
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:45,800
He's a work that, uh, that
the divisions among peoples,

260
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:50,690
by creating independent states, you
create borders, borders are, are, are, uh,

261
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,490
always something people argue about.

262
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:57,350
That itself produces wars and triggers
wars and, and, and then the, uh,

263
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,450
the thinking that your country is great,
right,

264
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,790
and making your nation great again,
that kind of stuff that, it, uh,

265
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,800
the argument is that that kind
of nationalism necessarily
produces hatred and,

266
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,820
uh, hatred, violence, war intolerance.

267
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,300
It kind of takes all of the, you
know, the worst things of, of,

268
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,230
of recent centuries in the
past. And pins it on, on this,

269
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,060
this one word in this one idea.

270
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,930
So if that's not the case,

271
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,450
how did these ideas than pick up,

272
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,810
is this just sort of where we see this
now in academia where they just sort of

273
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,610
pick ideas that they sort of all agree
on are true and then it just runs

274
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,260
throughout,
uh,

275
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,520
the universities and then eventually
trickle down in the media and then get,

276
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,460
gets broadcast. The universities are, um,

277
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,040
are a hot house for the
development of ideas is, you know,

278
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,140
in principle is a really, really
wonderful to be good, right? In principle,

279
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,680
it's a really wonderful thing,
but, uh, but because, uh,

280
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,180
academia is overwhelmingly,
I mean, you know,

281
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,360
consists of, um, uh, uh,

282
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,870
a debate between kind of
Neo Marxists, uh, who,

283
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,340
who wanna you know, who, who,

284
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,420
whose aim is to achieve
justice by undermining pretty
much all inherited ideas

285
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:19,650
one after another. So there's
that. And then there's,

286
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,060
there's the great majority
of academics who are, uh,

287
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,720
who are liberals and,

288
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,590
and don't necessarily
agree with the neo Marxism,

289
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,780
but it turns out that they're not
very good at, uh, at, uh, at, at,

290
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,250
at resisting it. So academia
ends up being a, um,

291
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,240
um,

292
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,240
a fight between two universalist
visions and they're both utopian.

293
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:49,380
One is, is a neo Marxist Universal's
vision, which is utopian.

294
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,270
And the other is the liberal
universalists division,

295
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:56,040
which is Utopian and ideas
that are like nationalism.

296
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,990
Um, was there a particular artist
that are arguing for, uh, the, the,

297
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,060
the goodness of the justice of,

298
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,770
of defending your own people looking out
for their interests, their tradition,

299
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,604
their culture,

300
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,380
that kind of thing violates the
universalism of both the Marxists and the

301
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:18,300
liberals. Right. So have we watched
sort of the failure of liberalism here?

302
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,650
So if the Neo Marxists and the postmodern,

303
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:24,300
it's even if they're a smaller
percentage at the universities,

304
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,330
then the liberals that
the liberal somehow,

305
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,940
this is what I've been trying to noodle
through for the last couple of years ago,

306
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:34,340
that the liberals, somehow you
didn't have enough to stand on to,

307
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,360
to stop the bad ideas of the neo Marxist.
Yeah, exactly. You and you and you can,

308
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,580
you can actually see why because, because,
um, uh, the, the Neo Marxists have,

309
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,990
have a, I mean, the, the, the, the
agenda evolves and it develops, but,

310
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,880
but it's always, um, a, you know,
a very clear, uh, picking out,

311
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,240
picking out of ideas that need to be
destroyed and uprooted picking out of,

312
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,620
you know, institutions that need to
be destroyed and uprooted. They're,

313
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,520
they're constantly saying, to get
justice, then we need to overthrow this,

314
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,790
that, and the other thing. And the
liberals, they're responses. Uh, no.

315
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,790
Everybody just should be free
to do whatever they want.
And, you know, of course,

316
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm very sympathetic to that, but,
but what you say, it's not enough.

317
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,630
It's not enough. When that's
the contest. One side is saying,

318
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,430
here's a really clear agenda for, for
what we gotta do in order to, to, to,

319
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,770
to fix the problems in the world.
And the,

320
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:29,010
the liberals are always some one
form or another of saying, well, no,

321
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:32,040
let's just everybody, like everybody
should do whatever they want and that,

322
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,960
that's not good enough.
If you,

323
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,430
if you're fighting a strong vision of,
you know,

324
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,600
what would be right,
you need an,

325
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,930
you need to counter it with
a strong vision or you lose.

326
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,490
And that's what happened.
I mean,

327
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,680
that's what I'm seeing right now with
the liberals in the United States.

328
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:48,130
It's like

329
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,500
this, this ever, uh,

330
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,890
dissipating group of people that are
sort of standing on quicksand because the

331
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:58,120
left, the neo Marxists have sort of taken
over the Democratic Party in all of the

332
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,380
apparatus of the left.

333
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,180
And then you have liberals who now mostly
secretly agree with conservatives in a

334
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,570
lot of ways, right? But they can't,
but they're afraid to say that.

335
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,330
And then there we're just watching
them whittle away. It's, it's,

336
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,650
it's sad to me in, in many ways for the,
for the ideas that I care most about.

337
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,860
Well, we don't know how it's going.
I don't, don't get too sad. You know,

338
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,400
we're really bad at predicting
what's gonna, what's gonna happen.

339
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
People are just bad at it. So, um,

340
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,660
we got to figure out what's worth fighting
for and we may win, we may lose. But,

341
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,050
you know, it's, um, um,

342
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,140
it's a mistake to think that we know
how it's all gonna turn out. We, we,

343
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,160
we just don't right now. Nobody, well, if
we knew I wouldn't be doing this, so I,

344
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:41,980
nobody predicted the, the, the,

345
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:46,180
the collapse of the Soviet Union or almost
nobody and nobody predicted the, the,

346
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,580
the, the rise of, of Brexit and
Trump and nationalism now where the,

347
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,070
that the housing bubble,
we're just, we're terrible at,

348
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,450
at seeing the future.
What we gotta do is we've,

349
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,550
we've got to think strategically about,
um,

350
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,950
what kinds of ideas that are out there
and what's needed and we need to work to

351
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:06,420
build up, um, uh,

352
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,010
an alternative framework that's going
to be more conservative and more

353
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:14,720
attractive and, and, and, and, and,
and capable of, of, of rallying people,

354
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,880
which, which I, I think liberalism is,

355
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,100
is less and less capable
of doing these days.

356
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,210
So, and I've seen you do some Twitter
threads on this sort of thought.

357
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,090
So I obviously want to talk about Trump
and Brexit and how they fit into this

358
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:25,924
conversation.

359
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,020
But, so if, if liberalism has
a certain, uh, fault here,

360
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:36,530
what are the answers that conservatism
has that you would say could stop some of

361
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,500
the rise of this new homework and stuff?
Conservatism,

362
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,480
the word conservatism refers to two
different political movements, which are,

363
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,430
which are traditional based,
their traditionalist. Um,

364
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,520
so conservatism is not,
it's not a universal theory,

365
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:58,320
so it's not like Marxism or liberalism
where you take a Marxist or a liberal and

366
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:03,210
they'll tell you, um, how the whole world
should think, you know, in all times.

367
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:07,260
In all ages, every place in the world.
Conservatism is not like that because,

368
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,100
because, uh, being a traditionalist
means, you know, I may,

369
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,810
I may respect more or less
the traditions of, uh,

370
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:20,760
of, of the Russians or the Chinese or
the, the, the Indians or the Germans,

371
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,110
but, but all those trades,
each, each one of them is
different, right? So, uh, so, uh,

372
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,000
some of them are like more in
some of them, like less in,

373
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,150
in the American context or let's
say the Anglo American context.

374
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,470
To be a conservative means a
specific thing. It means to be a,

375
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,890
to believe that the Anglo
American political traditions,

376
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,590
political and religious traditions are a,
uh,

377
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,390
an extraordinary achievement that
they, they are one of the, the, the,

378
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,590
the greatest, if not the greatest,
one of the greatest traditions, um,

379
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,370
that have ever been developed
in mankind's history.

380
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,150
And that most of,
um,

381
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,910
what we value in, in what we
love about the modern world, uh,

382
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,130
whether it's, uh, uh, the, the,

383
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,610
the idea of limited government
or a individual liberties or,

384
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,910
uh, or the, the, the, the kind of
science that that grows out of, uh,

385
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,063
uh,

386
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,360
out of Newton or the kind of culture
that grows out of a common sense,

387
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,930
skepticism. Um, all of these things there,

388
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,670
they're part of the Anglo American,
uh,

389
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,260
inheritance of a, an empiricist
attitude towards knowledge. Uh,

390
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,910
a common law tradition tradition, which
is not based on, on universal rights, but,

391
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,380
but which pioneered a freedom
of speech and freedom of, of,

392
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,030
uh, of, um, uh, of, uh, of property.

393
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,110
In fact, Mo, Mo, most of,

394
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,660
of what's in the American bill of
rights is these traditional English,

395
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,570
uh, English rights, which were
not developed by liberals.

396
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,360
They were developed by
conservatives fighting against, uh,

397
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:12,270
against the authoritarianism of,
uh, let's say the stewards. Um,

398
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,570
so when we talk about conservatism,
we're,

399
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,110
we're not talking about, um, there's, uh,

400
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,100
one set of ideas that are
eternally always true.

401
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:29,660
We're talking about a tradition of a
certain nation or a group of nations,

402
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,170
which by trial and error,
right? So it's empirical, right?

403
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:37,640
By trial and error over over centuries,
over thousands of years in fact,

404
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,890
have succeeded in,
uh,

405
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,130
developing and stumbling upon things that
are just spectacular and that are kind

406
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:50,560
of a gift to, to the rest of,
of mankind. And today what,

407
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,960
what we're seeing is that the,
the educational institutions,

408
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,220
rather than saying,
look,

409
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:02,720
let's take a look at the traditions of
this nation and, uh, and, uh, you know,

410
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,860
the thousands of years of development
going all the way back to the Bible,

411
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,950
let's see how it contributed
to, uh, the things that,

412
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,930
that we care about,
that that's what a conservative would do.

413
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:17,520
And say what contributed to,

414
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,040
to the things we care about and how
can we strengthen those strands in the

415
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:26,450
tradition, both nationally and also
in our, in, in our personal lives.

416
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:31,451
How can we live as conservative people
who will raise children to respect the

417
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,760
things that should be respected.
That's what conservatives focus on.

418
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,863
And so they're playing,

419
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,010
conservatives are always playing
a completely different game from,

420
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,330
from liberals.

421
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:46,020
Liberals are trying to try to tell you
some abstracts that have rules that if

422
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,570
everybody were to follow them,
then everything would be great.

423
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,250
And conservatives say there is no
such abstracts that have rules that if

424
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:57,000
everybody follows them, everything
would be great. What there is is um,

425
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,650
nations handing down a way of life
which have some good things about them,

426
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,880
some bad things about them,
but,

427
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,720
but everything that's good about them
is coming down from that tradition.

428
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:11,610
So we need to be working on
strengthening it and, and, and, and, uh,

429
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,130
and, and, and improving
it. So as we're watching,

430
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:17,970
what I would say is sort of the collapse
of liberalism on the left and now

431
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,710
there's sort of all of these refugees,

432
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:23,220
many of whom have been in this very
studio and who watched the show.

433
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,570
There are refugees that I think are
moving to something that is center right,

434
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:30,810
which I see is rich with ideas and
debate and all of these things.

435
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,380
I think a lot of people have some fear.
If you've come from the left,

436
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,970
they have some fear that there's some
sort of religious connotation attached to

437
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,440
conservatism. Now you just explained a
little bit of the history of that. Um,

438
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,220
but do you think there's room for
a secular conservatism? Can that,

439
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:51,810
can that fit within their look?
If it's a great question and there's no,

440
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,420
there's no simple answer
to it because, um, uh,

441
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,520
let me say one thing that's really simple.

442
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,450
You don't have to become a,

443
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:08,451
an Orthodox Christian or an Orthodox
Jew in order to take part in,

444
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,490
uh, in this great inheritance, which
is your inheritance. Okay. That's,

445
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,080
so,
it's a different question to say,

446
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,980
is it actually possible to sanitize it?

447
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:24,330
Of all religious aspects that,
that I'm, I'm more doubtful.

448
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:28,350
So let's take taken an example
that's really related to this book.

449
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,870
Um, uh, I, I mentioned
earlier that the, the, um,

450
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,880
the idea of national independence
is a biblical idea. Um,

451
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,340
the Romans didn't believe
in national independence.

452
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,590
The Greeks didn't believe in
national independence. I mean,

453
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,420
it has a source and that source is in,
uh,

454
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,550
in this tradition that says that,
you know, the god of Israel,

455
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:57,060
God, God, creator of Heaven
and earth is speaking to Moses.

456
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,480
And unlike all the other gods
of the ancient Middle East,

457
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,400
this particular God does not order his
people to go out and conquer the four

458
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,270
corners of the earth,

459
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,930
which is what the gods of the Assyrians
and the Babylonians were doing.

460
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,470
God event. That's a pretty big sea change
from what was happening before that.

461
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,210
It's an, it's an incredible, I mean that
in a, in at a certain level, that's what,

462
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,450
that's what the Hebrew Bible
is about. It's, it's about,

463
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:25,980
is there some alternative
to, uh, to living these,

464
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,720
these little tribes that are constantly,

465
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:30,990
we're each other or bringing peace
and prosperity by having, you know,

466
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,760
the Babylonians conquered
the entire world,

467
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:37,380
the four corners of the earth as they,
as they used to say. And uh, and so here,

468
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,410
the, the, the God of Israel speaks
to Moses and, and even though he's,

469
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,920
he's the creator of Heaven and earth, and
he's the god of everything. He doesn't,

470
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,920
he doesn't, he doesn't tell a
brand. He doesn't tell Moses, go,

471
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,810
go out and conquer the whole world.
He gives them borders the first,

472
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,990
as far as we know, the first borders,
any God ever gave his people, he says,

473
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,960
here are your borders and you're
not allowed to cross them.

474
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,870
You're not allowed to go trouble.
The neighbors because they have,

475
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,290
they have their own land and their own
promise and their own way. Now, this is,

476
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,270
this is a huge revolution
in political thought,

477
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,051
but,

478
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:15,500
but at the same time also also in theology
that that there could be a god that

479
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,760
cares about all humanity, but what
he wants is his, each different,

480
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,540
each different nation to, to,
to, to, to have its own freedom.

481
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,680
Now take that as an example.
That's,

482
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,450
that's something that I
think it's very difficult to,

483
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,550
to have an Anglo American conservatism
that uproots that biblical heritage.

484
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,920
Okay. Now that that doesn't
dictate, you know, what,

485
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,180
you know what you believe on every subject
just cause you're a conservative. But,

486
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,250
but if you don't have some kind of,

487
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,380
if you don't have a sense that there's
something incredibly important that needs

488
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:56,140
to be honored in hand handed
down in that tradition,

489
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,600
then it's going to be real hard
for you to be in conservative.

490
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,680
So how do you make room then? So I
get it. So on a, on a macro level,

491
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,670
you're saying you need though,

492
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:07,540
that those underpinnings on the micro
level for the individual that comes across

493
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:12,140
that maybe that either isn't religious or,
or for gay people or anyone that's,

494
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,520
that's sort of the outsider, uh,
how can they say, all right, well,

495
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,960
I can fit into this,

496
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,850
this conservative idea in different,
different times,

497
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,980
different periods of history.

498
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,530
Um,
uh,

499
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,470
there were tighter and looser,

500
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,770
mmm.
MMM.

501
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,560
More inclusive and less inclusive versions
of the traditions that we're talking

502
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:42,480
about. This is, I think there's,
uh, an important, common,

503
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:47,481
very common misconception about
conservatism is that often people are not

504
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:52,500
conservatives assumed that
the traditions are monolithic.

505
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,360
They dictate one answer on every question.
You know,

506
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,910
the tradition is this a
authoritarian thing? It,

507
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,030
it's always been the same. It has, you
know, it has a catechism and uh, and you,

508
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:08,880
you just have to believe and do
whatever you're told, and if you don't,

509
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:12,000
then then you're out.
I think that's a completely,

510
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,300
it's almost a propagandistic view of
the way traditions actually works.

511
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:21,660
The way traditions actually
work is that, that, of course,

512
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:25,980
a strong tradition. Um, does, um,

513
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,290
uh, does seek to inculcate
norms? When I say,

514
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,120
when I say norms, I mean, uh,

515
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,120
the thing that it would be best to do
where the thing that it would be best to

516
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,280
be,
but being the fact that the tradition,

517
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:42,410
hands down certain norms.
First of all,

518
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,280
there's huge arguments
within the tradition about
what those norms are, right?

519
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:47,740
I mean,
the,

520
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,730
the traditions themselves are very
often very pluralistic internally.

521
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,050
And then even if you're not
part of that pluralism, there's,

522
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,730
there's additional layers. There's the,
there's, there's the things that, uh,

523
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,110
that are,
uh,

524
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,290
strongly encouraged and the things they're
slightly encouraged and then there's

525
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,130
things that are tolerated. And then there,
then there are things, things that are,

526
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,270
uh, are, are, are
considered problematic, but,

527
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,860
but you'll leave them alone for now.
And then the things that the tradition,

528
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,580
you know, goes after and
tries to, uh, to say, look,

529
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:26,420
that that's really going to ruin us.
Right. Murdering people. It's a bit mind.

530
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,150
Right. So, um, so I,

531
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,220
I think that the more conservative
you become and the more you study what

532
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,500
conservatism really is as opposed to,
you know,

533
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,330
the cartoon version of it
that we get in, in, you know,

534
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,580
most academic courses on the
subject, let's say, or, or, or, or,

535
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,300
or on television, when,
when, when you study it,

536
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,400
of course you'll find things in
the past that you know, that, uh,

537
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,490
that you'll see as as terrible.
Nobody's pretending that's not the case.

538
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,800
But a tradition is something
that, uh, is always internal,

539
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,170
internally pluralistic.
Um,

540
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,880
it has different levels of space that it
makes for different, different kinds of,

541
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,840
of, uh, of dissidents and you know,
for, for, for example, the, the,

542
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,470
the English tradition is, um, it's,

543
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,320
it's often accused of being anti-catholic.
And,

544
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,780
and you'll notice that it's
relationship with, uh, with, uh,

545
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,800
with Judaism is not the same as its
relationship with Catholicism. Why?

546
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,670
Because, because the, the
periods that we're talking about,

547
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:35,780
our periods in which
Catholicism was, uh, uh,

548
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,140
was the official ideology of a world
empire that was trying to conquer,

549
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,260
conquer the English and prevent
them from being independent.

550
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,340
And I'm not saying everything
that was done in the name of,

551
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,010
of defending against this what,
you know,

552
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:53,870
w w w w w was perfectly well
executed, but you'll have to, I think,

553
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,190
use some common sense,

554
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,920
a nation that's facing a world empire
that has a certain religion that is,

555
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,430
that, that that's its
formal ideology. Well,

556
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
of course they're not going to treat
Catholics the same way that they're going

557
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:12,770
to treat other dissidents.
But I think people are always looking to,

558
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,770
looking at the past to see, um,
uh, oh, Gotcha. Look, they, uh,

559
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,830
the persecuted this and that and
the other thing and, and, and,

560
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,300
and usually it's true, but they're
not looking at the way in which,

561
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,440
um,

562
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,440
in which a dissidence did in
fact a flourish increasingly
over the millennia UN

563
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,190
under these, uh, these
different, um, uh, different,

564
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:43,140
different kinds of regimes. I mean, the
fact is we, Jews are still here. I mean,

565
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,020
has, there was plenty of persecution.
There's plenty to complain about.

566
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,890
But the fact is that we're still
here. And, and, and, and that,

567
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,530
that means that there were,
uh,

568
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,590
times in places throughout the history
of Christianity and Islam where,

569
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,490
uh, where the Jews had more or less
status, more or less tolerance,

570
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:07,070
more or less kind of contribution
in, in, in society. Um, and I,

571
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,980
so I, I would say that with
regard to conservatism today,

572
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,443
um,

573
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,700
we're in any case in a period where we're,

574
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:21,460
what we're trying to do is we're trying
to salvage what we can. All right. I mean,

575
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:26,400
I, I don't, I don't know if it's going
to succeed, but, um, as a conservative,

576
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,550
the maps that I face is today is virtually
every major idea or concept or ideal

577
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,810
that was handed down from the past
has been savagely attacked and may be

578
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:45,640
overthrown in the last few
generations. So I, I'm,

579
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm talking about the idea of the nation
they did with the family. Uh, the,

580
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,910
the, uh, the,

581
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:56,911
the ideas of man and woman of God
and scripture of a holiness of,

582
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:03,440
of honor. I mean, you can just keep going
and going. I mean, anything that, that,

583
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,710
that I think created the things that
are good in our world today that really

584
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:15,750
worked is now being savaged
and, and destroyed. And I'm,

585
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,680
you know, I'm, I'm, I'm looking
for allies. I'm not looking,
looking for, for enemies.

586
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,760
I hear I have enough. I mean
the people who are, uh, and,

587
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,890
and, and it's, it's many
the ones who are actively,

588
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:31,710
purposely destroying these things and
the ones who were just going along with

589
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:35,790
them. I mean, that's most
of our culture. So, um,

590
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,080
you know, I, I, I would, I
would be real grateful for, uh,

591
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,750
a willingness to have conversation with
anybody who's willing to, uh, to try to,

592
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,280
uh,
to,

593
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,940
to work out a contemporary conservatism
that could do some good and that would

594
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,310
be as inclusive as possible.

595
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,860
All right then, so let's take this
conversation into the modern world.

596
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:59,500
There's a couple things happening
right now that sort of fit,

597
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,000
we'll let you talk about in the book,
but that,

598
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:04,720
that fit perfectly for this conversation.
So let's talk about Trump. First.

599
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:09,130
People described him as a nationalist.
He talks about America first,

600
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,160
as far as I can tell, he doesn't want
to nation build all over the world and,

601
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,240
and expand American
empire everywhere. Um, um,

602
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,330
that's sorta your kind of nationalism,
right? Yeah, it is. I, I, I,

603
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:27,020
I think on nationalism, Trump, Trump
is, is excellent. I mean, he's,

604
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:31,940
he's not just, um, he's not
just looking for ways, you know,

605
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,530
and this is,
you know,

606
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,990
whether you think that he's finding right
ways are proposing the right ways is

607
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,880
his, the, his theme is, is
looking for ways to try to, uh,

608
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,850
to think about America's
a nation rather as,

609
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,440
rather than as a world empire.
We need to come back to that in a second,

610
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,900
but with,
um,

611
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,400
but then he goes and he speaks in front
of the United Nations, right? And he says,

612
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,710
look, I'm not just saying, um,

613
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,480
that my job is America first.
I'm talking to all the nations.

614
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm saying, look, each of you,

615
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,130
you're elected by a certain public or
you represent a certain public and,

616
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,300
and your job is to take care of
those people. And I think that's,

617
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,160
that's exactly the kind of, uh, of, of,
of nationalism we should be thinking.

618
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,600
Does that right there show you how
crazy things have gotten at the academic

619
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,170
level?
Because even when he says that,

620
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,020
that we should just think about ourselves
first that somehow is thought of as

621
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,220
Zena phobic or, or racist or something
like that. And it really, anyone,

622
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:39,220
if you really sat in it and thought
about it for a second or maybe if you,

623
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,890
if you remove Trump's
personality or whatever it is,

624
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,220
but have you thought about just what
he's saying that Americans should care

625
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:49,630
about America first and what happens with
our board first? It it sensible. I mean,

626
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:50,381
as you said at the beginning,

627
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:55,381
it's common sense of the people in the
United States are convinced that they

628
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:01,741
have some kind of a uniquely crazy
thing going on because of who Trump is.

629
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,980
I actually,
I think this is actually just not true.

630
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,810
I mean if you go just just go look at the
UK, right? They don't have Donald Trump.

631
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,020
You think that things are any less
crazy in the UK than they are?

632
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:17,610
And we'll get to exit in
a minute. But it's, Gee,

633
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,940
look at a sister democracy
within a lot of ways, a very, uh,

634
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,070
a very similar culture. And the, uh, the,

635
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,620
the elites I'm talking about
the universities, the media,

636
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,020
um, the, uh, um, a lot
of the, the, the, the,

637
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,160
the career politicians and bureaucrats,

638
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,730
there's this layer of people who are,
are,

639
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,750
they're just as crazy against,
uh,

640
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,230
any kind of indications of,
uh,

641
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:54,250
of nationalism and national independence
in the UK as, as they are in America.

642
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,910
So it's not, Trump didn't cause
this craziness. Trump is, is,

643
00:40:57,911 --> 00:41:02,740
is actually more of an effect than he
is a cause. The craziness predates him.

644
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:06,430
The craziness begins with, I
mean, it has a long history,

645
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:11,431
but let's say roughly the craziness
begins roughly in 1989 when the,

646
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,360
um,
when the Soviet Union falls,

647
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:20,860
the Berlin Wall falls and
America, which had, had spent,

648
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:25,270
most of it's not, not
all, but most of it's, um,

649
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,930
uh,

650
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,930
two centuries of independence arguing
for the virtue of independent nations.

651
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,940
Right. Being mostly on that
side of things, right? When
the, when, when, when the,

652
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,450
when the,

653
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,390
the Americans were broadcasting their
radio broadcasts into Europe during World

654
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,240
War II, what were they, what were they
broadcast and they're broadcasting,

655
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:49,390
you've been conquered by the evil empire
and we're coming to free the nations of

656
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,720
Europe so that then they will be able
to live independently. That was like,

657
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,140
we're not coming to make
our little satellite, right?
Well, we're not coming to be,

658
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,850
you know, a better empire to
conquer you and rule you. Right? So,

659
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,450
so at the time it was clear
and I think most, most,

660
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,300
most probably don't realize how
incredibly unique that is, right?

661
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:12,530
That a country would go halfway across the
world to do that. Right? It's a, it's a,

662
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,520
it's a very special thing. You
know, and we can, we can talk about,

663
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,490
but this,
this goes back to your religion point.

664
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,080
When FDR on the eve of World War II,
right?

665
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,210
These FDR gives his, uh, uh, in,

666
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,210
in January of 1939,

667
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,390
he has a state of the Union address
where he can already see that America is

668
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:35,980
going to go to war against, uh, against
the fascists and maybe the communist too.

669
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,350
And, and, and he describes
what it is that we're,

670
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,680
what is it we Americans are fighting for?
What are we going to be fighting for?

671
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,960
And he says,
first of all,

672
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:49,961
for our religion and then from our
religion comes our democracy and our

673
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:54,590
willingness to have comedy among
nations. But he says, first and foremost,

674
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,470
religion effect.
He calls the allied nations,

675
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:00,570
he calls them the God fearing democracies,
right?

676
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,720
T today nobody would say their e t t no.

677
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,800
Nobody would understand that FDR and the
people then thought they were fighting

678
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,910
for God fearing countries
against atheist or totalitarians.

679
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:15,830
Nobody thinks like that anymore. But,
but, but that's what it was. All right,

680
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:20,660
so, so if we go back to, um, uh,

681
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,310
where does this willingness to allow
other nations, their freedom come from?

682
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,880
FDR At least knows that it comes,
that it comes from,

683
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:33,470
from Christianity that comes from Judaism.
And Christianity, but to go back to,

684
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,970
to, to uh, to the, the,
the current crisis.

685
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:42,620
We've got elites that, uh, after 1989,

686
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,920
and it doesn't matter if they call
themselves liberal or conservative.

687
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,730
I mean almost all of them,
Democrats, Republicans, Labor,

688
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,920
conservative in the UK and all,

689
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:55,921
almost all the parties in Europe went
after this utopian dream of one law to

690
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,580
cover the entire earth. Uh, uh,

691
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,730
George Hw Bush called it the new world
order. Like if you're a nationalist, you,

692
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:08,860
you hear this kind of thing, it just
sends a chill down your spine, right?

693
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,080
The Bells go off. Go off. What
that, that's why the American one,

694
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:15,560
the Cold War was to,
was to impose order on the entire planet.

695
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,000
And now America's going to decide,
I mean that,

696
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,300
that was really kind of a cookie
moment. And not only that, but,

697
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,370
but bushes that one world ordered order
speech. I mean he had a few of them, but,

698
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,770
but the particular one world order
speech and he says explicitly for a

699
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,100
generations, mankind has been
struggling to reach this moment.

700
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,190
It's like this utopian thing.
A thousand generations.

701
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,840
We've been struggling to
reach this moment, but, but,

702
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,600
but all the previous generations have
failed in. Now we're going to succeed.

703
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,530
What are we going to succeeded? He
says, we're going to eliminate the,

704
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,330
the law of the jungle and replace it by
the rule of law. Right. It, I mean it's,

705
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,430
it's like this, you know, John
Lennon, stuff like the, the, the, the,

706
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,750
the entire planet is going to be
this borderless thing under a single,

707
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,640
under a single law, somehow
automatically love each other and, right.

708
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,070
We all more with each other and we're
gonna have, because the whole comedy,

709
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,330
because the whole past was,
you know,

710
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,000
based on ignorance and darkness
and inclusion that, you know,

711
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:15,480
there was nothing good back there. And
I mean, he didn't explicitly say that,

712
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:17,130
but that,
that's the clear implication.

713
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,710
But it's funny that it's a very deal
Marxist idea coming out. H It's Georgia.

714
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,320
Absolutely. Absolutely. Nobody would
really think it absolutely is. But that's,

715
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:30,150
I mean, if you're, sometimes you
hear conservatives like me say it,

716
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,210
it's all just liberalism,
right? You know, it doesn't,

717
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,430
it doesn't matter what label they
put on it because, because the,

718
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:38,760
the fact is that,

719
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,060
that all the elites at the top of all
of these academic institutions and,

720
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:47,400
and, and, uh, political parties,

721
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,780
they had all these disagreements among
one another, but, right. They disagree.

722
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,660
They thought that they had
election campaigns, but they, but,

723
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,510
but they weren't disagreeing
about the fundamentals.

724
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:01,050
The fundamental was we
liberals in the west,

725
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,880
we know how to run the world. We've got
the answer. Like, all you need to do is,

726
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:09,420
you know, take, take the way
America runs and, or, or, or,

727
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,150
or Germany or whatever you want,
and uh,

728
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,120
and apply it to every country in the
world to every nation in the world.

729
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,440
But if necessary,
by force will dictate the rules.

730
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,630
There's going to rules
for the whole planet.

731
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,280
And if somebody does something wrong,
then we start bombing them. Which, I mean,

732
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,380
that's,
it's simplistic,

733
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:33,300
but that's roughly a description of
an entire generation of American and,

734
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,910
and, uh, and, and, and, and
European political thoughts.

735
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,200
It'd be like the neo conservatives
basically, right? Well, they're,

736
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,150
they're just one strand. I
mean, you'll, you'll, you'll,
you'll notice that the, the,

737
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,010
the, the neoconservatives, uh,

738
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,690
may may have been arguing
right for let's say invade,

739
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,090
invade Iraq and Afghanistan,

740
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:57,780
whereas Liberals in Europe
might've been saying, no,

741
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:02,040
don't invade Iraq and Afghanistan. So
there, there's substantive disagreements,

742
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:07,041
but what they're not disagreeing about
is that the European ideal of eliminate

743
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:12,860
all the borders, right?
A, uh, a, uh, the, the,

744
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:17,580
the, the European Union, uh,
founded in 1992 in, in, in,

745
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,270
in its current form, any right
after the Berlin Wall fell the idea,

746
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,560
we're going to take down all the borders.

747
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,540
We're not gonna have restrictions on
immigration or the free or, or, or, or,

748
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,410
or trade or, or, or, or
anything that we, every,

749
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,180
everybody's going to be free to be
part of one thing. And Europe itself,

750
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,370
you know, has no borders,
right? You're, you're, you're,

751
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,500
you're didn't know and still doesn't
know to this day how many countries on

752
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:46,510
earth it's going to expand to
embrace and its entire project.

753
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,540
The of the European elites is
creating a world's courts and,

754
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:52,721
uh,

755
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:57,070
and world economic bodies to regulate
everything on earth and get everybody on

756
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,260
one page doing, doing,
doing one thing. So,

757
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,600
so there's an argument between
the Europeans and the Americans.

758
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,550
Should the Americans be invading your act?

759
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,430
But there's no argument
about what the project is.

760
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,350
There's no argument about the idea that
we don't actually need diversity among

761
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:13,270
nations. We, we don't need
an independent nations.

762
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:16,480
We need one central thing that's
going to govern everything.

763
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:21,570
So is the simplest way to encapsulate
their argument is that's like the,

764
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:25,900
I get the d there's this dystopian idea
or sort of that by freeing everybody or

765
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:27,580
something that,
you know,

766
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,390
we'll just ignore thousands of years of
history and we're all going to love each

767
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:34,390
other, something like that.
But with the more, um,

768
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,790
the ferry version of this is that,
well,

769
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,970
one world government now you can
absolutely control everybody. I mean,

770
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,090
would you say that's really the heart
of this? It's really about control.

771
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,400
It's freeing everybody, right?
You're exactly right. It's, well,

772
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,980
they say they're freeing everybody.
But their idea of freedom is,

773
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,180
is, uh, you know,

774
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,460
let me take just a small example from,
you know,

775
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:01,660
from being an Orthodox Jew. I think
this applies to everybody, but, uh, but,

776
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,460
um,
uh,

777
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,630
they have an idea of what
human rights is and they,

778
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:11,590
they're sure that their idea of human
rights is true for everybody on earth.

779
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:14,350
Nevermind the fact that, you
know, every five or 10 years,

780
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,940
the content of it actually moves,
right? Right. But at any given moment,

781
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,470
right this way, but at any given moment,
they think that they know, you know what,

782
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,180
you know, what the absolute, you know,

783
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:30,181
what reason was a capital r what it
dictates is that the true setup for rights

784
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:34,810
for everybody on earth. So,
um, so as an Orthodox Jew,

785
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,820
um, I, I immediately run
into problems with this. Why?

786
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:44,470
Because, because, uh, we, we
have a tradition going back
thousands of years of, of,

787
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,210
uh, of Surrey circumcising our, our, our,
our male children. And, and it's, it's,

788
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:54,010
it's a, a, a central
symbol of, um, of, uh,

789
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,180
both the,
uh,

790
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,540
of the hardship of joining the
Jewish people and, uh, and,

791
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:03,220
and going into covenant with God.
That's our tradition.

792
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,340
You don't have to like it or not like it.
That's the way we do thing.

793
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,770
We can do things. It's incredibly
important to us now. Now the, the,

794
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,170
the universal reason people, they come
and say, well, look, you're biting,

795
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,920
violating the rights of the child. And
so you're not allowed to do that anymore.

796
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,440
We're, we're, we're, we're going
to ban it. Or, um, we have a, a,

797
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,690
a method of, of, uh,
slaughtering animals, uh,

798
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,680
four for food that goes back thousands of
years. Koch, kosher slaughter. And, uh,

799
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:36,620
from our traditional understanding,
this is a, this is humanitarian,

800
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,440
right? The, the, the, the, the
Jewish kosher slaughter. It,

801
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:44,640
it's aim is to eliminate,
among other things, to,

802
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,960
to eliminate things like, uh, uh,

803
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,070
hunting and tearing animals apart and
doing all sorts of other horrible things.

804
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:55,040
No, there's only certain animals you're
allowed to slaughter and you have to

805
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,570
slaughter to them in a certain way,
which,

806
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:01,460
which traditionally we thought that's the
most painless way. But now the, the uh,

807
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:05,030
the, the universal human
rights people are in this case,

808
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,790
the universal Vercel rights.
People that come and say, no,

809
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,980
you can't slaughter your away because
we know the answer of, of, you know,

810
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:16,330
of the best way to slaughter an animal.
And so you're going to do it our way.

811
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:21,140
I mean, basically what they're saying
is, is you're not allowed to be a Jew.

812
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,740
You're not allowed to be a traditional
Jew because we figured out the answers.

813
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:28,600
We figured out the answers for everybody.
And if you want to do it due to,

814
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,200
to do your traditions, then
that will shut you down. Now,

815
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,380
that same argument is true that I
just gave Forrest at ox Judaism.

816
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:40,130
It's true for everybody. It's
true for every tradition.
There is no such thing as,

817
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:44,960
as some professors in Germany sit and
figure out the universal human rights for

818
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,190
all time and,

819
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,090
and then we impose it on everybody without
oppressing all the other people have

820
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:52,910
their own traditions of how to do so.
Interesting to me because as you know,

821
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:56,270
I came from the left and I wasn't
progressive and I saw this and then when I

822
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:57,260
started waking up to it,

823
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:59,810
that's sort of when people started
caring about what I was thinking.

824
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,290
But I remember thinking that even when
the gay rights movement was happening in

825
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,124
America,

826
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,880
but there was this very odd thing that
if you didn't get to exactly where they

827
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:10,280
were on gay rights or
gay marriage that day,

828
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:13,220
they got there that you
were automatically a big,

829
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,000
and it's like what a crazy way of
viewing the world because Barack Obama,

830
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,520
who nobody in their right
mind would think is anti gay.

831
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,080
He ran against gay marriage.

832
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:24,320
She was not for gay marriage the first
time you went around. So history,

833
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,400
if these people win,

834
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,660
the long game history will be
not too kind to Barack Obama.

835
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:31,670
And I guess we're going to
have to take down his library,

836
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,050
which is being constructed right now.

837
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:36,800
I think they're gonna have to take that
down because he was against the human

838
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:40,520
rights that are going to be very obvious
to them that this is a 20, 30 years.

839
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:45,310
This is, this is such an
important point. I mean, the, the,

840
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,700
the only way that you can keep the,

841
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,630
the only way that you can preserve

842
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,313
mmm.

843
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:56,570
A certain way of doing things
or a certain idea is through

844
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,013
mmm.

845
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,160
Just through traditions that pass down
and attitude of sacredness and giving

846
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,570
honor to, to that way of
doing things. And you know,

847
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:11,550
of course nothing human is permanent.

848
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:15,450
Everything changes a little bit from
generation to generation. But, um,

849
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,640
but we see in, you know, by looking
at [inaudible], looking at the, the,

850
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:24,360
the Jews or in India or, or,
uh, or, or in China, we can see,

851
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:29,361
we see that are some things
that can actually be a
handed down over thousands of

852
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,130
years. It, it's possible,

853
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,730
but this idea that our reason is just
going to figure out the right thing and

854
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,900
nevermind the past.

855
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:46,220
That's just all that's doing is creating
a permanent revolution where every

856
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:51,600
single generation, I
mean, even every 10 years,

857
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,410
it already devours and reject and destroys
the thing that it created in just a

858
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,680
few moments ago. [inaudible] all right.
So there, there are some people who,

859
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,420
you know, who, who, um, who in theory,
they find that attractive. They,

860
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,190
I mean, they're, uh, the
young people usually,

861
00:54:11,191 --> 00:54:15,700
right? Find that very attractive,
like everything before us
was awful. You know, it,

862
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:16,603
it's,

863
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,070
it's part of being apparently part of
being human is that a lot of adolescents,

864
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,453
um,

865
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,290
feel during their adolescence that really
nothing is important other than the

866
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:32,940
fact that I'm free and I decided to
do what I want. Um, and, uh, you know,

867
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,780
it's not true of all adolescents,
but it's true of a lot of adolescents.

868
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:41,220
It's a very, very common thing. And, and,
and, and it's part of being human. But,

869
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,140
um, but when, when you're a
grown up, um, you have to, uh,

870
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,800
take responsibility for questions like,
um,

871
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,060
is, is my nation, is my religion?

872
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:57,960
Are My traditions actually good?
If I believe that they're good,

873
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,030
if I believe they're
contributing good to the world,

874
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,840
then there are things I need to
do in order to hand them down.

875
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,670
It's not a few things. It's a
lot of things. Human beings,

876
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,020
if they're not, if, if,

877
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,950
if they don't work really
hard to uh, maintain the, the,

878
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:16,560
the honoring of the traditions,

879
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:18,750
the traditions get thrown out of the
window and you're going to have nothing

880
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:23,220
left. Now I'm like, let's
take something like, um,

881
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:28,170
free speech because I know you talk
about it a lot and free speech is people

882
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:30,000
think about free speech as though,

883
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,320
I mean it's the standard thing to say
is it's a right, it's a human right.

884
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,130
It's in the constitution,
it's a unit,

885
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:41,450
but people rarely way too rarely
focus on the fact that the actual

886
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:48,390
implementation of a regime of
free speech is a tradition.

887
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,000
It's a tradition.
If,

888
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,300
if you need to work hard to raise your
children to not tell the other one to

889
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:00,870
shut up,
but you need to train them over years,

890
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,930
it makes you angry that
your brother is saying that,

891
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,250
that your sister saying that.
Makes you angry. I mean,

892
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:09,120
th th they're constantly ready
to go to war over, right?

893
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:13,920
That's the way kids are and you have to
train them and work on them and work on

894
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:16,800
them to civilize them,
allows the other one to speak.

895
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:20,820
I know that it's making you angry, but
allow them to speak. Let them talk.

896
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:25,750
Then you'll get your turn.
Now that that little family Vignette,

897
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:29,890
it's actually true of the, of,
of the entire civilization.

898
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,300
The fact that that you can
have a, you know, a country,

899
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:39,340
most people are willing to allow someone
else to say what they think even though

900
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:40,174
they disagree.

901
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,740
That's an incredibly difficult
tradition to inculcate to,

902
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:49,600
to raise people to do that. That's a
fight that you have to refight in, in, in,

903
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:53,340
in the education of the entire
country and every generation it's you,

904
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,020
there's no point in asserting
it cause it's reasonable.

905
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,290
It's not about whether it's reasonable,
it's about what do,

906
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:04,350
what are you willing to do to make these
traditions channel people in such a way

907
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:09,520
that guess what, they're not free.
Someone says something you don't like,

908
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,290
then you're not free to just start,

909
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,200
start cursing them out
like people do on Twitter.

910
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,070
You're not free to do that
because self restraint,

911
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,470
self constraint is the only
way that freedom of speech
is going to exist in your

912
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:26,110
country.
That means that we need to focus on,

913
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,880
on the constraint part on how do you
get people to not do whatever they want.

914
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,420
That's the only way that free speech
can continue to exist. So the,

915
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,430
even even the things that seem to be
like the most valuable freedoms are,

916
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,270
they exist because they are
Anglo American traditions.

917
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:47,530
And if you're running a revolution where
you're overthrowing one tradition after

918
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:51,370
another, after another, nothing is going
to be left of the things that we value,

919
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:56,020
including the freedoms. So
all right, so that being said,

920
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,300
and that that could have
been the ending right there,

921
00:57:58,301 --> 00:57:59,890
cause that's how your kappa show,
right?

922
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,160
But if everything you
said is true right there,

923
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,980
then how concerned are you for the future?

924
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:11,010
Because it does seem that the forces
that you're fighting against in this book

925
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:16,420
are getting stronger. Yeah,
it's it, it's very frightening.

926
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,820
It, Eh, on the free
speech thing, you know, a,

927
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:24,430
a generation ago I was
at university and, um, I,

928
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:29,130
uh, I started the, uh, the, the Princeton
Tory, it's the, it was the, the,

929
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:32,920
the pro Reagan publication on,
on the university campus.

930
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,200
And, um, of course, lots of people didn't
like it. Conservatives where I minority,

931
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,710
um, and people call me
names, people that, you know,

932
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:43,780
there's all sorts of nastiness,

933
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,910
but nobody ever thought it was
illegitimate. Right. It's a different era.

934
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:49,871
I mean,

935
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:53,350
w w we had friends who are liberals
and we'd friends who were progressive,

936
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,950
nobody thought that our
publication that are pro Reagan,

937
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:01,360
that are conservative publication,
that it was illegitimate. Right.

938
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:04,570
They didn't think, no, you're
not allowed to say that.

939
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,430
This is where someone like Ben Shapiro,

940
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:10,340
who often is just saying the things that
Reagan said that were brought over and

941
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,440
jet and tears. And today people
are, there's lots of things.

942
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,010
So in those days, I would just say
whatever I, you know, whatever,

943
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:21,990
I thought I would write whatever I
wanted. I, that's how I grew up. But I,

944
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,510
I tell my children, you know, and I'm
ashamed of this, but, but it's true.

945
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,540
I tell my children, no, look, there's
things you believe that you're,

946
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:33,930
you're not allowed to say anymore.
And I wish it weren't like that. I,

947
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:38,390
I'd like to see it change. But right now
there's no point in like in, in, you know,

948
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:41,270
throwing away your, your, uh, your,

949
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,380
your capacity to earn a living and to do
good on all sorts of fronts because you

950
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:49,460
insist in just saying whatever you want
to say. I can't stand it. But that's,

951
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:53,390
that's the reality is
that, is that the, uh, um,

952
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:56,250
the zone for,
for,

953
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,410
for freedom of speech is rapidly,
rapidly closing.

954
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,140
It's getting narrower and
narrower. And, um, and,

955
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,980
and that's just one example of the things
that we've lost. I think it's a very,

956
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,570
it's a very frightening period.

957
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:14,900
But let me just say one positive
thing because I mean, look,

958
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:19,340
I can easily plot a
trajectory where, um, where,

959
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,570
uh, where America doesn't
make it through this,

960
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,130
but w w w,
w w let me look at the other possibility.

961
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:34,270
This is also a moment of great
opportunity because it's,

962
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,280
there's a tradition among diplomats
that you read sometimes in,

963
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:44,780
um, in history books that kind
of a legend that the world,

964
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:49,670
uh, is like, uh, an ice cap. The political
world is like an ice cap and every,

965
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,670
every once in awhile it,

966
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,130
it unfreezes and it breaks
up and it rearranges itself.

967
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,760
So like every 50 years
or every 75 or 100 years.

968
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,960
And we really do seem to be
in a period like that where,

969
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:08,030
where all the bets really are off and,

970
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:08,923
um,

971
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:14,060
that will hopefully draw to the front,

972
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,620
um, creative, strong, uh,

973
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,290
people who have,
um,

974
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:26,480
well if something important to
offer to the rephrasing the re,

975
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,790
uh, re construction of, um,

976
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:36,670
of the world that's coming, um,
this reconstruction, you know, it,

977
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,340
it, it can be something
absolutely horrendous and I don't,

978
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,440
we shouldn't kid ourselves, we're really
moving in a bad direction. But, um,

979
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,640
the reason that I find,
uh,

980
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,500
the nationalist movements encouraging in,

981
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,550
in American the UK and other countries is
not because it's not because, you know,

982
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,700
I support everything that every
one of these people say or do.

983
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:02,060
I actually have absolutely no idea what
most of them, you know, are going to do.

984
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,420
And a lot of them are new to politics
and we don't actually know what they're

985
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:09,470
going to do, but, but what I, uh,

986
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,700
but I do see the opportunity. I D I don't
know if it's going to turn out well,

987
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:17,930
but I do see clearly the opportunity when,

988
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,820
um, when, right.

989
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,100
Because the national movements movements
could take a turn for the worst, right?

990
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,950
They could turn to things
that are about race.

991
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,030
They have no nationalism and those types
of things. They certainly could. And, and,

992
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:34,890
uh, and that is actually one
of the things that, that,

993
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,420
uh, that I say when I, when I
go around giving talks is I,

994
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,810
I've noticed that many conservatives,
um,

995
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,280
dismiss the, the racist,
right? I mean, they have a,

996
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,710
um, a lot of conservatives,
they look, they're looking at,

997
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,300
you know, how strong is the Nazi party
or the KKK and, and, and, and they are,

998
01:02:57,301 --> 01:02:58,320
they're trivial. I mean, they're,

999
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:02,340
they're absolutely trivial
and it's completely unfair
to associate conservatism

1000
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:06,900
with that answer. It's reasonable in
the sense that they dismiss it. But, uh,

1001
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,850
but looking at the level of,
at the level of ideas of who's,

1002
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,970
who's thinking,

1003
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:16,380
who's trying to actually come up with
a worldview that could a few years from

1004
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:20,760
now become some, something
important, I think it's a mistake to,

1005
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,730
to dismiss the far right.

1006
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,530
Not that I'm not that I'm
sympathetic to them, but the,

1007
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,430
the quality of the, uh,
of the, the arguments,

1008
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,000
the,

1009
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
the work that's being done by people to
justify a kind of a neo Darwinian kind

1010
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:42,720
of racism, like a white,
a white identity politics.

1011
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:48,090
They're actually doing quite a bit of
work to get this idea into shape now.

1012
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,510
I, I detest it, right? Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

1013
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,250
I hope it's soundly defeated,

1014
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,050
but it's really quite a attractive to,

1015
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:02,160
uh, lots of people in their twenties
and their thirties who are looking at,

1016
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:07,140
you know, the, the old liberal
order and saying, oh my
gosh, well that doesn't work.

1017
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,760
So, so where do we go?
Um, and it means that,

1018
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,870
um, yeah, we have those of us who are, uh,

1019
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,280
inclined to a national
conservatism that is, uh,

1020
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,880
that has nothing to do with
race. That, that, you know,

1021
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,260
those of us who think the color of your
skin really should make absolutely zero

1022
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:30,270
difference in the way
that we order society.

1023
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,570
There's so many important important
issues. Why the color of your skin.

1024
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,470
So those of us who, who are, uh, um,

1025
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:42,330
inclined to a national conservatism,
uh, which will, uh, believe in,

1026
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:46,510
in the nation and its heritage, but I
have no interest in, in, you know, in,

1027
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:49,320
in the genetic population that you know,

1028
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,600
that you supposedly came from,

1029
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:55,770
we have a lot of work to do to create
something that's going to be sufficiently

1030
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:56,604
powerful.

1031
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,540
I'm talking about an idea
that sufficiently coherent
and powerful and attractive

1032
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,180
so that it will actually have,
uh,

1033
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:07,310
be able to be politically effective
w before these other guys,

1034
01:05:07,311 --> 01:05:11,100
like the forces before these other guys,
you know,

1035
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:16,410
before they win. I mean, right now they're
not winning, but 10 years from now,

1036
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,790
20 years from, I would,
I think all bets are off.

1037
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:23,220
We don't know where this is going.
And so, so there is there dangerous,

1038
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,100
but there's an opportunity to create a,
uh,

1039
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:31,920
a much more traditionalist,
conservative, um, uh, uh,

1040
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:36,640
a decent, moderate common sense
traditionalist conservatism,

1041
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,090
which will be national, which will
be nationalists, which we'll, we'll,

1042
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,680
we'll believe in the
traditions of nations and, and,

1043
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,530
and seek to maintain their independence.

1044
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,490
There's a space to do that
and it's exciting to be
able to do that because that

1045
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:52,300
space hasn't existed. You know, for
the last generation. It was, you know,

1046
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,610
no one wanted to hear it.
It's,

1047
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,670
that's a conservative space that
a good old fashion liberal could,

1048
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,560
could be okay with. You know, we've
barely scratched the surface here,

1049
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:03,370
but we got a rapper now, so we should,
we should definitely do this again. Okay.

1050
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,210
I'd love to. Can I get you back here to
the United States and hear this again?

1051
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,840
It in Israel. We'll do it intrusive.
I'll do either way. I'll buy,

1052
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,920
I'll buy you a steak next to the old city
walls. If you come to Jerusalem, done.

1053
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:19,330
I'm done. All right. For more on your arm
and follow him on Twitter. Why has one.
