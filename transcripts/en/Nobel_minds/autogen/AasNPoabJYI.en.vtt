I always say to my students and that

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020
I always say to my students and that
 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.930
I always say to my students and that
being a scientist is like being an

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940
being a scientist is like being an
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.799
being a scientist is like being an
explorer and I really mean that because

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809
explorer and I really mean that because
 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.020
explorer and I really mean that because
in a sense I think in science we explore

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
in a sense I think in science we explore
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.650
in a sense I think in science we explore
the world the universe around us some

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
the world the universe around us some
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.180
the world the universe around us some
people look at big things and other

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
people look at big things and other
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220
people look at big things and other
people look at very small things but in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
people look at very small things but in
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.710
people look at very small things but in
a sense we're all trying to understand

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
a sense we're all trying to understand
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140
a sense we're all trying to understand
the world around us in a sense we're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
the world around us in a sense we're
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.240
the world around us in a sense we're
looking in little corners in places that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
looking in little corners in places that
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.460
looking in little corners in places that
nobody has ever looked before and that's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
nobody has ever looked before and that's
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.420
nobody has ever looked before and that's
a lot of fun so we go to work and we

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
a lot of fun so we go to work and we
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.819
a lot of fun so we go to work and we
have problems that were interested in

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
have problems that were interested in
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.639
have problems that were interested in
when and when I say we for my kind of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
when and when I say we for my kind of
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.549
when and when I say we for my kind of
work I run a laboratory and that means

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
work I run a laboratory and that means
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560
work I run a laboratory and that means
there are people who have come to the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
there are people who have come to the
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.030
there are people who have come to the
laboratory to work with me because

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
laboratory to work with me because
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
laboratory to work with me because
they're interested in the same problems

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
they're interested in the same problems
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.400
they're interested in the same problems
it's like a family if you will

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410
it's like a family if you will
 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.540
it's like a family if you will
interested in problems and we get

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
interested in problems and we get
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850
interested in problems and we get
excited about things and we figure out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
excited about things and we figure out
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.719
excited about things and we figure out
how to do experiments to test them
