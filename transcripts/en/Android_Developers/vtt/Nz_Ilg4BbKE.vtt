[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.840
BENJAMIN FRENKEL: Welcome!

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.010
I'm Ben Frenkel.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.810
I'm a product manager
for Google Play.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.210
And with me today,
I'll be joined

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.922
by Jonathan Cheung, Steve Suppe,
as well as Andrew Giugliano.

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:18.380
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.340
about unleashing the power
of Play Store Discovery.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.550
What I wanted to
do first, though,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.530
is get to know the
audience a little better.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.299
I don't know all of you.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.132
I know some of you, but
I don't know all of.

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:36.640
And what I wanted
to do is to see

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.760
what kind of the mix of
people are here today.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
So, I want to see
a show of hands.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.780
How many of you are on the
business side of games?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.760
The product managers
and so forth?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.370
All right, we've got a
decent representation there.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.890
How many of you use the
Play Console regularly?

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.280
Either looking at reports--

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760
All right, there's
even more hands.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.422
And how many of
you are engineers?

00:00:57.422 --> 00:00:58.880
How many of you
write code at least

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.730
sometimes or have
ever written code?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.090
That might be some more hands.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.860
Well this is a great
mix for this talk,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.430
because we have something
for everybody today.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520
So for the business
side of the house,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.860
we're going to be talking
about business impact.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.668
What these tools can
do for your business.

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:17.210
We're going to show
some case studies

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.830
for the Play Console, folks.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.290
We're going to show you how
to use the tools we're going

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.230
to be talking about today.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.280
And for the engineers
in the room,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.800
we have an entire
section at the end

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.930
that's a technical
deep dive into how

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.240
to use Google Play Instant.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.580
And it even involves
actual code.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.700
So, there's one more question,
one more exciting question.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.778
I kind of spoil the result, but
just bear with me for a second.

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:47.320
I want to see one
more show of hands.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.400
One more show of hands.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.650
How many of you think
you've either seen

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.250
or yourself have taken
full advantage of all

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.520
the promotional tools
that Play offers?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.250
OK, so we've got a couple of
very optimistic people here

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.230
and I love that about you.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.090
But, the answer is, no.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.250
None of you have really
been able to take advantage

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.669
of all of the tools that
Play provides to promote

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.880
your game on the store.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.228
But, it's not your fault.
It's not you, it's me or us,

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:14.770
I should say.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.260
Because, we haven't
really done a good job

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.350
of showing you
what it would look

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.010
like if you used all of
the tools at your disposal

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.420
to their full extent possible.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.280
And today, we're going to close
that gap with an example led

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.340
by a good friend of mine, Burt.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.480
This is Burt.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.630
And through Burt's eyes
and some of his friends,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.160
which I'll also
introduce to you,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.560
will show you what it
would look like if you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.740
turned all the Play's
promotional tools up to 11.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.000
More than 10, up to 11.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.660
This is a really big deal.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.210
So why don't we
get things started.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.610
We're going to start at the
beginning of Burt's journey

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.110
on the Play Store.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.900
So Burt's the type of
person who always wants

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.640
to know what's coming next.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.520
He loves watching trailers
of the upcoming movies.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.580
And he gets the
same buzz when he's

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.790
looking at the pre-reg
section on the store.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.340
So, Burt's looking at the
pre-reg section of the store.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
And he spots one of his
favorite franchises, this game

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.900
SnoreCraft.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.860
It's big on P.C. And
unaware that things

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.140
could get even
more exciting, Burt

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.010
dives into the store listing.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.080
Wait, what's that?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.790
He thinks There's
free stuff too?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.590
I can unlock exclusive rewards
just by pre-registering?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.120
And there's a demo?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.120
I can actually play
this game right now.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.090
I can preserve and
reserve my avatar's name.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.780
I can customize my avatar.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.920
And I can earn experience
points all the way up to launch.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.900
This indeed was a
triumphant day for Burt.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.470
Bursting with excitement, Burt
pre-registered for SnoreCraft

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.970
and shared the pre-reg listing
with almost all of his friends.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.600
Burt slept well that night
dreaming of the rewards

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.190
he was soon to receive.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.450
Fast forward and its launch day.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.660
Burt wakes up, stretches,
and sees a notification

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.380
that SnoreCraft is now
available to everybody.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.600
And before even
getting out of bed,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.790
Burt installed SnoreCraft
and immediately

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.790
redeemed the long
awaited reward.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.350
Boy, was Burt excited.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.410
But this was not just
a good day for Burt.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.430
This was also a good day for
all the people Burt invited

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.580
to the pre-registration.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.870
And not only his friends,
but their friends, and then

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.960
their friends' friends,
and so on, and so forth,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.420
until almost all
of Burt's friends

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.892
were playing SnoreCraft.

00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:02.900
Almost everyone
except for the Bobs,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.600
who I am also introducing
for the first time

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.680
here today to all of you.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.020
So a bit of background
on the Bobs,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.220
these are identical quadruplets
that were separated at birth.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.010
And through a mere
quirk of fate,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.130
they happened to
all be named Bob.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.110
What are the chances?

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.580
And it might not be
obvious at first glance,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.570
but when the Bobs smile, you
can really see the family

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.180
resemblance here.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.010
So, because the Bobs missed
out on pre-registration,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.230
the Bob's road to SnoreCraft
was different from Burt's

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.700
and Burt's friends.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.000
Each had to chart their own
path to eventually installing

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.320
SnoreCraft.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.200
So one Bob came through the
new and updated section.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.730
Another was
recommended SnoreCraft.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.590
The third Bob came through the
role-playing games collection.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.280
Bob number four had it
suggested through ads.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.980
And for good measure,
their cousin Becky

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.380
discovered SnoreCraft through
the editor's choice section.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.150
But, they all eventually
landed on the store listing.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.760
But, before we go on,
I wanted to provide

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.270
a bit of additional
context about the Bobs.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.130
So, after they were
separated at birth,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.740
each ended up growing up
in a different country.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.360
One lives in Portugal.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.560
One in Brazil.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.400
One in Mexico.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.070
And one lived here in
the U.S. And each of them

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.370
independently developed
an unyielding passion

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.580
for soccer, or how almost
everyone else in the world

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.770
refers to it as football.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.720
And this context is important.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.420
Because not only
did each of the Bobs

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.460
find their own way
to the store listing,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.530
but when they arrived
at the store listing,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.600
they discovered
it was customized

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.350
to their preferences.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.060
So with an international
football event looming,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.210
the Bob from Portugal arrived
on a store listing that

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.910
celebrated his national team.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.550
The game icon, the
screenshots, the text,

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.910
all showed the support
for the team he loves.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.400
The Bob from Brazil
saw a store listing

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.850
that celebrated his team.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.540
And the Bob from Mexico and
the Bob from the U.S. store

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.480
saw store listings that
celebrated their national teams

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.580
too.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.970
The Bobs from
Portugal and Brazil

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.520
immediately installed the
game right off the bat.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.230
No questions asked.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.380
However, the Bobs from
Mexico and the U.S.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.750
were initially a
little reluctant

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.480
to install the game right away.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.390
One Bob was concerned about the
available space on his device.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.750
The other Bob was new to
gaming and just wasn't

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.010
familiar with the franchise.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.330
But, fortunately, SnoreCraft
had an instant game.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.760
The space constrained
Bob was relieved

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.890
that he could try the
game before committing

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.630
to a big install.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.520
And the newbie,
well, though he was

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.770
unfamiliar with the
franchise, his curiosity

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.920
got the better of him.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.360
And he clicked to try now, too.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.060
Eventually all the
Bobs installed the game

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.900
and played happily ever after.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.348
The end.

00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:14.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.520
So, hopefully that's
giving you a sense of what

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.820
taking full advantage of
all the marketing tools

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.100
the Play Store
has to offer looks

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.590
like from a user's perspective.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.580
Through Burt's eyes,
you've seen the power

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.390
of Play's pre-launch
tools, the viral growth

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.880
opportunity, the impact
of pre-reg rewards

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.230
and Google Play Instant.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.020
And through the eyes of
all the Bobs and Becky,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.780
you saw the impact of Play's
post-launch marketing tools,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.510
from customized store listings
to store listing experiments.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.010
What we're going
to do now is, we're

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.180
going to turn our attention
to what the business impact is

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.473
of these tools and the technical
details of how to use them.

00:08:55.473 --> 00:08:56.890
When I hand things
off to Jonathan

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.473
in a second, who's
going to be talking

00:08:58.473 --> 00:09:01.233
about the pre-launch
marketing tools.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:02.650
He's going to hand
to Steve, who's

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.590
going to be talking about the
post-launch marketing tools.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.840
And then, lastly, for the
engineers in the room,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.500
Andrew is going to do
a deep dive into how

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.530
to build an instant game.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.670
And with that, come on up.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.361
Jonathan, take it away.

00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:20.307
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:26.200
JONATHAN CHEUNG: Thanks, Ben.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.420
In the next section, we're going
to go over some of the tools

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.350
from the developer's
perspective.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.490
We'll show and explain the
opportunities available for you

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.570
to use today and go
over some best practices

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.520
to make your
pre-launch campaigns as

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.470
exciting as possible.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.230
Let's start with pre-launch.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.720
As we all know, in the
console and P.C. world,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.440
pre-launch marketing and even
pre-ordering has become a norm.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.680
Well today, I'm excited to say
that pre-launch marketing is

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.130
also increasingly
popular for mobile games.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.440
In fact, for most games, the
pre-launch and launch period

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.610
is typically the time when you
have the most buzz and interest

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.510
around your game.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.840
Many game developers have told
us that during this period

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.240
is also the cheapest
time to acquire

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.090
a new user throughout the
lifetime of their games.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.890
As such, it's crucial to engage
with your potential players

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.190
and hopefully capture
the interest in your game

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.204
before you launch.

00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:39.280
So, how do you make the most
of this important period

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.320
in your game's lifecycle?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.440
And how do you
effectively communicate

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.070
what is special about your
game and capture play interest

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.380
even before you launch?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.920
Luckily, we at Google
Play have some tools

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.932
which can help you to grasp this
unique pre-launch opportunity.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.070
Until recently, it has been
very difficult for developers

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.820
on Play to capture pre-launch
buzz around their games

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.440
and translate this to
actual installs at launch.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.660
Developers had to think
very hard about where

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.820
to spend their marketing
dollars and how

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.120
to invest in different efforts,
as there is no easy way

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.970
to capture this
interest and maintain it

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.960
until the game is ready.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.810
Well, today I'm pleased to
announce that Google Play's

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.810
pre-registration feature is
available to all developers

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.530
on Google Play.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.310
For those of you who aren't
familiar with the tool,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.500
pre-registration helps
capture demand generated

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.640
by pre-launch marketing.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.820
And it activates it
at launch to help

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.410
accelerate your pre-launch
success in the market.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.830
When your pre-registration
campaign is started,

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.380
a clear pre-registration
call to action

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.030
will appear on your
pre-release store

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.120
page, which allows users
to register interest

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.010
in your title.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.500
In return for
pre-registering, players

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.080
will receive a launch
day notification

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.470
from Google Play allowing them
to become one of the first

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.410
to install and play your game.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.390
Not only does it allow you to
engage and reward core fans

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.470
early, but pre-registration
notifications also

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:28.020
drive higher volumes
of D1 and D7 installs.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.840
On top of this, Play's
pre-registration tool

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.710
is more effective than most when
it comes to driving conversions

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.570
to install.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.250
On average, we actually see the
Play's pre-registration feature

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.960
sees about a 38%
conversion to install,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.840
which is a much
higher conversion

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.495
rate versus other
pre-registration sources.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.850
Finally, pre-registration
has the added benefit

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.380
of allowing you to display
your store listing to use this

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.570
on Play even before you launch.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.360
This allows you to drive
traffic from all your marketing

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.940
sources to a single
destination in order

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.535
to capture launch
demand for your title.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.460
Next, setting up a
pre-registration campaign

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.700
is super easy using
the Play Console.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.070
First, you want to
navigate to App releases.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.630
Then, you'll need to upload
an APK or bundle containing

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.180
a manifest describing
your device types you want

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.370
to include in your campaign.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.550
And release it onto one of
your closed testing tracks.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.850
Remember, you don't need to
make this closed testing track

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.950
available to any of your users.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.400
Its purpose can be simply
to hold your APK or bundle

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.830
containing these
device restrictions.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.370
This will in turn activate
the pre-registration control

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.390
center, which will allow you
to turn off and on countries

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.820
where you want to run your
pre-registration campaigns in.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.640
In this control
center, you can also

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.690
see pre-registration
sign-ups per country

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.330
as well as conversions to
install per country when you

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.820
eventually launch your game.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.370
Note that we will be limiting
pre-registration campaigns

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.223
to run for a maximum of
90 days in each country.

00:14:20.223 --> 00:14:22.890
You will see a helpful indicator
in the console telling you when

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.060
you are close to this time.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.300
Finally, I want to go
over some recommendations

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.550
to consider when
using pre-registration

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.480
with Google Play.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.210
First, allow some time to
build excitement in your title.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.880
Usually between three
to 12 weeks is ideal.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.990
Next, use all your channels
to indicate and build interest

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.580
around your title.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.310
You can use media, social,
YouTube, communities

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.946
with your own
website, et cetera.

00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:57.440
And drive your Android traffic
to Play's pre-registration

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.130
on the Play Store, specifically
due to the higher conversion

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.850
rates.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.020
So, that's Play's
pre-registration feature

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.010
in a nutshell.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.280
But, wait, there's more.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.890
Today, I am pleased
to announce that we

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.640
are launching pre-registration
rewards to all developers.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.560
What does this actually
allow you to do?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.300
Pre-registration
rewards allows you

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.130
to offer a free IAP, or in-app
purchase, to all your players

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.980
who have pre-registered
for your title.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.790
This reward is delivered
to users via Play

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.660
and is advertised via special
card on your store listing

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.920
as you can see on the screen.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.260
Configuring this reward is also
very easy using Play Console.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.250
You want to select the
IAP you want to give away.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.200
Supply the text that users
will see on your store listing

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.910
about the IAP.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.850
And when your game
launches, this IAP

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.360
will be in the library for you
to consume in your full game

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.750
experience.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.490
Also, remember to
configure your award

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.770
before starting your
pre-registration campaign

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.940
to ensure that all your users
will receive your reward

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.690
when you launch.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.430
Using pre-registration
rewards is a great way

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:22.320
to add value to your
pre-registration campaign.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.720
Not only does it
help incentivize uses

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.650
to pre-register for
your game, it also

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.760
can drive uplifts of
conversions to install,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.990
as there is value
waiting for the player

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.130
when they install
and play your game.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.200
In our pilots, we
have actually seen

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.110
about a 15% increase
in conversions

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.710
when games are using rewards.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.730
In fact, we didn't just see
an increase in conversion,

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.270
one of our developers,
Nexon in South Korea,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:57.460
also shared data showing a store
a sizable increase in uplift

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.840
and engagement for users who
received a reward versus those

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.420
who did didn't.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.119
Players were more likely
to stick with the game

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.790
and continue actively
playing if they

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.849
received a reward at the start.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:15.500
Pre-registration rewards is
available to all developers

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.874
right now to use in the
Google Play Console.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.079
So, another new addition
to pre-registration

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.390
is the ability to
run an instant game

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.940
alongside your
pre-registration campaign.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.430
Instant games allow you
to highlight key game play

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.890
elements of your
game and can even

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.250
display a clear call to
action to pre-register

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.070
from within the game itself.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.310
Upload and configure
your instant game

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.270
as known on the Play Console.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.410
And it will now show up
during pre-registration

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.580
if you distribute it
to the same countries

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.490
as you are running
your campaigns in.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.560
This is yet another
way to add value

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.690
to pre-registration campaign.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.915
And make it more enticing and
encourage players to finally

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.370
pre-register for your game.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.850
It's also important to call out
that all the features we just

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.360
described can be used in
conjunction with each other

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.470
to help create a unique and
compelling pre-launch marketing

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.080
story.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.720
For instance, you
may want to consider

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.350
tying a pre-registration
reward around a key item

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.230
or character you are showing
prominently in your marketing

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.960
material, tailor
your store listing

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.100
around your pre-registration
reward or instant game.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.770
And you may even allow
plays to sign up and create

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.400
a character inside your instant
game, which they can then

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.210
carry over into your full
game when it launches.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.030
We believe the intelligent
usage of these features

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.760
can help highlight
and communicate

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.020
what is special about your game,
even before the audience gets

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.420
their hands on the
finished product.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.300
And we hope you feel inspired
to create innovative and playful

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.620
pre-launch campaigns.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.430
Now, I'm going to
hand over to Steve,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.860
who's going to talk about how
to effectively market your games

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.798
even after you launch.

00:19:13.798 --> 00:19:16.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.230
STEVE SUPPE: Thanks, Jonathan.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.730
OK.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.300
Hi, everyone.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.050
My name's Steve.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.440
I'm a product manager
on the Play Console.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.020
Thanks very much
for coming today.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.540
So, at this point,
Jonathan's just

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.600
walked you through running a
successful pre-registration

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.670
campaign.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.350
And you've done all this work
getting ready for launch.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.510
But once you've launched,
I'm sorry to tell you,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.860
you're not actually finished.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.290
You've now just opened
up the floodgates.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.720
Your game is now exposed
to the vast demand

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.090
that Google Play brings to you.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.970
This is scary, but
it's a good thing.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.690
But, you have to keep optimizing
your marketing message

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.898
if you're going to make
the most of this exposure.

00:19:55.898 --> 00:19:58.190
So, I'm going to walk you
through the key features that

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.220
will help you to do that so that
you can continuously improve

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.530
your marketing and
your acquisition rate

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.760
over the life of your launch.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.750
When you first launch
your game on Google Play,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.960
you'll have to design and
publish your store listing.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.410
The store listing is your
front page for your users.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.740
It's where users read what you
have to say about your game.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.620
And where they can
browse your screenshots,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.730
your trailer videos,
and hopefully

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.860
even try an instant game.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.020
You've probably
spent weeks or even

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.860
months agonizing over the
perfect icon, screenshots,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.220
and more, to go on this page.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.000
And I'm sure your
teams did a great job.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.950
But, the thing is, it's
really, really hard

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.870
to know if you've
gotten this right,

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.400
even if you think you're
getting a good conversion rate.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.550
How do you really know
that you've optimized?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.125
There's a lot of people out
there visiting your page.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:51.750
And you'll want to
maximize your chance

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.170
of convincing them to install.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.220
And that's why the Google Play
Console provides store listing

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.800
experiments.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.740
Store listing experiments
is our A/B testing framework

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.010
that lets you try variants of
your store listing via properly

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.900
controlled experiments.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.510
You can easily try new
screenshots, videos,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.130
and descriptions,
so that you can

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.850
try all the great, and
maybe not so great,

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.830
ideas that you've ever had.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.330
You provide the ideas.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.562
We provide statistical
analysis so

00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:23.770
that you can be sure that
the changes and the results

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.460
are significant.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.580
You'll find store
listing experiments

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.790
underneath Store
presence on the left hand

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.530
nav of the Play Console.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.960
For those of you that
are already using them,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.510
we've introduced two
new metrics that we

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.140
think are your gold star metrics
when you're launching a game.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.900
First, we have
first-time installers.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.540
These are users who have
visited your listing

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.600
and are installing your
game for the first time.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.570
The other new metric
is one day retention,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.465
which are first-time installers
who have not uninstalled

00:21:56.465 --> 00:21:57.590
your game in the first day.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.310
So, they've continued to keep
your game more than 24 hours,

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.110
which is when we find is
the key time for retention.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.420
Even cooler, both
of these metrics

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.180
are now reported in
hourly intervals.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.840
So previously, you might have
had to wait 24 hours or more

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.870
in order to see the
most current results.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.570
Now, you can see
them every hour.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.840
You can also opt in to
receive email notifications

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.990
for when we think your
experiment is complete.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.910
This will help you
to make decisions

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.570
more quickly so you can take
advantage of good changes

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.560
and avoid the bad ones
as quickly as possible.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.420
Using store listing
experiments can

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.060
lead to great gains
in user acquisition,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.590
such as hot head games.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.800
You saw a 40% increase
in acquisition rate

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.740
simply by improving their icon.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.660
Here are some tips
and tricks that you

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.880
should keep in mind when
you're making the most out

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.070
of the store
listing experiments.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.170
So first of all, you
should think back

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.170
to how you were taught
experimentation in high school

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.990
science class.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.630
To get the clearest results, you
should test just a single asset

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:05.720
at a time.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.000
For example, changing your
icon or maybe a screenshot.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.310
Because, if you change
too many things at once,

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.680
you won't actually know
what drove that change

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.660
in acquisition rate.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.540
Second, you'll want to make sure
that you test for at least a

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.780
full week so that you can
track weekday and weekend

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.330
performance, because users
behave differently depending

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.840
on the time of the week.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.540
For games, the most
prominent assets

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.920
are your icon
screenshots and videos.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.150
So make sure to prioritize
these for testing.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.900
Finally, when you have a variant
that we tell you is working,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.480
you'll want to promote that
one to be your main listing as

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.890
soon as possible.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.460
But, you should continue
serving your original

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.350
as a 1% experiment
for a few more weeks

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.360
so that you can
ensure that over time,

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.810
this new one is still
outperforming your old one.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.560
Great.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.350
So, once you've optimized
your store listing,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.923
you now have a solid foundation
for user acquisition.

00:24:02.923 --> 00:24:04.840
You've probably learned
a lot about your users

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.090
along the way and the
best ways to communicate

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.770
what's unique and
exciting about your game.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.080
But, as you're looking at
your experiment results

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.110
and diving deeper into our
user acquisition reports,

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.420
you may find that there
are specific segments that

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.060
aren't converting as
well as you'd like.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.820
Google Play enables you to
run this global business

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.170
and not all users are the same.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.160
So, I'm excited to talk to you
about a powerful new feature

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.430
that allows you to market to
these different user segments

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.950
in a way that is much more
likely to get them to install

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.780
your game.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.240
This is what we call
custom store listings.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.130
Custom store listings
allow you to create

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.880
unique store listings delivered
to specific user segments.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.160
So, you tell us which types of
users should see this listing.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.330
And we do the rest.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.580
So, let me walk you through some
of the new targeting criteria.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.150
The first targeting dimension
that we've introduced

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.840
is country.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.410
Up until now, you've
had to rely on language

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.070
as a rough proxy for geography.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.490
But, users in
different countries

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.190
don't always choose the
language you would guess.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.950
For example, did you know
that half of users in India,

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.950
over half of users in
India, have set their device

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.380
language to either American
or British English.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.770
And these flavors of
language are not the same.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:20.790
I know this firsthand.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.333
So, I'm an American, born and
raised, but I live in London.

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:26.250
And if you've ever been
to London, if you ever

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.310
find yourself invited
to a fancy dress party,

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.550
you want to make sure that
you got the country right.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.330
Because, if you
get it wrong, you

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.420
could end up wearing a
tuxedo to a costume party.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.150
Or worse, show up wearing
a costume to something

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.350
like a wedding, or an
anniversary, or something

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.850
worse.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.700
Who knows?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.940
So, with this feature,
you can serve up

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.120
to five different listings to
completely different groups

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.580
of countries.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.690
So, by first targeting
by geography,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.000
you're very specific in how
you communicate to your users.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.683
So, imagine you're
a soccer game.

00:26:00.683 --> 00:26:02.600
Do you want your users
to be dreaming of being

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.480
in the most successful squad?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.730
Or do you want them to be
part of the winning-est team

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.570
in the tables?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.150
You can also use
your icon to help

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.150
users feel more at home,
such as the use of English

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.580
and American flags in
the icons we have here.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.580
We're also adding other
targeting capabilities.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.340
You can now target on the
launch day of your game,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.040
for those of you that were
excited about pre-reg.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.700
This is a really powerful way
to change your marketing message

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.130
to the right set of users
throughout the lifecycle

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.430
of your game.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.840
So for example, for
pre-registration users,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.110
you can now highlight rewards
or display a pre-launch teaser

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.230
trailer that the users in
places where you've launched

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.550
are not seeing so you can
really customize your message.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.760
For example, Gamevil's
game, Talion,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.890
was able to make use of
pre-registration store

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:53.810
listings.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.998
So like most games, they didn't
launch everywhere at once.

00:26:56.998 --> 00:26:59.040
Using this feature, they
were able to communicate

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.190
their launch only to the users
that were eligible for it.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.620
And they basically doubled their
pre-registration conversion

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.860
rate.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.917
Finally, taking a
step back, I want

00:27:11.917 --> 00:27:14.000
to give you a peek behind
the curtain of what else

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.240
we're up to.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.800
We're launching an early access
program for install state.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.140
Today, when you think
about your store listing,

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.750
you're thinking about, how do I
get users to install the game?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.390
But, some of these
visitors already

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.950
have your game installed.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.610
Or worse, they've churned or
maybe uninstalled your game.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.370
So, we can help you to
re-engage with these users,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.625
such as in this example, where
we can communicate new game

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:40.730
play in order to bring these
users back and excite them

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.813
into reinstalling your game.

00:27:42.813 --> 00:27:44.980
If you're interested in
being part of this beta that

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:51.820
we're running, be sure to go
to g.co/play/installstateEAP.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.140
And we'll get you signed up.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.640
All right.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.810
So, I've just
spent a lot of time

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.560
talking to you about
the marketing message

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.565
that you provide.

00:27:58.565 --> 00:28:00.190
But, there are other
parts of the store

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.050
listing that users see.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.630
Specifically, I'm
talking about ratings.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.280
Did you know that 42% of users
who leave a one star review

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.780
mentions stability or bugs?

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.393
No one in this room means
to have stability problems.

00:28:13.393 --> 00:28:15.310
But, it's often hard to
measure and track them

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.420
so that you can fix them.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.430
Luckily, we have
Android vitals to help

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.200
you gather more insight.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.990
We offer 15 engineering
metrics across five

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.630
different performance areas
to represent the things

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.452
that users care about the most.

00:28:28.452 --> 00:28:30.410
So, you can measure the
performance and quality

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.620
of your app as experienced
on real devices

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.210
in the hands of real
users in the real world.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.133
So, if you're interested
in Android vitals,

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:41.050
be sure to join some of
these other talks that

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.400
are going on this week.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.390
To wrap it all up,
custom store listings

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.430
for countries and
pre-registration

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.330
is available today, as are
the store listing experiments

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.500
for all of these store listings.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.940
I hope I've inspired
you to think

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.300
about cool and unusual ways that
you might be able to segment

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.120
your audience to really
squeeze out as much

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.860
of the acquisition rate
as you possibly can.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.890
Now, Andrew is going
to come up on stage

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.200
and walk you through building
an instant game, which

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.150
is a very important part
of any store listing,

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.640
but requires a little bit
more technical know how.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.760
Thanks for your time.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.227
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:18.227 --> 00:29:19.560
ANDREW GIUGLIANO: Thanks, Steve.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.260
Hello, my name is
Andrew Giugliano.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.920
And today, I will be talking to
you about Google Play Instant.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.810
And to answer your
question, yes, I

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.050
got a really bad sunburn during
the keynote this morning.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.810
It happens.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.800
It happens to the best of us.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.780
Google Play Instant
is a technology

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.570
that enables users to instantly
be immersed in your experience

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.460
with a single tap,
letting them try

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.620
your game without the
weight of installing.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.780
Here, we see an
example of cookie jam

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.880
blast being launched
from the try now button

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.140
in the Play Store.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.020
Today, instant games can
be launched from anywhere

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.390
across all of player's
properties and beyond.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.980
Now, how does Google Play
Instant help your game?

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.760
Simply put, it is getting
players into your experience

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.900
fast.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.520
It's increasing discoverability.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.070
You're getting more players
into your experience

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.540
across many surfaces.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.590
You're driving installs.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.965
Players are given
the opportunity

00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:16.590
to install your
game without ever

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.620
having to leave the experience.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.130
And you're improving retention.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.870
By offering players
a taste of your game,

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.610
Google Play Instant
helps players

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.520
feel more confident that your
game is worth installing.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.700
And this could lead to
less players uninstalling

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.390
after download.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.140
As you can see,
this technology has

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.730
been helpful to our partners.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.730
Across different categories,
monetization strategies,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.960
technologies, we've seen Instant
be impactful in driving uplift

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.820
for our developers.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.050
If there's one key
takeaway from this slide,

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.410
it's that Instant could
be helpful for your game.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.448
I also want to call out
our fantastic ecosystem

00:30:55.448 --> 00:30:57.240
of developers that is
formed to help others

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.040
create their own Instant games.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.170
In fact, AppOnboard,
just yesterday,

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.960
released their AppOnboard
Studio Tools, specifically built

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.020
for Instant games, which helps
creators create an Instant

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.730
game with no code.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.890
I believe this is a
testament that we are not

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.900
alone in seeing the
potential of Instant games

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.030
to help developers
drive installs.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.012
And we're not stopping there.

00:31:19.012 --> 00:31:21.220
We will be continuing to
expand the reach of Instant.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.920
You may have noticed a few
slides ago the game's playlist

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.330
that lets you try a
lot of games very fast.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.130
That's on the far left.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.470
And our success has enabled
us to elevate Instant games

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.780
from the store listing to
the top layer of Play Store

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.320
Discovery, from the
search page to game

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.210
highlights and collections
on the landing page.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.040
These new experiences
were made possible

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.850
to the incredible
support of our partners

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:43.888
building instant games.

00:31:47.345 --> 00:31:49.220
So now that we've seen
the impact of Instant,

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.500
we'll do a deep dive on
building your own instant game

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.940
from scratch.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.990
Engineers in the room,
this pit will be for you.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.490
Now, under the hood,
an instant game

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.230
is just a 10
megabyte or less APK

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.570
that is being served
over Play, downloaded,

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.510
and run on a more secure
runtime on the device.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.520
Creating a separate APK and
getting under that size limit,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.490
it might sound
difficult. But, here we

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.220
will show you how easy it is
to create your own instant game

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.303
and we'll give you all
the tools to do so.

00:32:14.303 --> 00:32:15.970
In fact, if anything
is to be taken away

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.580
from the next section, it's
that creating instant games

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.790
is now easier than ever.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.740
In this example,
we'll use Unity.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.613
But, nearly any APK
can be made instant.

00:32:24.613 --> 00:32:27.030
And we have a great plugin for
Coco's creators developers.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:27.905
We'll see that later.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.090
First off, there
are four major steps

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.257
in creating an instant game.

00:32:33.257 --> 00:32:34.760
And this spans any game engine.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.968
You're going to build it out.

00:32:35.968 --> 00:32:38.250
So, you're going to actually
make the APK instant.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.350
You're going to
gracefully convert

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.020
your users from the instant
game to the install game.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.240
You're going to reduce size
to meet that 10 megabyte

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.520
requirement, and we'll give
you some tips and tricks

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.397
to do that.

00:32:48.397 --> 00:32:49.980
And you're going to
do some publishing

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.813
and testing on Play to
test the distribution

00:32:51.813 --> 00:32:53.327
of your instant game.

00:32:53.327 --> 00:32:54.660
So let's build the instant game.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.440
First off, the
tools we will need

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.310
is Unity, the great Google
Play Instant plug-in for Unity.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.810
That will make a
lot of this easier.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.310
You can get that
on the asset store.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.320
You can also download
it on GitHub.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.870
An Android device can
be physical or virtual.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.780
We recommend testing it on
Pre-Oreo and Oreo plus devices,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.270
just because there's a slight
difference in the runtime.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.190
And access to your source code
and Play Developer Console.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.808
First step, you'll go to the
build settings in the plugin.

00:33:24.808 --> 00:33:26.350
You will choose the
scenes that you'd

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.594
like to include in
your instant game.

00:33:28.594 --> 00:33:29.980
And that's it.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.370
So, the URL is not required.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.590
We provide a
default one any-who.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.450
And don't worry
about asset bundles,

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.197
we'll see that a little later.

00:33:40.197 --> 00:33:42.030
Next, you'll configure
your Player Settings.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.650
This is a mix of
required changes

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.690
you need to make
your game instant.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.000
It's all a click of a button,
you just click Update.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.750
As well some recommended changes
to help reduce that size.

00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:56.000
And then you just select
build and run from the plugin,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.870
and you can run your
game instantly locally.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.053
Super easy.

00:34:00.053 --> 00:34:01.720
So now that we've
built an instant game,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.380
let's gracefully convert those
users from the instant game

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:04.960
to the installed game.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.585
Because, obviously, that's what
we're trying to do here, right?

00:34:07.585 --> 00:34:08.590
That's the scope.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.730
So, we make it easier by
providing a showInstallPrompt,

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.139
where you just call
one line of code,

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.360
we show the prompt, and
we care of the rest.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.790
And it works for
pre-reg as well.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.280
So, players can
pre-register and install

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.885
without ever having to leave
the instant experience.

00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:26.260
Likely, you should put this
at the end of your experience

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.170
and have a level that match.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.980
And you could also show
a persistent button

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.070
so the user could, at
any time, go to install.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.570
Additionally, you might want
to carry some information over.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:36.612
We'll show you that, too.

00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:40.949
That could be buy in-game
items, levels, when

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.360
you customize your character.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.500
You can use a cookie API
to transfer this data over.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.909
So, here, you'll just
call the one line above.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.139
And we will do the rest.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:56.159
Likewise, you can just put
a string of data together

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.745
and we will bring that
over to the install game.

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:01.370
And this is all you
have to call to get

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.685
that data on the other side.

00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.310
And just like that, you have all
the tools to convert your user

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.950
from instant to installed.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.530
OK, let's look at reducing size.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.157
This could be the
most frightening one

00:35:13.157 --> 00:35:13.990
for some developers.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.110
But, we'll give you some help.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.805
First off, you want to narrow
the scope of the content

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:19.680
in your instant game.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.360
You don't want to include your
full game as an instant game.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.660
And if it's under 10 megabytes
already, that's great.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.880
But, really you want to
offer a trailer of your game.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.450
You want to offer the
most exciting pieces.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.780
Show game play that is critical
to understanding the full game.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.580
But, you shouldn't just
choose easy levels,

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.530
show the exciting ones as well.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.415
And, again, games as
large as 350 megabytes

00:35:39.415 --> 00:35:41.040
have been able to
launch instant games.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.530
And I'm sure even
larger than that.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.670
No matter what game you have,
you can create an instant game.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.170
Remove unnecessary assets.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.910
Do deep dive through
technical resources.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.120
Remove what's not needed.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.910
Unneeded assets.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.137
Even reducing resolution.

00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:57.720
Really, you should
ask yourself, is it

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.280
critical to get us
to the experience?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.428
If not, remove it.

00:36:00.428 --> 00:36:02.970
Also, follow those recommended
settings I showed you earlier.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.690
That really helps
in reducing size.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.720
Finally, a really good way
to get under that size limit

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.070
are asset bundles.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.140
They allow you to load
assets dynamically

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.640
while the instant
game is running.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.205
And these assets will not
count against your limit.

00:36:17.205 --> 00:36:19.660
While you may use as many
asset bundles as you like,

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.120
each asset level must be less
than 50 megabytes in size.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.140
So, be thoughtful on how many
asset bundles you import.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.300
There are three pieces
needed to use asset bundles

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.805
in your instant game.

00:36:28.805 --> 00:36:30.430
First, you want to
create asset bundles

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.460
from the scenes in your game.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.500
You want to show user
friendly loading screen

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.150
while that is loading up.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.580
And you will need
a web server CDN

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.530
to serve these asset bundles.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.750
And using the tool
in the plugin,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.160
we will help you take
care of those first two.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.118
So, first, you'll go to
the bundle creation tab

00:36:49.118 --> 00:36:50.868
and you'll select the
scenes that you want

00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:52.382
include in the asset bundle.

00:36:52.382 --> 00:36:54.840
Once finished, we will give
you a file that you'll throw up

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.675
on your web server or CDN.

00:36:56.675 --> 00:36:58.050
And then that next
screen, you'll

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.480
specify the URL to
access those files.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.445
Additionally, you can
provide a custom background

00:37:04.445 --> 00:37:06.570
for the loading screen I
was talking about earlier.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.400
But, we provide a
default one as well.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.920
So, super easy.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.210
And just like that,
when you click Finish,

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.827
we will generate the code
to retrieve the asset

00:37:14.827 --> 00:37:15.660
bundles in the game.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.327
So, it's really easy
and you're all set.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.400
So we've looked at some
tools for reducing size.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.350
Let's look at Play
and how Play can

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:29.545
help in this testing in
the development phase.

00:37:29.545 --> 00:37:30.920
You should take
your instant game

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.500
and you should upload it to
your internal test track.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.950
There's no size limit here.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.010
So, you can use this
iteratively while you're

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.860
building this instant game
to test the distribution up

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.897
to 100 users that
you'll choose manually.

00:37:42.897 --> 00:37:45.230
Now, make sure that there is
an accompanying installable

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.660
listing or you're
in pre-reg phase.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.850
Because, you need to
upgrade to installed or you

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.890
need to be in the pre-reg phase.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.440
And then, of course, push your
production when you're ready.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.720
And just like that,
you have all the tools

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.520
to make a production-ready
instant game.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.870
You can see more information
below at the link.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.670
Not using Unity?

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.485
No problem.

00:38:05.485 --> 00:38:07.610
Make the following changes
in your manifest to make

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.710
nearly any APK locally
readable as instant.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.680
And, of course, you'll need
to follow the four key steps.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.708
We talked about
some APIs earlier.

00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:16.250
If you follow the
GitHub link, you'll

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.530
see some sample code
and native Android

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.780
for using the same
APIs, like cookie, API,

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.470
and a showInstallPrompt.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.360
We also offer a plugin
with Cocos Creator

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.160
that allows you to create
an instant game by recording

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.000
the game play.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.042
And I'll show you the
assets needed to package it

00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:31.000
with your instant game.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.536
It's a really cool experience.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.590
So, to quickly recap,
there are three key things

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.570
I want you to walk away with.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:42.710
Number one, that Play
offers an incredible array

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.600
of promotional and
marketing tools

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.960
from pre-reg, to store
listing experiments, to Google

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.320
Play instant.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.902
Two, these tools
are easy to use.

00:38:52.902 --> 00:38:54.860
Most are configurable
through the Play Console.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.360
And in the case of
Google Play Instant,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.880
we showed you that you could
build a demo yourself or have

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.180
one of our implementation
partners build one for you.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.530
Lastly, Play's
promotional capabilities

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.080
can deliver material
business impact.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.330
So, what's next?

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.580
You can start by taking a
picture of this slide, which

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.650
includes all the links
from the presentations.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.610
Phones are going up.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.860
Now that we've taken a look
at what instant games are,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.800
how they can help, and
how to build your own,

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.450
I want to give you
a chance to test

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.510
some of the instant games
that are out there today.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.220
Scan the QR code and
you'll be brought

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.250
to a collection of great
instant games on the Play Store.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.470
At the bottom, here
is the link to sign up

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.450
for the customized
store listing features

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.000
and install state EAP as well.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.158
So, with that, thank
you for your time.

00:39:45.158 --> 00:39:46.450
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.950
