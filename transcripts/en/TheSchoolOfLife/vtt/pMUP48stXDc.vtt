00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.490
For some 400 years across the European Middle
Ages, one philosophy book was prized above

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.760
any other. Present in every educated person’s
library, it was titled in Latin De Consolatione

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.189
Philosophiae or, as we know it in English
today, The Consolation of Philosophy. Editions

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.910
appeared in all the large European languages,
Chaucer translated it into English, as did

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.540
Sir Thomas More and Elizabeth I – and Dante
made it a centerpiece of the intellectual

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.649
scaffolding of his Divine Comedy. The book
was the work of the Italian statesman, scholar

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.969
and academic Boethius, who penned it in a
few months in appalling circumstances in a

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.820
prison in Pavia in 523 A.D. Boethius was born
into a highly successful and wealthy family

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.580
in the years after the collapse of the Roman
Empire in the West. From an early age, he

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.980
took an interest in the Classics, and translated
much of Plato and Aristotle’s work from

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.190
Latin into Greek; it is thanks in great measure
to his efforts that Classical philosophy made

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.530
its way into the Middle Ages and from there
into the modern world. For many years, Boethius’s

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.910
life was seemingly blessed. He lived in a
sumptuous villa in Rome and was married to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.479
a kind and beautiful woman called Rusticiana,
with whom he had two handsome, clever and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.700
affectionate sons. Under a sense of obligation
to his society, Boethius eventually entered

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.780
politics and occupied a number of elevated
administrative positions under the ruler of

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.750
Italy, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths.
Bertrand Russell wrote of him: He would have

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.920
been remarkable in any age, in the age in
which he lived, he is utterly amazing. But

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.829
suddenly, in the spring of 523 A.D, Boethius’s
fortune ran out. There was a knock at the

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.649
door and a gang of Theodoric’s guards accused
him (quite falsely) of having plotted against

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.049
the increasingly paranoid and vengeful king.
With scarcely time to say goodbye to his family,

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.680
Boethius was carted off to prison. Entirely
innocent but also aware of the risk he was

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.939
in, Boethius fell into despair. In a tiny
cell, he contemplated his rapid fall from

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.030
grace, his love for his family and the unfairness
of his destiny. What would eventually lift

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.380
his spirits – and at the same time, gift
humanity one of its greatest works of prison

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.780
literature of any time or place – was his
decision to think his way philosophically

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.430
out of his sorrows. As The Consolation of
Philosophy opens, Boethius describes his listless

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.510
sadness and terror at his state: ‘White
hairs are scattered untimely on my head, and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.960
the skin hangs loosely from my worn-out limbs’.
But in this downcast state, Boethius receives

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.080
an unexpected visit: ‘While I was pondering
thus in silence, and using my pen to set down

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.840
so tearful a complaint, there appeared standing
over my head a woman’s form, whose countenance

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.870
was full of majesty, whose eyes shone as with
fire and whose power of insight surpassed

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.590
that of all men…’ His visitor is a metaphorical
figure whom Boethius terms Lady Philosophy.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.960
Lady Philosophy is carrying a pile of classical
books in one hand and a sceptre in the other

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.890
– and she has come to visit Boethius in
his cell in order to remind him of some of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.050
the fundamental truths of his favourite subject,
largely as defined by the Stoic school of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.740
Greece and Rome. That she should have dropped
in on him was, in a sense, no surprise: in

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.120
the classical world, philosophy was not an
abstract academic discipline, it was a set

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.110
of tools specifically designed to help one
live and die well, and with acute relevance

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.450
at the darkest moments. Lady Philosophy begins
by gently chiding Boethius for ‘flaring

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.690
up against’ his fate. She reminds him, as
Stoic philosophers had constantly stressed,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.690
that human beings are not in control of most
of what happens to them. Our destiny is in

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.670
large measure in the hands of a devilishly
powerful seductive goddess whom the Romans

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.100
knew as Fortuna, the Goddess of Fortune. This
figure was a central deity in the Roman pantheon

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.960
and was represented across the Roman world
on coins and statues. She was typically depicted

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.770
holding a cornucopia in one hand, overflowing
with fruit and luxuries, and on the other,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.000
leaning on a tiller, a marker of her capacity
to direct people’s fates. Depending on her

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.630
mood, Fortune might either shower us with
gifts or, with a blithe smile, steer us towards

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.300
catastrophe. To be a philosopher means to
understand all that Fortune controls, to resist

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.349
her blandishments, to know never to put complete
faith in the things that are, ultimately,

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.620
always in the hands of an immoral and reckless
force – and to prepare for the day when

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.229
we may have to surrender her gifts at a stroke.
These gifts comprise most of what we would

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.330
today think of as the fundamental ingredients
of happiness: love, family, children, prosperity,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.759
reputation and career. But, for a Stoic philosopher,
none of them should be things that the wise

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.800
should ever really trust – for all of them
can be lost in horrific circumstances at any

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.139
moment. Lady Philosophy sits with Boethius
in his cell and reminds him of his appalling

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.460
exposure to Fortune’s deceptive charm: ‘I
know the many disguises of that monster, Fortune,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.650
and the extent to which she seduces with friendship
the very people she is striving to cheat,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.699
until she overwhelms them with unbearable
grief at the suddenness of her desertion.’

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.870
But Lady Philosophy also reminds Boethius
that the wise have to resist putting their

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.509
faith in the gifts of Fortune. She introduces
a famous image of a Wheel of Fortune, which

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:33.530
spins between success and favour – and appalling
punishment and pain. Fortune spins the wheel

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.180
with abandon and merciless cruelty, enjoying
the screams of those who, only hours before,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.580
were confident of their future. ‘If you
are trying to stop her wheel from turning,

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.499
you of all men are the most obtuse,’ Lady
Philosophy tells Boethius, ‘You are seeking

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:53.900
to regain what really did not belong to you.’
Fortune herself pipes up at this point and

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.550
says with chilling candour: ‘Inconstancy
is my very essence; it is the game I never

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.270
cease to play as I turn my wheel in its ever
changing circle… yes, rise up on my wheel

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.370
if you like, but don’t count it an injury
when by the same token you begin to fall,

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.599
as the rules of the game will require….
Isn’t this what tragedy commemorates with

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.320
its tears and tumult?’ Lady Philosophy now
gets to the heart of her message. Boethius

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.219
must, like any good philosophically inclined
person, stop trusting in anything that Fortune

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.979
can take away at once: ‘You know there is
no constancy in human affairs, when a single

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.099
swift hour can often bring a man to nothing.’
‘If you are in possession of yourself you

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.979
will possess something you would never wish
to lose and something Fortune could never

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.759
take away…. Happiness cannot consist in
things governed by chance.’ Boethius must

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.370
retreat to what the Stoic philosophers called
his ‘inner citadel,’ a minimal self immune

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.130
from the cruelty of Fortune. Lady Philosophy
stresses that a different sort of happiness

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.669
can be found by focusing on all that Fortune
can never make one lose, specifically one’s

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.849
powers of reasoning, which give one access
to the beauty, mystery and complexity of the

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.220
universe. True philosophers rise above their
immediate circumstances, become indifferent

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.000
to their own fate and identify with the vast
forces of history and nature. It’s a measure

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.590
of the relevance of Boethius’s message that
we today so firmly identify happiness with

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:27.600
two areas that lie entirely in the hands of
Fortune: romantic love and career success.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.949
And, unsurprisingly, we are continually let
down here too, the wheel of fortune spinning

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:38.669
us randomly from promise to disgrace, from
hope to ruin. Boethius’s provocative message

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.370
to his own times and to our own is that the
best way to find peace of mind may be to perceive

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.870
the ingredients we associate with happiness
as in truth direct conduits to a fundamental

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.990
instability, and thereby to inner torment
and anxiety. Boethius’s wisdom was to be

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.129
the last eloquent outcry of the guiding ideas
of Classical philosophy and in particular,

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:06.330
its Stoic branch. Thereafter, Christianity
subsumed its insights, which were then further

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.939
obscured by the scientific optimism of the
modern period. Our own troubled times deserve

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:17.419
to witness the rediscovery of the Stoic message.
We become philosophers not by writing books

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:23.219
or attending university courses, but by appreciating
how little of our lives is in our hands, the

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:28.400
ubiquity and fickleness of Fortune and our
need to look beyond public opinion, family,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.030
love and status – in order to build up serenity
through the exercise of one’s distinctive

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:40.410
and fate-independent mental powers. Boethius
was killed, as he feared, a few months after

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.870
being imprisoned. His grave lies in the Church
of San Pietro in Ciel d’Oro in Pavia, half

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.580
an hour from Milan. In his honour, we should
leave space for Lady Philosophy occasionally

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.670
to come and visit us – and, when we are
facing the worst turns of Fortune’s wheel,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:02.740
let her strengthen our resolve to depend a
little less on what was in fact never really

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:10.630
ours to rely upon. If you liked this film,
