00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.020
Caravans of migrants and refugees are coming
from Central America because of poverty and

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.640
violence, but climate change is also playing
a big role.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.760
Now the new  climate change report just released ...

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.520
Climate change.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.380
The climate change ...

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.980
Climate emergency.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980
... climate change today, it came with a dire warning.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.640
El Salvador is one of the main places they're
fleeing from, and it's experiencing a water

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.660
crisis.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.440
95% of the surface water in the country is
undrinkable.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.060
In the summer of 2018, droughts in what's
known as Central America's “Dry Corridor”

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.560
– that's Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
and El Salvador

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
– have been projected to  leave up to 2 million people hungry.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.960
Mexico and Central America could see up to 3.9 million climate refugees in the next 30 years.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.889
And around the world, it's expected that just
over 143 million people will be displaced

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.509
by climate change by 2050.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.610
In El Salvador, it's not just droughts that
contribute to lack of water.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.400
For many, the taps are also running dry because
of the threat of privatization of what little

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.240
drinkable water is left.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.180
The right-wing in the country is trying to
introduce a Comprehensive Water Law that will

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.080
include members of the business sector on
their governing board.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.040
If water becomes privatized in El Salvador,
its most vulnerable communities could lose out.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.200
Around 600,000 people in El Salvador have
no access to drinking water.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.220
That's around 10% of the country's population.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.040
Anabel Chavez Mejia is one of them.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.700
She lives in the Usulután department in what's
considered part of El Salvador's “dry corridor.”

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.120
At more than three dollars, a 
barrel of water costs more than half of what

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.340
rural Salvadorans earn  in a day.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.060
On top of the burden of retrieving water,
El Salvador is one of the most dangerous countries

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.660
in the world for women.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.700
In 2017, one woman was murdered every 18 hours.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.460
Latin America continues to be the most dangerous
region for environmental activism.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.540
In 2017, the area accounted for 60% of all
environmental activists killed.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.040
Despite the challenges of defending water,
there have been some environmental wins.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.320
In 2017, El Salvador became the only 
country in the world to ban mining.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.400
In 2015, the local government stood up to
Coca-Cola and stopped them from digging wells

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.540
in the Salvadoran town of Nejapa.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.060
But the fight to protect the environment and natural resources in the country is far from over.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.660
