00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In lecture, Dave introduce the Rabin-Miller test for primality.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For this assignment, I want you to implement this test.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The Rabin-Miller function your going to write will take in a number

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that may be composite or prime and target, which defines the desired probability level.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The default value 128 corresponds to a probability of 1/2^128.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Two useful routines are the module exponentiation function

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that we've been using throughout this unit and randrange,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is a function of the Python library, that returns a random integer

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a random integer between start and end.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I haven't provided any tests, but you should be able to find some prime and composite numbers

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to test with on your own.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There is some randomness, so there is a small chance the test will return True for a composite number,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but if your target is set high enough--and 128 should be pretty high.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's very unlikely that this will happen.
