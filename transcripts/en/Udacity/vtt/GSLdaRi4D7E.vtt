00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.950
Now that we found the least
common denominator, which is 16,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.218
we have to find equivalent
fractions of three eighths and

00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:10.680
five sixteenths that have
the least common denominator.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.080
Five sixteenths already has
sixteen in the denominator, but

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.420
what about three eighths?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.590
Which of these fractions is
equivalent to three eighths and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.070
also has sixteen in the denominator?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.820
Please pick one.
