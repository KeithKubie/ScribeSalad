00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.510
The move planner app that you'll be building will require three

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.630
different asynchronous requests.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.330
It will require data from Google street-view, The New York Times, and Wikipedia.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.790
When the user types in an address,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.250
the street-view of their new potential home will become the background, and

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.080
they'll see related New York Times and Wikipedia articles below.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.740
But, before we start building,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.780
we really need to break down the components of asynchronous requests.
