00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.636
It's time to play Vine-HS.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.606
-Vine-HS.
-(cheering)

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.212
As the old saying goes,
Doug loves movies,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.248
and true movie lovers like Doug
get bummed out

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.949
when they think
of all the classic films

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:20.053
that are trapped
on obsolete VHS tapes.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.022
Um, those are cassettes
not deemed worthy enough

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.791
to be ripped onto Netflix
or PornHub

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.360
and they're just
kind of floating some...

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.462
I'm just throwing out
random, uh...

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.364
But thanks to Vine accounts
like Grimy Ghost!

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.732
and It Came From The VCR,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.701
we can revisit the weirdest gems
ever put to tape.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.037
So I'm gonna show you
a bizarre clip from an old VHS,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.206
and then for 250 points,
I want you to tell me

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.874
what the next line of dialogue
is, all right?

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.811
All right, first up,
these aging Anglos.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.746
I can't seem
to get it up properly.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.581
Are you less moist, for example?

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.817
-Yes, exactly.
-Yes, exactly.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.085
Doug.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.154
Yes, we are both dry as (bleep).

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.990
All right, points. Points.

00:00:58.023 --> 00:00:59.525
Erica.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.463
I used to squirt and now
it's more of a light misting.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:17.543
And then you just see her...
(hisses) Excuse me!

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.512
-Points to Erica Rhodes.
-Cup o' tea.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.416
Very well played. Uh, next up,
this cutting critique.

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:25.685
Color isn't that great
and this horse is fat,

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.186
looks a little bit overweight.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.555
This horse'll never
get my money any day.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.157
(bell dings)

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.426
What a (bleep) dick.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.894
Rory.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.463
Okay, thank you,
Tim in Pontiac, Michigan.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:41.434
That's the last time
we go to the phones.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:45.037
Points. Points.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.606
Erica.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.575
And the horse looks even worse.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.544
-Oh!
-Points.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.984
Next up, these fish lovers.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.286
Come on, Eric,
you've had your lunch.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.190
(babbles)

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:05.958
(bell dings)

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.094
Doug.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.362
He goes on to say...

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.299
(babbling)

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.553
And then the dolphin goes,
"Why are you speaking Porpoise?"

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.221
Points.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.390
Yeah, that's very racist.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.058
We're not the same.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.593
Rory Scovel.

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:43.696
Cut! James, look, if you can't
remember the lines,

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.031
just call for them.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.967
Do not dolphin scat again.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.905
-Points, points.
-(babbling)

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:58.611
Finally, this lurid embrace.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.219
(bell dings)

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:17.763
You guys have never seen,
uh, Spider-Boyz II Men?

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:21.701
Uh...
Doug Benson.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.803
I don't know if there's
any dialogue, Chris,

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.569
but here comes Spider-Man.
