00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.603
Why are you back?!
-(Bannon sighs)

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.073
There was a murder
at my favorite Denny's.

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.942
Nice! Hey, that brings us
to our desk piece.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.413
It's time for "Nice! Not Nice!"

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.115
<i> -Super</i> not nice. -What?
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.185
♪ ♪

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.057
♪ Nice! ♪

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.825
Miniskirts.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:28.194
In order to convince me
to stay at war,

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.763
General McMaster had
to show me an old photo

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.199
of hot Afghan women
in miniskirts.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.436
Tali<i> damn!</i>

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.538
Not nice!

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.906
Mini fridges.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:43.776
Mini fridges have problems
on many sides.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.478
On many sides.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.847
You have to bend down
to use them,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.715
the freezer always ices up,

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:53.252
and the shelves are too short
for my KFC bucket.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.288
And the bucket's the best part.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.857
But show me a mini fridge
in a miniskirt,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.894
and, fridgie, damn...!

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.763
Super not nice.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.999
Lice. They pester small children
at summer camp,

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.801
and that's<i> my</i> job.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.771
Okay, Steve, stay on topic.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.606
What? You can't fire me.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:14.907
I queef.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.676
-Language!
-English!

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.344
That's my favorite one!

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.779
I know it by heart.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.481
Moving on.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.015
Nice.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.450
Statues.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:28.888
The single best way to preserve
our precious, precious history.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.389
Not nice!

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:33.526
History. It's old, it's books,

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:36.129
and I wasn't there,
so who cares?

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.799
Besides, people always say,
if you don't learn it,

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.567
it just repeats itself.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.636
So I'll catch a rerun.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.404
(laughter)

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:48.541
(sniffs)
Uh, super duper not nice.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.610
The History Channel.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.745
It's all<i> Pawn Stars </i>
and<i> American Pickers.</i>

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.448
Where's Hitler?
He used to be the whole channel.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.017
When I get home
after a hard morning,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.553
I want to plunk down
on my bare mattress,

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:03.723
with a jug of wine,
and root for Hitler!

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.526
(chuckles)
You know, when I need to unwind,

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:10.062
Karen runs me
a nice, shallow bath.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.532
That's disgusting, Mike.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:16.569
I hope you drown in it
like a toddler.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.538
Nice.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.139
Hillary Clinton.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:23.543
She called me a creep
for breathing down her neck

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.411
during the second debate.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:28.014
But I'm not a creep.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.582
I'm in love.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.983
I'm obsessed with her!

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.685
I can't stop thinking about her.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:35.388
The only reason I wanted to see
her 30,000 e-mails

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.690
was because I was hoping
there was one in there

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:39.425
that said she loved<i> me!</i>

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.494
(laughter, aw'ing)

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.764
(crying):
Not nice!

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.299
Tears!

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:51.003
There's water in my eye, Steve!
Help me! Help!

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.838
I said I don't like water.

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:55.641
But let me do it nice--
that'll cheer you up.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.076
(Trump crying quietly)

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.646
You know what's...<i> nice?</i>

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.583
Working for
a white nationalist website,

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.484
then working
inside the White House

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.254
while you<i> say</i> you stopped
working at that website,

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.089
but you never really did.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:13.559
-Okay, okay, Steve. -So then
you go back to that website,

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.062
even though you'll still be
working for the White House,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.130
-No, Steve, no, no, no, no.
-but this time

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.366
without the shackles
of a gutless deep state,

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.201
-TRUMP: Okay, uh...
-keeping me from using

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:23.970
-PENCE: No.
-my dark sex magic

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.472
-No. -in my war against
globalist secular modernity!

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.274
-He's getting too intense!
-I am the beast

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:29.575
-He's overheating!
-in the maze!

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.844
-No! Steve! Oh, no! -And
the Grail resides within me!

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.779
-We have to cool him down!
-I and other virile...

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.048
(yelling)

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.516
I'm melting!

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.719
-Oh, no! I'm melting!
-PENCE: Oh, no.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.521
I told you
I never touch the stuff!

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:43.823
Oh...!

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.291
-He's a witch!
-Oh!

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.159
I'm a witch.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:48.694
-TRUMP: Steve!
-(yelling)

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:51.864
No...! It's impossible!

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.967
No, Steve! No!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.770
-(final exhale)
-PENCE: He's gone!

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.172
Don't worry.
This happens all the time.

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:01.341
He'll be back.
