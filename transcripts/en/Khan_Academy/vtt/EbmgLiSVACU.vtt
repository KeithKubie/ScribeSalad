00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.140
Let's see if we can simplify
this expression right over

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.979
here and write it in
scientific notation.

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:07.520
So the first thing
I want to do, well

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.353
I already have parts
of this expression that

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:11.010
are written in
scientific notation.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.156
For my brain, to simplify
the multiplication,

00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:15.280
I like to write everything
into scientific notation

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.190
and then do whatever
I need to do

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.490
to get the final product
into scientific notation.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.730
So this part right
over here, 0.2,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550
is not in scientific notation.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.300
In order for it to be
scientific notation,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.560
it would have to be some
number between 1 and 10,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.729
not including 10-- so
greater than or equal to 1,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.040
less than 10-- being
multiplied by some power of 10.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.279
And this is clearly less than 1.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.820
But we could just
view this as, look,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.810
this is in the tenths place.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.880
This is 2 times 1/10.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.730
1/10 is 10 to the negative 1.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.200
So this is the same
thing as 2 times 10

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.864
to the negative 1-- same
thing as 2 times 1/10.

00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:56.280
Now if we look in
the denominator,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.580
in blue, we have this part.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.470
It is written in
scientific notation.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.940
But this green part is not.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.980
But we could easily write it
as-- this is five 10,000's.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.950
10,000 is 10 to the fourth.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.060
So this is the same thing as 5
times 10 to the fourth power.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.730
And you see that it has
one, two, three, four 0's.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.760
So now let's take the
product in the numerator

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.892
and the denominator.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.350
So in the numerator,
I'm just going

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.170
to swap the order in
which I'm multiplying.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.753
I'm just multiplying
a bunch of stuff.

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:28.400
4.6 times 10 to the sixth times
2 times 10 to the negative 1.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.880
It doesn't matter what
order I multiply them in.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.470
So I could rewrite this
as 4.6 times 2 times

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.000
2 times 10 to the sixth-- I'm
switching colors-- times 10

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.870
to the negative 1.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.030
And then in the denominator,
let me just write the 5 times

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.700
2.3 times 10 to the fourth
times 10 to the negative 2.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.210
And now let us attempt
to simplify this thing.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.040
So here, we have 4.6 times 2.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.900
Let me circle that.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.080
So 4.6 times 2 is 9.2.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.790
So that's 9.2.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.800
And then 10 to the sixth
times 10 to the negative 1--

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.759
we have the same base.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.800
We're taking the product.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560
We can add the
exponents-- is going

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.340
to be 10 to the 6 minus 1
or 10 to the fifth power.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.230
So we've simplified
our numerator.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.980
And now in our
denominator, let's see.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.110
5 times 2.3-- 5 times 2 is 10.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.870
5 times 0.3 is 1.5, so
it's going to be 11.5.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.420
So this is going to be 11.5.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.080
And then if I multiply
10 to the fourth times 10

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.290
to the negative 2, that's going
to be 10 to the 4 minus 2 or 10

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.830
squared-- times 10
to the second power.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.150
And now I can divide
these two things.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.630
So this is going to
be equal to-- we'll

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.100
have to think about
what 9.2 over 11.5 is.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.790
But actually let me
just do that right

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.195
now, get a little practice
dividing decimals.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.150
Let me get some
real estate here.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.130
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.220
9.2 divided by 11.5--
well if we multiply

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.050
both of these times 10, that's
the exact same thing as 92

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.602
divided by 115.

00:03:44.602 --> 00:03:46.060
We're essentially
moved the decimal

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.220
to the right for both of them.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.630
And let me add some zeros
here because I suspect

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.550
that I'm going to
get a decimal here.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.740
So let's think what
this is going to be.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.870
Let's think about this.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.710
Well 115 doesn't go into 9.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.180
It doesn't go into 92.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.820
It does go into 920.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.064
And I'm going to eyeball and
say that it will go eight times.

00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:07.230
Let's see if that works out.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.313
So I have my decimal here.

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:09.550
That's a 0.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.830
8 times-- 8 times 5 is 40.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.130
8 times 11 is 88.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.196
And then 88 plus 4 is 92.

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:21.700
Oh, it went in
exactly, very good.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.440
So 920, we have no remainder.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.460
So 9.2 divided by 11.5
simplified to 0.80.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.560
And then 10 to the fifth
divided by 10 to the second,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.450
we have the same base,
and we're dividing.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.910
So we can subtract
the exponents.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.022
That's going to be
10 to the 5 minus 2.

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:45.730
So this right over
here is going to be 10

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.130
to the third power-- so
times 10 to the third power.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.280
Now, are we done?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.270
Well in order to be done,
this number right over here

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.840
needs to be greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.710
It is clearly not greater
than or equal to 1.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.120
So how can we rewrite this
as the product of something

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.300
that is greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.370
and some power of 10?

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.290
Well this 8 right over here,
this is in the tenths place.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.500
It's 8/10, 8 times 1/10.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.560
So this is going to be the
same thing as 8 times 10

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.610
to the negative 1 power.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.200
And then we have this 10 to
the third here-- so times 10

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.240
to the third power.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.680
We'll do that in
that other color.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.160
And now we have the same base.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.470
Just add the exponents.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.130
So this is going to
be equal to 8 times 10

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.565
to the 3 minus 1-- so
8 times 10 squared.

00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:48.190
And we're done.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.660
We've simplified our
original expression.
