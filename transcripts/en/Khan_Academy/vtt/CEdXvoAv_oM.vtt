00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.540
This is a picture of
the planet Lubricon-VI.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.890
And Lubricon-VI is a
very special planet

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.220
because it's made up of
a yet to be discovered

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.420
element called Lubrica.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.460
And Lubrica is special
because if anything glides

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.470
across the surface
of Lubrica, it

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.677
will experience
absolutely no friction.

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:22.760
So if this right over here
is a sheet of Lubrica--

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.340
we're looking at
it from the side.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.010
And if we have a brick on top of
it, maybe gliding on top of it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.050
like that, it experiences
absolutely no friction.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.700
Now, the other things we
know about Lubricon-VI

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.830
is it's drifting in deep
space and it does not

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.190
have an atmosphere.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.720
In fact, it is a complete
vacuum outside of it.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.620
It's in such deep space,
such a remote part of space,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.820
that there aren't even a few
hydrogen atoms right over here.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.750
It is a complete,
absolute vacuum.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.490
And it's also an ancient planet.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.840
The star that it
used to orbit around

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.990
has long since died away.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.099
So it's just this lonely
planet drifting in deep space

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.030
without an atmosphere.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.610
The other thing we
know about Lubricon-VI

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.950
is that it is a perfect sphere.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
It is a perfect, perfect sphere.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.420
Now, my question to you.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
For some bizarre
reason there happens

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.990
to be, on the surface
of Lubricon-VI--

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100
so this right over here is
the surface of Lubricon-VI.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.890
There happens to be a sock that
is frozen in a block of ice.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.190
So this is my sock and its
frozen in this block of ice.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.430
And it happens to be traveling
at 1 kilometer per hour

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.750
in that direction.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080
If we were to look at it
from this kind of macro scale

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.660
when we're looking
at the planet,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.000
let's say then that
is the frozen sock,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.940
and it is traveling
along the equator.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.580
It is traveling along the
equator of Lubricon-VI.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.960
So my question to you,
given all of the assumptions

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.610
we made that it has
absolutely no atmosphere,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.639
it's a perfect
sphere, and Lubrica

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.660
has absolutely no
friction regardless

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.020
of what's traveling
on top of it-- what

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.190
will happen to this
frozen sock over time?

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.330
To answer that question,
we need to think about all

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.630
of the forces that
are acting on this,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.700
I guess, frozen block
of ice and sock.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.310
And first of all, let's
think about these forces that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.990
are acting in the radial
direction, inward or outward,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.880
of the center of the planet.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.160
Well, this planet has a mass.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.700
And so you have an inward force
towards the planet's center

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.670
of mass.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.990
And so you have the
force of gravity

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.290
acting on this
block going radially

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.440
inward to the center
of the planet.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.250
So I'll draw it like this.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.850
So we have our force of gravity.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.520
We have our force of gravity
going radially inward,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.830
just like that.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.730
But then we know that
the block is not just

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.520
spiraling towards the
center of the earth.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.620
We have the surface here.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.250
It's not going to go through
the surface of Lubrica.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.840
We can also assume that
Lubrica is a very, very, very

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.460
strong material.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.160
And so you also
have a normal force.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.840
You also have a
normal force that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.860
is keeping the
block from spiraling

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.120
towards the center of the earth.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.870
So this is a normal force.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.880
And one thing we'll
think about now,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.590
and we'll address it
directly in another tutorial,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.100
is whether this normal force is
equal to the force of gravity.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.216
We'll think about that
in a future video.

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:47.590
But these are all
the forces that

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.460
are acting in the
radial direction,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.320
either inward towards the
center of the planet or outward.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.440
But if we think about in
the tangential direction,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.930
along the surface of the
planet, there are no net forces.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.630
And because there
are no net forces

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.010
in this tangential
direction right over here,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.870
this block will not either
accelerate nor decelerate.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.132
There is no air friction.

00:04:13.132 --> 00:04:15.090
Or I should say air
resistance, which is really

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.990
just friction with the particles
if you had an atmosphere.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.130
It's a complete vacuum,
so there's nothing there.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.760
There is no friction with
the surface of the planet.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.030
So there's no
friction there, which

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.500
could have been a force in
the tangential direction.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.050
So there's absolutely no forces
in the tangential direction.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.120
So this block of
ice will actually

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.090
continue to travel at
one kilometer per hour

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.830
for all of eternity.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.680
So it'll just continue
to do it given

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.010
the assumptions that
we've just made.
