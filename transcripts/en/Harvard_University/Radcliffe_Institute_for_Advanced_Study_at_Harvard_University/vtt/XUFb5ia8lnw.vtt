00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.390
-It's good to be here.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.139
Thanks for coming.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.770
And I'm going to talk
about, I think, six things.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.570
First of all, I want to say
thank you to the institute.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.560
It is an amazing opportunity.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.610
And I made some really great
friends and thought things

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.750
and heard things I never
would've thought or heard

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.250
before.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
So it feels very lucky
to be here, very lucky.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870
I kept wanting to make a
joke about-- something like,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.980
and I'm so glad now it's
a three year fellowship.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260
And the second thing
I want to say-- We

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.130
were listening to "Gratitude,"
Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.760
Do you all know
Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.520
And you probably know Maurice
White died two weeks ago

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.861
or something.

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:51.360
Maybe.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.760
Maybe you didn't.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.070
But I've been thinking
about Maurice White.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.890
I was watching some
of Earth, Wind,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.970
&amp; Fire's videos this morning.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.280
So one of the things
that I love-- I mean,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.250
that was like one of the
groups that I grew up on.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.810
So you know, the music
that I grew up with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.330
and that my-- I kind of
grew up with my father.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.570
It was Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.736
So I grew up actually right
outside of Philadelphia.

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.650
And like, the other
little White kids

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.450
were writing AC/DC and Def
Leppard on their books.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.100
And I was writing
Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.860
and the Commodores on my books.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.640
I mean, if that song's called
gratitude-- My book's called

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.980
Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.990
It just occurred
to me how formative

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.790
that that was and how beautiful
they were on stage-- I mean,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.430
the music is incredible--
but how beautiful they were.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.960
I was looking at them,
and Phillip Bailey, he

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600
looks like he's the young guy
with the beautiful falsetto

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.290
voice.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.420
And I remember-- They got
a song called "Reasons."

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.990
And it's like an adult,
grownup, sexy song.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.300
And I remember being
seven or eight years old

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.814
singing the reasons
that we're here.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:19.320
[SINGING] In the morning,
when I rise, no longer feeling

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.860
hypnotized.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.765
I was seven!

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.840
And then, another
thing I thought about

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.100
is that when I
was a kid, I would

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.530
listen to the music
with the headphones on.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.020
And I heard my dad one
time, who was a huge reader,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.610
and I just wasn't
into books as you.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.110
-Heard

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.615
-Presently.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:42.490
Heard from my mother.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.726
And I overheard my dad say, hey,
lea-- Cause I was sitting there

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.850
reading the lyrics, because
I would get all records

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.460
off the Columbia Record Club.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.245
And I overheard my dad say
to my mom, well, at least

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.330
he's reading something!

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.000
So Maurice White and my big
brother taught me how to read.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.720
The second thing I wanted to
say-- So, he's in the room.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.260
I have a teacher named
Lucille Bertuccio who

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.540
is-- she might still be
alive, but she's on her way--

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.750
but she's a gardening
teacher in Bloomington.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.620
And you know, she's one of
our elders in Bloomington

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.790
who has given so much
of her life to us.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.390
I first met her because
I was at like an urban--

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.390
like a foraging class, edible
weeds and stuff like that.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.430
So you know, we'd be
eating like violets

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.770
off the ground or
dandelions, which

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.027
I love, and all kinds
of stuff like that.

00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:00.610
I took other classes
with her as well,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.320
as she was an incredible
model of some generosity

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.849
and kindness.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:05.640
She's so beautiful.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.359
I can remember her
walking down the street--

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.275
because you didn't have
a car, so she'd always

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:13.690
be walking with her cart when
she's going to the market

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.779
or whatever-- her laugh, her
incredible wisdom, her joy,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.920
her sort of rage--
you know, her sort

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.850
of beautiful, critical
rage at the ways

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.050
that the planet's
getting fucked up.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.114
So anyway, I don't know if
she's still here on this planet,

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.780
but I want to bring
her in the room too.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.990
And I'm going to
read a poem first,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.150
an elegy called "Burial."

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.910
So I ask this question
whenever I read this poem.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.150
Has anyone done anything
with their placenta?

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.240
What?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.490
You.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.180
What did you do?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.800
-I ask people the same question.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.000
-Oh, you do?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.236
How come?

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:04.470
-Because it's part
of the work I do.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.140
-OK.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.431
It's part of the work I do too.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
Did anyone do anything
neat with their placenta?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.930
Besides just-- I
don't know what you'd

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.997
do with it if you don't
do something neat with it.

00:05:15.997 --> 00:05:17.330
Did anyone plant a tree with it?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.725
Thank you.

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:24.600
It's called "Burial."

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.670
"You're right, you're
right, the fertilizer's

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.120
good-- It wasn't a gang
the dullards came up

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.650
with chucking a fish
in the planting hole

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.910
or some midwife got
lucky with the placenta--

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.270
oh, I'll plant a tree here.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.900
And a sudden flush of quince
and jam enough for months.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.680
Yes, the magic dust
our bodies become

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.580
casts spells on the roots about
which someone else could tell

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.010
you the chemical processes."

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.110
Probably someone in this room.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.250
"But it's just
magic to me, which

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.530
is why a couple springs ago
when first putting in my two

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.550
bare root plum trees out back,
I took the jar which has become

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.310
my father's home,
and lonely for him

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.200
and hoping to coax him back
for my mother as much as me,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.600
poured some of them
in the planting holes.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.770
And he dove in glad
for the robust air,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.710
saddling a slight gust
into to my nose and mouth,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.770
chucking as I coughed,
but mostly he disappeared

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.290
into the minor yawns in the
earth into which I placed

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.090
the trees, splaying
wide their roots,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.770
casting the grey dust of my old
man evenly throughout the hole,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.540
replacing then the clods
of dense Indiana soil until

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.660
the roots and my
father were buried,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.230
watering it all in with one
hand while holding the tree with

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.100
the other straight as a flag
to the nation of simple joy

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.750
of which my father is now
a naturalized citizen,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.880
waving the flag from
his subterranean layer,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.120
the roots curled around him
like shawls or jungle gyms,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.720
like hookahs or the
arms of ancestors,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.160
before breast-stroking
into the xylem--"

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.040
Lucille taught me that word--

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.470
"Riding the elevator
up through the cambium

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.230
and into the leaves where, when
you put your ear close enough,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.070
you can hear him whisper
good morning, where,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.200
if you close your eyes
and push your face

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.890
you can feel his
stubbly jowls and good

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.720
lord this year he would giddy
at the first real fruit set

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.760
and nestled into the 30 or
40 plums in the two trees,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.750
peering out from the sweet
meat with his hands pressed

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.310
against the purple skin
like cathedral glass,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.920
and imagine his joy
as the sun wizarded

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.730
forth those abundant sugars.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.400
And I plodded barefoot and
prayerful at the first right

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.070
plum's swell and blush,
almost weepy conjuring

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.580
some surely ponderous averse to
convey this bottomless grace--

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.710
you know, oh father oh
father kind of stuff--

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.440
hundreds of hot air balloons
filling the sky in my chest,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.710
replacing his intubated body
listing like a boat keel side

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.010
up, replacing the
steady stream of water

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.050
from the one eye which his
brother wiped before removing

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.070
the tube, keeping his
hand on the forehead

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.440
until the last wind in
his body wandered off,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.840
while my brother
wailed like an animal.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.210
And my mother said,
weeping, it's OK.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.640
It's OK, you can go, at all
of which my father guffawed

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.600
by kicking from the first bite
buckets of juice down my chin,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.010
staining one of my two
button-down shirts,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.450
the salmon colored silk one,
hollering there's more of that!

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.590
almost dancing in the
plum, in the tree,

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.780
the way he did as a person,
bent over and biting his lip

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.290
and chucking the one hip out
then the other with his elbows

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.250
cocked and fists loosely made
and eyes closed and mouth

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.130
made trumpet when
he knew he could

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:56.165
make you happy just by being
a little silly and sweet."

00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:57.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.596 --> 00:08:58.550
Thank you.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.210
This is my talk.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.300
I wrote it this weekend.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.830
And I thought I was going
to write a little thing

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.070
and then do some other thing.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.480
But then this thing
just keeps on coming.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.910
I think it's called
"A Book of Flowers."

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.750
And I don't know if I will
call it "A Book of Flowers"

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.696
before the part that I'm going
to read to you or after that.

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:28.820
But I just called it "A
Book of Flowers" before it,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.680
so we have to go from there.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.800
"A Book of Flowers."

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.380
I'll say it again, I don't care!

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.320
So the deal was-- This is from
an interview between my friend

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.140
Kyla who-- for the
record, I don't

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.650
know I got this right
yet-- She's also

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.780
part of this African American
poetry community, Cave Canem,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.510
that I belong to.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.910
She is coaxing this out of me.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.200
She's like my teacher
in this, in a way.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.269
She asks me in the
interview, "There's

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.060
a lot of grief in
catalog, but there's also

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.910
a tremendous amount of joy.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.510
By the time I got
to the poem weeping

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.445
and about the niece who's made
a friend in this butterfly--"

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:14.830
I had this poem about my
niece and she becomes friends

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.890
with a butterfly--
"I was thinking,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.230
I'm reading a book of poems
about flowers by a black man.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.990
Even though you do talk
about things related to race,

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.460
I wondered if you were
resisting all the things you

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.910
could've been talking about.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.492
Was any of that conscious?

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:31.200
Or you just minding
your business talking

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.530
about your regular life?"

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.460
Here's my answer.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.640
"If there was any kind of overt
action the book is taking--

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.710
and I don't want it to be
a book against anything--

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.240
it's a book imagining or
advocating for something.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.270
It's really-- like
the title says--

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.620
It's advocating for
something unabashed,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.240
something vulnerable,
and you know, full-on.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.600
If it's conscious of
any sort of confinement,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.300
it's a confinement
that I often feel

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.790
when I want to express
a sort of wild love,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.960
when I want to be full-on
about what I adore.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.910
And that's maybe what
the book is most.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.600
It has that kind of heart in it.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.140
It wants to be nuts
in love with shit,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.260
which includes
being heartbroken,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.800
all torn up about
stuff, and open.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.030
And that can feel
really terrifying,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.500
that kind of openness
or attempt at openness.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.480
I'll speak for myself.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.820
That feels scary.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.860
When you're like,
oh I love this!

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.540
Because then if someone's
like, fuck your little thing,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.770
that sucks.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.120
That hurts.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.130
The posture of irony is
emotionally easy to take.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.700
It's very much a way of
not being vulnerable, not

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.140
being addressed."

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.840
"A Book of Flowers.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.920
One.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.290
Kyla, you and I both know
this is a bullshit answer.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.960
You gently said as much to me
when we ran into each other

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.010
a few weeks after we did the
interview over the phone.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.140
I said, hey, I'm going to try
to write another essay to more

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.640
properly answer your question.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.940
There's more to say.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.980
To which you said,
yeah, I kind of figured.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.590
When we talked on the phone,
I was wandering around Oakland

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.290
after a long day at the Black
Farmers and Urban Gardeners

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.970
Conference, a little bit
lost and a lot hungry,

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.420
looking for a place to eat
that might have something

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.970
substantial and vegan both.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.050
Not always easy to come by.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.570
When I did finally
find a place, it

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.382
was not both, for the record.

00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:17.840
And when you asked
me the question,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.570
I couldn't quite formulate
what it is I wanted to say.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.950
That's because I didn't
quite know what I thought.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.780
Or maybe more
accurately, I didn't

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.320
know I knew what I thought.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.850
Though I did, of
course, I did, know

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.150
what it means to be black
man writing a book of poems

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.322
about flowers, as you say.

00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:34.530
Though, Kyla, there are many
other things in my book,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.500
thank you very much.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.520
I do want to say and re-say to
anyone who will listen to me--

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.290
thank you for asking,
Kyla-- that I believe

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.380
in gratitude, 'flowers."

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.730
There's a kind of discipline,
an energizing and catalyzing

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.930
and potentially
collectivizing discipline.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.670
What I mean is that, when
I'm thinking of gratitude

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.880
or the gratitude I'm thinking
of is largely about the ways

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.180
we make each other possible.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.600
And gratitude makes
me more interested

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.080
in making people
possible, myself included.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.640
Barbara Ehrenreich wrote
a pretty compelling

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.190
I'm-sick-of-all-this-gratitude
piece in the New York Times.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.580
It kind of flayed the 'I'm
so grateful for my Lexus SUV'

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.170
stuff floating around
that I associate

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.919
with Palm Springs or something,
even though I don't actually

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.710
know where that is.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.860
I'm so grateful for my
beautifully manicured garden,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.660
et cetera.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.250
And that's very far from what
I'm talking about, as you know.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.240
I mean, how lucky it is to have
one of those Valentine's Day

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.930
cards that plays a
recording and a song,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.560
this one belting
out the Supremes,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.760
'I Hear a Symphony,' and your
murdered pal's voice telling

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.530
you, Ross, I love you
like an old Motown record.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.970
How lucky to have been
alive to care for your dying

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.760
father after years
of hardly been

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.420
able to talk to each other,
to open his water bottles

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.780
when he couldn't open
them for himself,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.440
to scramble him a couple eggs
and convince them to eat it.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.080
How lucky to take a phone call
during your graduate workshop

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.860
from an unfamiliar
number, which was

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.860
your pal calling from
the psych ward the day

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.930
after his suicide attempt.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.630
How lucky to have done a
beautiful thing in your life,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.630
to have loved something,
to have touched

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.165
with your hands this
earth, to have been loved,

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:17.050
to have escaped, none
of which-- and Lord,

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.590
I hope it's in the
poems-- implies

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.850
evasion of sorrow or pain,
none of which, lord knows,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.990
implies not looking
back, not reaching back.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.000
No, I mean across,
not reaching across.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.810
If there's anything interesting
to me about the palms,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.020
it's that they are motivated
by precisely the desire

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.690
to reach across, which is
exactly what metaphor means,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.250
after all.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.500
Have you seen the moving
trucks in Greece emblazoned

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.420
with the word metaphores.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420
My palms would be stupid
little things to me,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.370
if they didn't reach your way.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.420
Who has the time?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.900
But you said flowers,
so let's talk flowers.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.160
For instance, the mighty
dandelion, which in my garden

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.040
is common enough for my
buddy to have actually said,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.440
whoa man, I've never seen so
many dandelions in my life,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.740
and which is edible
top-to-bottom and paints

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.630
the asses of honeybees
gold, to boot.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.850
Who thinks of the
arugula blossom,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.260
papery, peppery, with somehow
a kiss as sweet at the end?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.920
And two, the false
indigo blooms?

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.269
Who knows the false indigo?

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:21.630
-Uh, yeah.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.840
-Well, you'll
understand me then.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.980
And two, the false
indigo blooms.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.200
I'm not kidding.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.150
It's uncouth to say so, but
I feel sometimes somehow

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.340
the need to repeat
myself on this one.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.440
It makes the rivers
in my body fill up--

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.280
which yes, is a not-great
metaphor for a sexy feeling--

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.870
while watching the bumblebees
lumber up to them, nuzzling

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.920
the blue petals until they
part and then some growling

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.240
and quaking, before
the bumblebee crawls

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.990
from the cave, all
drowsy and pollen-lit,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.050
and does it again and again.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.490
Can you believe it?

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.690
How lucky for the precise
folk of the pear tree

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.170
blooms from beneath
the bloomers of which

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.730
tumbles an animal
scooting in currents

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.250
through the late spring air.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.440
You should by now have
wrinkled your nose

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.620
and thought poorly of me
and waved your dusty copy

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.920
of Sir Benedict Cumberbatch's
Craft of Good Writing, First

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.580
Edition in my direction at
how mixed my metaphors have

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.960
become in this place."

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.590
It's true, that's
not a real book.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.920
But man, that made me laugh
when I wrote First Edition.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.230
I thought, that's a good touch!

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.350
"I'm guessing if you came
to my garden with me,

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.280
it might happen to you.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.120
And what about the chokeberry?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.770
Not the same or as good as, but
kind of like the chokecherry--

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.496
bitter, makes your
tongue sticky--

00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:44.870
which I used to pick from the
back of my grandpa's pickup

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.810
truck in Verndale, Minnesota.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.680
And serviceberry, AKA
juneberry, AKA saskatoon berry,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.100
whose many aliases
pale in comparison

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.820
to the many registers of
deliciousness and health

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.200
benefits of the simple berry.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.970
And two, how lucky
for the goumi--"

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.568
Does anyone know
what a goumi is?

00:17:02.568 --> 00:17:05.200
Aw.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.510
Come to my garden.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.410
"In fact, yes, let
me take this moment

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.890
to say no small praise upon
the goumi bushes in my garden.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.520
Let us first attend to the word
in the mouth, which is itself

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.589
a kind of miracle, forcing
you to become a baby again,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.726
glottal and cute--
guh; before coaxing

00:17:23.726 --> 00:17:28.400
you to say ooh, you crooner,
you; and then to say mm;

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.530
which you know, is the
sound of the things;

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.760
and closing out with the ee.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.410
That's a happy sound.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.420
And then let us acknowledge
too the no fewer than 8

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.850
trillion glassy
freckles shimmering

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.480
the goumi's red surface,
which when you account

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.060
for the 8 trillion
goumi on this one bush,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.835
makes a galaxy of
glassy freckles."

00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:51.970
I was imagining the
mathematicians, like,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.245
walking out.

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:54.680
You don't know
what a trillion is.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.620
Not to mention that
the goumi makes

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.605
its own nitrogen, its own food,
and who does that these days?

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.845
Not to mention, the
silvery leaves also

00:18:06.845 --> 00:18:09.580
speckled, flecked
to mirror the berry,

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.610
or the flower
preceding the berry,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.370
which is not quite like
the bell of a trombone,

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.390
but I will say like the bell
of a trombone today, because it

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.800
is one of the many
things in my garden

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.300
turns my body into a horn,
pulling me into the orchestra.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.030
And from that not quite
trombone or the trillions

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.720
of them shivering on
the bush is belted

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.740
a smell both sweet and
creamy that drops me

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.560
some days to my very knees.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.590
And I haven't mentioned
yet the way they taste,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.350
the way they hang on the
bush, slowly wisening

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.700
into an unspeakable
sweetness which

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.110
will every day from
late June to mid-July

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.510
make you forget whatever
the hell it is you

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.366
came out here to do, unless
you came out here to eat goumi.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.410
Or this-- I have a
good friend named

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.000
Ginger, a neighbor's
tortoiseshell cat,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.570
and she drops by daily.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.510
And she likes to hop
onto my shoulders

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.980
when I'm bent over
in the garden,

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.220
so as to differently
see her world.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.830
Usually she gets
up there and she

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.040
likes to mosey out onto the
gangplank plank of my arms,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.050
wrapping her front
legs around it,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.210
smooshing her face
into my bicep,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.730
and hurting me a little
bit with her claws.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.690
Gingie has a weird
and imposing swagger,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.095
a slight leftward
cast to her trot,

00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:27.470
maybe because of
all the time she

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.130
spends huffing in the
catmint in my garden,

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.330
her little white
ponch swaying beneath.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.340
And when she turns the corner
to my alley come April or May,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.700
which in southern Indiana is the
season of fledglings and baby

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.650
bunnies and such, her
parents will set off

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.660
a cacophony of
chirps and whistles

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.660
and screams, like something
out of a Western or something.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.230
I'm thinking now
of an Eddie Murphy

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.930
skit in which his mother becomes
with her slipper like Clint

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.430
Eastwood.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.000
One of these days, I saw
through the front window Ginger

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.906
come trotting toward my
house across the street

00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:04.280
with a murderous
look at her eye.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.640
And I thought, uh oh.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.300
And when she got
close, I saw she

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.900
had in her mouth, a
baby bunny kicking

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.280
its cute, little, cute,
long, cute bunny feet.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.100
I was mostly naked and barefoot
when I ran outside and startled

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.710
Ginger just by slamming open
the screen door yelling,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.020
let the bunny go!

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.110
Ginger dropped the
cute little guy,

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.550
and it scampered off a few feet
before being recovered again.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.330
Now I throw a rubber clog that
was laying in the bee balm

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.650
and sage at Ginger, a
more aggressive version

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.410
of distraction, just
clipping her ear.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.050
And the bunny this time
made a good getaway, maybe

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.210
had a full second or two,
while Ginger looked first

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.070
at the clog and
then at me, really?

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.890
Did you really just throw
your size 14 Croc at me?

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.850
Then she added, looking
back over her shoulder

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.015
as she began her
pursuit, don't you

00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:55.850
know how stupid you
look in those things?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.530
The bunny bolted down the
hill in front of my house,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.470
and Ginger bolted
after it, and I

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.928
bolted after them both,
barefoot and in my underwear.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.470
The bunny made a hard right
and boogied up the sidewalk.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.270
And though the
bunny was quick, it

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.780
was not Ginger, who closed on
it almost immediately until, I

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.660
kid you not, not one
but two blue jays

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.940
dive-bombed her, screaming
the whole way down,

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.890
which did in fact
distract Ginger

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.870
enough that the
bunny scooted away,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.660
crossing the street in the
fastest hops of her new life

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.060
before getting into a thicket.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:38.000
Gingie looked up into the sky
with her paw over her face--

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.460
the jays were convincing,
very nasty, if pretty little

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.990
fuckers-- defending herself
against another attack.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.640
And after Gingie saw
the jays perched back up

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.500
in the crabapple tree,
their chests flared up

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.330
and their wings reshuffling
like switchblades clicking shut

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.500
and sliding back
into pockets, she

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.240
looked around for
the bunny, which

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.250
was by now in the next county.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.670
Then Gingie, after sniffing and
then licking first one paw then

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.699
the other, the way
sometimes basketball players

00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:10.240
will look at their
hands when they've

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.645
missed a couple easy
shots in a row--"

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:16.136
I like that metaphor a lot.

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:22.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.240
"turned around and me and
shrugged as if to say,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.230
did that really just happen?

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.320
It did.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.500
I saw with my own
eyes in my own garden

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.640
which I feel so compelled
to write, to spend time in,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.190
and to shout about its beauty,
its wonder, its care to anyone

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.880
who will listen.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.480
Or this, what the parsley
looks like and flower

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.700
in its second year,
its weird stock

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.060
shot up nearly my
height and the blooms

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.840
like doilies peppered
with luminous wasps.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.660
Or the drift of mountain
mint, its plumes poking

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.500
from the dusty leaves
on stocks about me-high,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.660
so thick with thirsty bugs,
an orgy of bees and wasps

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.410
and flitterers innumerable,
that when you part them

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.960
with your hands, pardon me,
you might say, coming through,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.370
you might say, and then
lower your face to smell

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.390
medicinal floral sharp-- The
humming there of the bees

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.770
you have become is probably
not unlike the sound of blood

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.590
moving through your body.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.170
Or the last dance of the peach
bloom, that wispy outfit it

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.800
shimmies out of before
swelling into fruit.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.480
Kyla, do you know that ants help
the peony bud unwrap by licking

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.150
from the sticky bulb the
sweet nectar you can see

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.350
dotted in the flowers' surface
in little luminous gems?

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.410
Ever find a big
burly mustard plant

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.630
that had volunteered
itself in the pine bark

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.090
murch of the foot
of a blueberry bush?

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.680
Ever cut down what you
thought the mulberry tree that

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.230
planted itself in
the wrong place,

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.950
only to realize when it
wouldn't die that it was

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.020
a peach tree these days grown
to 18 feet tall and heavy

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.860
with a good yellow clingstone
more immune to the rock

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.430
than all the others?

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:00.630
Ever seen the blueberry flowers,
like the teeniest white gowns

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.310
after a rain, the
bead of water topped

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.010
in the flowers' tiny eye, your
reflection quaking in there,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.910
more like you than any
image of you ever seen?

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.090
Every slid 20 sweet potato
slips into a patch of yard

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.260
without even turning
the soil, without even

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.460
shearing the grass, and
watch those slips slither

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.890
into a carpet of
heart-shaped greens,

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.550
and after the first
frost and loosening

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.540
the soil with your pitchfork,
slid your hands into the ground

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.030
to yank out the clusters
of sweet brown bodies,

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.920
soil-covered and true?

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.880
Look at me going
on like this, Kyla.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.520
I'm resisting your question
about resistance, looks like.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.450
But I'm not really resisting.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.900
Truth is, I'm
making an argument.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.320
I'm making an
argument with my body

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.400
and the ground about our
bodies and the ground.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.560
Two.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.680
When I told my buddy--
Let's start again.

00:25:03.872 --> 00:25:07.260
When I told my buddy
the poet and essayist,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.070
and beatmaker and
dancer Patrick Rosal

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.894
that I was trying to answer your
question in a less bullshit way

00:25:13.894 --> 00:25:15.310
and I thought there
might be a way

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.870
to do it through the
garden, through the ground,

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.960
he sent along a little entry
in an essay he's writing.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.300
His piece, a seedling still--"

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.250
It's a pun.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.670
"--is ostensibly about being
mistaken for the waitstaff,

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.690
despite being dressed
nothing like the waitstaff,

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.870
by white lady at table 24 at the
National Book Award Ceremony,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.760
which is held at a place called
Cipriani's, where that night

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.642
they served beef cheeks.

00:25:40.642 --> 00:25:42.740
Pat was there that
night to celebrate

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.560
a few of his friends, who
also happen not to be white,

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.670
being nominees or
judges, you know,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.490
to celebrate how far we've come.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.100
I think she asked him to refill
her wine glass or something.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.030
He paid about $250
for the pleasure.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.977
This is what he sent along."

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:04.310
So maybe you'll get this, but
he had a really nice suit,

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.310
but it was really
cheap-- inexpensive.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.960
"'This two piece fits
me nice and slim,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.170
tapered along the sides, the
sleeves long enough for me

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:18.280
to flash a bit of French cuff,
just snug in the shoulder

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.410
for the lapels' gentle slope
to the simple double button--

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:25.960
black, classy, and polyester.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.630
The suit is $90.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.800
OK, 105 with the in-seam hem.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.250
That's one decent night
of drinks in Manhattan.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:38.100
It's an expensive bottle
of wine or a used TV.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.670
It's an Amtrak
ticket, round-trip

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.450
from Philly to New York Penn.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.620
It's a used parlor guitar
with a cracked tuning peg.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.770
It could buy me enough
kush to get me lifted

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.840
twice a week for three months.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.510
But I'm buying this
suit right here

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.430
to go to cheer hard for friends
who were being celebrated

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.210
at the National Book Awards.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.260
Black tie, the invite says.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.050
My seat at the table
cost me almost 2 and 1/2

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.020
times the price of my suit.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.000
I pay up, because I
want to be in the room

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.060
to dap my brothers and sisters.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.900
Get it?

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.590
The word "style" is
cousin to "stylus,"

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.270
to etch, or to engrave.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.370
And so it is a way to inscribe
oneself upon the world,

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.910
but also a way to dig, to
delve into, to investigate.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.630
Style is then an
inquiry to engrave.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.840
Style furthermore is a way
to carve a place, a hole

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.630
into some landscape.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.250
It is a way to prepare
the earth for the body.'"

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.520
That's Pat's part.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.470
"And I might take this lyric
etymology one step further

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.650
or build a little
addition onto it,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.120
with your and Pat's permission,
because style is also

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.780
a way of looking.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.380
Both Pat's looking good in
his off-the-rack-- I saw him

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.570
and the way he looked was
real clean, sharp enough

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:59.910
to catch you; in fact, he killed
me and my corny-ass text--

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.220
and a particular way
of looking, of seeing,

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.630
which a book about
flowers might be.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.110
How you look and how you look.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.043
How you look and how you look.

00:28:10.043 --> 00:28:13.784
So the words 'look'--
or another hop here,

00:28:13.784 --> 00:28:17.510
'see'-- might also be a mode
of inscribing oneself upon

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.920
the world or out of it.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.790
It might be also a kind of
engraving or digging, which

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.260
might also be a
kind of shoveling.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.110
And you know where
this is going.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.790
How you see or what you
see depends on the ground.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.690
You cannot engrave, in
other words, you cannot dig,

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.000
in other words, you cannot
prepare the earth for your body

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.500
without the proper
and true ground.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.640
Maybe this book of
flowers is a preparation

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.860
for the ground I wish to enter.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.780
Three.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.660
Preparing the ground
for our bodies.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.810
Yes, of course, I mean the land.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.290
But I'm really talking about
the ground, what holds us,

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.230
what we walk on,
what we fall onto,

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.770
what we leap from, what
holds us, the ground.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.400
Or in a painting, that
against which the marks are

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.040
made in a Franz Kline painting,
the big industrial swipes

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.590
of black arguing with or
emerging from or even resisting

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.860
the creamy surfaces, gestures
legible because of the ground,

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.150
dependent upon the ground.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.030
Or better yet a
Glen Ligon painting,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.480
the Zora Neale Hurston quote and
black text on a white surface,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.120
'I feel most colored when I'm
thrown against a sharp white

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.590
background.'

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.440
And if there are these physical
or visual grounds, the grounds

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.140
of an image, I'm really
curious about the grounds

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.120
of our imaginations and the
ground it is implied or assumed

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.010
by the word resistance in
the context of your question

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.420
and some other similar questions
I've got about this book.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.480
What are you resisting in your
book of flowers, Black man?

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.230
Turns out, I might be kind
of resistant to the word

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.750
resistance.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.450
I'm resistant to
the word resistance

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.760
because what I hope
I'm doing actually

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.980
is imagining a ground
different than the one

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.060
the question presumes.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.820
Because the ground that
question presumes is something

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.460
I refuse to abide.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.240
On that ground, which is
perhaps a simply descriptive

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.210
of an America, which
is for the record,

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.230
like everything fleeting.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.420
Let's call it an American
ground, in which, for which,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.250
upon which black people
are not actually people.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.240
And sometimes it
feels that if America

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.920
grants that if we are
people, that it also imagines

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.060
that our natural condition is
pain, is suffering, is turmoil,

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.460
is indignity, is death.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.470
It's big business, our
suffering, our death.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.800
All kinds of people dance to it.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.420
All kinds of people fuck to
it and fall in love to it.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.150
People hold hands
in darkened theaters

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.470
to it, weeping and
entering a ground.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.150
People grow up to it, will
feel nostalgic for it,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.020
for our death.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.250
It's the best TV
series of all time.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.942
It's got the best beat.

00:30:54.942 --> 00:30:56.650
Sometimes seems to me
that a black person

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.570
becomes more legible in this
particular American ground

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.520
the closer they
are to being dead.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.435
Wait, wait, I have to watch
this murder one more time.

00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:07.620
And whoa, there goes another.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.380
That is the ground.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.110
I hear myself say
it among friends,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.390
so I'll say to you
right now that they

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.939
would like us to believe it.

00:31:16.939 --> 00:31:18.730
They would like us to
believe-- I sometimes

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.190
believe, watching Walter
Scott been shot again

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:25.150
and again on the news when any
child could see, watching Tamir

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.540
Rice be murdered again and
again-- that our natural state,

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.430
our natural condition, our
ground is pain, if not death.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.810
There's a child, I think
he's eight years old--

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.400
you know this, don't you?--
who was inventing a rocket pack

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.570
to escape the
bullets fired at him,

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.250
by-- he doesn't know this
yet-- this American imaginative

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.820
ground, a rocket pack that will
propel him far above and beyond

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.150
the reach of that ground.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.830
Let's call that, yes, an
American imaginative ground.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.840
Let's call it something
like a foundational American

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.450
imaginative ground.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.894
And let me say, I don't
believe in it as a ground.

00:32:03.894 --> 00:32:06.060
And consequently, I don't
believe in it as something

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.490
to be resisted.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.250
I just believe it's a persistent
and abhorrent disruption

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.150
to the actual ground, the
actual ground being what

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.830
I hope my book, a black man's
book of flowers might look at.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.860
Or since Cornelius Eady
says it better in his poem,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.660
"Gratitude"-- yes,
I am a copycat--

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.640
then I could ever
hope to, quote,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.800
"I'm a brick and house that is
being built around your house."

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.940
Or to stay kind of on topic,
I'm a flower in a garden,

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.260
being planted around your
garden, a fervent and raucous

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.800
mint.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.600
So what's the ground?

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.540
Our necessary lives or
our lives necessary.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.970
And in our lives are many
things-- loss, sorrow,

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:54.830
violence, pain, yes, but
also delight, silliness,

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.910
raucous laughter, care--
care as I see it, above all.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.590
Love, as I see it, above all.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.580
A thousand, thousand
undocumented instances

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.020
in my life alone of how I've
been loved and cared for,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.810
lives that have seen my life
and thereby made it possible.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:17.901
Lives, life, which has
made our lives possible.

00:33:17.901 --> 00:33:18.710
It's a poem.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.160
It's called 'A
Small Needful Fact.'

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.130
Is that Eric Garner
worked for some time

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.170
for the Parks and Rec.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.370
Horticultural Department,
which means, perhaps,

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.450
that with his very large hand,
perhaps, in all likelihood,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:37.240
he put gently into the earth
some plants which, most likely,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.780
some of them, in all
likelihood, continue to grow,

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.820
continue to do what
such plants do,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.030
like house and feed small
and necessary creatures,

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.120
like being pleasant
to touch and smell,

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.530
by converting
sunlight into food,

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.340
like making it easier
for us to breathe.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.350
Four.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:04.480
Celebration, exultation,
praise, and gratitude,

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.810
and the rigorous practice,
the rigorous public practice

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.020
of those things is one of
the ways we remind ourselves

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.690
that our lives are the ground,
that living is the ground.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.389
Those things remind
us that being murdered

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.320
and fucked over and
terrorized is aberration

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.510
and to announce to
the state or a shared

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.670
consciousness or a broken
American imagination

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.480
by hollering with the light at
our utterly necessary lives,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.400
our beautiful, beautiful
necessary lives,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.940
that we are in
fact meant to live.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.770
And so Kyla, this
book about flowers

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.650
by a black man-- you knew
all along, I suspect, sorry

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.960
I can be long winded sometimes--
was both utterly conscious--

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.389
I knew what I was
and wasn't saying

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.110
and what perhaps I'm
expected to be saying--

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.620
and it was just me
minding my business,

00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:17.700
talking about my life, my life."

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.930
How much time do I have?

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.930
We started, what,
like ten minutes late?

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.510
Five?

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.312
13 minutes late?

00:35:24.312 --> 00:35:25.520
-Why, what do you want to do?

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.478
-I want to read a poem.

00:35:26.478 --> 00:35:27.382
-Sure!

00:35:27.382 --> 00:35:28.364
-OK, OK.

00:35:33.274 --> 00:35:38.010
It's called "Catalog of
Unabashed Gratitude."

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.570
The orchard that you
talked about is in there,

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.360
and also there's this child
named Aralee, who in the poem

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.120
is an idea, and now
that's a person.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.500
She's born.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.310
"Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.550
Friends, will you
bear with me today,

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.830
for I have awakened from a
dream in which a robin made

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.470
with its shabby wings a kind of
veil behind which it shimmied

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.100
and stomped something
from the south of Spain,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.460
its breast aflare, looking me
dead in the eye from the branch

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.810
that grew into my window,
coochie-cooing my chin,

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.760
the bird shuffling
its little talons

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.570
left, then right, while
the leaves bristled

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:17.260
against the plaster wall two of
them drifting onto my blanket

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.130
while the bird opened and closed
the wings like a matador giving

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.410
up on murder, jutting its
beak, turning a circle,

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.030
and flashing, again,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.850
the ruddy bombast of its breast
by which I knew upon waking it

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.700
was telling me in
no uncertain terms

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.540
to bellow forth the
tubas and sousaphones,

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.480
the whole rusty brass
band of gratitude

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.350
not quite dormant in my belly.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:48.370
It said so in a human voice,
'Bellow forth.' And who among

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.310
us could ignore such
odd and precise counsel?

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.450
Here ye!

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.080
Here ye!

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.790
I am here to holler that I've
hauled tons-- by which I don't

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.020
mean lots, I mean
tons-- of cowshit

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.940
and stood ankle deep
in swales of maggots

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.420
swirling the spent beer grains
the brewery man was good enough

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.420
to dump off holding his nose,
for they smell very bad,

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.190
though make the compost writhe
giddy and lick its lips,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:19.590
twirling dung with my pitchfork
again and again with hundreds

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.140
and hundreds of other people.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.600
We dreamt an orchard this
way, furrowing our brows,

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.662
and hauling our
wheelbarrows, and sweating

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.870
through our shirts, and less
than a year later, there

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.160
was a party at which
trees were sunk

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.500
into the well-fed
earth, one of which,

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.000
a liberty apple,
after being watered in

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.780
was tamped by a baby
barefoot with the bow hanging

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.810
in her hair, biting her
lip in her joyous work.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.050
And friends this is the
realistic place I know.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.100
It makes me squirm like
a worm I'm so grateful.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.470
You could ride your bike
there or roller skate

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.450
or catch the bus.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.950
There's a fence and a
gate twisted by hand.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.760
There's a fig tree taller
than you in Indiana.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.720
It'll make you gasp.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.530
It might make you want to
stay alive, even, thank you.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.080
And thank you for not taking my
pal when the engine of his mind

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.736
dragged him to swig fistfulls
of Xanax and a bottle

00:38:10.736 --> 00:38:12.730
or two of booze.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.470
And thank you for
taking my father

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.720
a few years after his
own father went down.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.610
Thank you, mercy.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.440
Mercy, thank you.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.755
For not smoking meth
with your mother.

00:38:22.755 --> 00:38:26.310
Oh thank you for leaving
and for coming back.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.310
And thank you for what
inside my friends' love

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.300
bursts like a throng of
roadside goldenrod gleaming

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.170
into the world, likely
hauling a shovel with her,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.390
like one named Aralee ought,
with hands big as a horse's,

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.010
and who, like one
named Aralee ought,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.830
will laugh time to time til
the juice runs from her nose.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.960
Oh, thank you for the
way a small thing's wail

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.530
makes the milk or
what once was milk

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:57.440
in us gather into horses
huckle-buckling across a field.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.860
And thank you friends, when last
spring the hyacinth bells rang

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.920
and the crocuses flaunted
their upturned skirts,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.590
and a quiet roved
the beehive which

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.570
when I entered were
snugged two or three

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.630
dead fist-sized clutches
of bees between the frames,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.510
almost clinging to one another,
this one's tiny head pushed

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.840
into another's tiny wings,
one's forelegs resting

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.310
on another's face,
the translucent paper

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.960
of their wings fluttering
beneath my breath

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.670
and when a few dropped to
the frames beneath, honey.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.280
And after falling down to cry,
everything's glacial shine.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.120
And thank you, too.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.380
And thanks for the corduroy
couch I have put you on.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.320
Put your feet up.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.290
Here's a blanket, a
pillow, dear ones,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.210
for I think this is
going to be long.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.020
I can't stop my
gratitude, which includes,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.050
dear reader, you, for
staying here with me,

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.690
for removing the lips
just so as I speak.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.560
Here is a cup of tea.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.170
I've spooned honey into it.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.860
And thank you the tiny bee's
shadow perusing these words

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.380
as I write them and the way
my love talks quietly when

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.230
in the hive, so
quietly, in fact,

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.240
you cannot hear her voice, but
only notice barely her lips

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.660
moving in conversation.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.810
Thank you what does
not scare her in me,

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.830
but makes her reach my way.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.440
Thank you the love she
is which hurts sometimes.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.440
And the time she misremembered
elephants in one of my poems,

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.430
which here they come, garlanded
with morning glory and wisteria

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:41.110
blooms, trombones all the
way down to the river.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.850
Thank you the quiet in
which the river bends around

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.570
the elephant's solemn trunk,
polishing stones, floating

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.860
on its gentle back, the flock
of geese flying overhead.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.510
And to the quick and
gentle flocking of men

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.910
to the old lady falling down
on the corner of Fairmount

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.620
and 18th, holding patiently
with the softest parts

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.350
of their hands her
cane and purple hat,

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.185
gathering for her the
contents of her purse

00:41:07.185 --> 00:41:10.800
and touching her
shoulder and elbow.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.720
Thank you the cockeyed
court on which

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.720
in a half-court
three on three, we

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.150
oldheads made of some
runny-nosed kids a shambles,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.420
and the 61-year-old--
the 61-year-old

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.030
after flipping a reverse
lay-up off a back door cut

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.870
from my no-look pass to seal
the game ripped off his shirt

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.130
and threw punches at the
gods and hollered at the kids

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:36.040
to admire the pacemaker's scar
grinning across his chest.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.860
Thank you the glad accordian's
wheeze in the chest.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.940
Thank you the bagpipes.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.630
Thank you to the woman
barefoot in the gaudy dress

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.230
for stopping her car in
the middle of the road

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:51.250
and the tractor trailer behind
her, and the van behind it,

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.070
whisking a turtle off the road.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.340
Thank you god of gaudy.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.270
Thank you paisley panties.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.820
Thank you the organ up my dress.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.690
Thank you the sheer
dress you wore

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.970
kneeling in my dream
at the creek's edge

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.270
and the light
swimming through it.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:14.120
The koi kissing halos into the
glassy air, the room in my mind

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.410
with the blinds
drawn where we nearly

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:20.670
injure each other crawling into
the shawl of the other's body.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.500
Thank you when I
just say it plain--

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.160
we fuck each other dumb.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.340
And you, again, you,
for the true kindness

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.350
it has been for you to remain
awake with me like this,

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.160
nodding time to time and making
that little noise that I take

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.240
to mean yes, or, I understand,
or, please go on, but not

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.770
too long, or why are you
spitting so much, or easy

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.570
Tiger, hands to yourself.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.950
I am excitable.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.560
I am sorry.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.090
I am grateful.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:01.070
I just want us to be
friends now, forever.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.640
Take this bowl of
blackberries from the garden.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.520
The sun has made them warm.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.300
I picked them just for you.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:12.390
I promise, I will try to
stay on my side of the couch.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.800
And thank you the baggie
of dreadlocks I found

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.160
in the drawer while washing
and folding the clothes

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.800
of our murdered friend, the
photo in which his arm slung

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.820
around the sign to the 'trail
of silences.' Thank you the way

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.670
before he died, he held
his hands open to us,

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.990
for coming back in a waft
of incense or in the shape

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:36.140
of a boy in another city looking
from between his mother's legs,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.150
or disappearing into the stacks
after brushing by, for moseying

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:44.320
back in dreams where, seeing us
lost and scared he put his hand

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.250
on our shoulders and pointed
us to the temple across town.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.700
And thank you to the
man all night long

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.810
hosing a mist on his
early-bloomed peach tree

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:59.360
so that the hard frost not waste
the crop, the ice in his beard

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.420
and the ghosts lifting from
him when the warming sun

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.340
told him sleep now.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.460
Thank you the
ancestor who loved you

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.060
before she knew you by
smuggling seeds into her braid

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.540
for the long journey, who
loved you before he knew you

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.460
by putting a walnut tree in
the ground, who loved you

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.370
before she knew you by
not slaughtering the land.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.930
Thank you who did not bulldoze
the ancient grove of dates

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.010
and olives, who sailed
his keys into the ocean

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:29.360
and walked softly home, who
did not fire, who did not

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.980
plunge the head into the
toilet, who said stop,

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.630
don't do that, who lifted
some broken someone up,

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:39.390
who volunteered the way a plant
birthed of the receding plant

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.700
is called a volunteer, like
the plum tree that marched

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.780
beside the raised
bed in my garden,

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.470
like the arugula
that marched itself

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.265
between the blueberries, nary
a bayonette, nary an army, nary

00:44:50.265 --> 00:44:51.010
a nation,

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.230
which usage of the word
volunteer familiar to gardeners

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.870
the wide world made my
pal should 'Oh!' and dance

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.100
and plunge his knuckles into the
luscious soil before gobbling

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.820
two strawberries and digging
a song from his guitar made

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.350
of wood from a tree
someone planted.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.180
Thank you.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.830
Thank you zinna, and gooseberry,
rudbeckia, and pawpaw,

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.210
Ashmead's kernel, cockscomb,
and scarlet runner, feverfew

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.230
and lemonblam.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:17.510
Thank you knitbone and
sweetgrass and sunchoke

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:22.710
and false indigo whose petals
stammered apart by bumblebees

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.095
good lord please
give me a minute.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.010
And moonglow and
catkin and crookneck

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.370
and painted tongue and
seedpod and johnny jump-up.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.890
Thank you what in us rackets
glad what gladrackets us.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.940
And thank you too, this
knuckleheaded heart,

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.820
this pelican heart,
this gap-toothed heart

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.690
flinging open its
gaudy maw to the sky,

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:51.110
oh clumsy, oh bumblefucked,
oh giddy, oh dumbstruck,

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:54.065
oh rickshaw, oh goat
twisting its head at me

00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:58.320
from my peach tree's highest
branch, balanced impossibly

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.810
gobbling the last
fruit, its tongue

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:04.610
working like an engine, a
lone sweet drop tumbling

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.470
by some a miracle into my
mouth like the smell of someone

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.940
I've loved, heart like
an elephant screaming

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:16.170
at the bones of its dead, heart
like a lady on the bus dressed

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.700
head to toe in gold, the sun
shivering her shiny boots,

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.300
singing Erykah Badu
to herself leaning

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.430
her head against the window.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:28.600
And thank you the way one time
my father came back in a dream

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.720
by plucking the two cables
beneath my chin like a bass

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.530
fiddle's strings and played
me until I woke singing.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.530
No kidding, I was singing
and smiling, thank you.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.170
Thank you, stumbling into the
garden where the Juneberry's

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.760
flowers had burst open like
the bells of French horns,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.900
the lily my mother
and I planted oozed

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.030
into the air, the
bazillion ants labored

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.130
in their earthen
workshops below,

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.540
the collared greens waved in the
wind like the sales of ships,

00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:00.660
and the wasps swam in the
mint bloom's viscous swill.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:08.500
And you, again you, for
hanging tight, friends.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.750
I know I can be long
winded sometimes.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.980
I want so badly to rub
the sponge of gratitude

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:24.700
over every thing, including
you, which is awkward.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.575
The little soap running
into your hoodie

00:47:27.575 --> 00:47:30.410
or down your collar.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:33.460
Soon it will be
over, which is what

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.940
the little girl in my dream
said, holding my hand,

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.250
pointing at the
rolling sea and the sky

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.850
hurtling our way like so
many buffalo, who said,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:48.450
it's much worse than
you think, and sooner.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:53.480
To whom I said, no duh
child in my dreams.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.530
What do you think this
singing and shuddering

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.970
is, what this screaming and
reaching and dancing and crying

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:03.270
is, other than loving what
every second goes away?

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.946
Goodbye, I mean to say.

00:48:05.946 --> 00:48:07.600
And thank you.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.400
Every day."

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.950
Thank you.
