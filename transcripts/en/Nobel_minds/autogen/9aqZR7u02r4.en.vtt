the awarded the Nobel Prize oh thank you
it I know it's extremely early in the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
it I know it's extremely early in the
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.000
it I know it's extremely early in the
morning in fact the middle of the night

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
morning in fact the middle of the night
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860
morning in fact the middle of the night
there what were you doing when the call

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
there what were you doing when the call
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.160
there what were you doing when the call
from Stockholm came well I was sleeping

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
from Stockholm came well I was sleeping
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.350
from Stockholm came well I was sleeping
and my wife got the call and woke me up

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
and my wife got the call and woke me up
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
and my wife got the call and woke me up
do you recall your initial reaction well

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
do you recall your initial reaction well
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.319
do you recall your initial reaction well
I mean a wonderful surprise of course

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
I mean a wonderful surprise of course
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.479
I mean a wonderful surprise of course
yeah just amazing there I imagine is

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
yeah just amazing there I imagine is
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.950
yeah just amazing there I imagine is
throwing the house into some kind of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
throwing the house into some kind of
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.000
throwing the house into some kind of
disruption well we probably won't go

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
disruption well we probably won't go
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.580
disruption well we probably won't go
back to sleep well yeah yes but I I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
back to sleep well yeah yes but I I
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.230
back to sleep well yeah yes but I I
guess there's the normal business of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
guess there's the normal business of
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.200
guess there's the normal business of
life to run alongside handling the press

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
life to run alongside handling the press
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.770
life to run alongside handling the press
that are about to descend on you your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
that are about to descend on you your
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.070
that are about to descend on you your
main interest I I gather is developing

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
main interest I I gather is developing
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499
main interest I I gather is developing
far more accurate clocks and that's what

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
far more accurate clocks and that's what
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200
far more accurate clocks and that's what
you've been devoted to your career well

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
you've been devoted to your career well
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969
you've been devoted to your career well
that's been the that's been the main

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
that's been the that's been the main
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.569
that's been the that's been the main
theme yes but there's been many enough

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
theme yes but there's been many enough
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.819
theme yes but there's been many enough
from there including their work on

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
from there including their work on
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.210
from there including their work on
single atom and the trapping of single

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
single atom and the trapping of single
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670
single atom and the trapping of single
atoms this allows you to observe the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
atoms this allows you to observe the
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.490
atoms this allows you to observe the
superposition of quantum states a parade

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
superposition of quantum states a parade
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.399
superposition of quantum states a parade
this is basically observing if you like

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
this is basically observing if you like
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.710
this is basically observing if you like
the frontier between the classical world

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
the frontier between the classical world
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.490
the frontier between the classical world
where states don't superimpose and the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
where states don't superimpose and the
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380
where states don't superimpose and the
quantum states where you can have

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
quantum states where you can have
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.740
quantum states where you can have
multiple states at the same time uh well

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
multiple states at the same time uh well
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740
multiple states at the same time uh well
you might say that that's right yeah how

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
you might say that that's right yeah how
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.410
you might say that that's right yeah how
do you track the anthems now in our case

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
do you track the anthems now in our case
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.389
do you track the anthems now in our case
the atoms are ions charged atoms we use

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
the atoms are ions charged atoms we use
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.160
the atoms are ions charged atoms we use
electric field to hold them in one place

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
electric field to hold them in one place
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.559
electric field to hold them in one place
and then you use laser beams to

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
and then you use laser beams to
 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.089
and then you use laser beams to
manipulate them is that correct that's

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099
manipulate them is that correct that's
 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.809
manipulate them is that correct that's
right uh-huh tell me more please about

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819
right uh-huh tell me more please about
 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.110
right uh-huh tell me more please about
why we need more accurate clocks well I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
why we need more accurate clocks well I
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.780
why we need more accurate clocks well I
think historically it's always been true

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790
think historically it's always been true
 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.000
think historically it's always been true
that when we've made better clocks

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
that when we've made better clocks
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.030
that when we've made better clocks
there's always been an application the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
there's always been an application the
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.600
there's always been an application the
main use throughout history for the last

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
main use throughout history for the last
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.930
main use throughout history for the last
many centuries is that you know clocks

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
many centuries is that you know clocks
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.339
many centuries is that you know clocks
are used in navigation and the bitter

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349
are used in navigation and the bitter
 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.380
are used in navigation and the bitter
clocks we have the better navigation we

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
clocks we have the better navigation we
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.380
clocks we have the better navigation we
can do and so that that team has carried

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
can do and so that that team has carried
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.220
can do and so that that team has carried
through for many centuries as we make

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
through for many centuries as we make
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.039
through for many centuries as we make
better clocks that that's still been the

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049
better clocks that that's still been the
 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.380
better clocks that that's still been the
primary application these days also that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
primary application these days also that
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.080
primary application these days also that
the timing the precise timing you know

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
the timing the precise timing you know
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.039
the timing the precise timing you know
you know my good clocks is is also used

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049
you know my good clocks is is also used
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.520
you know my good clocks is is also used
in communication so but historically the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
in communication so but historically the
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.699
in communication so but historically the
main use has been continues to be in

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709
main use has been continues to be in
 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.449
main use has been continues to be in
their navigation what carrots are our

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459
their navigation what carrots are our
 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.009
their navigation what carrots are our
most accurate clocks now you have this

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019
most accurate clocks now you have this
 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.670
most accurate clocks now you have this
mercury on clock yeah they're currently

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
mercury on clock yeah they're currently
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.759
mercury on clock yeah they're currently
the most the most accurate one is also

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769
the most the most accurate one is also
 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.759
the most the most accurate one is also
in our lab it's based on aluminum and

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769
in our lab it's based on aluminum and
 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.960
in our lab it's based on aluminum and
the accuracy meaning you know how will

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970
the accuracy meaning you know how will
 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.690
the accuracy meaning you know how will
we can control the environmental effects

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700
we can control the environmental effects
 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.440
we can control the environmental effects
and so on is is it about one part in 10

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450
and so on is is it about one part in 10
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.610
and so on is is it about one part in 10
to the 17 how long can you keep it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
to the 17 how long can you keep it
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.060
to the 17 how long can you keep it
running for is it indefinite well so far

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070
running for is it indefinite well so far
 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.670
running for is it indefinite well so far
these are laboratory devices so they

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
these are laboratory devices so they
 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.520
these are laboratory devices so they
don't work continuously but they can

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
don't work continuously but they can
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.400
don't work continuously but they can
work many hours and days to produce

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410
work many hours and days to produce
 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.430
work many hours and days to produce
these results so the the other

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440
these results so the the other
 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.559
these results so the the other
application that is often talked about

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569
application that is often talked about
 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.819
application that is often talked about
his quantum computing right and does

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829
his quantum computing right and does
 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.559
his quantum computing right and does
your work take us a step closer to

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569
your work take us a step closer to
 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.819
your work take us a step closer to
quantum computing well I and I think you

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829
quantum computing well I and I think you
 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.319
quantum computing well I and I think you
might say that but in the same breath

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329
might say that but in the same breath
 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.160
might say that but in the same breath
you have to say that it's a long long

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
you have to say that it's a long long
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.560
you have to say that it's a long long
way before we have a useful quantum

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570
way before we have a useful quantum
 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.680
way before we have a useful quantum
computer but I think most of us feel

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690
computer but I think most of us feel
 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.740
computer but I think most of us feel
that even though it is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750
that even though it is
 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.340
that even though it is
long you know the long ways off before

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350
long you know the long ways off before
 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.920
long you know the long ways off before
we can realize such a computer that I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
we can realize such a computer that I
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.930
we can realize such a computer that I
think many of us feel that it'll

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940
think many of us feel that it'll
 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.330
think many of us feel that it'll
eventually happen it's primarily a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
eventually happen it's primarily a
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.580
eventually happen it's primarily a
matter of controlling these systems

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590
matter of controlling these systems
 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.120
matter of controlling these systems
better and better and we work both fair

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
better and better and we work both fair
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.730
