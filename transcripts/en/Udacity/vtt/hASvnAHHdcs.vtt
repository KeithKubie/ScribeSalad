00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.000
In order to start resolving
ambiguities of the kind

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.760
the occur with the earthquake story,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.200
we need a new knowledge representation
called a traumatic rule system.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.120
A traumatic rule system is
a type of frame system,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.830
where the frame represents an action or
event identified by a word.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.580
The word caused forth a number of
expectations about the roles that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.990
are connected with
that particular event.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.720
David, can you think of an example
of the thematic-role frame?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.600
&gt;&gt; So one simple example that comes
to mind for me is the word throw.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.840
I know that if a throw action has taken
place, a few things have to be in play.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.710
I expect there to be
someone doing the throwing.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.530
I expect something to be thrown.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.150
I might expect a target
specified by the word at or

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.430
a destination specified by the word to.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.530
So, for example,
I throw the ball to a choke, or

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.302
I throw the ball at a choke,
depending on how nice I'm feeling.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:52.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Note that even though
David isn't talking about a specific

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.030
instance of throwing,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.980
he's still able to generate expectations
with the general action of throwing.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.480
This shows what a traumatic
case frame does for you.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.770
It is able to generate expectations.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.920
Let us look at how it would
actually work in action.
