00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.309
I'll have a shot of whiskey, a gin &amp; tonic,
and a home pregnancy test - to go, please.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.070
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and you know
who has it the worst?

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Pregnant women.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.019
They can't have caffeine, they can't smoke,
and they definitely can't drink alcohol - though

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.210
that doesn't always stop everyone.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.599
According to the CDC, 1 in 13 women admit
to drinking while pregnant, and 1 in 70 women

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.619
admit to binge drinking.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.540
Some states, including Alaska, which has the
highest rate of fetal alcohol syndrome in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.299
the country - have even resorted to administering
free pregnancy tests at bars, in order to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.130
raise awareness about the disease.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.010
But what is fetal alcohol syndrome?

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.320
And is it a guaranteed thing if you drink
while pregnant?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.470
Well, not really.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.250
We've known since the late 60s that alcohol
can cause birth defects.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.640
When a pregnant woman drinks, the alcohol
passes through the placenta to the fetus,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.770
and gets into your baby's bloodstream.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.180
The problem is that babies metabolize alcohol
way slower than adults do - so 1 drink to

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.830
you is like 4 drinks to them.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.610
Now 4 drinks probably won't harm you - but
in fetuses, it interferes with the delivery

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.170
of oxygen and nutrition they need in order
to keep growing.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.610
That's why exposure to alcohol - especially
in excessive amounts - can disrupts your baby's

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.440
development, causing growth problems and brain
damage.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.690
Physically, it has very characteristic effects.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.120
Children with FAS typically have microcephaly,
which is a smaller than normal head; as well

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.800
as eyes that are smaller, and more far apart,
than normal.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.811
Now you're probably wondering, why do women
continue to drink during pregnancy, even when

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.659
they know it's bad for their baby?

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.220
There are a couple reasons.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.070
For one, most women don't even know they're
pregnant, until they're at least a month in.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.840
And research shows that alcohol is the most
harmful to fetuses during the first 3 months

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.070
of pregnancy.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.300
So there's a good chance many of the women
whose children have FAS, didn't even know

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.400
they were doing them harm.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.710
Now you could argue that if you found out
you were pregnant, and knew you'd been drinking

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.870
heavily during that time, you could always
abort.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.310
But it's unrealistic to expect everyone to
take that option.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.060
Another potential cause of FAS, is plain and
simple alcoholism.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.610
It's a disease, and a devastating one that
can take over our rational brain and make

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.560
us do things that we know are bad.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.290
But how bad is bad?

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.980
And how much alcohol would it take to cause
something like fetal alcohol syndrome?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.920
Think of like a spectrum.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.200
On the one end, having 1 drink per day or
less, has really not been associated with

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.980
any risk of FAS.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.700
On the other end of the spectrum, you have
children with full-on FAS, whose mothers typically

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.110
consumed 8 - 10 drinks per day.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.650
In the middle, women who have 4-6 drinks per
day, typically produce children with mild

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.670
FAS.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.630
But even 1-2 drinks per day, substantially
increases the odds of stunting your child's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.630
growth.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.610
Which is why public health experts recommend
the "better safe than sorry" approach.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.010
No alcohol, no worries.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.530
What do you think?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.260
One drink won't kill your unborn baby, but
is the 30-minute buzz you get really worth

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.260
the constant worrying?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.499
