not login and they're brand new and I
 

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.950
not login and they're brand new and I
still want to personalize their

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960
still want to personalize their
 

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.690

issues one interesting thing we talked

00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:30.799
issues one interesting thing we talked
 

00:35:30.799 --> 00:35:33.099
issues one interesting thing we talked
about was last year we said well how do

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:33.109
about was last year we said well how do
 

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:34.539
about was last year we said well how do
you build a billion by billion

00:35:34.539 --> 00:35:34.549
you build a billion by billion
 

00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:35.829
you build a billion by billion
collaborative filtering matrix it

00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839
collaborative filtering matrix it
 

00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:38.650
collaborative filtering matrix it
becomes insane even if you could build

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:38.660
becomes insane even if you could build
 

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.029
becomes insane even if you could build
it like how do you deploy how do you

00:35:40.029 --> 00:35:40.039
it like how do you deploy how do you
 

00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:42.269
it like how do you deploy how do you
move around it just comes very tricky

00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:42.279
move around it just comes very tricky
 

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:44.950
move around it just comes very tricky
and again many of these problems no one

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960
and again many of these problems no one
 

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.059
and again many of these problems no one
else has to deal with because they don't

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:46.069
else has to deal with because they don't
 

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:49.150
else has to deal with because they don't
have a billion by billion users so the

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160
have a billion by billion users so the
 

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.890
have a billion by billion users so the
other this last point I think Tom very

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:50.900
other this last point I think Tom very
 

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.079

time on getting ten billions billions

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160
time on getting ten billions billions
 

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.769
time on getting ten billions billions
and billions of new ratings every day

00:35:56.769 --> 00:35:56.779
and billions of new ratings every day
 

00:35:56.779 --> 00:35:58.180
and billions of new ratings every day
between all these billion objects so

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:58.190
between all these billion objects so
 

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.950
between all these billion objects so
it's not that I just built this thing

00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960
it's not that I just built this thing
 

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.839
it's not that I just built this thing
once I have to update it every second

00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:01.849
once I have to update it every second
 

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:04.059
once I have to update it every second
essentially this becomes tricky and so

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:04.069
essentially this becomes tricky and so
 

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:06.520
essentially this becomes tricky and so
this is really the last thing which is

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:06.530
this is really the last thing which is
 

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.350
this is really the last thing which is
you start building a good product and

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:08.360
you start building a good product and
 

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.850
you start building a good product and
then Marissa comes and says hey I want

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:09.860
then Marissa comes and says hey I want
 

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.620
then Marissa comes and says hey I want
that updated you like every second now

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:11.630
that updated you like every second now
 

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.260
that updated you like every second now
so literally everything has to be online

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:14.270
so literally everything has to be online
 

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.730
so literally everything has to be online
everything has to be incremental you

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:15.740
everything has to be incremental you
 

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.130
everything has to be incremental you
can't do anything batch and you have to

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.140
can't do anything batch and you have to
 

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.780
can't do anything batch and you have to
do essentially everything very very

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:19.790
do essentially everything very very
 

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.510
do essentially everything very very
quickly so again it's another constraint

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520
quickly so again it's another constraint
 

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.000
quickly so again it's another constraint
that makes the problem harder and also

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.010
that makes the problem harder and also
 

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.620
that makes the problem harder and also
limits kind of you know the technology

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:26.630
limits kind of you know the technology
 

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.750
limits kind of you know the technology
we have today how it can be useful so

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760
we have today how it can be useful so
 

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.240
we have today how it can be useful so
literally all these things have massive

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.250
literally all these things have massive
 

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.680
literally all these things have massive
research projects that you know

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:32.690
research projects that you know
 

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.970
research projects that you know
literally we don't know how to solve all

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:33.980
literally we don't know how to solve all
 

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.770
literally we don't know how to solve all
these things in the best way today and

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:35.780
these things in the best way today and
 

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.790
these things in the best way today and
we don't have enough people who don't

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800
we don't have enough people who don't
 

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.140
we don't have enough people who don't
have enough time to go figure this all

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:38.150
have enough time to go figure this all
 

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.090
have enough time to go figure this all
out so this is a critical piece

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:40.100
out so this is a critical piece
 

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.960
out so this is a critical piece
literally I believe of the relationship

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:42.970
literally I believe of the relationship
 

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:48.160
literally I believe of the relationship
and so again kind of getting to what is

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.170
and so again kind of getting to what is
 

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.990
and so again kind of getting to what is
that what is that Yahoo so we have kind

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000
that what is that Yahoo so we have kind
 

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.360
that what is that Yahoo so we have kind
of a high level architecture where you

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.370
of a high level architecture where you
 

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.680
of a high level architecture where you
know one thing we do is understand

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:53.690
know one thing we do is understand
 

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.230
know one thing we do is understand
content all the types of content we

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240
content all the types of content we
 

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.700
content all the types of content we
understand the users we have and there's

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:57.710
understand the users we have and there's
 

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.590
understand the users we have and there's
various segments of users so they talk

00:36:59.590 --> 00:36:59.600
various segments of users so they talk
 

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.170
various segments of users so they talk
about new moans old ones and then we

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:02.180
about new moans old ones and then we
 

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.700
about new moans old ones and then we
have you know a ranking and serving

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:03.710
have you know a ranking and serving
 

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.200
have you know a ranking and serving
component you can call it that which is

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.210
component you can call it that which is
 

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.020
component you can call it that which is
kind of the recommendation engine itself

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.030
kind of the recommendation engine itself
 

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.880
kind of the recommendation engine itself
this is you know and there's you know

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:09.890
this is you know and there's you know
 

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.280
this is you know and there's you know
the users are pushing data to all these

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:12.290
the users are pushing data to all these
 

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.780
the users are pushing data to all these
systems and we're pushing data to them

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:13.790
systems and we're pushing data to them
 

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.060
systems and we're pushing data to them
in some way and you know this is very

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.070
in some way and you know this is very
 

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.530
in some way and you know this is very
high level in a sense that there may be

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:17.540
high level in a sense that there may be
 

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.510
high level in a sense that there may be
several of these depending on how you

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520
several of these depending on how you
 

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.730
several of these depending on how you
want to push the stuff to users but in

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:21.740
want to push the stuff to users but in
 

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.320
want to push the stuff to users but in
general you're solving these three major

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.330
general you're solving these three major
 

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:30.040
general you're solving these three major
pieces so looking at Yahoo up to today

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.050
pieces so looking at Yahoo up to today
 

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.970
pieces so looking at Yahoo up to today
we have a long history of

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:30.980
we have a long history of
 

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.890
we have a long history of
personalization we focus on you know

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:32.900
personalization we focus on you know
 

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.330
personalization we focus on you know
people tell us things so we have

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:34.340
people tell us things so we have
 

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.950
people tell us things so we have
explicit personalization and Yahoo

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960
explicit personalization and Yahoo
 

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.180
explicit personalization and Yahoo
you've been telling us stuff for a long

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.190
you've been telling us stuff for a long
 

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.310
you've been telling us stuff for a long
time we learn things about you so we

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:39.320
time we learn things about you so we
 

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.960
time we learn things about you so we
implicitly do this and then you push

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:40.970
implicitly do this and then you push
 

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.790
implicitly do this and then you push
this to content ads and we've been doing

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800
this to content ads and we've been doing
 

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.430
this to content ads and we've been doing
this for many many years about more than

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440
this for many many years about more than
 

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.620
this for many many years about more than
10 years ago we really literally

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:47.630
10 years ago we really literally
 

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.150
10 years ago we really literally
invented behavior targeting for

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160
invented behavior targeting for
 

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.920
invented behavior targeting for
advertising and you know as many many

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:50.930
advertising and you know as many many
 

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.540
advertising and you know as many many
years before anyone else essentially

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:52.550
years before anyone else essentially
 

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.960
years before anyone else essentially
caught up so it's very long history but

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:55.970
caught up so it's very long history but
 

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.370
caught up so it's very long history but
in the past 18 months we've had a big

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.380
in the past 18 months we've had a big
 

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.110
in the past 18 months we've had a big
focus on that particularly because

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.120
focus on that particularly because
 

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.870
focus on that particularly because
Marissa is big on personalization so one

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880
Marissa is big on personalization so one
 

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.730
Marissa is big on personalization so one
of the things that done is in 18 months

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:03.740
of the things that done is in 18 months
 

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.440
of the things that done is in 18 months
we've literally rebuilt the system four

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:05.450
we've literally rebuilt the system four
 

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.690
we've literally rebuilt the system four
times and so you build the system once

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:07.700
times and so you build the system once
 

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.610
times and so you build the system once
you put technology in gent you push

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:09.620
you put technology in gent you push
 

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.170

before and you learn what you need next

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.180
before and you learn what you need next
 

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.400
before and you learn what you need next
and so you just throw the old system

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.410
and so you just throw the old system
 

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.870
and so you just throw the old system
when you rebuild all over again right

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880
when you rebuild all over again right
 

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.850
when you rebuild all over again right

and that's very exciting so we've been
talking about personalization and that's

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.450
talking about personalization and that's
 

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.640
talking about personalization and that's
a key word for yahoo right now first

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:17.650
a key word for yahoo right now first

people in lots of other places and it's
 

00:40:23.259 --> 00:40:25.470
people in lots of other places and it's
interesting to me what is meant by

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480
interesting to me what is meant by
 

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.980
interesting to me what is meant by
personalization in many places that

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:28.990
personalization in many places that
 

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.779
personalization in many places that
don't take this as seriously as Yahoo

00:40:30.779 --> 00:40:30.789
don't take this as seriously as Yahoo

does personalization is either trivial

00:40:34.049 --> 00:40:34.059
does personalization is either trivial
 

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:39.870
does personalization is either trivial
or it's impossible so what's actually

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880
or it's impossible so what's actually
 

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.210
or it's impossible so what's actually
meant by personalization what I'm going

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:42.220
meant by personalization what I'm going
 

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.549
meant by personalization what I'm going
to do in the next 15 minutes is talk

adults and teens think about
 

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.559
adults and teens think about
personalization they don't really

00:41:04.559 --> 00:41:04.569
personalization they don't really
 

00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:06.989
personalization they don't really
believe that personalization is going on

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:06.999
believe that personalization is going on
 

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:10.620
believe that personalization is going on
and they don't really understand how it

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:10.630
and they don't really understand how it
 

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.349
and they don't really understand how it
would go on and maybe that's not

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359
would go on and maybe that's not
 

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:14.910
would go on and maybe that's not
surprising if this is the kind of

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920
surprising if this is the kind of
 

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.390
surprising if this is the kind of
personalization we see so if i take what

enough to just gain facts you have to

00:44:47.859 --> 00:44:47.869
enough to just gain facts you have to
 

00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:50.680
enough to just gain facts you have to
make inferences about those facts and in

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:50.690
make inferences about those facts and in
 

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.060
make inferences about those facts and in

has learned is to look for another city

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:26.830
has learned is to look for another city
 

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:33.550
has learned is to look for another city
that also might be in Pennsylvania and

that also might be in Pennsylvania and
 

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.579
that also might be in Pennsylvania and
thereby figure out that Pittsburgh is in

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:36.589
thereby figure out that Pittsburgh is in
 

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:40.359
thereby figure out that Pittsburgh is in
Pennsylvania or to look for a company

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:40.369
Pennsylvania or to look for a company
 

00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:43.210

thereby infer that that company is in
Pittsburgh and that Pittsburgh is in

less confidence so I talked about

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:02.630
less confidence so I talked about
 

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.570
less confidence so I talked about
learning about the world but it's also

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:04.580
learning about the world but it's also
 

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.720
learning about the world but it's also
important to learn about the user and

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:06.730
important to learn about the user and
 

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.280
important to learn about the user and

about how your research could fit in
 

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.740
about how your research could fit in
think about it in those terms and then

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:45.750
think about it in those terms and then
 

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:49.250
think about it in those terms and then
come top adjusting the night maybe you

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260
come top adjusting the night maybe you
 

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:51.110
come top adjusting the night maybe you
could talk a little about what your

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:51.120
could talk a little about what your
 

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:58.280
could talk a little about what your
