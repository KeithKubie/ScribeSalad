00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.270
Many of my friends, teachers, romantic partners
and even my parents have all told me to stop

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.940
fidgeting, "TRACE STOP SHAKING YOUR LEG."

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:15.130
But I didn't even know I was doing it MOM,
geez!

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.150
fidgeting friends
Once upon a time, Psychologist Sir Francis

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.769
Galton was sitting in a lecture, got bored
and decided to watch the audience instead

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.039
of listen to the speaker.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.300
(been there!)

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.429
According to him, these elderly Victorian
lecture-goers were, "swaying from side-to-side"

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.010
at about "1 fidget a minute."

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.420
When the audience's attention was aroused,
he noticed their fidgeting would lessen.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.980
In his paper, published in Nature, titled
"The Measure of Fidget" Galton determined

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.839
people must fidget out of boredom!

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.910
This was before discussions about hyperactivity
or sugar, or before the television RUINED

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.239
our attention span.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.579
This was 1885!

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.260
130 years ago, people fidgeted.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.920
It's definitely not caused by over-caffeinated,
ADHD-prone, coddled millennials.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.069
Instead, fidgeting seems to be part of human
nature.

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.840
The dictionary defines fidgeting as "small
movements, especially of the hands and feet,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.439
caused by nervousness or impatience," but
science has another explanation; it's a way

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.350
to keep my brain active and focused.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.369
Yep, you heard me, fidgeting may equal focus.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.860
HASHTAG SCIENCE, YO.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.050
When brains are stressed we don't pay as close
attention, and we don't learn as much!

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.860
Cognitive Load Theory says to think of the
brain like a CPU; when too much is going on

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860
the brain can't focus.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.130
So, to offload some of that stress, the brain
might trigger our fidgeting!

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.240
Lower stress is highly associated with better
learning and memory performance, so fidgeting

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969
can help us learn!

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.030
Though science isn't sure… because maybe
it's just men…

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.580
For some reason men fidget twice as often
as women, and a 2005 study from the University

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.439
of Hertfordshire found fidgeting can reduce
levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.729
should lower stress.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.530
A study in PLoS ONE, however, that benefit
seems to fall on men who fidgeted.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.860
The fidgeting men they tested performed better
on cognitive tests and had lower stress, but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950
fidgeting women did neither.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.450
Another study with ADHD kids further muddies
the fidgeting waters, as fidgeting doesn't

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510
help everyone all the time.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
A study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology
assessed the working memory of young fidgeting

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.890
boys.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.740
When ADHD kids were put in a swivel chair
and allowed to spin, they performed better

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170
on memory tests.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.220
However, kids without ADHD performed worse
when they were allowed to spin, and better

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.350
when they stayed still.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.020
It would seem, though fidgeting may lower
stress and help learning, there's a level

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.580
where the benefits to our attention and learning
disappear.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.270
For example, drawing random doodles, kicking
feet, or shaking legs may be fine, but drawing

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.190
specific pictures or walking around the room
is too distracting and benefits are lost.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.990
So, perhaps boys with ADHD need to fidget?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.990
What about girls?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.070
Do they get ANY benefit?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.770
Well, a study from September 2015 in the American
Journal of Preventive Medicine, looked at

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.510
13,000 UK women 12 years apart and found adults
who fidgeted, also burned calories!

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.130
Their results found fidgeters had quote "better
health outcomes," than their still counterparts.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.560
And another study in Medicine &amp; Science in
Sports &amp; Exercise found fidgeting can burn

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.530
up to 144 calories a day!

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.190
That's more than a can of pop!

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.210
Some researchers believe fidgeting seems to
be an adaptation to our more sedentary lifestyle.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.700
But a study in Frontiers in Psychology looking
at memory retention of lectures, and fidgeting…

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.900
found almost the same as Galton in 1885.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.870
If you track the number of fidgets per minute,
it's a good indicator of audience boredom.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.450
Fidgeting seems to be a representation of
our animal brains working hard to keep on

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.790
task and learning.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.650
It can be irksome, but as long as it's not
distracting to others, it's not necessarily

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.290
bad, and is (at least) burning some calories!

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.210
Sometimes we're just… fidgety widgety.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.250
Do you fidget?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.250
How?

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.250
Pen clicker?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.250
Leg shaker?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.250
Finger tapper?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.250
Nail biter?

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.250
Whatchoo got?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.250
Tell us your fidgeting functions down below.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.660
Fidgeting might be annoying to some, but sitting
is killing you.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660
Yep.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.660
Your chair.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.810
It's slowing killing you right now.
