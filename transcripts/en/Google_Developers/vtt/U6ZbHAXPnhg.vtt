PAUL SAXMAN: Hello, and welcome
to Google Maps Garage.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.950
I'm Paul Saxman.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.350
And with me this week is Josh
"Raster Data" Livni.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.390
Today we're going to talk about
getting raster data in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.090
your mobile map using the Google
Maps Android API and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.453
some WMS services, or raster
data services, which Josh is

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:25.330
going to talk about.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.800
But what we mean about getting
raster data in your map is, if

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.690
we look at the tablet
here, this is the

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.570
Azavea Philly tree map.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.710
And you can see here, as we
zoom in, this application

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.730
actually has a lot
of data in it.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.410
These are actually individual
trees in the city of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.590
Philadelphia--

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.220
a lot more data here than you
could actually do in markers,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.800
for example.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.650
So the way they're doing this is
they're actually generating

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.120
images on their server,
providing these images to the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.830
application.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.750
The Android API is actually
rendering them

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.490
on top of the map.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.010
The really nice thing about
this, as well, is that, via

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.830
the API, these tiles and these
images actually rotate and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770
tilt, like you would expect
them with the map.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.220
The way this works is what Josh
is going to explain now.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.770
JOSH LIVNI: All right,
thanks, Paul.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.020
Yeah, so I'm just going to go
through three simple Chrome

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.250
tabs to cover the general
technique they used here.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520
Let me go ahead and zoom
in this blog post.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.410
So in addition to releasing this
app recently, they also

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.550
wrote some notes up on
how they did it.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.690
The title, "WMS On Android," is
kind of what we're going to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.490
walk through for the rest
of the session.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.070
But first, as many of you know,
our base map tiles and

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.670
many tiles that you see on maps
come in these 256-pixel

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.460
squares that people send over.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.980
They align really nicely.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.730
And you often see them, perhaps,
pre-rendered or

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
available in some sort of
URL and then an XYZ--

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.540
the x-axis, y-axis, and zoom
level of the tiles.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.450
But another way to send images
or rasters like this over the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.020
wire is using something called
WMS, or Web Map Service, a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.060
standard supported by lots of
large organizations, open

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.419
source software, and what
they're using here.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.320
PAUL SAXMAN: They support it,
and they provide this data, as

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.610
well, right?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.690
A lot of these companies--

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.860
or organizations, actually--

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.820
provide raster services.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.750
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.450
So you can use some open source
software or software of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.560
your choice to create a kind of
WMS service with your data.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.580
Or just go out on the web, which
we'll talk about in a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.930
little bit, and see that there's
lots of public data

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.320
available for you
in this format.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.970
So how does one get it into your
Android tile provider?

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.940
So this blog post kind
of walks you through.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940
I'm not going to go into
it in great detail.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.030
You can read it for yourself
on the Azavea blog.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.270
But let's go ahead and take a
look at what is this WMS when

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.490
you encounter it in the wild.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.170
So here's an example of the
National Atlas, which has tons

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.080
and tons of data layers
available to you on US

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.480
government created data sets,
of which there's a lot.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380
So here are some examples of
some WMS services that we have

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.340
available to us.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.190
I'm going to go ahead and
click on one here, this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.310
Agriculture, for example.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.170
And you'll notice the URL here
has GetCapabilities.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.440
A WMS server has two general
requests that you make here--

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.350
the GetCapabilities, which tells
you what you can get out

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.210
of it, and the GetMap, which, as
you might guess, gives you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.580
back a map image.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.070
So I'll hit the GetCapabilities.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.520
And if I scroll down here,
it's an XML document that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.430
describes all of the features
and different things you can

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.530
do with this particular
WMS service.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.670
And they all differ.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.460
The important thing to look for
that we're going to need

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.320
to put into our application is
the name of the layer that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.870
we're interested in getting.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.720
So here, they have some layers--
for example, crop 1.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.390
And the other thing that's
really important-- although

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.270
there's a few--

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.210
are the supported projections.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.500
So the projection that we use in
Google Maps is a Spherical

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.920
Mercator projection.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.280
And it goes by, confusingly, a
number of different coordinate

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.790
reference systems or spatial
reference systems.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.260
So the sort of official one,
3857 here, if you see that,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.320
you're good to go.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.400
But you could also go ahead
and use any of these--

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.950
54004; this ESRI one, 1002113;
or this more common but

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.880
unofficial 900913--

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360
Google, in elite speak--

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.149
reference system.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.610
And if the WMS says, I support
this, then you're good to go

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.880
to overlay the images.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.880
If, for example, it only has
this kind of plate carree 4326

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.340
reference system, you're not
going to be able to align the

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.080
tiles with a Spherical
Mercator map.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.290
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, different
projection.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.340
And so that's actually a really
interesting thing.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.950
So digging around some of these
WMS providers, I saw

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.760
probably about a little over
half actually support the ones

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.480
that we can use.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.395
So very important to look for
this when you're looking at

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:47.600
these public WMS servers.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.490
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.745
PAUL SAXMAN: But there are a
number of them out there.

00:04:49.745 --> 00:04:52.140
I mean, they're not
hard to find.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.110
JOSH LIVNI: And on that note,
projections are confusing.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.180
So if you want to see us give
a talk on projections--

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.135
not going to cover them anymore
today-- let us know in

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.710
the comments, and maybe we'll
whip something up.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.760
So the next step is the
GetMap request.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.440
You can see in the URL, there's
a whole bunch of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.740
different parameters.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.330
Here I have my layers
is value 3.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.260
I picked some layer at random.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.705
I have a bounding box,
which I can change.

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:13.560
And I get back this map image.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.170
If I hit back one, my layers
is now crop 1.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.980
I could change it to crop 2.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.180
And I get back images for their
various different layers

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.500
that they support in the
bounding box width and height

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.740
that are requested.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.770
So the final step is, now that
we know what WMS is, how do we

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.760
turn this into the nice
256 tiles and get

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.070
them in the tile provider?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.570
And fortunately, again-- thanks,
Azavea; super cool--

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.300
you guys produced some open
source code, which Paul has

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.740
generalized in some ways and
made really easy for you guys

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.360
to get arbitrary
WMS servers in.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.380
So why don't you tell
us about that?

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.950
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.630
So this is the
maps-wms-tiles-sample.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.510
We'll link to this in
the description, or

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.050
it is linked to.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.480
So basically, I just
forked their code.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.220
Their code is actually
relatively easy to use.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.750
They just have their tile
provider hardcoded in.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.150
I generalized it by pulling it
out into an object that we can

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.650
use to populate any number of
different tile providers.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.350
But if you just have your own
tile provider, you want to use

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.710
that, definitely you can go
straight to their code and

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.110
fork their repository.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.700
So what I did-- if we
go to the next--

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.820
so here, you could see in
this code, is I have

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.810
five different providers.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.280
These are different tile
providers that are available.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.810
You could see that I generalized
it, so you can

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.520
just pass the parameters
that you need.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.760
You definitely need the URL.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.310
You definitely need
the layers.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.090
There's a number of other
optional parameters, things

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.480
like the style.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.410
Some of these providers
have different styles.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.230
That's all in the
GetCapabilities.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.900
And then also, there's
transparency.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.630
So by default, if the tile
provider can provide pings

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.710
with transparency, then that's
just default on.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.400
But you can turn that off
and actually have an

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.150
opaque map if you want.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.480
So this is an example.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.160
So I'm going to run this
application here, so we can

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.350
see what it looks like.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.950
So here we are on the
tablet again.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.470
So this is from Google Maps.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.070
JOSH LIVNI: Is this
city lights?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, this
is city lights.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.080
JOSH LIVNI: --at night.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.250
Yeah, the NASA city lights that
we've brought into Google

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.440
Maps Engine.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.670
And Google Maps Engine also has
a WMS endpoint, amongst

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.600
others, that you can get you
data out in KML, integrated

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.800
into the Maps API, or a WMS
that then we can use

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.210
arbitrarily in applications
such as this.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.740
PAUL SAXMAN: Yep.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.460
So you load your raster data
into Maps Engine, then you

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.170
automatically get this
WMS service.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:43.120
So here, you can see this is
Earth lights at night.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.940
Really nice thing.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.140
So again, you can see these
tiles actually loading as I'm

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.030
zooming in.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.600
These are actually coming
from some of

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.490
the Maps Engine servers.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.910
And again, you can also
rotate and tilt.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:56.980
Another example.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.190
So we saw the National
Atlas earlier.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.410
So this is precipitation.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.950
I just switched the map type.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.760
I think this is the
hybrid map.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.540
And you can see this
overlay data.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.950
This is precipitation in
the United States.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.640
And the nice thing about this,
or interesting thing about

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.990
this, is you can see that the
labels are actually rendered

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.670
on top of the data.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.370
So that's kind of the
default mode.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.230
We don't yet support actually
rendering the labels

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.250
underneath the tile overlay.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.492
But--

00:08:27.492 --> 00:08:29.220
JOSH LIVNI: Who wants
labels underneath?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.860
That's no good.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.175
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.930
Actually, it's the other way
around a lot of times.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.112
Everybody is begging
for people to have

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:34.870
the labels on top.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.950
So this is a nice demonstration
of seeing the

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.620
labels and the data.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.200
And again, as we zoom in, as
we're rendering these tiles,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.960
we're just making requests
of the WMS service and

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.740
filling them in.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.490
They load a little bit slower
than the map tiles.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.520
Just depends on the speed of
the WMS service that we're

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.180
pulling from.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.210
Some other examples
is the NOAA.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.460
So NOAA has a number of
different services.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.210
This one was Watch and Warning,

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.200
weather watches and warnings.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.365
So this data looks really great
on top a map, especially

00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:08.930
a street map.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.730
And another one from NOAA,
this is Radar.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.960
So radar, you could see a lot
of precipitation out East.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.500
So all this information is
pretty much freely available

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.420
to put on top of your map, as
long as you know where the

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.750
data comes from and also have
the ability to put it on your

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:32.250
map using the Maps API and
this API from Az--

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:32.610
JOSH LIVNI: Azavea.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.870
PAUL SAXMAN: Azavea.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.650
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.000
Actually, I don't know how
to pronounce it, either.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.800
PAUL SAXMAN: One quick last one,
a really interesting one.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.650
So this one was from USGS.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.550
You can see all counties
in the United States.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.140
So if you wanted to render
this as polygons, you can

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.240
imagine that's actually a lot
of work, actually producing

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.110
the polygons and actually
rendering them.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.190
This way, rendering them as
raster tiles, it just works.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.430
And easy cheesy.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.500
JOSH LIVNI: Less bandwidth,
yeah.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.150
So it's a best practice, before
you just go hit up a

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.550
WMS endpoint, to see if the
provider also has a tile

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.670
endpoint, where they've
potentially pre-rendered or

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.510
cast or otherwise made available
the kind of XYZ

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.860
format tiles.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.690
Since WMS is a lot more
flexible, you're not

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.980
unnecessarily using their
CPU to create that.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.380
So check out also, of course,
their usage policy and so

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.660
forth before you start grabbing
kind of tiles.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.170
And many of them have
attribution

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.240
that they might request.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.080
So just common best practices
when using

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.060
anybody's web service.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.360
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I'm sure
some of these big

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.090
guys can handle it.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.660
But if it's somebody that just
put some tiles up for a sample

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.630
application and--

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.440
JOSH LIVNI: They might be sad.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.880
PAUL SAXMAN: --yeah-- and your
app takes off, then yeah.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.970
JOSH LIVNI: And in a case like
that, where you see something

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.950
like that and you have the
rights to use the tiles, but

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.060
you're you concerned about
hitting them, you can put up

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.940
really simple proxies in
between, like TileCache, which

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.510
will sit in between a WMS server
and then spit out these

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.050
XYZ tiles, which makes it really
easy on everybody.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.920
But in any case, you can hit it
directly without a proxy or

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.380
setting up your own service
using this code here.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.420
And it looks like, really, the
only thing you need to modify

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.040
with the code is this
mainactivity.java.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.240
Change the URLs in here to match
what you need, and you

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.680
have a working WMS
Android app.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.400
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, so either
grab this app, or if you just

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.310
have one endpoint.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.960
If you want to play around with
multiple endpoints, use

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.300
the code I put up.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.690
If you want to just use one
endpoint and hardcode the URL

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.060
in, check out what Azavea
put together.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.880
And there's a lot of--

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.830
this is getting up and
running quickly.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.510
You could probably get this app
running in about five, ten

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.760
minutes if you know you have to
pace in your key and link

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.920
to the Android library.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.630
But beyond all that, it's
actually just pretty

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.780
much plug and play.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.450
A lot of advanced topics
around WMS.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.980
There's a number of other WMS
services out there that we

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.930
could talk about.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.430
Josh mentioned we could probably
have a whole talk

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.470
about projections and
how these work.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.340
If you guys want to hear more
about any of these things,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.560
definitely leave us
some comments.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.520
If you have any questions--

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.270
JOSH LIVNI: We love comments
and questions.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:55.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Absolutely.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.400
So we will try our best
to get back to you

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.350
on any of the comments.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.650
And if you just want to tell
us if and how, or not, you

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.210
like the show, do
that, as well.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.760
And thanks for joining us.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.980
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, thanks
for tuning in, guys.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.610
See you in a couple weeks.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Adios.
