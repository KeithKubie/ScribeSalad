Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.125 --> 00:00:04.169
We're here at Devoxx 2014, and
I'm here where Chet and Romain.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:04.710
Chet, Romain.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.320
Romain, Chet.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.570
ROMAIN GUY: It's all the same.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.959
It's all the same.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.232
You don't even know who's who.

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:11.690
We're here to talk
about Android 5.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.750
That you know what it is?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.422
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:13.921
Yes.

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.510
NICK BUTCHER: L stands for?

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.850
CHET HAASE: Lollipop.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.530
NICK BUTCHER: Lollipop.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.060
Awesome.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.450
And people are
actually, as we speak,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.960
getting their
updates over there.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.280
So what are they
actually getting?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.100
I hear things like material
design, material design,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.090
and material design.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.830
CHET HAASE: That's
pretty much it.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.000
Those are the first
three elements,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.890
and then there's a couple
after that, including material

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.520
design, and then also
the implementation

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.140
of material design.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.682
ROMAIN GUY: There are
a few more features.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.506
CHET HAASE: Are there?

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:37.918
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:38.543
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:40.880
That's certainly the ones
that I worried about.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.860
So basically everything
that the team that I'm on,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.350
which is the UI Toolkit Team,
worked on for the release

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290
was all about material design.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.570
Because the UX Team's
vision for material design

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.430
was so grandiose and
large, basically we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.971
needed to work the
entire [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.930
to figure out how to
implement that thing.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.555
NICK BUTCHER: So you
worked really hard

00:00:58.555 --> 00:00:59.722
so developers don't have to?

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.596
CHET HAASE: That's
another way of putting it.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:02.222
Sure.

00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:04.430
NICK BUTCHER: So what are
developers getting, really,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.480
with material design?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.820
So there are things
like coloring,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.930
there are things like,
obviously, animations,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.810
and all of that is baked in
the platform at this point.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.220
CHET HAASE: Right.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.720
Right.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.815
So I think one of the
things to come out of this,

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.940
like, if you go to these
talks and you sort of read

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.689
the articles, you're
like, well, so what's

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.290
this huge new swath
of APIs that I

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.583
need to use to implement
material design in my app?

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.410
And the answer is
actually not that much.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.240
A lot of it just comes for free.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.885
So when you opt into
the material theme

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.510
or if you're using
the support library,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.281
you opt into the
AppCompat theme,

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.280
and then you're running
on the Lollipop release,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.450
you're just going to
get a bunch of stuff

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.550
for free, which is the
colorizing of the assets.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.590
So you're going to look
like the standard, which

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.010
it should look on the platform.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.710
You're going to get
animations in a lot of areas,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.720
icon animations.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.710
You're going to get shadows and
elevation on standard widgets.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.640
So all of that
stuff is for free.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.860
Then you can choose to opt
into more material design

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.200
capabilities, like custom
animations or activity

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.110
transitions if you want to.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.940
But you don't have to
do all of that stuff.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.416
It's sort of a sliding scale
of how far do you want to go.

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:04.340
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.890
So that's obviously a big
piece, material design.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.330
And users will see it.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.930
Developers need
to understand what

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.474
it is that people will
certainly expect to see, too.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.140
ROMAIN GUY: Developers
should definitely

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.350
go read the guidelines,
because there's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.150
a lot to learn about
what's expected

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.530
in terms of animation--

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.196
NICK BUTCHER: So that
was a conversation

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:23.340
we had previously was is this
something for just designers

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.040
or should developers
really read this?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.593
ROMAIN GUY: Well, yeah.

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:26.470
It's for developers,
but designers

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.290
should understand it as well.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.790
NICK BUTCHER: And vocabulary
is probably something important

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.460
so everybody's on the
same page for that.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.290
Beyond material design, there
must be a few other things.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.090
So Notifications is one of the
first things that users see.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.755
How does that surface in
the API to developers?

00:02:41.755 --> 00:02:43.930
ROMAIN GUY: Well,
there's the new future

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170
of adding the Notifications
on the Lock screen

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.590
so the users can
choose what they

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.780
want to expose on
their Lock screen,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.860
because there's obviously
a privacy concern.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.020
So applications
can tell the system

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.100
if the Notifications should
be Public, Private, or Secret.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.600
And then the user
can decide if they

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.000
want to make private
notifications public

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.450
or if they want to keep
everything private.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.302
So there's a lot around that.

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.760
CHET HAASE: There's new APIs
around colorizing your assets.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.440
So further branding
of your application

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.939
by coloring your
Notification icons.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.355
Sort of minor tweaks on top
of what Notification's already

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:15.950
doing.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.170
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.940
But for the most
part, we're sticking.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.720
And any use of the
existing Notification API

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.224
will just transfer?

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:23.390
CHET HAASE: That just works.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.636
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.344
Everything that used
to work still works.

00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:26.110
It looks better.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.360
NICK BUTCHER: It looks better.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.970
That sounds pretty good.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.330
Concurrent documents.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.220
So one of the things
people will see

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820
is that when they look at
all their applications,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.720
every Chrome page is rendered
as a separate document.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.090
So is that something that's
available to developers

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.590
as well?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.764
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah.

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:44.514
There's a new API.

00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:47.130
Applications can decide
what is a document.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.797
And they have a lot
of control over when

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:50.796
do they start a new
document, how many documents

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.220
do they want to
keep in that list.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.965
And for certain applications,
like Docs or Chrome,

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:57.450
it makes a lot of sense.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.700
It's not going to make as
much sense for other things,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.500
like a media player,
a music player,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.640
but it's up to the developers.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.860
NICK BUTCHER: So one
thing I saw in the release

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.830
notes is the ability to have now
a Chromium-based WebView, which

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.450
was one of the new
things in KitKat.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.030
To have some sort
of a modern WebView

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.279
with a number of new features.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.769
It is now being unbundled in
the sense that it's there,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.407
but it's being updated
outside of the main releases.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:23.990
CHET HAASE: Yeah,
from the Play Store.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.120
NICK BUTCHER: From the
Play Store directly.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.870
CHET HAASE: Right.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.316
So now the WebView
has the ability

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.690
to be updated from
the Play Store

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.400
so you can actually get more
recent updates to WebView

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.917
outside of the standard platform
releases at whatever time

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:34.750
schedule they're at.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.760
NICK BUTCHER: Which
means whenever Chromium

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.180
has this new release with
support for, I don't know,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.504
WebGL or what have you, you
can get it fairly quickly?

00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:46.420
ROMAIN GUY: Well, and
more importantly for bug

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.050
fixes for instance.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.020
NICK BUTCHER: Oh,
and that, of course.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.270
CHET HAASE: Right.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.900
Yeah, I don't know what the
specific plans are, like,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.884
how frequently they
would release it.

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.550
The announcement was more around
the plumbing and the capability

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.590
to actually do the
unbundled releases

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.970
through the Play Store for now.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.803
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:02.070
So any other APIs?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.700
I'll get to runtime
implementation.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.689
ROMAIN GUY: Many APIs.

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:06.480
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.340
I heard 5,000.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.820
It scared be a little
bit, but we certainly

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.267
don't have time to cover
the 4,900 other ones.

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:16.600
Any ones that you want to cover?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.516
ROMAIN GUY: Let's see.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:21.340
I mean, I can talk about
APIs that I like personally.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.785
The ability to run your
PS1, since I think it

00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:25.950
can be very useful to
a lot of applications.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.900
Obviously not all of them.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.350
I also like the unification
of all the media session

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.640
APIs to be able to
control music playback.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.460
Now there's a unified way
of creating a playback

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.240
UI in Notifications, because
now every media player

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.590
has its own way of doing it.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.930
It can be a little
confusing for the users,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.565
but now there's a common style.

00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:47.010
And since applications can
brand their notifications,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.350
it will still look like
your media application.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.910
It's just easier for everybody.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.451
NICK BUTCHER: So something else
you're probably interested in

00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.920
is updates to OpenGL support?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.120
So what's new there?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.820
Is that just a
new rev of OpenGL?

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.612
ROMAIN GUY: Android 5 is
getting OpenGL 3.1, which

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.320
brings a lot of very
interesting features

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.590
to graphics programmers
and game developers.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.130
And also there's
the introduction

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.530
of something called the
Android Extension Pack.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.430
So it basically gathers
20 existing OpenGL Engine

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.950
extensions and packages
as a single one

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.460
so developers are guaranteed
that all of these extensions

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.895
will exist on all
Android 5 devices.

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:25.762
It's easier to
manage them that way.

00:06:25.762 --> 00:06:27.470
NICK BUTCHER: So all
of that, by the way,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.330
is now powered by a new runtime.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.010
So ART is now the
new and only runtime,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.190
and so there's no going
back to Dalvik, right?

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.000
ROMAIN GUY: There's
no going back.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.375
CHET HAASE: Over
their dead body,

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:40.770
I think they would probably say.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.030
Yeah, so ART is
a better runtime,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.196
and it's the only one there.

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:45.545
It allows ahead of
time compilation.

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:49.610
It allows better, much faster,
and smaller pause time GC.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.980
So allocation of objects as
well with collection objects

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.700
is much faster.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.700
It also has the ability
to defragment the heap

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.290
by actually being
a moving collector.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.857
So when your activity
goes in the background,

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:02.440
then that might be
an appropriate time

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.460
for it to actually gather
the objects together,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.260
sort of to create larger spaces
in the heap, which was not

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.720
possible under Dalvik before.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.095
NICK BUTCHER: So does that
actually help you reach, like,

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:14.310
those 60 frames
per second at all?

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.410
Was that a big--

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.665
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:16.165
Yeah.

00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:18.870
Because the more garbage you
allocate, the more objects

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.620
you allocate.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.114
Over time then, the garbage
collectors are going to come in

00:07:22.114 --> 00:07:23.530
and say, well, I
need more memory.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.113
I can't find memory
immediately so I'm

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:27.780
going to have to collect dead
references to actually create

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.760
the room to allocate
more objects.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.394
And that took more
and more time.

00:07:32.394 --> 00:07:34.060
The more fragmented
your heap would get,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.650
the messier things got.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.440
So then you'd see pause times.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.615
If you'd just run
logcat, then you

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:42.710
would see pause times of
easily 10 to 20 milliseconds

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.045
when it would do a
full stop-the-world GC.

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:46.522
And now those pause
times are down

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:47.980
to, like, two or
three milliseconds

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.090
at a time, which
means it brings it

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.440
below that magical barrier
of 16 milliseconds.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.460
16 milliseconds is
the amount of time

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.710
that you have to
do everything to do

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.460
to put the pixels
onto the screen

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.770
in order to maintain
60 frames a second,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.760
say for animations or
other rendering stuff.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.220
So if we can get the pause time
down to such a point where it's

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.636
less significant or not
huger than a single frame

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:13.010
just in and of
itself, then we've

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.590
got a much better chance of
maintaining a smooth frame

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.090
rate.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.280
NICK BUTCHER: So if
people are interested

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.946
in the actual
implementations of the GC,

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:21.400
I would recommend they watch
the Google I/O sessions

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.369
that go into very much detail--

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.660
CHET HAASE: As well as the
Android Developers Backstage

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.710
Podcast.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.800
We had a two-parter, because
I was so into the runtime

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.289
that we talked to
Anwar for much longer

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.740
than we were supposed to.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.850
NICK BUTCHER: I listened
to both parts, actually.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.820
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.640
NICK BUTCHER: So it
was interesting enough

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.514
for me to go until the
end of the second part

00:08:39.514 --> 00:08:43.630
so I do encourage people to
listen to that one as well.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.570
So let's see, Project
Volta battery usage.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.960
Is that just an internal thing.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.430
So we gather statistics
and we learn from it

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.159
then you guys can do stuff?

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.200
Or is it something exposed
to developers as well?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.880
ROMAIN GUY: Well, it's
similar to what we did before

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.754
with Project Butter and
Project Svelte, which

00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.184
was an internal project
gathering a lot of statistics

00:09:00.184 --> 00:09:02.100
to understand what was
going on in the system,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.380
obviously fixing the problems
as they were identified,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.750
and then making available
the tools that were built

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.430
for internal use
to all developers.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.610
So there is something called
the Battery Historian,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.450
it's on github.com/google, and
it's the tool that was used

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.049
by the Android Team to
find all those issues.

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:21.340
CHET HAASE: It's actually
similar to a lot of the tools

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.500
that we've seen on Android.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.370
Some of them look, you
know, a bit homegrown,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.900
and it's because
they were, right?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.890
So the GPU profiler
stuff, especially the

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.140
on device tools as well
as some of the DDMS tools,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.890
you actually wrote
because you needed them

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.590
to [INAUDIBLE] the platform
in one way or another.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.590
Like, I personally would
benefit from having

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.480
a tool that showed
me this information.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.810
So you write the
tool, and then there's

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.185
no reason not to push the tool
out there for other people

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:47.082
to benefit from as well.

00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:47.790
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.020
Anything else you want
to mention on maybe,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.710
I don't know, your
favorite feature?

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.230
I know it's like choosing--

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.430
ROMAIN GUY: I mean, Android
5 is a huge release,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.924
and I think everybody should
just go take a look at it.

00:09:58.924 --> 00:10:00.840
There's [INAUDIBLE], you
can run the emulator,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.377
the system images from each
of the devices are available,

00:10:03.377 --> 00:10:04.460
look at the release notes.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.010
I mean, there's
something for everybody.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:06.250
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.791
And we didn't talk
about the devices,

00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:10.430
but there is certainly some
new shiny devices to look at.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.270
A phone, a tablet,
and certainly that

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.410
is a good way to first
experience as a user,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.320
and probably as a
developer they're

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.980
really cool and
powerful devices.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.242
Anything else?

00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:23.200
CHET HAASE: Animations.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.330
Lots of new animations.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.270
That's always a
good thing, right?

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:25.890
ROMAIN GUY: That's
all you care about.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:26.598
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:27.990
Well, it's-- sure.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.490
Yeah.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.847
OK.

00:10:29.847 --> 00:10:30.680
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.080
Well, I guess that's all
the time we have for it.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.680
Thanks, guys.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:32.900
ROMAIN GUY: Thanks.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.250
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.374
NICK BUTCHER: See you soon.

00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:36.170
Bye, everyone.
