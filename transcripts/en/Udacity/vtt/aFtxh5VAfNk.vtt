So, in addition to hostile aggression, we also have what's known as

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:07.518
instrumental aggression. And instrumental aggression occurs when someone acts

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:12.354
aggressively. But in the service of achieving some particular goal. Good

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:17.396
examples of this happen often in sports. So, for instance, in hockey. Let's say

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:21.090
someone body checks someone real hard into the boards. In order to prevent that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.550
person from getting the puck. This is instrumental aggression, because it's

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.511
used in the service of achieving a goal, in this case preventing the guy from

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:33.032
getting the puck. This is different from hostile aggression. Now we're going to

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.429
go to Lauren, for a word on biology and aggression.
