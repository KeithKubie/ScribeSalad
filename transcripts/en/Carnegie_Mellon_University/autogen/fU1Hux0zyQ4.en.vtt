digital cameras that we find work really
well with that equipment to take great

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
well with that equipment to take great

panoramas and what I have in front of me

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
panoramas and what I have in front of me
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460
panoramas and what I have in front of me
is an epic 100 it's very similar to the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
is an epic 100 it's very similar to the
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.870
is an epic 100 it's very similar to the
epic except that it's bigger

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
epic except that it's bigger
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.670
epic except that it's bigger
dimensionally so it's wider and taller

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
dimensionally so it's wider and taller
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.060
dimensionally so it's wider and taller
and it has a slot that moves and I'll be

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
and it has a slot that moves and I'll be
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.080
and it has a slot that moves and I'll be
showing you that so that it can

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
showing you that so that it can
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.660
showing you that so that it can
accommodate larger cameras but for the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
accommodate larger cameras but for the
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.130
accommodate larger cameras but for the
most part the menus are similar and I'm

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
most part the menus are similar and I'm
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.630
most part the menus are similar and I'm
going to stick with this for simplicity

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
going to stick with this for simplicity
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819
going to stick with this for simplicity
to introduce you to the system let's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
to introduce you to the system let's
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380
to introduce you to the system let's
start by talking about the hardware

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
start by talking about the hardware
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900
start by talking about the hardware
itself we call this the robot and then

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
itself we call this the robot and then
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.130
itself we call this the robot and then
you've got the digital camera and all

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
you've got the digital camera and all
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.830
you've got the digital camera and all
together you have the GigaPan system the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
together you have the GigaPan system the
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270
together you have the GigaPan system the
reason we call this a robot is it has

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
reason we call this a robot is it has
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520
reason we call this a robot is it has
moving parts and let me just go through

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
moving parts and let me just go through
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.720
moving parts and let me just go through
those a little bit with you and explain

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
those a little bit with you and explain
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.680
those a little bit with you and explain
it to you first of all what is important

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
it to you first of all what is important
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600
it to you first of all what is important
about the panorama process is you want

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
about the panorama process is you want
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549
about the panorama process is you want
to be able to take your camera and point

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
to be able to take your camera and point
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979
to be able to take your camera and point
it in multiple orientations take

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
it in multiple orientations take
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.869
it in multiple orientations take
pictures one at a time and then later

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
pictures one at a time and then later
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610
pictures one at a time and then later
take all those overlapping pictures and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
take all those overlapping pictures and
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680
take all those overlapping pictures and
put them together into one giant very

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
put them together into one giant very
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450
put them together into one giant very
high-resolution image that's explorable

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
high-resolution image that's explorable
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.330
high-resolution image that's explorable
so this robot needs to be able to hold

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
so this robot needs to be able to hold
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399
so this robot needs to be able to hold
your camera and move it around on the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
your camera and move it around on the
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230
your camera and move it around on the
bottom we have a stepper motor this is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
bottom we have a stepper motor this is
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149
bottom we have a stepper motor this is
called the pan motor you'll notice

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
called the pan motor you'll notice
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.200
called the pan motor you'll notice
actually that on the bottom of this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
actually that on the bottom of this
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.950
actually that on the bottom of this
robot there is a nonstick non-skid

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
robot there is a nonstick non-skid
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410
robot there is a nonstick non-skid
coating that non-skid coating is nice

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
coating that non-skid coating is nice
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880
coating that non-skid coating is nice
because it means you can actually rest

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
because it means you can actually rest
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770
because it means you can actually rest
this on top of an object like a table or

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
this on top of an object like a table or
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109
this on top of an object like a table or
railing in a museum and get pretty good

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
railing in a museum and get pretty good
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.289
railing in a museum and get pretty good
shots even without a tripod so that's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
shots even without a tripod so that's
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880
shots even without a tripod so that's
the pan motor and you can see that when

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
the pan motor and you can see that when
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.760
the pan motor and you can see that when
the robots off I can move it by hand we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
the robots off I can move it by hand we
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069
the robots off I can move it by hand we
have a tilt motor for the pitch of the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
have a tilt motor for the pitch of the
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109
have a tilt motor for the pitch of the
camera and that's right here it's the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
camera and that's right here it's the
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.730
camera and that's right here it's the
same exact thing and it also has a sort

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
same exact thing and it also has a sort
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130
same exact thing and it also has a sort
of non-slip surface on it and I can move

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
of non-slip surface on it and I can move
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139
of non-slip surface on it and I can move
that by hand it's not so easy on the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
that by hand it's not so easy on the
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090
that by hand it's not so easy on the
epic 100 you should be gentle with this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
epic 100 you should be gentle with this
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819
epic 100 you should be gentle with this
on the epic it has a lower gear ratio

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
on the epic it has a lower gear ratio
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.499
on the epic it has a lower gear ratio
and it's easier to move by hand because

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
and it's easier to move by hand because
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.569
and it's easier to move by hand because
it's not designed for as heavy a camera

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
it's not designed for as heavy a camera
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999
it's not designed for as heavy a camera
and the last motor we've got is a servo

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
and the last motor we've got is a servo
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249
and the last motor we've got is a servo
here a servo motor and that has a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
here a servo motor and that has a
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109
here a servo motor and that has a
robotic finger attached to it that's why

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
robotic finger attached to it that's why
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910
robotic finger attached to it that's why
this is a robot so we can push down on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
this is a robot so we can push down on
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889
this is a robot so we can push down on
the shutter to take pictures and that's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
the shutter to take pictures and that's
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080
the shutter to take pictures and that's
of course what makes this such a funny

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
of course what makes this such a funny
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600
of course what makes this such a funny
robot since the only universal way we

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
robot since the only universal way we
 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.999
robot since the only universal way we
have of talking to inexpensive cameras

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
have of talking to inexpensive cameras
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.770
have of talking to inexpensive cameras
is the shutter button it makes a lot of

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
is the shutter button it makes a lot of
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.520
is the shutter button it makes a lot of
sense to be able to put

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
sense to be able to put
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.850
sense to be able to put
that down directly ourselves so a few

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
that down directly ourselves so a few
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410
that down directly ourselves so a few
more things about the robot first of all

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
more things about the robot first of all
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.090
more things about the robot first of all
there is a level bubble here that's very

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
there is a level bubble here that's very
 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.520
there is a level bubble here that's very
useful when you put this on a tripod to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
useful when you put this on a tripod to
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.680
useful when you put this on a tripod to
arrange and make sure that you're as

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
arrange and make sure that you're as
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.270
arrange and make sure that you're as
level as possible so that your panorama

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
level as possible so that your panorama
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.610
level as possible so that your panorama
comes out more or less straight that's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
comes out more or less straight that's
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770
comes out more or less straight that's
important another important point is a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780
important another important point is a
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.559
important another important point is a
connection the servo moves and because

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569
connection the servo moves and because
 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.150
connection the servo moves and because
it moves we have to have this flexible

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
it moves we have to have this flexible
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.000
it moves we have to have this flexible
cable here connecting it to the robot if

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
cable here connecting it to the robot if
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.449
cable here connecting it to the robot if
you're to unplug this it's a cable that

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
you're to unplug this it's a cable that
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.540
you're to unplug this it's a cable that
is just a three pin connector and the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550
is just a three pin connector and the
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.840
is just a three pin connector and the
trick with that is there's an epic

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
trick with that is there's an epic
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.280
trick with that is there's an epic
question which is it's not necessarily

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290
question which is it's not necessarily
 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.530
question which is it's not necessarily
obvious which way to plug it in now the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
obvious which way to plug it in now the
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000
obvious which way to plug it in now the
good news is if you plug it in wrong

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
good news is if you plug it in wrong
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.800
good news is if you plug it in wrong
when you turn the robot on it says

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
when you turn the robot on it says
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.390
when you turn the robot on it says
you've plugged in the cable wrong so

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
you've plugged in the cable wrong so
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
you've plugged in the cable wrong so
then you can try it the other way the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
then you can try it the other way the
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830
then you can try it the other way the
reason this is removable is because on

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
reason this is removable is because on
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.190
reason this is removable is because on
the epic 100 it's actually useful to be

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200
the epic 100 it's actually useful to be
 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.350
the epic 100 it's actually useful to be
able to remove this and then plug in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
able to remove this and then plug in
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.650
able to remove this and then plug in
instead a remote trigger and if you're

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
instead a remote trigger and if you're
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.720
instead a remote trigger and if you're
using a camera like the g11 that we'll

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520
using a camera like the g11 that we'll
be talking about in a bit you can

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
be talking about in a bit you can
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800
be talking about in a bit you can
actually unplug this remove this unit

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
actually unplug this remove this unit
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.710
actually unplug this remove this unit
altogether by unscrewing here and you

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720
altogether by unscrewing here and you
 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.810
altogether by unscrewing here and you
can put the g11 on here you can get the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
can put the g11 on here you can get the
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.250
can put the g11 on here you can get the
cable from us that allows you to connect

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
cable from us that allows you to connect
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.190
cable from us that allows you to connect
directly to the g11 from here and then

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
directly to the g11 from here and then
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.130
directly to the g11 from here and then
your robot will electronically tell the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140
your robot will electronically tell the
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.530
your robot will electronically tell the
g11 to actually take the pictures and so

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
g11 to actually take the pictures and so
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.420
g11 to actually take the pictures and so
that works for the higher-end

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430
that works for the higher-end
 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.410
that works for the higher-end
point-and-shoot cameras that actually

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
point-and-shoot cameras that actually
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.470
point-and-shoot cameras that actually
have remote trigger remote triggers now

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
have remote trigger remote triggers now
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360
have remote trigger remote triggers now
the other interesting thing to know

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
the other interesting thing to know
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.410
the other interesting thing to know
about the system is of course the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
about the system is of course the
 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.199
about the system is of course the
batteries so let's talk about that the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209
batteries so let's talk about that the
 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.360
batteries so let's talk about that the
batteries are in a compartment and those

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
batteries are in a compartment and those
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.340
batteries are in a compartment and those
of you who have used the old beta units

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
of you who have used the old beta units
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.599
of you who have used the old beta units
see that this is quite different from

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609
see that this is quite different from
 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.520
see that this is quite different from
that here we have a pretty easy way of

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
that here we have a pretty easy way of
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410
that here we have a pretty easy way of
taking the batteries in and out there

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420
taking the batteries in and out there
 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.180
taking the batteries in and out there
just double-a batteries the six of them

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190
just double-a batteries the six of them
 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.539
just double-a batteries the six of them
a few words about batteries in general I

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
a few words about batteries in general I
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.890
a few words about batteries in general I
don't recommend that you use alkaline

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
don't recommend that you use alkaline
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.810
don't recommend that you use alkaline
because they don't last very long you're

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820
because they don't last very long you're
 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.250
because they don't last very long you're
only going to get a three or four

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260
only going to get a three or four
 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.569
only going to get a three or four
Panorama is out of alkaline in my

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579
Panorama is out of alkaline in my
 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.680
Panorama is out of alkaline in my
opinion these are really nice

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690
opinion these are really nice
 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.610

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450
each and that's a pretty good battery to
 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.479
each and that's a pretty good battery to
use so you want to go for batteries that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
use so you want to go for batteries that
 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420
use so you want to go for batteries that
have a lot of amp hours on board and you

batteries and when we get to the robot

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650
batteries and when we get to the robot
 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.690
batteries and when we get to the robot
you'll see it actually tells you how

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700
you'll see it actually tells you how
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.490
you'll see it actually tells you how
many volts you have running so you have

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500
many volts you have running so you have
 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.720
many volts you have running so you have
an idea when you're running low on

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730
an idea when you're running low on
 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.700
an idea when you're running low on
battery power you know what I do is I

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710
battery power you know what I do is I
 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.770
battery power you know what I do is I
actually leave the batteries in my

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780
actually leave the batteries in my
 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.020
actually leave the batteries in my
backpack inside of this case but

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030
backpack inside of this case but

separate from the robot when I go hiking
 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.740
separate from the robot when I go hiking
so that there's no chance that the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750
so that there's no chance that the
 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.420
so that there's no chance that the
buttons are going to get hit as I hike

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
buttons are going to get hit as I hike
 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.760

around and turn the thing on and often

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770
around and turn the thing on and often
 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.800
around and turn the thing on and often
I'll get to the panoramic place and then

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
I'll get to the panoramic place and then
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.970
I'll get to the panoramic place and then
I'll actually put the batteries in for

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980
I'll actually put the batteries in for
 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.370
I'll actually put the batteries in for
the shot so that's one nice way to

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380
the shot so that's one nice way to
 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.800
the shot so that's one nice way to
protect yourself so we'll put the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810
protect yourself so we'll put the
 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.750
protect yourself so we'll put the
batteries in and we've talked about the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760
batteries in and we've talked about the
 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.450
batteries in and we've talked about the
lower mechanism of the system it's time

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460
lower mechanism of the system it's time
 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.770
lower mechanism of the system it's time
to talk about one of the most important

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780
to talk about one of the most important
 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.420
to talk about one of the most important
things of all which is actually placing

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
things of all which is actually placing
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.120
things of all which is actually placing
the camera on the robot so I have three

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130
the camera on the robot so I have three
 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.230
the camera on the robot so I have three
different cameras here that I want to

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240
different cameras here that I want to
 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.730
different cameras here that I want to
just talk about briefly and then we'll

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
just talk about briefly and then we'll
 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.990
just talk about briefly and then we'll
use one of the cameras to really go

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000
use one of the cameras to really go
 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.880
use one of the cameras to really go
through all the menus with you these

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890
through all the menus with you these
 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.770
through all the menus with you these
three cameras happen to be cannons of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780
three cameras happen to be cannons of
 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.750
three cameras happen to be cannons of
course you can use any make of camera on

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760
course you can use any make of camera on
 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.930
course you can use any make of camera on
the GigaPan and the let's start with the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940
the GigaPan and the let's start with the
 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.480
the GigaPan and the let's start with the
smallest one actually this tiny camera

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490
smallest one actually this tiny camera
 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.410
smallest one actually this tiny camera
that I have here is called a it's in the

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420
that I have here is called a it's in the
 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.560
that I have here is called a it's in the
SD series from Canon this is the SD 780

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570
SD series from Canon this is the SD 780
 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.430
SD series from Canon this is the SD 780
is elf it's 12 megapixels and it has I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440
is elf it's 12 megapixels and it has I
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.400
is elf it's 12 megapixels and it has I
think it three times optical zoom the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410
think it three times optical zoom the
 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.170
think it three times optical zoom the
reason this is a great choice is it's

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180
reason this is a great choice is it's
 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.970
reason this is a great choice is it's
one of the smaller cameras from Canon

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980
one of the smaller cameras from Canon
 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.380
one of the smaller cameras from Canon
that doesn't have too much been getting

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390
that doesn't have too much been getting
 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.390
that doesn't have too much been getting
so it's reasonable that way it has some

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
so it's reasonable that way it has some
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.820
so it's reasonable that way it has some
zoom it has pretty high quality optics

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830
zoom it has pretty high quality optics
 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.490
zoom it has pretty high quality optics
and you're able to do some of the most

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500
and you're able to do some of the most
 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.960
and you're able to do some of the most
important things with this camera even

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970
important things with this camera even
 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.130
important things with this camera even
though it's a small point-and-shoot

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140
though it's a small point-and-shoot
 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.560
though it's a small point-and-shoot
camera which is in this case you can put

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570
camera which is in this case you can put
 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.210
camera which is in this case you can put
it in what's called program mode on this

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220
it in what's called program mode on this
 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.820
it in what's called program mode on this
camera and then you can fix the exposure

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830
camera and then you can fix the exposure
 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.370
camera and then you can fix the exposure
and the focus and especially fixing the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380
and the focus and especially fixing the
 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.930
and the focus and especially fixing the
exposure turns out to be really

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940
exposure turns out to be really
 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.450
exposure turns out to be really
important in GigaPan because you want

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
important in GigaPan because you want
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.610
important in GigaPan because you want
all the pictures that you take to have

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620
all the pictures that you take to have
 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.380
all the pictures that you take to have
similar enough exposure that when you

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
similar enough exposure that when you
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.360
similar enough exposure that when you
stitch them all together into one

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
stitch them all together into one
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.580
stitch them all together into one
picture the same sky doesn't look like

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590
picture the same sky doesn't look like
 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.080
picture the same sky doesn't look like
it's different colors and different

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090
it's different colors and different
 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.490
it's different colors and different
brightnesses because that gets really

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500
brightnesses because that gets really
 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.900
brightnesses because that gets really
well it gets ugly

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910
well it gets ugly
 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.690
well it gets ugly
so this is a small camera this is in

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700
so this is a small camera this is in
 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.710
so this is a small camera this is in
fact the camera that we use

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720
fact the camera that we use
 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.500
fact the camera that we use
educationally now at the other end if

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510
educationally now at the other end if
 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.690
educationally now at the other end if
you have an epic 100 it's a rather large

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700
you have an epic 100 it's a rather large
 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.910
you have an epic 100 it's a rather large
unit and it has this particular trick

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920
unit and it has this particular trick
 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.400
unit and it has this particular trick
the plates on which the camera sits

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410
the plates on which the camera sits
 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.490
the plates on which the camera sits
actually comes out and the dimensions of

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500
actually comes out and the dimensions of
 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.659
actually comes out and the dimensions of
this area are quite large

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669
this area are quite large
 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.679
this area are quite large
and so you can put really large

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689
and so you can put really large
 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:42.179
and so you can put really large
point-and-shoot cameras that are

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189
point-and-shoot cameras that are
 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.909
point-and-shoot cameras that are
essentially nearly DSLRs on this this is

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919
essentially nearly DSLRs on this this is
 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:47.189
essentially nearly DSLRs on this this is
a nice example this is a Powershot SX 10

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199
a nice example this is a Powershot SX 10
 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.919
a nice example this is a Powershot SX 10
is it's sort of the successor to the old

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:49.929
is it's sort of the successor to the old
 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.499
is it's sort of the successor to the old
SX 100 series and what's great about

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509
SX 100 series and what's great about
 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.329
SX 100 series and what's great about
these cameras is they have a fantastic

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339
these cameras is they have a fantastic
 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:56.639
these cameras is they have a fantastic
zoom this has a twenty times optical

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:56.649
zoom this has a twenty times optical
 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.009
zoom this has a twenty times optical
zoom in fact twenty times optical zoom

00:06:59.009 --> 00:06:59.019
zoom in fact twenty times optical zoom
 

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.859
zoom in fact twenty times optical zoom
is so good that you'll often want to

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:01.869
is so good that you'll often want to
 

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.259
is so good that you'll often want to
decide during your GigaPan shooting do I

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:04.269
decide during your GigaPan shooting do I
 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:05.939
decide during your GigaPan shooting do I
really want to use full zoom or is this

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949
really want to use full zoom or is this
 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.589
really want to use full zoom or is this
180 degree picture something where I

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599
180 degree picture something where I
 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.059
180 degree picture something where I
only really need about half of my zoom

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:09.069
only really need about half of my zoom
 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:12.629
only really need about half of my zoom
so whereas on the small elf you're

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639
so whereas on the small elf you're
 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.249
so whereas on the small elf you're
always going to full zoom it becomes

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259
always going to full zoom it becomes
 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.429
always going to full zoom it becomes
natural and automatic to do that on the

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439
natural and automatic to do that on the
 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.019
natural and automatic to do that on the
camera like this you're really going to

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:19.029
camera like this you're really going to
 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:21.869
camera like this you're really going to
make decisions about zoom because this

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879
make decisions about zoom because this
 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.579
make decisions about zoom because this
is a Canon camera and it's pretty

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:23.589
is a Canon camera and it's pretty
 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.129
is a Canon camera and it's pretty
high-end the menus on it are nearly

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139
high-end the menus on it are nearly
 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.069
high-end the menus on it are nearly
identical to the Powershot g11 and so

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:29.079
identical to the Powershot g11 and so
 

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.269
identical to the Powershot g11 and so
I'm going to use the g11 and I'll talk

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279
I'm going to use the g11 and I'll talk
 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.299
I'm going to use the g11 and I'll talk
about why and that menus that you see on

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:33.309
about why and that menus that you see on
 

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:34.919
about why and that menus that you see on
there transfer extremely well to this

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:34.929
there transfer extremely well to this
 

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:37.559
there transfer extremely well to this
and actually also to the small PowerShot

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:37.569
and actually also to the small PowerShot
 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.469
and actually also to the small PowerShot
ELPH the SD 780 that we talked about so

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479
ELPH the SD 780 that we talked about so
 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.579
ELPH the SD 780 that we talked about so
that's the really large camera and

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:41.589
that's the really large camera and
 

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:44.850
that's the really large camera and
indeed it fits on the epic 100 now the

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860
indeed it fits on the epic 100 now the
 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.659
indeed it fits on the epic 100 now the
camera that were going to be talking

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:45.669
camera that were going to be talking
 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:48.389
camera that were going to be talking
about right now is the g11 this is one

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:48.399
about right now is the g11 this is one
 

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.819
about right now is the g11 this is one
of my favorite cameras from Canon and I

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:50.829
of my favorite cameras from Canon and I
 

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:52.739
of my favorite cameras from Canon and I
like it because it's very compact this

is the best camera that we can recommend

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479
is the best camera that we can recommend
 

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:58.529
is the best camera that we can recommend
for the epic so the epic 100 will fit

00:07:58.529 --> 00:07:58.539
for the epic so the epic 100 will fit
 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:02.100
for the epic so the epic 100 will fit
this nearly DSLR version of the FX 10 is

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.110
this nearly DSLR version of the FX 10 is
 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.029
this nearly DSLR version of the FX 10 is
but the epic doesn't have this

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039
but the epic doesn't have this
 

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:07.859
but the epic doesn't have this
retractable plate and it's actually a

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:07.869
retractable plate and it's actually a
 

00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:09.749
retractable plate and it's actually a
little bit smaller on the inside which

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759
little bit smaller on the inside which
 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.759
little bit smaller on the inside which
is great for hiking but it does fit the

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:11.769
is great for hiking but it does fit the
 

00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:13.109
is great for hiking but it does fit the
Canon G 11 which is an outstanding

00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:13.119
Canon G 11 which is an outstanding
 

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:16.949
Canon G 11 which is an outstanding
camera and I think it reminds me of some

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:16.959
camera and I think it reminds me of some
 

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.329
camera and I think it reminds me of some
of the old SLR s I used to use because

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:18.339
of the old SLR s I used to use because
 

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.419
of the old SLR s I used to use because
it has these dials on top so this is the

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:21.429
it has these dials on top so this is the
 

00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:22.709
it has these dials on top so this is the
camera we're going to use today and I'm

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:22.719
camera we're going to use today and I'm
 

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:24.359
camera we're going to use today and I'm
going to use this camera to show you how

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:24.369
going to use this camera to show you how
 

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:25.949
going to use this camera to show you how
you go about mounting your camera on

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:25.959
you go about mounting your camera on
 

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:28.469
you go about mounting your camera on
your robot so firstly like these side

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479
your robot so firstly like these side
 

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:30.059
your robot so firstly like these side
units because we don't need them to be

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:30.069
units because we don't need them to be
 

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:33.509
units because we don't need them to be
extended for this camera now in putting

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519
extended for this camera now in putting
 

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.129
extended for this camera now in putting
the camera on the robot the first thing

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:35.139
the camera on the robot the first thing
 

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.589
the camera on the robot the first thing
to do is to realize that often there's

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599
to do is to realize that often there's
 

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:39.329
to do is to realize that often there's
some things you need access to before

00:08:39.329 --> 00:08:39.339
some things you need access to before
 

00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:41.909
some things you need access to before
you lock your camera down in particular

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919
you lock your camera down in particular
 

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.009
you lock your camera down in particular
in the case of the g11 the SD card is

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:44.019
in the case of the g11 the SD card is
 

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:46.559
in the case of the g11 the SD card is
down here and the battery is down here I

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:46.569
down here and the battery is down here I
 

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.019
down here and the battery is down here I
almost always use at least a four

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:49.029
almost always use at least a four
 

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.210
almost always use at least a four

something nice and large
 

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.499
something nice and large
because you want to be able to take four

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:55.509
because you want to be able to take four
 

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:56.939
because you want to be able to take four
or five hundred pictures that the

00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:56.949
or five hundred pictures that the
 

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:59.129
or five hundred pictures that the
maximum resolution offered without even

00:08:59.129 --> 00:08:59.139
maximum resolution offered without even
 

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.749
maximum resolution offered without even
worrying about running out of memory and

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:00.759
worrying about running out of memory and
 

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.639
worrying about running out of memory and
of course in this case the batteries

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:02.649
of course in this case the batteries
 

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:05.280
of course in this case the batteries
down here and so between the battery of

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:05.290
down here and so between the battery of
 

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.480
down here and so between the battery of
the camera and the batteries and the

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.490
the camera and the batteries and the
 

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.949
the camera and the batteries and the
panorama I can take something like ten

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
panorama I can take something like ten
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:09.689
panorama I can take something like ten
panoramas and then it's time to change

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:09.699
panoramas and then it's time to change
 

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.389
panoramas and then it's time to change
both batteries out all right let's go

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399
both batteries out all right let's go
 

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.249
both batteries out all right let's go
ahead and look at how to mount this on

00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:14.259
ahead and look at how to mount this on
 

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:17.249
ahead and look at how to mount this on
on the robot there first thing we do is

00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:17.259
on the robot there first thing we do is
 

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:18.840
on the robot there first thing we do is
notice that there's a quarter inch screw

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.850
notice that there's a quarter inch screw
 

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.660
notice that there's a quarter inch screw
on the epoch 100 it's the same on the

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:21.670
on the epoch 100 it's the same on the
 

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.610
on the epoch 100 it's the same on the
epoch and it just slides left and right

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:23.620
epoch and it just slides left and right
 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.949
epoch and it just slides left and right
in the slot that sliding is important

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959
in the slot that sliding is important
 

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:27.600
in the slot that sliding is important
because it lets us adjust the left/right

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:27.610
because it lets us adjust the left/right
 

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.429
because it lets us adjust the left/right
position of the camera we're going to

00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:29.439
position of the camera we're going to
 

00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:31.530
position of the camera we're going to
take the regular quarter inch hole that

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.540
take the regular quarter inch hole that
 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.480
take the regular quarter inch hole that
you might use to mount your camera to a

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:33.490
you might use to mount your camera to a
 

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.519
you might use to mount your camera to a
tripod and instead of mounting to a

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:35.529
tripod and instead of mounting to a
 

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:37.019
tripod and instead of mounting to a
tripod well mount directly to here I

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:37.029
tripod well mount directly to here I
 

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:39.569
tripod well mount directly to here I
like to get the robot arm out of the way

00:09:39.569 --> 00:09:39.579
like to get the robot arm out of the way
 

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.869
like to get the robot arm out of the way
and then I'll turn this so I have some

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:42.879
and then I'll turn this so I have some
 

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.210
and then I'll turn this so I have some
room and I can see what I'm doing and

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220
room and I can see what I'm doing and
 

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.579
room and I can see what I'm doing and
off we go you'll notice that the screw

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:47.589
off we go you'll notice that the screw
 

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:49.290
off we go you'll notice that the screw
is captive so it won't fall out of the

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.300
is captive so it won't fall out of the
 

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.999
is captive so it won't fall out of the
robot way it's not connected to a camera

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:51.009
robot way it's not connected to a camera
 

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:53.189
robot way it's not connected to a camera
which is nice I screw that in part ways

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:53.199
which is nice I screw that in part ways
 

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:54.989
which is nice I screw that in part ways
and this is on a rubberized mount so

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:54.999
and this is on a rubberized mount so
 

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:56.879
and this is on a rubberized mount so
it's pretty safe what's slide very

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:56.889
it's pretty safe what's slide very
 

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:58.920
it's pretty safe what's slide very
easily once I've screwed it in part way

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:58.930
easily once I've screwed it in part way
 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.160
easily once I've screwed it in part way
I'm going to sight the lens to this

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.170
I'm going to sight the lens to this
 

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.319
I'm going to sight the lens to this
diamond and this diamond and this notch

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:04.329
diamond and this diamond and this notch
 

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:06.840
diamond and this diamond and this notch
are important because they represent the

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.850
are important because they represent the
 

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.119
are important because they represent the
center of rotation of the robot so we

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:09.129
center of rotation of the robot so we
 

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:10.499
center of rotation of the robot so we
want the center of the lens to

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:10.509
want the center of the lens to
 

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.840
want the center of the lens to
correspond to that and so now by having

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:12.850
correspond to that and so now by having
 

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.999
correspond to that and so now by having
the slot be loose I can move left and

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:15.009
the slot be loose I can move left and
 

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:15.869
the slot be loose I can move left and
right like that

00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:15.879
right like that
 

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:18.240
right like that
and I'll stop when the center of

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.250
and I'll stop when the center of
 

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.889
and I'll stop when the center of
rotation is roughly right which is about

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:19.899
rotation is roughly right which is about
 

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:23.579
rotation is roughly right which is about
there and then I'll tighten it down so

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:23.589
there and then I'll tighten it down so
 

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.079
there and then I'll tighten it down so
that's one adjustment that we make every

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:25.089
that's one adjustment that we make every
 

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:28.189
that's one adjustment that we make every
time we load the camera onto the robot

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:28.199
time we load the camera onto the robot
 

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:30.990
time we load the camera onto the robot
now let's talk about centering the

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000
now let's talk about centering the
 

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.879
now let's talk about centering the
camera in general as I take pictures

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:32.889
camera in general as I take pictures
 

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.579
camera in general as I take pictures
here I've got you know this GigaPan epic

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:35.589
here I've got you know this GigaPan epic
 

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:36.749
here I've got you know this GigaPan epic
Pro in front of me and then I've got my

00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:36.759
Pro in front of me and then I've got my
 

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:38.600
Pro in front of me and then I've got my
book pay book case further behind and

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.610
book pay book case further behind and
 

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.730
book pay book case further behind and
there's a problem as this pans and tilts

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:41.740
there's a problem as this pans and tilts
 

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.960
there's a problem as this pans and tilts
like that

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:42.970
like that
 

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.290
like that
if the foreground moves relative to the

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:46.300
if the foreground moves relative to the
 

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.699
if the foreground moves relative to the
background that means if there's

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:47.709
background that means if there's
 

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:50.009
background that means if there's
parallax then the pictures aren't going

00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:50.019
parallax then the pictures aren't going
 

00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:51.600
parallax then the pictures aren't going
to stitch together because if I line up

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:51.610
to stitch together because if I line up
 

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.970
to stitch together because if I line up
the pro the book case will be out of

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:53.980
the pro the book case will be out of
 

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.919
the pro the book case will be out of
alignment if I line up the book case the

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:55.929
alignment if I line up the book case the
 

00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:57.960
alignment if I line up the book case the
pro will be out of alignment so it's

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:57.970
pro will be out of alignment so it's
 

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.910
pro will be out of alignment so it's
really important to do your best to

00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920
really important to do your best to
 

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.639
really important to do your best to
cause the camera as it's moving by the

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:02.649
cause the camera as it's moving by the
 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.639
cause the camera as it's moving by the
robot not to induce any parallax now

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:05.649
robot not to induce any parallax now
 

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:07.650
robot not to induce any parallax now
there's something called NPP no power

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:07.660
there's something called NPP no power
 

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.290
there's something called NPP no power
Bax point or the nodal point the idea is

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.300
Bax point or the nodal point the idea is
 

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.110
Bax point or the nodal point the idea is
we want the optical center of the camera

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120
we want the optical center of the camera
 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.260
we want the optical center of the camera
to be what the robot rotates about so

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.270
to be what the robot rotates about so
 

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.520
to be what the robot rotates about so
that nothing moves the environment kind

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:17.530
that nothing moves the environment kind
 

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.630
that nothing moves the environment kind
of like what your eyeball does when you

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640
of like what your eyeball does when you
 

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.340
of like what your eyeball does when you
look around

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.350
look around
 

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.560
look around
so we've already adjusted for the center

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:22.570
so we've already adjusted for the center
 

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.030
so we've already adjusted for the center
of the optics in the left-right

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040
of the optics in the left-right
 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.850
of the optics in the left-right
direction using that diamond now we need

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:26.860
direction using that diamond now we need
 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.700
direction using that diamond now we need
to adjust up down and forward and

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:29.710
to adjust up down and forward and
 

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.090
to adjust up down and forward and
backward we do both up down and forward

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.100
backward we do both up down and forward
 

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.160
backward we do both up down and forward
and backward using a single adjustment

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.170
and backward using a single adjustment
 

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.200
and backward using a single adjustment
system and that's right here on the side

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.210
system and that's right here on the side
 

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.110
system and that's right here on the side
arm so I'm going to unscrew it and show

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120
arm so I'm going to unscrew it and show
 

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.460
arm so I'm going to unscrew it and show
you how that works there is a slot on

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:44.470
you how that works there is a slot on
 

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.220
you how that works there is a slot on
this arm that slides forward and

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.230
this arm that slides forward and
 

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.620
this arm that slides forward and
backward and that lets us make a for apt

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:49.630
backward and that lets us make a for apt
 

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.380
backward and that lets us make a for apt
adjustment at the same time this screw

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.390
adjustment at the same time this screw
 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.930
adjustment at the same time this screw
isn't in the middle of this disc and so

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:54.940
isn't in the middle of this disc and so
 

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.450
isn't in the middle of this disc and so
by rotating the disc you'll notice that

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:57.460
by rotating the disc you'll notice that
 

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.240
by rotating the disc you'll notice that
the screw moves up and down so I can

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.250
the screw moves up and down so I can
 

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.950
the screw moves up and down so I can
make a vertical adjustment that way and

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:01.960
make a vertical adjustment that way and
 

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.410
make a vertical adjustment that way and
I can move the center of where I'm

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:04.420
I can move the center of where I'm
 

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.380
I can move the center of where I'm
pivoting my for EFT adjustment in the

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.390
pivoting my for EFT adjustment in the
 

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.230
pivoting my for EFT adjustment in the
vertical direction what I want is

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240
vertical direction what I want is
 

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.090
vertical direction what I want is
vertically I want the lenses Center and

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.100
vertically I want the lenses Center and
 

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.040
vertically I want the lenses Center and
the center of this disc to be the same

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.050
the center of this disc to be the same
 

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.400
the center of this disc to be the same
which in this case means roughly right

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:17.410
which in this case means roughly right
 

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.480
which in this case means roughly right
there right about straight with the g11

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:20.490
there right about straight with the g11
 

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.490
there right about straight with the g11
now that's great because in the vertical

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:23.500
now that's great because in the vertical
 

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.490
now that's great because in the vertical
sense that means as I move about I'm not

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.500
sense that means as I move about I'm not
 

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.680
sense that means as I move about I'm not
going to be inducing parallax now let's

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.690
going to be inducing parallax now let's
 

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.120
going to be inducing parallax now let's
talk about the hard one forward and

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.130
talk about the hard one forward and
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.600
talk about the hard one forward and
backward

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:30.610
backward
 

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.610
backward
now I'll give you the bad news first

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:32.620
now I'll give you the bad news first
 

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.620
now I'll give you the bad news first
when we go ahead and tighten this right

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:34.630
when we go ahead and tighten this right
 

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.400
when we go ahead and tighten this right
around here for now the bad news is on a

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.410
around here for now the bad news is on a
 

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.370
around here for now the bad news is on a
camera system that has zoom the fore/aft

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:41.380
camera system that has zoom the fore/aft
 

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.070
camera system that has zoom the fore/aft
nodal point moves depending on how sumed

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.080
nodal point moves depending on how sumed
 

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.530
nodal point moves depending on how sumed
in you are and that's a surprise to some

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.540
in you are and that's a surprise to some
 

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.050
in you are and that's a surprise to some
people so in particular when i zoom in

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.060
people so in particular when i zoom in
 

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.170
people so in particular when i zoom in
all the way like this what happens is I

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.180
all the way like this what happens is I
 

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.510
all the way like this what happens is I
zoom forward and zoom into the picture

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:54.520
zoom forward and zoom into the picture
 

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.150
zoom forward and zoom into the picture
the nodal point moves back and in fact

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160
the nodal point moves back and in fact
 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.440
the nodal point moves back and in fact
it's very close to the back of the

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.450
it's very close to the back of the
 

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.740
it's very close to the back of the
camera whereas if i zoom out pull back

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.750
camera whereas if i zoom out pull back
 

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.750
camera whereas if i zoom out pull back
and get a wide-angle view the nodal

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760
and get a wide-angle view the nodal
 

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.330
and get a wide-angle view the nodal
point moves forward so you will have to

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:06.340
point moves forward so you will have to
 

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.220
point moves forward so you will have to
experiment with your camera and try and

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.230
experiment with your camera and try and
 

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.960
experiment with your camera and try and
find a position for the zoom that you

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:09.970
find a position for the zoom that you
 

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.730
find a position for the zoom that you
typically use now with the g11

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:11.740
typically use now with the g11
 

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.640
typically use now with the g11
I always zoom it in all the way and I

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:14.650
I always zoom it in all the way and I
 

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:15.900
I always zoom it in all the way and I
happen to know that when I'm using then

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:15.910
happen to know that when I'm using then
 

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.430
happen to know that when I'm using then
all the way in the situation like this I

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440
all the way in the situation like this I
 

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.920
all the way in the situation like this I
want the camera pretty far

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:18.930
want the camera pretty far
 

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.650
want the camera pretty far
forward way forward like that so that's

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660
forward way forward like that so that's
 

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.840
forward way forward like that so that's
what I would do on the g11 so the

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:23.850
what I would do on the g11 so the
 

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.760
what I would do on the g11 so the
interesting news is you can actually use

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:25.770
interesting news is you can actually use
 

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.380
interesting news is you can actually use
your eyes to estimate where the nodal

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.390
your eyes to estimate where the nodal
 

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.300
your eyes to estimate where the nodal
point is for aft so when I look in that

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.310
point is for aft so when I look in that
 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.760
point is for aft so when I look in that
lens and zoom in I can actually see what

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:31.770
lens and zoom in I can actually see what
 

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.470
lens and zoom in I can actually see what
looks like the back of the lens to me

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480
looks like the back of the lens to me
 

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.880
looks like the back of the lens to me
your eyes do a really good job of

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:34.890
your eyes do a really good job of
 

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.130
your eyes do a really good job of
estimating where the back is and when

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:37.140
estimating where the back is and when
 

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.320
estimating where the back is and when
you zoom out you'll actually see what

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.330
you zoom out you'll actually see what
 

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.970
you zoom out you'll actually see what
looks like the back of the lens move

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980
looks like the back of the lens move
 

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.730
looks like the back of the lens move
forward so that's pretty cool it's a

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740
forward so that's pretty cool it's a
 

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.900
forward so that's pretty cool it's a
nice way of telling what's going on

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:44.910
nice way of telling what's going on
 

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.540
nice way of telling what's going on
that's one point the second point is you

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:47.550
that's one point the second point is you
 

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.829
that's one point the second point is you
can do research on the Internet and we

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839
can do research on the Internet and we
 

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:50.960
can do research on the Internet and we
have a website even on which we talk

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:50.970
have a website even on which we talk
 

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.460
have a website even on which we talk
about where the nodal point is for

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.470
about where the nodal point is for
 

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.290
about where the nodal point is for
various cameras so there's ways for you

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300
various cameras so there's ways for you
 

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.269
various cameras so there's ways for you
to get more information

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279
to get more information
 

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.579
to get more information
third you can actually experiment so you

00:13:58.579 --> 00:13:58.589
third you can actually experiment so you
 

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:00.590
third you can actually experiment so you
can take your camera put it on a GigaPan

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600
can take your camera put it on a GigaPan
 

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.900
can take your camera put it on a GigaPan
and you can set up a scene where you

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:02.910
and you can set up a scene where you
 

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.250
and you can set up a scene where you
have something close in something far

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260
have something close in something far
 

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.820
have something close in something far
away and you can literally move the

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:07.830
away and you can literally move the
 

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.530
away and you can literally move the
robot back and forth taking care that

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540
robot back and forth taking care that
 

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.840
robot back and forth taking care that
you're rotating on the base and you can

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:11.850
you're rotating on the base and you can
 

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.790
you're rotating on the base and you can
see if the handle is moving or not and

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800
see if the handle is moving or not and
 

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.100
see if the handle is moving or not and
you can adjust this until it's clear to

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.110
you can adjust this until it's clear to
 

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.260
you can adjust this until it's clear to
you that the object that's close isn't

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:18.270
you that the object that's close isn't
 

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.820
you that the object that's close isn't
moving relative to the background as you

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.830
moving relative to the background as you
 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.769
moving relative to the background as you
just spin this left and right like that

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:21.779
just spin this left and right like that
 

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.890
just spin this left and right like that
and that works perfectly well to last

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:24.900
and that works perfectly well to last
 

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.980
and that works perfectly well to last
but certainly not least if you're taking

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:27.990
but certainly not least if you're taking
 

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.600
but certainly not least if you're taking
a picture of the Grand Canyon this

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.610
a picture of the Grand Canyon this
 

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.730
a picture of the Grand Canyon this
doesn't matter that is to say if

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740
doesn't matter that is to say if
 

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.840
doesn't matter that is to say if
everything is pretty far away

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:32.850
everything is pretty far away
 

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.510
everything is pretty far away
there is no parallax issue if you close

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:35.520
there is no parallax issue if you close
 

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.340
there is no parallax issue if you close
one eye and move your head around

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
one eye and move your head around
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.510
one eye and move your head around
nothing moves relative to anything else

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:38.520
nothing moves relative to anything else
 

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.790
nothing moves relative to anything else
this is a problem in situation where you

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800
this is a problem in situation where you
 

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.650
this is a problem in situation where you
have a scene where you have quite close

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660
have a scene where you have quite close
 

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.540
have a scene where you have quite close
objects and four objects in the same

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:44.550
objects and four objects in the same
 

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.910
objects and four objects in the same
scene so for instance a flower bed in

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920
scene so for instance a flower bed in
 

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.690
scene so for instance a flower bed in
your backyard or an arboretum or such

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:50.700
your backyard or an arboretum or such
 

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.610
your backyard or an arboretum or such
also this doesn't matter if you have

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620
also this doesn't matter if you have
 

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.560
also this doesn't matter if you have
relatively flat world so if you're in an

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:54.570
relatively flat world so if you're in an
 

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.820
relatively flat world so if you're in an
art museum you're taking pictures of

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:55.830
art museum you're taking pictures of
 

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.890
art museum you're taking pictures of
some beautiful paintings and wall text

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:57.900
some beautiful paintings and wall text
 

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.110
some beautiful paintings and wall text
on the wall everything is roughly the

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120
on the wall everything is roughly the
 

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.550
on the wall everything is roughly the
same distance away it just doesn't

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560
same distance away it just doesn't
 

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.670
same distance away it just doesn't
matter nearly as much so you also should

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680
matter nearly as much so you also should
 

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.050
matter nearly as much so you also should
think about the context and think about

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060
think about the context and think about
 

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.310
think about the context and think about
whether you need to worry about this or

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320
whether you need to worry about this or
 

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.610
whether you need to worry about this or
not that's all we need to discuss for

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620
not that's all we need to discuss for
 

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.500
not that's all we need to discuss for
those adjustments the next one is the

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:12.510
those adjustments the next one is the
 

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.600
those adjustments the next one is the
robot arm so the finger has two

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:14.610
robot arm so the finger has two
 

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.150
robot arm so the finger has two
adjustments one is height in that

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160
adjustments one is height in that
 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.850
adjustments one is height in that
direction and the other allows you to do

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860
direction and the other allows you to do
 

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.650
direction and the other allows you to do
two directions dimensions of adjustment

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660
two directions dimensions of adjustment
 

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.380
two directions dimensions of adjustment
and that's this now for height what I

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:24.390
and that's this now for height what I
 

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.060
and that's this now for height what I
like to do is I like to push up on the

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:26.070
like to do is I like to push up on the
 

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.980
like to do is I like to push up on the
finger and then give myself enough

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:27.990
finger and then give myself enough
 

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.960
finger and then give myself enough
height to get in here and adjust the

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:29.970
height to get in here and adjust the
 

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.970
height to get in here and adjust the
zoom I want to be able to comfortably

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980
zoom I want to be able to comfortably
 

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.870
zoom I want to be able to comfortably
adjust the zoom

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880
adjust the zoom
 

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.189
adjust the zoom
and it's perfectly fine to have two or

00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199
and it's perfectly fine to have two or
 

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.569
and it's perfectly fine to have two or
three centimeters of space here that's

00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579
three centimeters of space here that's
 

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:38.090
three centimeters of space here that's
all right so now I'll go ahead and bear

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100
all right so now I'll go ahead and bear
 

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.120
all right so now I'll go ahead and bear
down on that screw now to actually

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.130
down on that screw now to actually
 

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.579
down on that screw now to actually
adjust so that I'm hitting the actual

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:43.589
adjust so that I'm hitting the actual
 

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:45.680
adjust so that I'm hitting the actual
trigger button head-on what I like to do

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:45.690
trigger button head-on what I like to do
 

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.650
trigger button head-on what I like to do
is Center it push down on the trigger be

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660
is Center it push down on the trigger be
 

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.879
is Center it push down on the trigger be
sure that I'm in the right place and

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:49.889
sure that I'm in the right place and
 

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:55.850
sure that I'm in the right place and
then tighten this down one of the places

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860
then tighten this down one of the places
 

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.470
then tighten this down one of the places
that you'll commonly find people have

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480
that you'll commonly find people have
 

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.680
that you'll commonly find people have
made mistakes with the GigaPan is

00:15:59.680 --> 00:15:59.690
made mistakes with the GigaPan is
 

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.329
made mistakes with the GigaPan is
they'll adjust the robot trigger finger

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339
they'll adjust the robot trigger finger
 

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:04.040
they'll adjust the robot trigger finger
carelessly it'll be right on the edge of

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.050
carelessly it'll be right on the edge of
 

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.019
carelessly it'll be right on the edge of
the button it'll work for the first 40

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:06.029
the button it'll work for the first 40
 

00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:07.400
the button it'll work for the first 40
pictures and then maybe it'll stop

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.410
pictures and then maybe it'll stop
 

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.499
pictures and then maybe it'll stop
working for five pictures and that's a

00:16:09.499 --> 00:16:09.509
working for five pictures and that's a
 

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:11.120
working for five pictures and that's a
shame because they go home they have

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.130
shame because they go home they have
 

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.769
shame because they go home they have
this beautiful 45 picture panorama and

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779
this beautiful 45 picture panorama and
 

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:14.360
this beautiful 45 picture panorama and
the last five pictures never got taken

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.370
the last five pictures never got taken
 

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.759

there's two way to do with that first of

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:16.769
there's two way to do with that first of
 

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:18.889
there's two way to do with that first of
all of course pay attention to the

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899
all of course pay attention to the
 

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:19.790
all of course pay attention to the
trigger button make sure you've

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800
trigger button make sure you've
 

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.920
trigger button make sure you've
tightened this down well second of all

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:21.930
tightened this down well second of all
 

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.199
tightened this down well second of all
and just as important pay attention to

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:24.209
and just as important pay attention to
 

00:16:24.209 --> 00:16:25.129
and just as important pay attention to
the GigaPan while you're taking your

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139
the GigaPan while you're taking your
 

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:26.930
the GigaPan while you're taking your
panorama make sure you're looking and

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940
panorama make sure you're looking and
 

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.300
panorama make sure you're looking and
are assured that in fact the pictures

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.310
are assured that in fact the pictures
 

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.100
are assured that in fact the pictures
are getting taken just when you expect

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.110
are getting taken just when you expect
 

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.680
are getting taken just when you expect
them to be taken so I want to start by

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:33.690
them to be taken so I want to start by
 

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.249
them to be taken so I want to start by
talking about setting up the camera and

00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:36.259
talking about setting up the camera and
 

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:38.090
talking about setting up the camera and
some of the things I'm going to talk

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100
some of the things I'm going to talk
 

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.389
some of the things I'm going to talk
about are setup issues that you need to

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399
about are setup issues that you need to
 

00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:43.370
about are setup issues that you need to
do once you'll have the menu set up

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380
do once you'll have the menu set up
 

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.679
do once you'll have the menu set up
correctly for Jigga panning other issues

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:45.689
correctly for Jigga panning other issues
 

00:16:45.689 --> 00:16:48.199
correctly for Jigga panning other issues
I'm going to talk about are things like

00:16:48.199 --> 00:16:48.209
I'm going to talk about are things like
 

00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:49.670
I'm going to talk about are things like
exposure lock that you're going to have

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680
exposure lock that you're going to have
 

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.990
exposure lock that you're going to have
to do every time you're taking a

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000
to do every time you're taking a
 

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.900
to do every time you're taking a
panorama all over again for that

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:52.910
panorama all over again for that
 

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.090
panorama all over again for that
situation for that specific context so

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100
situation for that specific context so
 

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.889
situation for that specific context so
let's go through background setup first

00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899
let's go through background setup first
 

00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:59.749
let's go through background setup first
and talk about the modes that these

00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759
and talk about the modes that these
 

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.579
and talk about the modes that these
cameras have and what really matters to

00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:01.589
cameras have and what really matters to
 

00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:04.069
cameras have and what really matters to
make a good panorama so now we're going

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079
make a good panorama so now we're going
 

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.380
make a good panorama so now we're going
to talk about the menu and these are the

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:06.390
to talk about the menu and these are the
 

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.520
to talk about the menu and these are the
settings that you're going to make

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:07.530
settings that you're going to make
 

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.230
settings that you're going to make
essentially once and then this will be

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240
essentially once and then this will be
 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.569
essentially once and then this will be
appropriate for all panoramas now I've

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579
appropriate for all panoramas now I've
 

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.980
appropriate for all panoramas now I've
hit the menu button to get to this mode

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:12.990
hit the menu button to get to this mode
 

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.270
hit the menu button to get to this mode
you just hit the menu button to get in

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280
you just hit the menu button to get in
 

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.039
you just hit the menu button to get in
and out of it and so we'll go back into

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:16.049
and out of it and so we'll go back into
 

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:18.199
and out of it and so we'll go back into
menu and I'm going to walk you down the

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:18.209
menu and I'm going to walk you down the
 

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.000
menu and I'm going to walk you down the
menu items that are most important for

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.010
menu items that are most important for
 

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.279
menu items that are most important for
giga panning first of all digital zoom

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:22.289
giga panning first of all digital zoom
 

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:24.529
giga panning first of all digital zoom
let's talk about digital zoom you want

00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:24.539
let's talk about digital zoom you want
 

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:26.809
let's talk about digital zoom you want
it off the reason is you want each

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:26.819
it off the reason is you want each
 

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.039
it off the reason is you want each
picture you take to be as

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:28.049
picture you take to be as
 

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:30.560
picture you take to be as
high-resolution as high fidelity as

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:30.570
high-resolution as high fidelity as
 

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.110
high-resolution as high fidelity as
possible and the digital zoom is simply

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120
possible and the digital zoom is simply
 

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.029
possible and the digital zoom is simply
amplifying the picture without using

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039
amplifying the picture without using
 

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.890
amplifying the picture without using
optics so you want maximum optics

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900
optics so you want maximum optics
 

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.610
optics so you want maximum optics
optical zoom but no digital zoom the

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:40.620
optical zoom but no digital zoom the
 

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.320
optical zoom but no digital zoom the
next one that matters in terms of

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.330
next one that matters in terms of
 

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.270
next one that matters in terms of
autofocus it doesn't matter so much

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280
autofocus it doesn't matter so much
 

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.919
autofocus it doesn't matter so much
because you're often going to be taking

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:45.929
because you're often going to be taking
 

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:46.490
because you're often going to be taking
gig depends with

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500
gig depends with
 

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.100
gig depends with
out-of-focus and there are situations in

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.110
out-of-focus and there are situations in
 

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.140
out-of-focus and there are situations in
which you will use autofocus in a

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:51.150
which you will use autofocus in a
 

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.660
which you will use autofocus in a
situation where you're in that art

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:53.670
situation where you're in that art
 

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.240
situation where you're in that art
museum and everything is flat it makes a

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.250
museum and everything is flat it makes a
 

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.950
museum and everything is flat it makes a
lot of sense to nail the focus and lock

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960
lot of sense to nail the focus and lock
 

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.180
lot of sense to nail the focus and lock
it and I'll show you how to do that on

00:17:59.180 --> 00:17:59.190
it and I'll show you how to do that on
 

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.680
it and I'll show you how to do that on
this camera and other cameras have

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:00.690
this camera and other cameras have
 

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.410
this camera and other cameras have
similar ways to do it in a situation

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:03.420
similar ways to do it in a situation
 

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.820
similar ways to do it in a situation
where you are in that Arboretum and

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:04.830
where you are in that Arboretum and
 

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.440
where you are in that Arboretum and
things are close and far away

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.450
things are close and far away
 

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.390
things are close and far away
autofocus can be good because it's kind

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400
autofocus can be good because it's kind
 

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.250
autofocus can be good because it's kind
of like focus stacking you're taking a

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260
of like focus stacking you're taking a
 

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.640
of like focus stacking you're taking a
picture of the close objects close

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:12.650
picture of the close objects close
 

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.750
picture of the close objects close
focused on it and you're taking a

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760
focused on it and you're taking a
 

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.670
focused on it and you're taking a
picture of the far object far focused on

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:16.680
picture of the far object far focused on
 

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.980
picture of the far object far focused on
it and that can be very useful and we'll

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:18.990
it and that can be very useful and we'll
 

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.210
it and that can be very useful and we'll
talk about that a little bit more when

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220
talk about that a little bit more when
 

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.680
talk about that a little bit more when
we talk about pausing and retaking

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:21.690
we talk about pausing and retaking
 

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.420
we talk about pausing and retaking
because there's nice ways to trick the

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:23.430
because there's nice ways to trick the
 

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:24.620
because there's nice ways to trick the
camera into giving you just the right

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:24.630
camera into giving you just the right
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.140
camera into giving you just the right
focus on each picture the next one that

focus on each picture the next one that
 

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.110
focus on each picture the next one that
matters a whole lot is review I've got

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120
matters a whole lot is review I've got
 

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.450
matters a whole lot is review I've got
review set to two seconds and that is

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460
review set to two seconds and that is
 

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.700
review set to two seconds and that is
good because longer than two seconds

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:34.710
good because longer than two seconds
 

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.130
good because longer than two seconds
gets in the way of picking to give your

pan and attending to what's going on two
 

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.360
pan and attending to what's going on two
seconds gives you enough time so that as

and ruin it should I pause and go back

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900
and ruin it should I pause and go back
 

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.830

behind me on the shelf so what I do at
 

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.960
behind me on the shelf so what I do at
this point is I'll set up the shot first

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:05.970
this point is I'll set up the shot first
 

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.210
this point is I'll set up the shot first
by zooming in all the way making sure I

understand the level of resolution I'm
going to be at and then I'll go in and

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:12.750
going to be at and then I'll go in and
 

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.300
going to be at and then I'll go in and
actually start

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:14.310
actually start

actually see everything and an important
 

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.140
actually see everything and an important
point to make to you is if we look at

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:24.150
point to make to you is if we look at
 

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.570
point to make to you is if we look at
the top of the camera it's an M or

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580
the top of the camera it's an M or
 

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.270
the top of the camera it's an M or

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.200
need as much consistency between the
shots as possible so you have the same

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.210
shots as possible so you have the same
 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.030
shots as possible so you have the same
exposure we want certainly the same

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:35.040
exposure we want certainly the same
 

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.800

white balance otherwise we will get

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:36.810
white balance otherwise we will get
 

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.240
white balance otherwise we will get
different color temperatures and as we

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.250
different color temperatures and as we
 

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.680
different color temperatures and as we
knit knit these together it'll look very

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:39.690
knit knit these together it'll look very
 

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.800
knit knit these together it'll look very
odd so I typically put that in manual

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:42.810
odd so I typically put that in manual
 

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.740
odd so I typically put that in manual
mode I'll typically put the ISO on the

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:45.750
mode I'll typically put the ISO on the
 

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.650
mode I'll typically put the ISO on the
finest level of detail possible these

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:48.660
finest level of detail possible these
 

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.300

small pointin shirts have relatively
 

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.270
small pointin shirts have relatively
small image sensors and so a low ISO is

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280
small image sensors and so a low ISO is
 

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.430
small image sensors and so a low ISO is
particularly meaningful as we talked

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440

about Pro units you can of course use

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600
about Pro units you can of course use
 

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.420
about Pro units you can of course use
much higher ISO values and that's just

00:22:59.420 --> 00:22:59.430
much higher ISO values and that's just
 

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.970
much higher ISO values and that's just

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.170
F 4.5 is as small as it gets as the
f-stop gets and that means that the

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:21.180
f-stop gets and that means that the
 

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.780
f-stop gets and that means that the

digital cameras as you make the iris
really small that means when you make

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:39.810
really small that means when you make
 

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.750
really small that means when you make
the f-stop really large you get into a

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760
the f-stop really large you get into a
 

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.790
the f-stop really large you get into a
diffraction problem and with Giga pans

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:43.800
diffraction problem and with Giga pans
 

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.980
diffraction problem and with Giga pans
you really care about the how

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:45.990
you really care about the how
 

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.260
you really care about the how
crystal-clear that image is as your iris

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:48.270
crystal-clear that image is as your iris
 

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.340
crystal-clear that image is as your iris
gets really small and you get

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.350
gets really small and you get
 

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.840
gets really small and you get
diffraction it gets softer it gets

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:50.850
diffraction it gets softer it gets
 

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.970
diffraction it gets softer it gets
blurrier actually so this is something

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980
blurrier actually so this is something
 

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.680
blurrier actually so this is something
you should experiment with on the g11

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:54.690
you should experiment with on the g11
 

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.790
you should experiment with on the g11
for example I try very hard to never go

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:58.800
for example I try very hard to never go
 

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.900
for example I try very hard to never go
beyond about F 5.6 because you really

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:02.910
beyond about F 5.6 because you really
 

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.250
beyond about F 5.6 because you really
start having significant diffraction

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260
start having significant diffraction
 

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.280
start having significant diffraction
problems and I stay as big as I can but

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:07.290
problems and I stay as big as I can but
 

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.840
problems and I stay as big as I can but
there's a trade-off right because if

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:08.850
there's a trade-off right because if
 

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.570
there's a trade-off right because if
your iris is large then you have very

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580
your iris is large then you have very
 

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.730
your iris is large then you have very
shallow depth of field so especially if

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740
shallow depth of field so especially if
 

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.960
shallow depth of field so especially if
things are close like this and you're

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:14.970
things are close like this and you're
 

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.340
things are close like this and you're
zoomed in all the way it's very

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:16.350
zoomed in all the way it's very
 

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.810
zoomed in all the way it's very
difficult to get everything in focus at

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820
difficult to get everything in focus at
 

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.180
difficult to get everything in focus at
the same time so my preference if

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:20.190
the same time so my preference if
 

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.730
the same time so my preference if
nothing is moving is keep that iris

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:22.740
nothing is moving is keep that iris
 

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.710
nothing is moving is keep that iris
large make the shutter speed nice and

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720
large make the shutter speed nice and
 

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.660
large make the shutter speed nice and
long if I have to now let's talk about

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:26.670
long if I have to now let's talk about
 

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.790
long if I have to now let's talk about
what happens at night because sometimes

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:28.800
what happens at night because sometimes
 

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.830
what happens at night because sometimes
you're going to want to do that and it's

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840
you're going to want to do that and it's
 

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.690
you're going to want to do that and it's
nighttime and you want a big iris and no

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700
nighttime and you want a big iris and no
 

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.100
nighttime and you want a big iris and no
matter what you do you have a 2 or 3

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.110
matter what you do you have a 2 or 3
 

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.080
matter what you do you have a 2 or 3
second exposure so how do you do that

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.090
second exposure so how do you do that
 

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.300
second exposure so how do you do that
well you'll do the 2 or 3 second

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:38.310
well you'll do the 2 or 3 second
 

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.010
well you'll do the 2 or 3 second
exposure but in the situation like that

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020
exposure but in the situation like that
 

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.660
exposure but in the situation like that
I'll do something else

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:41.670
I'll do something else
 

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.080
I'll do something else
actually introduced a two second timer

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.090
actually introduced a two second timer
 

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.220
actually introduced a two second timer
now this is nice because if you have a

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:46.230
now this is nice because if you have a
 

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.470
now this is nice because if you have a
two second timer then you can have a

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480
two second timer then you can have a
 

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.360
two second timer then you can have a
nice long exposure and when you press

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.370
nice long exposure and when you press
 

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.180
nice long exposure and when you press
the button on the camera it waits two

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:53.190
the button on the camera it waits two
 

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.580
the button on the camera it waits two
seconds and then takes a picture by the

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:55.590
seconds and then takes a picture by the
 

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.660
seconds and then takes a picture by the
time it takes a picture there's no

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:56.670
time it takes a picture there's no
 

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.120
time it takes a picture there's no
vibration there's nothing moving and so

00:26:59.120 --> 00:26:59.130
vibration there's nothing moving and so
 

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.590
vibration there's nothing moving and so
that two second timer gives you the

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600
that two second timer gives you the
 

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.080
that two second timer gives you the
chance of everything being still and in

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:03.090
chance of everything being still and in
 

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.640
chance of everything being still and in

photography I find that two-second

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:06.540
photography I find that two-second
 

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.990
photography I find that two-second
exposure is specially useful now I'm

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000
exposure is specially useful now I'm
 

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.890
exposure is specially useful now I'm
going to go ahead and turn off the

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900
going to go ahead and turn off the
 

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.810
going to go ahead and turn off the
two-second exposure so that it takes

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820
two-second exposure so that it takes
 

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.140
two-second exposure so that it takes
pictures instantly for now and so now

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:15.150
pictures instantly for now and so now
 

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.340
pictures instantly for now and so now
what we've got is one twentieth of a

you've identified all those settings

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:22.800
you've identified all those settings
 

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.870
you've identified all those settings
there's one other setting you have to be

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
there's one other setting you have to be
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.970
there's one other setting you have to be
aware of which is the focus we talked

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980
aware of which is the focus we talked
 

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.920
aware of which is the focus we talked
about this a little bit before if you're

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:27.930
about this a little bit before if you're
 

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.940
about this a little bit before if you're
in a scene where everything's at the

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:28.950
in a scene where everything's at the
 

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.520
in a scene where everything's at the
same distance go to manual focus nail

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:31.530
same distance go to manual focus nail
 

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.950

different focuses you can try leaving
autofocus on and see how it does

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240
autofocus on and see how it does
 

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.250
autofocus on and see how it does
although you may find that when you get

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260
although you may find that when you get
 

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.960
although you may find that when you get
to things like the clouds in the sky it

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:44.970
to things like the clouds in the sky it
 

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.940
to things like the clouds in the sky it

acquisition you can pause it go back and
 

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.700
acquisition you can pause it go back and
change the focus setting so you can be

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:52.710
change the focus setting so you can be
 

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.410
change the focus setting so you can be
manual it go to infinity at that point

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:54.420
manual it go to infinity at that point
 

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.030
manual it go to infinity at that point
or you can be an autofocus and switch to

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.040
or you can be an autofocus and switch to
 

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.950
or you can be an autofocus and switch to
manual and go to infinity and then you

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960
manual and go to infinity and then you
 

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.200
manual and go to infinity and then you
can resume taking the panorama on the

can resume taking the panorama on the
 

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.090
can resume taking the panorama on the
blue sky that way so that's an idea for

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100
blue sky that way so that's an idea for
 

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.650
blue sky that way so that's an idea for
dealing with the fact that some places

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:03.660
dealing with the fact that some places
 

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.600
dealing with the fact that some places
should be auto focus and some places you

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:05.610
should be auto focus and some places you
 

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.860
should be auto focus and some places you
want to lock the focus because they

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:06.870
want to lock the focus because they
 

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.870
want to lock the focus because they
don't have enough contrast enough detail

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880
don't have enough contrast enough detail

don't have enough contrast enough detail
for focusing to work well that describes

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:11.850
for focusing to work well that describes
 

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.670
for focusing to work well that describes
everything we need to know about taking

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:13.680
everything we need to know about taking
 

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.640
everything we need to know about taking
the pictures with the camera one of the

the pictures with the camera one of the
 

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.050
the pictures with the camera one of the
important next steps is actually trying

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:18.060
important next steps is actually trying
 

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.350
important next steps is actually trying
it out so I'll take a picture then once

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360
it out so I'll take a picture then once
 

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.760
it out so I'll take a picture then once
I've taken the picture I'll go and look

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:22.770
I've taken the picture I'll go and look
 

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.530
I've taken the picture I'll go and look
at it so I'm going to go to the mode

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:24.540
at it so I'm going to go to the mode
 

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.700
at it so I'm going to go to the mode
where you're looking at the pictures

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:25.710
where you're looking at the pictures
 

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.090
where you're looking at the pictures
I'll zoom in look at it in gory detail

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100
I'll zoom in look at it in gory detail
 

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.970
I'll zoom in look at it in gory detail
and wow I've got a nice picture I'm able

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980
and wow I've got a nice picture I'm able
 

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.990
and wow I've got a nice picture I'm able
to see the little buttons on the

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000
to see the little buttons on the
 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.640
to see the little buttons on the
old-fashioned GigaPan unit quite well

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:34.650
old-fashioned GigaPan unit quite well
 

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.100
old-fashioned GigaPan unit quite well
I'm seeing little chinks in the aluminum

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.110
I'm seeing little chinks in the aluminum
 

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.220
I'm seeing little chinks in the aluminum
so I'll zoom out so now I know that the

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:40.230
so I'll zoom out so now I know that the
 

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.810
so I'll zoom out so now I know that the

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.090
suddenly your two-second exposure is
taking four seconds and then it has to

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100
taking four seconds and then it has to
 

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.520
taking four seconds and then it has to
write the picture to the SD card so you

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:58.530
write the picture to the SD card so you
 

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.280
write the picture to the SD card so you
take four seconds plus something so now

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.290
take four seconds plus something so now
 

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.900
take four seconds plus something so now
the shutter delay needs to go from three

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:02.910
the shutter delay needs to go from three
 

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.400
the shutter delay needs to go from three
seconds which gives you just enough time

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:04.410
seconds which gives you just enough time
 

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.290

the button on the camera so don't worry
 

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.710
the button on the camera so don't worry
about pressing the button for me and

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720
about pressing the button for me and
 

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.330
about pressing the button for me and
that's it picture ordering is another

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:11.340
that's it picture ordering is another
 

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.400
that's it picture ordering is another
really interesting menu let me go ahead

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:13.410
really interesting menu let me go ahead
 

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:14.570
really interesting menu let me go ahead
and enter that and show you what's going

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:14.580
and enter that and show you what's going

on right now we're in column mode and

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460
on right now we're in column mode and
 

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.670
on right now we're in column mode and
column mode means we start the top left

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680
column mode means we start the top left
 

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.100
column mode means we start the top left
we take our picture by running down the

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:22.110
we take our picture by running down the
 

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.020
we take our picture by running down the
column and coming to the right and doing

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.030
column and coming to the right and doing
 

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.180
column and coming to the right and doing
that again so we're taking the picture a

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:26.190
that again so we're taking the picture a
 

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.570
that again so we're taking the picture a
column at a time instead we could

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:29.580
column at a time instead we could
 

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.060
column at a time instead we could
actually choose to take the picture in

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.070
actually choose to take the picture in
 

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.260
actually choose to take the picture in

down or row mode up row mode down means
 

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.380
down or row mode up row mode down means
we store the top and we scribe down row

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:40.390
we store the top and we scribe down row
 

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.850
we store the top and we scribe down row
mode up means we start at the bottom and

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:41.860
mode up means we start at the bottom and
 

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.790
mode up means we start at the bottom and
we scribe up let's talk about why you

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800
we scribe up let's talk about why you
 

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.450
we scribe up let's talk about why you
would want to use these modes typically

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:48.460
would want to use these modes typically
 

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.790
would want to use these modes typically
if you're capturing something where the

motion say a sunset it's very important

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:55.600
motion say a sunset it's very important
 

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.090
motion say a sunset it's very important
to you that the adjacent pictures are

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:57.100
to you that the adjacent pictures are
 

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.030
to you that the adjacent pictures are
taken quickly in rapid succession so row

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040
taken quickly in rapid succession so row
 

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.110
taken quickly in rapid succession so row
mode makes a lot of sense

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:01.120
mode makes a lot of sense
 

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.910
mode makes a lot of sense
in fact I'll often take sunset shots

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920
in fact I'll often take sunset shots
 

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.870
in fact I'll often take sunset shots
with row mode up because as the Sun sets

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880
with row mode up because as the Sun sets
 

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.240
with row mode up because as the Sun sets
the grass in front of the Sun is going

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.250
the grass in front of the Sun is going
 

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.130
the grass in front of the Sun is going
to become dark quickly so when I capture

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:11.140
to become dark quickly so when I capture
 

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.530
to become dark quickly so when I capture
the grass capture the sunset at just the

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:13.540
the grass capture the sunset at just the
 

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.820
the grass capture the sunset at just the
right time and I can even pause it and

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:14.830
right time and I can even pause it and
 

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:15.960
right time and I can even pause it and
then continue it when I get to the

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:15.970
then continue it when I get to the
 

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.310
then continue it when I get to the
horizon at just the right moment and

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:17.320
horizon at just the right moment and
 

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.010
horizon at just the right moment and
then I want to capture the sky as it's

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.020
then I want to capture the sky as it's
 

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.440
then I want to capture the sky as it's
very colorful as the Sun sets and again

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:22.450
very colorful as the Sun sets and again
 

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.640
very colorful as the Sun sets and again
you could pause it if you want for fun

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:23.650
you could pause it if you want for fun
 

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.590
you could pause it if you want for fun
wait for the color of the sky to start

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:25.600
wait for the color of the sky to start
 

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.420
wait for the color of the sky to start
to become quite saturated and then take

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:27.430
to become quite saturated and then take
 

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.590
to become quite saturated and then take
the pictures by the same token row mode

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:31.600
the pictures by the same token row mode
 

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.910

is really useful if you're looking at a

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920
is really useful if you're looking at a
 

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.890
is really useful if you're looking at a
really crowded situation like a baseball

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:34.900
really crowded situation like a baseball
 

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.260
really crowded situation like a baseball
game and there's motion because people

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:37.270
game and there's motion because people
 

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.250
game and there's motion because people
don't move up and down they move

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:38.260
don't move up and down they move
 

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.530
don't move up and down they move
sideways so the faster you can take the

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:40.540
sideways so the faster you can take the
 

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.440
sideways so the faster you can take the
pictures sideways the better column mode

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.450
pictures sideways the better column mode
 

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:44.520
pictures sideways the better column mode
turns out to be really nice for

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:44.530
turns out to be really nice for
 

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.220
turns out to be really nice for

everything is going to be good so that's
 

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:07.880
everything is going to be good so that's
the picture ordering situation and

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:07.890
the picture ordering situation and
 

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.230
the picture ordering situation and
there's a backlight mode and a motor

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240
there's a backlight mode and a motor

move between pictures
 

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.300
move between pictures
well the question is how did it know how

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:33.310
well the question is how did it know how
 

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.040
well the question is how did it know how
many degrees to move that depends

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.050
many degrees to move that depends
 

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.350
many degrees to move that depends
depending on the camera you use when you

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:37.360
depending on the camera you use when you
 

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.970
depending on the camera you use when you
put it at full zoom you may have to move

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:38.980
put it at full zoom you may have to move
 

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.980
put it at full zoom you may have to move
three degrees you may have to use move

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:40.990
three degrees you may have to use move
 

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.770
three degrees you may have to use move
15 degrees between pictures it's tricky

15 degrees between pictures it's tricky
 

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.840
15 degrees between pictures it's tricky
because you want a jacent pictures to

have some overlap say 30% or so
 

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.470
have some overlap say 30% or so
you don't want 70 or 80% overlap because

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480
you don't want 70 or 80% overlap because
 

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.760
you don't want 70 or 80% overlap because
you're wasting your time and you're

you're wasting your time and you're
 

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.710
you're wasting your time and you're
wasting camera and memory space it's

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720
wasting camera and memory space it's
 

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.840
wasting camera and memory space it's
just too much overlap you don't want too

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:55.850
just too much overlap you don't want too
 

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.850
just too much overlap you don't want too
little overlap because the stitcher

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:57.860
little overlap because the stitcher
 

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.070
little overlap because the stitcher
needs to have enough pixels in common in

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.250
what you do current field of view 10.8
 

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.370
what you do current field of view 10.8
degrees now once you do this a few times

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:27.380
degrees now once you do this a few times
 

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.050
degrees now once you do this a few times
you'll know what the right field of view

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:29.060
you'll know what the right field of view
 

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.760
you'll know what the right field of view
is for your camera I'm going to go ahead

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:30.770
is for your camera I'm going to go ahead
 

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.160
is for your camera I'm going to go ahead
and hit OK to change it it's going to

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.170
and hit OK to change it it's going to
 

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.610
and hit OK to change it it's going to
say use buttons to align horizon with

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:36.620
say use buttons to align horizon with
 

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.500
say use buttons to align horizon with
the top of the camera screen of course

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.510
the top of the camera screen of course
 

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.660
the top of the camera screen of course
first you want to set your camera to

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:40.670
first you want to set your camera to
 

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.010
first you want to set your camera to
whatever zoom you're intending to use

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.020
whatever zoom you're intending to use
 

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.290
whatever zoom you're intending to use
I'm zoomed forward all the way which is

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:44.300
I'm zoomed forward all the way which is
 

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.330
I'm zoomed forward all the way which is
what I want and what I'm going to do is

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:46.340
what I want and what I'm going to do is
 

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.280
what I want and what I'm going to do is
just pick something in the image in this

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.290
just pick something in the image in this
 

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.680
just pick something in the image in this
case the white cable there and I'm going

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:50.690
case the white cable there and I'm going
 

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.450
case the white cable there and I'm going
to set it by going on the up/down button

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:52.460
to set it by going on the up/down button
 

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.070
to set it by going on the up/down button
until it's on the very top of the screen

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.080
until it's on the very top of the screen
 

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.330
until it's on the very top of the screen
then I hit OK and it says reference set

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:57.340
then I hit OK and it says reference set
 

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.380
then I hit OK and it says reference set
then it says use buttons to align the

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.390
then it says use buttons to align the
 

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.330
then it says use buttons to align the
horizon or that object with the bottom

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:04.340
horizon or that object with the bottom
 

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.700
horizon or that object with the bottom
of the camera screen so now I'm simply

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:06.710
of the camera screen so now I'm simply
 

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.260
of the camera screen so now I'm simply
going to use the up button to move that

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.270
going to use the up button to move that
 

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.300
going to use the up button to move that
cable down now as I move that cable down

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.310
cable down now as I move that cable down
 

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.370
cable down now as I move that cable down
in the image it's showing me the current

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:12.380
in the image it's showing me the current
 

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.740
in the image it's showing me the current
degrees field of view as measured by the

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:14.750
degrees field of view as measured by the
 

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.750
degrees field of view as measured by the
stepper motors so right now in 4.2

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760
stepper motors so right now in 4.2
 

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.210
stepper motors so right now in 4.2
degrees there's five point eight degrees

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:19.220
degrees there's five point eight degrees
 

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:19.960
degrees there's five point eight degrees
and so on

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:19.970
and so on
 

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.940
and so on
I'll move the tip of that cable right to

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:21.950
I'll move the tip of that cable right to
 

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.470
I'll move the tip of that cable right to
the bottom of the screen don't worry

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480
the bottom of the screen don't worry
 

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.150
the bottom of the screen don't worry
about overlap it'll compensate for

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160
about overlap it'll compensate for
 

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.460
about overlap it'll compensate for
overlap for you and I'm at eleven point

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:27.470
overlap for you and I'm at eleven point
 

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.410
overlap for you and I'm at eleven point
five degrees maybe I'll go down a little

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:29.420
five degrees maybe I'll go down a little
 

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.860
five degrees maybe I'll go down a little
bit right there eleven point seven

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:32.870
bit right there eleven point seven
 

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.650
bit right there eleven point seven
degrees eleven point five all right we

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:35.660
degrees eleven point five all right we
 

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.030
degrees eleven point five all right we
hit okay so now we've physically

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040
hit okay so now we've physically
 

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.680
hit okay so now we've physically
measured the field of view of the camera

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:41.690
measured the field of view of the camera
 

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.620
measured the field of view of the camera
in the top up-down direction and the

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:44.630
in the top up-down direction and the
 

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.330
in the top up-down direction and the
robot now knows that number that number

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:46.340
robot now knows that number that number
 

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.340
robot now knows that number that number
is remembered by the robot even when you

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.350
is remembered by the robot even when you
 

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.570
is remembered by the robot even when you
turn it off and take the batteries out

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:49.580
turn it off and take the batteries out
 

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.310
turn it off and take the batteries out
so as long as you're using the same

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:51.320
so as long as you're using the same
 

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.470
so as long as you're using the same
camera fully zoomed in on the same robot

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480
camera fully zoomed in on the same robot
 

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.880
camera fully zoomed in on the same robot
you don't have to worry about that

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:54.890
you don't have to worry about that
 

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.130
you don't have to worry about that
number of course something that makes a

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.140
number of course something that makes a
 

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.720
number of course something that makes a
lot of sense is while you're taking

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:58.730
lot of sense is while you're taking
 

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.110
lot of sense is while you're taking
Gigot pans with the can

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:00.120
Gigot pans with the can
 

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.790
Gigot pans with the can
look at the pictures that are getting

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800
look at the pictures that are getting
 

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.890
look at the pictures that are getting
taken find something in the picture and

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900
taken find something in the picture and
 

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.720
taken find something in the picture and
when it goes to the next position make

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:05.730
when it goes to the next position make
 

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.220
when it goes to the next position make
sure what you're seeing is a reasonable

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.230
sure what you're seeing is a reasonable
 

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.450
sure what you're seeing is a reasonable
amount of overlap between the pictures

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460
amount of overlap between the pictures
 

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.450
amount of overlap between the pictures
so again you and your eyeballs and brain

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460
so again you and your eyeballs and brain
 

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.460
so again you and your eyeballs and brain
checking on the robot and making sure

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:13.470
checking on the robot and making sure
 

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.470
checking on the robot and making sure
it's doing the right thing there's no

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480
it's doing the right thing there's no
 

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.860
it's doing the right thing there's no
substitute for that okay that's the set

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:18.870
substitute for that okay that's the set
 

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.990
substitute for that okay that's the set
of GigaPan setups that we need to know

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000
of GigaPan setups that we need to know
 

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.070
of GigaPan setups that we need to know
about so we can actually take a picture

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.080
about so we can actually take a picture
 

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.900
about so we can actually take a picture
I'm going to go ahead and go to the top

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:23.910
I'm going to go ahead and go to the top
 

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.350
I'm going to go ahead and go to the top
level go back to new panoramas and show

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:27.360
level go back to new panoramas and show
 

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.510
level go back to new panoramas and show
you a few more tricks in taking a new

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520
you a few more tricks in taking a new
 

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.480
you a few more tricks in taking a new
panorama so just to review this we're

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:32.490
panorama so just to review this we're
 

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.740
panorama so just to review this we're
going to take a new panorama by making

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:33.750
going to take a new panorama by making
 

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.720
going to take a new panorama by making
sure the robot is ready in this case

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:35.730
sure the robot is ready in this case
 

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.040
sure the robot is ready in this case
it's still got the same exposure

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:37.050
it's still got the same exposure
 

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.290
it's still got the same exposure
settings it had before we're going to

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300
settings it had before we're going to
 

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.030
settings it had before we're going to
hit okay we're going to set the upper

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040
hit okay we're going to set the upper
 

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.660
hit okay we're going to set the upper
left and now let's try and be careful of

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:44.670
left and now let's try and be careful of
 

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.760
left and now let's try and be careful of
focus so we're going to go on the top

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:46.770
focus so we're going to go on the top
 

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:52.040
focus so we're going to go on the top
left of that early GigaPan and it's

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.050
left of that early GigaPan and it's
 

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.780
left of that early GigaPan and it's
going to say set lower right so we go

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:53.790
going to say set lower right so we go
 

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.180
going to say set lower right so we go
down to the bottom right corner of the

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:56.190
down to the bottom right corner of the
 

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.920
down to the bottom right corner of the
GigaPan unit the betta unit on the right

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:57.930
GigaPan unit the betta unit on the right
 

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.230
GigaPan unit the betta unit on the right
I should say the beta unit on the right

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240
I should say the beta unit on the right
 

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.440
I should say the beta unit on the right
so there's a six by three GigaPan and by

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:03.450
so there's a six by three GigaPan and by
 

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.450
so there's a six by three GigaPan and by
the way I'm at the six by three Jeep and

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460
the way I'm at the six by three Jeep and
 

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.990
the way I'm at the six by three Jeep and
that's 18 pictures but it's 18 pictures

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000
that's 18 pictures but it's 18 pictures
 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.160
that's 18 pictures but it's 18 pictures
and we don't have a real feel for

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.170
and we don't have a real feel for
 

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.540
and we don't have a real feel for
whether we're at the very edges of what

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:11.550
whether we're at the very edges of what
 

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.970
whether we're at the very edges of what
it could be at 30 percent overlap I can

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980
it could be at 30 percent overlap I can
 

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:20.710
it could be at 30 percent overlap I can
go down and right all the way to there

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720
 
 

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.870
 
before it goes to 7 by 4 so you can

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880
before it goes to 7 by 4 so you can
 

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.000
before it goes to 7 by 4 so you can
actually play that game if you wish so

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.010
actually play that game if you wish so
 

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:27.770
actually play that game if you wish so
you're capturing the largest space you

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780
you're capturing the largest space you
 

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.590
you're capturing the largest space you
can with those 6 by 3 pictures um what

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:30.600
can with those 6 by 3 pictures um what
 

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.180
can with those 6 by 3 pictures um what
it'll otherwise do is basically squish

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:32.190
it'll otherwise do is basically squish
 

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.920
it'll otherwise do is basically squish
them together to get exactly the top

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:33.930
them together to get exactly the top
 

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.420
them together to get exactly the top
left bottom right corners that you're

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:35.430
left bottom right corners that you're
 

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.430
left bottom right corners that you're
asking for so I'm gonna hit OK on that

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440
asking for so I'm gonna hit OK on that
 

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.350
asking for so I'm gonna hit OK on that
but now I'm going to play a game to make

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:39.360
but now I'm going to play a game to make
 

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.850
but now I'm going to play a game to make
sure I get the best focus that I can

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:40.860
sure I get the best focus that I can
 

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.890
sure I get the best focus that I can
just to show you an example the first

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900
just to show you an example the first
 

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.020
just to show you an example the first
thing it says is show panorama yes or

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.030
thing it says is show panorama yes or
 

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.250
thing it says is show panorama yes or
skip I'm going to say skip I don't want

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260
skip I'm going to say skip I don't want
 

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.590
skip I'm going to say skip I don't want
to see the panorama take 18 pictures yes

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:48.600
to see the panorama take 18 pictures yes
 

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.110
to see the panorama take 18 pictures yes
or cancel I'm going to say yes but now

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.120
or cancel I'm going to say yes but now
 

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.070
or cancel I'm going to say yes but now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to pay

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.080
what I'm going to do is I'm going to pay
 

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.020
what I'm going to do is I'm going to pay
careful attention to the robot as it

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.030
careful attention to the robot as it
 

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.060
careful attention to the robot as it
takes the pictures if the picture looks

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.070
takes the pictures if the picture looks
 

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.140
takes the pictures if the picture looks
focused fine

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:57.150
focused fine
 

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.090
focused fine
I've got auto focus on if the picture

00:41:59.090 --> 00:41:59.100
I've got auto focus on if the picture
 

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.260
I've got auto focus on if the picture
doesn't look focused I'm going to pause

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:00.270
doesn't look focused I'm going to pause
 

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.630
doesn't look focused I'm going to pause
it and show you what I do

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640
it and show you what I do
 

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.450
it and show you what I do
so taking panorama press X to pause

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:04.460
so taking panorama press X to pause
 

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.150
so taking panorama press X to pause
column one row one off it goes and it

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160
column one row one off it goes and it
 

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.120
column one row one off it goes and it
gets a picture in the dark and it's

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.130
gets a picture in the dark and it's
 

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.040
gets a picture in the dark and it's
actually well focused so it goes to the

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.050
actually well focused so it goes to the
 

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:14.620
actually well focused so it goes to the
next position

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:14.630
next position
 

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.620
next position
and gets a good picture and here's a

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:18.630
and gets a good picture and here's a
 

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.150
and gets a good picture and here's a
picture right below my business cards oh

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160
picture right below my business cards oh
 

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.030
picture right below my business cards oh
that was really fuzzy so I'll pause this

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040
that was really fuzzy so I'll pause this
 

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.300
that was really fuzzy so I'll pause this
I paused it but the robots moved on to

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:26.310
I paused it but the robots moved on to
 

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.040
I paused it but the robots moved on to
the next picture so I'm going to go back

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.050
the next picture so I'm going to go back
 

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:31.430
the next picture so I'm going to go back
one to go back to the bad picture so

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440
one to go back to the bad picture so
 

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.720
one to go back to the bad picture so
this is the picture that was bad right

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:32.730
this is the picture that was bad right
 

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.090
this is the picture that was bad right
so what I'm going to do put my hand out

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:35.100
so what I'm going to do put my hand out
 

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.390
so what I'm going to do put my hand out
here make sure that it can focus well by

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400
here make sure that it can focus well by
 

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.690
here make sure that it can focus well by
pushing halfway down and then I'll take

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700
pushing halfway down and then I'll take
 

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.490
pushing halfway down and then I'll take
the picture there we go

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500
the picture there we go
 

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.430
the picture there we go
much better focus and now I'll tell it

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440
much better focus and now I'll tell it
 

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.230
much better focus and now I'll tell it
to continue I'll go forward one to the

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240
to continue I'll go forward one to the
 

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.180
to continue I'll go forward one to the
next position because I took that

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.190
next position because I took that
 

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.400
next position because I took that
picture for it and now I'll hit okay go

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:52.410
picture for it and now I'll hit okay go
 

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.460
picture for it and now I'll hit okay go
ahead and continue taking pictures so

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:55.470
ahead and continue taking pictures so
 

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.940
ahead and continue taking pictures so
don't feel shy about getting in the way

00:42:58.940 --> 00:42:58.950
don't feel shy about getting in the way
 

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:00.980
don't feel shy about getting in the way
of the robot that way making sure that

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:00.990
of the robot that way making sure that
 

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.270
of the robot that way making sure that
is taking a good picture for you

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280
is taking a good picture for you
 

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.710
is taking a good picture for you
now you could even have gone in and

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720
now you could even have gone in and
 

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.790
now you could even have gone in and
changed to manual focus mode now go

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800
changed to manual focus mode now go
 

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.050
changed to manual focus mode now go
ahead and stop this because we don't

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060
ahead and stop this because we don't
 

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.150
ahead and stop this because we don't
actually need all these pictures so now

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160
actually need all these pictures so now
 

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.890
actually need all these pictures so now

to take pictures and we've go over
 

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.380
to take pictures and we've go over
you've gone over the camera now let me

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:27.390
you've gone over the camera now let me
 

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:29.450
you've gone over the camera now let me
just talk about one more advanced issue

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460
just talk about one more advanced issue
 

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.720
just talk about one more advanced issue
which is vignetting and then we're done

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:31.730
which is vignetting and then we're done
 

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.760
which is vignetting and then we're done
so vignette II the problem that you got

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:34.770
so vignette II the problem that you got
 

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:36.380
so vignette II the problem that you got
is that a lot of these cameras including

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:36.390
is that a lot of these cameras including
 

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:37.040
is that a lot of these cameras including
the g11

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.050
the g11
 

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.740
the g11
when you zoom them in all the way

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:38.750
when you zoom them in all the way
 

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.940
when you zoom them in all the way
especially when you have that wide open

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:40.950
especially when you have that wide open
 

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:43.640
especially when you have that wide open
aperture that I said is good which will

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:43.650
aperture that I said is good which will
 

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.530
aperture that I said is good which will
happen is the light beam is coming in

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540
happen is the light beam is coming in
 

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.760
happen is the light beam is coming in
through optics that aren't perfect

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:46.770
through optics that aren't perfect
 

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.110
through optics that aren't perfect
they're not thousands of dollars worth

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.120
they're not thousands of dollars worth
 

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.780
they're not thousands of dollars worth
of optics and there is an imaging chip

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:50.790
of optics and there is an imaging chip
 

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.910
of optics and there is an imaging chip
that is pretty small and the boundaries

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920
that is pretty small and the boundaries
 

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.400
that is pretty small and the boundaries
of the image can be quite dark now this

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.410
of the image can be quite dark now this
 

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.630
of the image can be quite dark now this
isn't typically a problem if you're

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640
isn't typically a problem if you're
 

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.610
isn't typically a problem if you're
taking pictures of grass or forests or

00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:58.620
taking pictures of grass or forests or
 

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.650
taking pictures of grass or forests or
trees or people but if you have

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660
trees or people but if you have
 

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.150
trees or people but if you have
something that's really homogeneous and

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160
something that's really homogeneous and
 

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.220
something that's really homogeneous and
bright in a color but not saturated not

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:07.230
bright in a color but not saturated not
 

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.350
bright in a color but not saturated not
bright white or black so let's say the

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:09.360
bright white or black so let's say the
 

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.170
bright white or black so let's say the
blue sky you got a problem because each

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180
blue sky you got a problem because each
 

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.340
blue sky you got a problem because each
of those pictures that is taking of the

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:13.350
of those pictures that is taking of the
 

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.560
of those pictures that is taking of the
blue sky the middle of it is bright and

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:15.570
blue sky the middle of it is bright and
 

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.870
blue sky the middle of it is bright and
the edges are dark so when the stitcher

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880
the edges are dark so when the stitcher
 

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.500
the edges are dark so when the stitcher
gets done

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.510
gets done
 

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.290
gets done
the picture is splotchy so what you need

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300
the picture is splotchy so what you need
 

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.300
the picture is splotchy so what you need
to do is understand what it takes to

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:23.310
to do is understand what it takes to
 

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.730
to do is understand what it takes to
make vignetting as small as possible a

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740
make vignetting as small as possible a
 

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.589
make vignetting as small as possible a
problem first of all good can

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599
problem first of all good can
 

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:28.880
problem first of all good can
the better the camera the better the

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:28.890
the better the camera the better the
 

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.380
the better the camera the better the
optics often the better the vignetting

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:30.390
optics often the better the vignetting
 

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.609
optics often the better the vignetting
and you can ask that question

00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619
and you can ask that question
 

00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:34.190
and you can ask that question
second of all you can do post-processing

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200
second of all you can do post-processing
 

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.960
second of all you can do post-processing
so you can programmatically go in and

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:35.970
so you can programmatically go in and
 

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.370
so you can programmatically go in and
correct the pictures for vignetting and

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380
correct the pictures for vignetting and
 

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.440
correct the pictures for vignetting and
much more advanced cameras actually have

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:39.450
much more advanced cameras actually have
 

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.029
much more advanced cameras actually have
lenses that are designed to correct with

00:44:41.029 --> 00:44:41.039
lenses that are designed to correct with
 

00:44:41.039 --> 00:44:43.460
lenses that are designed to correct with
an getting third thing you can do

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:43.470
an getting third thing you can do
 

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.650
an getting third thing you can do
keep the aperture a little smaller so

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660
keep the aperture a little smaller so
 

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.170
keep the aperture a little smaller so
try making the aperture smaller see if

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180
try making the aperture smaller see if
 

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.700
try making the aperture smaller see if
that solves part of your problem so that

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:49.710
that solves part of your problem so that
 

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.680
that solves part of your problem so that
you don't have as broad an aperture and

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:51.690
you don't have as broad an aperture and
 

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.329
you don't have as broad an aperture and
as much of a fringe of the lens being

00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339
as much of a fringe of the lens being
 

00:44:53.339 --> 00:44:58.130
as much of a fringe of the lens being
used and those are the kinds of issues

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140
used and those are the kinds of issues
 

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.839
used and those are the kinds of issues
that you need to think about whenever

00:44:59.839 --> 00:44:59.849
that you need to think about whenever
 

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:01.729
that you need to think about whenever
you have that beautiful blue sky and you

00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:01.739
you have that beautiful blue sky and you
 

00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:03.650
you have that beautiful blue sky and you
want to get one beautiful homogeneous

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660
want to get one beautiful homogeneous
 

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.229
want to get one beautiful homogeneous
piece of blue sky captured so good luck

00:45:06.229 --> 00:45:06.239
piece of blue sky captured so good luck
 

00:45:06.239 --> 00:45:07.579
piece of blue sky captured so good luck
with that that's the vignetting problem

00:45:07.579 --> 00:45:07.589
with that that's the vignetting problem
 

00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:09.380
with that that's the vignetting problem
that you'll see remember though that

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.390
that you'll see remember though that
 

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.120
that you'll see remember though that
making your apertures small introduces

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.130
making your apertures small introduces
 

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.549
making your apertures small introduces
the other problem which is diffraction

00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559
the other problem which is diffraction
 

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:15.200
the other problem which is diffraction
so if you make your aperture really

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.210
so if you make your aperture really
 

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.519
so if you make your aperture really
small to try and get away from

00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:16.529
small to try and get away from
 

00:45:16.529 --> 00:45:18.349
small to try and get away from
vignetting eventually you're going to

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359
vignetting eventually you're going to
 

00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:19.609
vignetting eventually you're going to
lose some sharpness because of

00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619
lose some sharpness because of
 

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:21.200
lose some sharpness because of
diffraction so there is a happy medium

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.210
diffraction so there is a happy medium
 

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.019
diffraction so there is a happy medium
and you want to try and forge toward the

00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:24.029
and you want to try and forge toward the
 

00:45:24.029 --> 00:45:26.960
and you want to try and forge toward the
medium as much as possible now the SD

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:26.970
medium as much as possible now the SD
 

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.910

780 is a great educational unit because

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920
780 is a great educational unit because
 

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.700
780 is a great educational unit because
it's inexpensive and it's tiny easy for

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:31.710
it's inexpensive and it's tiny easy for
 

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.799
it's inexpensive and it's tiny easy for
kids to use and I want to show you

00:45:33.799 --> 00:45:33.809
kids to use and I want to show you
 

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:38.299
kids to use and I want to show you
briefly how you fix the exposure and and

00:45:38.299 --> 00:45:38.309
briefly how you fix the exposure and and
 

00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:40.370
briefly how you fix the exposure and and
the focus on this camera because it's

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380
the focus on this camera because it's
 

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.229
the focus on this camera because it's
not quite the same everything else in

00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:42.239
not quite the same everything else in
 

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.209
not quite the same everything else in
the menus is exactly the same but the

00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:44.219
the menus is exactly the same but the
 

00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:45.529
the menus is exactly the same but the
way you fix the exposures is a little

00:45:45.529 --> 00:45:45.539
way you fix the exposures is a little
 

00:45:45.539 --> 00:45:48.049
way you fix the exposures is a little
different and I put it in program mode

00:45:48.049 --> 00:45:48.059
different and I put it in program mode
 

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:49.789
different and I put it in program mode
I'm going to zoom it in all the way

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:49.799
I'm going to zoom it in all the way
 

00:45:49.799 --> 00:45:52.039
I'm going to zoom it in all the way
so in those senses it's very much

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:52.049
so in those senses it's very much
 

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:53.180
so in those senses it's very much
similar to the camera you were using

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:53.190
similar to the camera you were using
 

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.059
similar to the camera you were using
before but here's the trick with fixing

00:45:56.059 --> 00:45:56.069
before but here's the trick with fixing
 

00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:58.130
before but here's the trick with fixing
exposure which again is very important

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140
exposure which again is very important
 

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.839
exposure which again is very important
you always want to fix exposure so on

00:45:59.839 --> 00:45:59.849
you always want to fix exposure so on
 

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:02.239
you always want to fix exposure so on
the SD 780 what you need to notice first

00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:02.249
the SD 780 what you need to notice first
 

00:46:02.249 --> 00:46:04.219
the SD 780 what you need to notice first
of all is there's a little donut here

00:46:04.219 --> 00:46:04.229
of all is there's a little donut here
 

00:46:04.229 --> 00:46:06.319
of all is there's a little donut here
around the function set button now

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:06.329
around the function set button now
 

00:46:06.329 --> 00:46:07.880
around the function set button now
function set and the donut exists on the

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:07.890
function set and the donut exists on the
 

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.380
function set and the donut exists on the
bigger cameras here is just much much

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:09.390
bigger cameras here is just much much
 

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.200
bigger cameras here is just much much
smaller and harder to see and ordinarily

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:12.210
smaller and harder to see and ordinarily
 

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.819
smaller and harder to see and ordinarily
you use the donut to do things like turn

00:46:13.819 --> 00:46:13.829
you use the donut to do things like turn
 

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:15.890
you use the donut to do things like turn
the flash on and off which of course is

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900
the flash on and off which of course is
 

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.650
the flash on and off which of course is
important and turn on the timer and as

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660
important and turn on the timer and as
 

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.209
important and turn on the timer and as
you'll recall the timer is great because

00:46:20.209 --> 00:46:20.219
you'll recall the timer is great because
 

00:46:20.219 --> 00:46:22.400
you'll recall the timer is great because
you can use it to introduce for instance

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:22.410
you can use it to introduce for instance
 

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.900
you can use it to introduce for instance
a two-second delay so that at night you

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:23.910
a two-second delay so that at night you
 

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.989
a two-second delay so that at night you
can get great GigaPan shots the donut is

00:46:26.989 --> 00:46:26.999
can get great GigaPan shots the donut is
 

00:46:26.999 --> 00:46:29.120
can get great GigaPan shots the donut is
also not labeled this way but you can

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:29.130
also not labeled this way but you can
 

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.589
also not labeled this way but you can
use it to lock the exposure and the

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599
use it to lock the exposure and the
 

00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:32.420
use it to lock the exposure and the
focus and that's very important so

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:32.430
focus and that's very important so
 

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:34.489
focus and that's very important so
here's how would you do that we can push

00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:34.499
here's how would you do that we can push
 

00:46:34.499 --> 00:46:38.359
here's how would you do that we can push
down the shutter and then we can push up

00:46:38.359 --> 00:46:38.369
down the shutter and then we can push up
 

00:46:38.369 --> 00:46:40.279
down the shutter and then we can push up
on the top of the donut where there's a

00:46:40.279 --> 00:46:40.289
on the top of the donut where there's a
 

00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:41.180
on the top of the donut where there's a
blue rectangle

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:41.190
blue rectangle
 

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.240
blue rectangle
and it locks the exposure it makes the

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:44.250
and it locks the exposure it makes the
 

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.740
and it locks the exposure it makes the
adjustment itself so it decided one

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:45.750
adjustment itself so it decided one
 

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.470
adjustment itself so it decided one
fifth of a second F 5.8 but the good

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480
fifth of a second F 5.8 but the good
 

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.270
fifth of a second F 5.8 but the good
news is it's locked now so all the

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280
news is it's locked now so all the
 

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.650
news is it's locked now so all the
pictures will be at that same exposure

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660
pictures will be at that same exposure
 

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.839
pictures will be at that same exposure
so you'd have to hunt to find the right

00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:53.849
so you'd have to hunt to find the right
 

00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:55.760
so you'd have to hunt to find the right
place to lock the exposure like that for

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:55.770
place to lock the exposure like that for
 

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.849
place to lock the exposure like that for
your overall panorama to lock focus you
