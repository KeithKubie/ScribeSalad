00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:02.909
- [Instructor] Let's
say I want to multiply

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.909
3.1 or 3 1/10

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.963
times

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:09.227
times 2.4

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.320
which could also be

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.524
described as 2 4/10ths

00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:16.045
so pause the video if you can do this

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:16.968
and once again, I'll give you a hint.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:18.269
See if you can express these

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.352
as fractions.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.000
So there's a couple ways you
can express it as a fraction.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860
You can express this as 3 1/10th

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.693
times

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:30.442
2 4/10ths

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.475
two,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:33.274
let's get the same color,

00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:35.024
2 4/10ths.

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:37.137
Now whenever you're multi

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.225
these are mixed numbers
right over here and

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:43.033
mixed numbers are not the super
straightforward to multiply,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.587
it's easier if they were written as

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.660
what's often known as improper fractions

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.721
but essentially not as mixed numbers.

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.699
So three is the same thing as 30/10ths.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.957
So 30/10ths plus 1/10th,

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:55.790
this is 31

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.895
10ths

00:00:57.895 --> 00:00:59.317
times

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.621
two is the same thing as 20/10ths.

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.424
So 20/10ths plus four is 24/10ths.

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:06.257
24

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:08.716
over 10.

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.252
And hopefully this
makes sense too that 3.1

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:12.924
this three right over here,

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:14.248
this is

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:16.576
30/10ths

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.091
or I can write,

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:19.438
let me write 30/10ths

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:21.823
and that this is 1/10th.

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:24.964
So this total is going to be 31/10ths.

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:26.525
Likewise, this two

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.226
is 20/10ths

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:31.181
plus 4/10th because it's 24/10ths.

00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:33.526
And now we can multiply.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:36.167
So this is going to give us

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:37.915
our denominator's pretty straightforward.

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:39.801
10 times 10 is

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.875
100

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.789
and then 31 times 24, we can multiply

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.490
in the traditional way

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.015
that we're used to
multiplying two digit numbers.

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:48.932
31 times 24

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.847
is going to be equal to

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.620
four times one is four,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.745
four times three is 12,

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.218
now we're gonna be multiplying
in the tenths place.

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:01.907
We're going to put a zero here.

00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:04.304
So two times one is two.

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:06.806
We're really saying 20 times one is 20.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:07.834
But you get the idea.

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.581
Two times one is two.

00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:11.816
Two times three is

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:12.649
six.

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.119
Really 600, because it's 20 times 30.

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.447
But I'm just following the standard multi

00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:19.165
the method for multiplication

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:20.657
then you add these.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:22.694
And you're gonna get four

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:23.803
four

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:25.133
seven.

00:02:25.133 --> 00:02:27.391
So when you multiply
these two things together,

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.808
in the numerator, you get 744

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.209
100ths.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.955
Which can also be expressed as

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.578
this is the same thing as 700ths

00:02:37.578 --> 00:02:39.828
or 700 100ths I should say,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.953
plus 44/100ths

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.019
and 700/100ths,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.184
that's just going to be equal to seven.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:49.624
So this is seven

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.243
plus 44/100ths

00:02:51.243 --> 00:02:53.368
which we could write as

00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:54.201
.44

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.151
that's our seven and 44/100ths.

00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.574
And we would be done.

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:01.913
And you might already be seeing a pattern.

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:05.013
If you just took 31 and
multiplied it by 24,

00:03:05.013 --> 00:03:06.013
you get 744.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:08.223
And notice,

00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:09.622
I have one

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.397
and two digits behind the decimal point.

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:14.249
Notice I have one

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.762
and two digits behind the decimal point.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.910
And so think about
whether that always works.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.139
Think about and why that might work.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.539
If you just multiply the numbers

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.911
as if they didn't have decimals,

00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:25.264
so you would've gotten 744

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:27.551
and you say, I got two
numbers behind the decimal,

00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.838
so my product is going to have two numbers

00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:30.697
behind the decimal,

00:03:30.697 --> 00:03:32.009
why does that work?

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.187
Or does it always work?

00:03:33.187 --> 00:03:34.911
And how does it relate to what we did here

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:37.437
which is converting these things to

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:39.050
improper fractions

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.800
and then multiplying it that way?
