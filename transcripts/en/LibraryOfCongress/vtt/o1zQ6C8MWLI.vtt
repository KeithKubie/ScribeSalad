00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.700
&gt;&gt; Paulette Hasier:
Good morning.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.020
My name is Dr. Paulette
Hasier, and I'm the chief

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.700
of the geography and
math division here

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.000
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.140
I would like to welcome you
and thank you all for coming

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
to the Library of
Congress GIS Day Event.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.490
We are really excited to
share the depth and breadth

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.210
of geospatial tools and data
and how they're being used

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.040
to support Congress and
how they're also being used

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.340
to support the library here.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.590
In this morning's
session you will hear

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.810
from our esteemed Congressional
members and representatives

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.600
from the Congressional
Research Service

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.370
on how GIS data can
inform policy.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.310
In our afternoon session, we
will treat you to a showcase

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.790
of GIS story maps and how this
tool has revolutionized the way

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.210
we support digital humanities
and digital visualization.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.690
I would, however, be remiss
if I did not thank those

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.580
who made this day possible.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.210
I would like to acknowledge
Congressman Takano

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.580
for taking the time out
of his busy schedule

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.780
to give us first-hand
insights on how GIS

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.590
and geospatial data is
being used in Congress.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.020
The GIS Program would not
be possible if it was not

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.990
for the support the
of our OCIO staff,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.280
our GI [inaudible]
staff, and our CRS staff.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.540
Special tanks are extended to
Dr. Mary Mazanec and [inaudible]

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.390
of the Congressional
Research Service

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170
for helping plan this day and
for speaking at the event.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.560
A special thanks to Steve
Kelly and Kathleen Ott

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.140
at the Library Congressional
Relations Office as well

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.610
for their help and guidance.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.760
Also a deep appreciation
for the [inaudible] staff,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.930
especially Laurie [inaudible],
who was helpful in scheduling

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.700
and creating this event for us.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.760
And lastly, I would like
to thank the participants

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.240
of the GIS LOC story
map pilot project,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.090
which you'll see this afternoon,
who brought their curatorial

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.720
and special collections
expertise to the project.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680
And now without further ado, I'd
like to introduce Mark Sweeney,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.020
the acting deputy director
of the Library of Congress

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.430
who will introduce
our keynote speaker,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.900
Representative Mark Takano.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.700
Thank you.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.530
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.830
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
morning, everyone.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.800
Thank you, Paulette.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.030
Members of Congress,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.300
on behalf of the Librarian
of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.750
it's my pleasure to
welcome to you GIS Day

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.430
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.600
Today's activities underscore
the increasing importance

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.110
of geospatial data to the
formulation of public policy

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.270
and execution of
legislative research.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.850
They're also point indicative
of the dramatic changes

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.670
that are occurring
with geospatial data

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.710
and the whole field of
geographic information sciences.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.510
Indeed, it is amazing to see
just how much policymakers,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.840
academics, analysts are now
routinely using geospatial data

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.700
to make sense of our
increasingly complex world.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.530
This is a change of significant
proportions, and I'm proud

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.830
to say that the Library

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.470
of Congress is right there
playing an active role.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.570
A prime example of this is
our new platform called the

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.830
Geospatial Hosting
Environment, GHE for short.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.290
It consists of a
series of data portals

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.900
and software packages
designed to help Congress,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.060
the Congressional
Research Service,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.320
and members of the
public access, understand,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.660
and use the library's
outstanding collection of modern

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.640
and historic geospatial data.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.980
I know you'll be hearing a lot
more about that later on today,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.450
especially in the afternoon.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.750
And now it is my honor

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.910
to introduce this
morning's keynote speaker,

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.390
United States Representative
Mark Takano,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.060
who represents California's
41st District.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.170
He represents the people of
Riverside, Moreno Valley,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.050
Jurupa Valley, and Paris.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.660
He serves as vice-ranking
member of the House Committee

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.130
on Veterans Affairs and is
a member of the Education

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.460
and Workforce Committee
and the Science, Space,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.010
and Technology Committee.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.880
It is highly noteworthy that
immediately after he was elected

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.420
to the House in 2013,
Representative Takano

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.290
and his staff enthusiastically

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.290
and effectively used geospatial
data in connection with a number

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.110
of creative policy studies.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.350
One of them, which was
particularly ground-breaking,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.710
used GIS data to compare
how high school funding

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.640
and household income relate
to academic performance.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.200
I'm delighted that we are now
going to have the opportunity

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.310
to hear about some of the way
the Congressman's office has

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.060
seized upon the opportunities
of GIS data in its work.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.190
So please join me in welcoming
Representative Mark Takano

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.590
to the podium this morning.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.390
Thank you.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:28.670
[ Applause ]

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.000
&gt;&gt; Mark Takano: Well,
happy GIS Day

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
or geographic information
systems day.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.270
Well, thank you for
that introduction.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.660
And thank you to the
Library of Congress

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.440
for hosting this
wonderful event.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.570
And it really is a pleasure
to be with you this morning,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.480
especially among people
who get really excited

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.110
about this software,
the GIS software.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.610
Well, on December
17th, 1903, Orville

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.290
and Wilbur Wright
achieved something

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.590
that no one thought
possible when Orville climbed

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.920
into the cockpit of a plane and
took flight for the first time

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.340
with Wilbur running
alongside him.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.130
And on February 23rd, 1945,
just months before the end

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.390
of World War II, six United
States Marines raised an

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.900
American flag during the fierce
and tragic five-week battle

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.740
of Iwojima, symbolizing the
valor of those who fought

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.370
and conquered a fascist regime.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.880
And on December 24th,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.580
1968 astronaut Bill
Anders pointed his camera

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.110
out of the window of Apollo 8
and captured the Earth rising

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.480
above the moon, putting
our planet and all

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.660
of its inhabitants into
a whole new context.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.370
But what connects
these three moments

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.850
and many others throughout
our history is

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.550
that we only know their glory,
understand their intensity,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.850
and appreciate their beauty

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.670
because they were
captured in visual images.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.540
The power of visual images
to communicate ideas is

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.090
so well accepted
that it's now cliche.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.290
A picture is worth -- well,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.200
I was going to say a
million words [inaudible].

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.130
But it does not diminish the
influence of that imagery --

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.980
it does not -- the fact

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.690
that it's a cliche does
not diminish the influence

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.460
that the images has
on our ability to see

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.410
and believe the truth
about our world.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.980
Now, no one will mistake
the maps we create

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.260
through GIS software for iconic
photographs, but the power

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.680
of images to help people see and
believe the truth still applies.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.070
And in a time when truth can be
hard to come by and even harder

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.400
to communicate, there has
never been a greater need

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.320
for technology that can
present information in the ways

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.100
that persuade us and inspire us.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.840
And that is what first
led me and my office

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.590
to start using GIS
mapping software.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.260
And it's why we continue
to use this software today.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.070
In my first term in office
I wanted to connect with

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.400
and better understand
the business community

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.910
in my district.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.060
And I wanted the business
community to see and understand

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.430
that I was serious
about supporting them.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.590
So my office set
up a listening tour

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.900
that we ambitiously called
100 Businesses in 100 Days.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.220
We didn't quite do
it in 100 days,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.270
but we did visit 100 businesses.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.260
I traveled around the district
asking local business owners

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.720
about their interests,
their goals, and, you know,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.020
what kept them up at night.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.700
And at the of the tour I
could have just listed the 100

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.000
companies I met with

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.310
and provided a short
description of each visit.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.310
I could have written an op ed or
a newsletter announcing the end

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.070
of my tour and then
declaring my findings.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.840
But instead, my staff
used GIS software

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.740
to build an interactive
map of all the businesses

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.940
that I had visited, accompanied
by pictures of my visits.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.270
The simple image of a map
of our district dotted

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.650
with 100 flags representing my
stops sent an important message

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.570
that I was committed to
supporting local businesses

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.660
and to promote the growth
of our local economy.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.120
Now, this is just one way that
GIS has helped me better serve

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.490
and communicate with
my constituents.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.110
The software is helpful not just
in mapping the places I've been

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.270
but mapping where my
constituents are as well.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.340
But as the vice-ranking
member of the House Committee

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.910
on Veterans Affairs, ensuring
our veterans get the care

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.930
and support they have earned
is one of my top priorities.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.680
And it's one of the most
important issues in my district,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.140
which has a large
veterans population.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.090
My office can use
mapping technology to find

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.140
out where the veterans in my
district are clustered so that

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.980
when I host a veteran's event,
I know where it should be held.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.310
We can use it to understand
where veterans live in relation

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.010
to their local VA
healthcare facility

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.520
so we can recognize issues
related to access to care

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.570
and the logistical challenge of
getting to and from facilities.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.290
We can also use it to appreciate
the geographic distribution

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.120
of veterans by gender,
by age, and by income

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.910
so that we can target
local services to the areas

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.990
that need it the most.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.180
Where should we host roundtables

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.730
to connect veterans
with local resources?

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.030
Where should a new VA
healthcare facility be built

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.030
to increase access to care?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.710
Which areas in the community
have the greatest risk

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.980
of veteran homelessness?

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.340
These are all questions that
mapping software can answer.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.470
So, you know, I'm
going to depart

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.620
from my script a little bit,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.300
right now in the Congress
we are considering a bill.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.920
It's called the Air
Act, which would be sort

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.900
of like a [inaudible] for
underutilized VA facilities.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.660
But one thing I would like
to see is a clear map showing

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.930
where those facilities are
-- all the facilities are,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.270
whether they're in red
states, blue states, rural.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.710
I'd like to know -- you know,
we have data from Medicare

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.610
that can tell us about the
quality of care provided

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.690
by the private sector
facilities --

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:34.940
that should be data that we can
map against all the data VA has

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.240
about its own healthcare.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.920
I mean, the government's
rich with data.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.850
And one of the things that
we are, in my opinion,

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.310
is we are pretty transparent
if we have the data.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.110
How is it we're going
to use that data?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.920
That would be enormously
useful in a very current issue

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.960
that we have going on and might
even help us get through some

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.750
of the partisan differences.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.160
I'll speak more about
that in a moment.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.390
So we live in a society and an
economy that's driven by data.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.190
Decisions about commerce,
traffic patterns,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.840
and even baseball strategy
are increasingly using --

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.780
made by using data that did not
exist even a few decades ago.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.280
Our systems learn and
evolve to fit our needs.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.440
The Internet knows
my preferences

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.240
and my hobbies better than
some of my own family members.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.920
And I'm not sure --
and I'm also sure

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.360
that I'm not alone
in that regard.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.920
Yet when it comes to
policy-making in Congress,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.790
that type of data-driven
thinking is almost non-existent.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.190
Anecdotes, partisanship,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.670
and ideology are filling
the void where data belongs.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.490
And we're always
experiencing the consequences

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.630
of not using data.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.800
Programs like GIS can help us
remove the partisan blinders

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.010
and see our challenges
for what they are instead

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.500
of what we want them to be.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.600
Let me give one more example.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.580
The common perception
of public transportation

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.950
in Southern California is
to put it kindly not great.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.750
Because of that, the first
thing people they need to live

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.900
in my region -- that people
think they need in order to live

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.850
in my region is a car.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.790
And because of that, public
officials are hesitant to invest

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.090
in a public transportation
system

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.310
that many folks will
not even consider using.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.750
Now, my office built a map

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.020
of public transportation
in the district.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.560
We found that most neighborhoods
in my community are actually

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.830
within walking distance
of a bus stop.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.240
And we found that by
adding a few more routes

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.700
in specific areas, the public
transportation system would be

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.200
even more accessible

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.410
for a greater number
of my constituents.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.780
Now, these small but important
insights are the difference

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.820
between lazy anecdotal thinking
that keeps us stuck in the past

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.870
and focused data-driven thinking

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.640
that can help us
redefine our future.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.020
Now, these are the insights
that can change the way we think

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.110
of our neighborhoods, our
cities, and our country

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.180
and really can help
us make policies

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.130
that improve the
lives of our citizens.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.360
GIS software and programs like
it put the power of imagery

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.770
to communicate complex
ideas and the power of data

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.860
to transcend our existing
biases into the hands

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.160
of members of Congress.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.970
Now, my office continues
to provide trainings

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.300
and step-by-step instructions
for other offices so that more

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.710
of my colleagues can
use the software.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:32.180
And I hope that by the next
GIS Day I'll have a handful

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.100
of members here with me
describing the innovative ways

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.920
they're using GIS to better
represent their constituents.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.030
I truly appreciate all the
work you do to preserve

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.770
and disseminate accurate
information

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.520
to members and to the public.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.150
And I believe -- and I
believe in your ability

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.180
to help us make better
decisions that will lead

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.810
to stronger communities
and a stronger country.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.500
So thank you for having me
this morning, and thank you

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.800
for all your hard work.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.600
And, again, happy GIS Day.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.400
Thank you.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:20.370
[ Applause ]

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.730
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: Thank you very
much again, Congressman Takano,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.770
for that excellent keynote.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.070
My name is Tim St. Onge.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.960
I'm with the Geography and Map
Division here at the Library

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.260
of Congress, and I'm going
to be guiding us along

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.710
in our program this morning.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.380
So next I'm pleased to
introduce Dr. Mary Mazanec.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.110
She is the director of the
Congressional Research Service.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.080
And she is here with other
members of CRS's GIS team,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.690
who will be discussing the
Congressional Research Services'

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.120
use of GIS to support Congress.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.510
So please welcome Dr. Mazanec.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:58.050
[ Applause ]

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: Good
morning, everyone.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.730
I am very pleased to be here
today to celebrate GIS Day

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.940
at the Library of Congress.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.230
Now, as most of you know,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.680
the Congressional Research
Service works exclusively

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.480
for the Congress.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.340
And we have been doing
so for over a century.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.170
As you may know, we provide
both legal and policy analysis

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.120
on all legislative
issues to committees

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.830
and members and their staff.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.430
And our core values -- our work
is guided by our core values,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.100
which are authoritativeness,
confidentiality,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.690
objectivity, and
non-partisanship.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.140
What you probably don't know is

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.940
that we have been using GIS
technology for over 20 years.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.950
GIS technology has
advanced significantly

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.150
in the course of
the last 20 years.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:05.470
And likewise, our use of GIS in
CRS -- GIS in CRS [Laughs] --

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.220
has also evolved significantly.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:16.190
We have moved from using
it ad hoc for an individual

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.320
on a desktop computer

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:24.230
to actually establishing a GIS
service, which supports all

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.860
of our analysts, attorneys,
and information professionals

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.840
as we do our work for Congress.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.040
And as many of you in the
audience can appreciate,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:40.460
public policy as laid out
by the Congressmen exists

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.160
within geographical boundaries.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:51.240
And this makes GIS a wonderful,
fabulous tool that can be used

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.830
to effectively and
succinctly visualize

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:02.340
and communicate public policy
analysis and very complex ideas.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.170
Now, I'd like to say that the
hallmark of our GIS team in CRS

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.270
and the way we do our
work is collaboration --

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.210
collaboration with those
of you in the Library

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:21.090
that are also using GIS and also
to our colleagues on the Hill.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.380
It is a collaborative
partnership.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:30.240
And from the CRS staff, our
team includes GIS analysts,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.930
research librarians, policy
analysts, and graphic designers.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.960
And we all work together to try
to produce the most informative

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.580
and best product
for the Congress.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.250
So I'm going to stop here
and really turn the program

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.790
over to the CRS experts,
if you can join me,

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.270
who will tell you more
specifics about how we use GIS

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.800
to support the Congress.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.600
Thank you.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.630
[ Applause ]

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:02.930
&gt;&gt; Calvin DeSouza:
Hello, everyone.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.930
I'm Calvin DeSouza, and I'm
going to talk about GIS,

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.740
along with Hannah
Fischer, my coworker.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.740
So to reiterate some of
the things that Mary said,

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.000
here at CRS, whenever we work
on a GIS request, we always want

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.790
to make sure that we find
the most authoritative data

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.440
that we can possible.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.560
So when we do that, we pair up
with a librarian or an analyst

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.190
to start working on a topic,
which can range from any

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.510
of these topics that you
see here on the map --

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.810
not a map, on the screen.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.930
So whenever we work with
a product, we then --

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.230
and finish it, we then take

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.100
to through a multi-separate
view process

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.740
where the results
can be anywhere

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.510
from a confidential memo to
Congressional staff or report,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.590
or other products, or
in-person briefing, or an email,

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.110
sort of telephone
correspondence back and forth.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.600
Topics can range from
an international issue.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.180
So here we have a couple
examples of reference maps

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.300
that we've made for a
couple international issues.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.080
We work with analysts,
get the appropriate data,

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.180
and we start designing
the map to make sure

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.690
that the appropriate
information is on the map

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.990
to easily convey the
information that we want.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.830
We can also work on local
issues where we'll reach

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.440
out to the local
governments to try

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.030
to gather what we
need for the maps.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.630
So it can really
range from anything.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.330
We're willing to work
with you along the way.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.030
What are our type of products?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.360
Sometimes we make maps in
PDF's that we distribute

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.740
to you directly to
Congressional clients.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.870
Sometimes those same
maps are in reports

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.040
that are along with
other products.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.150
Sometimes we do GIS analysis
where the result isn't a map,

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.570
it's actually spreadsheet
of data.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.840
So we've done all this analysis,
and here are the results of it

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.790
in a tabular format that you
can use for other products.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.260
Some Congressional staff,
they're pretty tech-savvy,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.980
and now more people with
the GHE, we have access

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.160
to RJS and RJS Online.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.600
So sometimes some staff want
to do the analysis themselves.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.290
So they don't know where
to get started with data.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.780
So we can gather the data
for them, package it up,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.480
and give it to them so they
can get their analysis started.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.520
And we're happy to
announce that we're getting

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.280
to the process of
interactive maps.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.280
So this is a thing that
we're going to start doing,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.830
including interactive maps
in some of our CRS products.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.040
And later on the line, we're
going to start find a way

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.090
to do confidential
interactive maps [inaudible].

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.880
So what kind of products
do we have?

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.820
Sometimes we have a
simple reference map --

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.560
what countries are part
of the NATO alliance?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.130
So we can make a map if
you're traveling to an area

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.660
and you just want to
see this information's,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.540
what country's a part and
what countries aren't?

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.920
So here's a simple reference
map that we can make.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.120
Next. We also have
industry-specific research.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.520
One of the things here at CRS,
the librarians are pretty good

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.820
about searching for information.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.290
So here's an example of media
outlets in a particular state.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:49.070
So can I get a list of all
the newspapers, magazines,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.510
dailies in my -- say, to
help you with outreach?

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.030
So we can go and get one
of these paper databases,

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.690
digitize it, and then
make a map for it.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.990
And here is the result.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.010
So you may not have access

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.220
to this information,
but at CRS, we do.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.590
One of the great
things that we can do,

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.950
we can help you see how has
legislation changed over time?

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.690
This example we have here,
we have four different areas.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.990
We have the Nevada test site

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.360
where they were testing
nuclear weapons.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.000
And there was proposed
legislation

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.300
that has change over time.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.160
The first area was this dash
box, the next where the hash is

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.130
through the counties, and
then the third were the

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.430
yellow counties.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.360
So you can see there have been
three rounds of legislation.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.130
How has that changed over time?

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.370
And you can see it on paper,
but sometimes seeing it

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.330
as a picture really
helps you visualize.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.850
Another example is possible
impacts of legislation.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.000
Everyone's heard of food
deserts where there's areas

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.430
where there are low
access to food.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.230
But there's no clear definition.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.200
So there are four definitions
of what a food desert is.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.280
So if legislations pass, what
definition are they going to use

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.600
and how will that
affect the constituents?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.090
So we will provide that to
you -- all four examples --

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.040
so you can see which way your
constituents would be affected.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.720
Another thing we can do, we
can map areas of interest.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.660
So here is our participation
-- precipitation --

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.600
participation of
the federal program.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.060
So we can map them up by county,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.660
by congressional
districts, by state.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.980
So you can say here's a
Social Security distribution

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.410
by county throughout
United States.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.080
And then we can also give
you a state-specific map

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.210
so you can compare your
state to other states

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.030
in the products that
we give to you.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.520
This was mentioned earlier,
mapping constituents;

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.230
where do we have high veteran
populations in our states?

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.550
So it's a simple question,
but it's these sort of things

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.850
that we can provide to you.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.330
So you can see instead of
this county, this county,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.390
you can now start
seeing the clusters

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.970
of where we have
high populations

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.990
of whatever our target group
is that we're looking at.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.120
So next I'm going to
turn the presentation

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.420
to my coworker, Hannah.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.700
&gt;&gt; Hannah Fischer: Oh,
thank you so much, Calvin.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.370
Okay. So now I'm going
to give an example

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:07.780
of how we combine the subject
area expertise that our analysts

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.730
and librarians have here at the
Congressional Research Service

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.200
and how we put that
together with GIS

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.940
to evaluate data sources
and to create GIS products

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.080
that are authoritative
and visually compelling

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.170
and that help Congress
navigate exactly those kinds

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.990
of really complex policy issues

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.610
that Representative
Takano mentioned.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.660
So let's go ahead
and get started.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.080
Oh, nope. What were you doing?

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.380
You were just --

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.680
&gt;&gt; Calvin DeSouza: Next.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.980
&gt;&gt; Hannah Fischer: Next?

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.400
Oh. There we go.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.140
All right.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.720
So I'm one member
of the CRS GIS team.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.200
And I happen to be working
with an analyst here

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.570
who works on refugee issues.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:08.810
And she wanted to map all
of the migrants who had died

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.040
in the course of
their migration.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.180
So she pointed me to a data
source that you can see here,

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.870
the Missing Migrants Project.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:26.420
And as you can see, this is a
snapshot from their website.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.150
And they have it kind of
centered on the Mediterranean.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.770
And it's very detailed data.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:37.250
It looks like a latitude
and longitude

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.960
for every migrant death.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.590
And so I said, "All right,
let's go ahead and bring

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.840
that into our GIS and
take a look at it."

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.160
So we brought it in, and the
first thing we did was what we

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.510
know every member of Congress
is immediately going to do,

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.390
which is we went to go
look at the United States.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.180
And when we did that,
we saw that there seemed

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.080
to be these two big
circles that are close to --

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.860
not exactly on but close
to the US/Mexico border.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.460
And that -- that seemed
a little odd to us.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.760
So we said, "All right.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.260
Well, let's take a
closer look at that."

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.750
So we did a little heat
mapping and clicked directly

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.270
on the center of the heat map.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.040
And it said, "Well,
there's 145 migrant deaths

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.290
at this exact location,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.640
this particular longitude
and latitude."

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:47.230
And we thought, "Well, that
just seem very unlikely to us.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.110
Let's look into that
a little bit more."

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:54.250
So we went to look at
the data's methodology.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.960
And indeed, once
which started reading,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.880
they do address that
exact thing.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.710
They have this sentence
in there:

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.050
Data on the US/Mexico border
are compiled based on data

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.110
from the US county
medical examiner's

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.410
and sheriff's offices.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.810
So essentially, data in this
area is collected differently

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.530
than in the rest of the world.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:23.620
They roll it up into these
county medical examiner's

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.590
offices for this area, which
is different than the data --

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.860
excuse me -- in the
rest of the world.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:41.120
Huh. So I remember
working with the analyst --

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.600
[inaudible] is the analyst, and
then our graphic specialist,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.080
Amber Wilhelm, who I
see is also in the room.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:55.050
And all kind of -- we sat
for a moment and thought

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.910
about this and said, "All right.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.670
Well, let's go home,
sleep on it,

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.430
and we'll come back tomorrow
and we'll try again."

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:08.380
So then the next day we came
back and we thought, "All right,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.240
well, maybe what we can
do is we can explain this.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:18.100
We'll come up with some
kind of legend and explain

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.830
that this is a little
bit different

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.130
on the US/Mexico border."

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.670
So here are some
designed legends that kind

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.740
of explain this difference.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.460
And then we looked at
that for a little while.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.670
And then we thought,
"Hmm, you know what?

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.310
I think this data, it just --

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.270
right now it doesn't
meet the CRS standards."

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.920
We take very seriously the idea

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.850
that Congress could
make policy based

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.030
on the information
that we give them.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:29:00.570
And the map as it currently is
could potentially be misleading.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.860
If you didn't go and take a look
and really read the legend here,

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.930
you could kind of
get the wrong idea.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:13.910
So right now I don't think
we can publish this map.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.010
However, I do have good news.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.380
So we were doing this back
at the beginning of 2017.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:28.420
At that time the last full year
of data that we had was 2015.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:32.810
The data for 2016 was similar.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.420
But then for 2017 there
is a new methodology.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.680
So as you can see here,
there's a longitude and latitude

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.290
for each missing migrant
along the US/Mexico border.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.840
So as we get to the end
of 2017, we may be able

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.290
to revisit this issue
and perhaps look

00:29:54.290 --> 00:30:00.540
into providing a product for
Congress in the coming year.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.840
All right.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.100
So other things that we're
looking into for the future

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.680
and that we're doing
at the moment.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.900
So one thing that we're
really trying to do more

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.340
of is we're trying to put more
charts and graphs together

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.990
with maps so that you can
really explore the data

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.720
in multiple different ways and
take a deeper dive into it.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.100
So here we have -- this is
crop cultivation in Kenya.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.420
The dark red colors
correspond to the years

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.760
in which we have the GIS data.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.450
And so providing it in these two
different ways hopefully allows

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.610
the viewer the space to say,
"Oh, okay, I understand this

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.910
in two different ways.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.660
I have a deeper understanding
of this issue now."

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:57.360
Another thing that we're looking
into is just taking a look

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.570
at different kind of charts
and providing the information

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.520
in different kind of ways.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.200
So in this particular
case we're taking a look

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.030
at European population.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.910
As you can imagine,
population can change kind

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.500
of on two different axes.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.560
So you could have what's
called here net migration.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.420
So immigration versus
emigration.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.560
Or you could have
a natural change.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.410
So that's live births
in a country

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.590
versus the deaths in a country.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.390
So we've got all of that
plotted on the chart.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.780
So you could be -- for
instance, you could be Germany.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.530
You could have a big growth rate
despite what is probably a lower

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:45.080
birth rate, and that's due
to that larger net migration.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.920
So you have more immigration
going into the country.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.320
Or conversely, you
could be Albania.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.980
So you have a pretty good birth
rate versus your death rate,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.800
but you have a lot
of emigration.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.310
And so you have a
shrinking population overall.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.670
So then once you
put that together

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:10.120
with a map using the
same color palette,

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.130
then you have two different
ways to explore this.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.200
You have a spatial
way to explore this

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.500
and this other chart -- kind of
new chart way to explore this.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.720
And hopefully a way to
explore this data in lots

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.700
of new and interesting ways.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.370
So as you can see,
our GIS products

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.640
for Congress really follow
along in many of the same ways

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.100
that all of our other
products for Congress do

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.970
and keep the same values.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:47.770
They are authoritative,
objective, and non-partisan.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:53.510
And they are confidential
for the requester.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.060
And hopefully they
allow the requester

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.610
to explore these issues in a --

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:06.180
in new and visually
compelling ways.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.060
All right.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.200
I think we have time
for questions

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.470
if anybody has any questions.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:33.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:38.410
Well, as our director
mentioned, CRS is --

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.310
our work is only for
Congress at this point.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:46.440
So it is -- it is
true that every --

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.360
sometimes our work
does get released

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.740
through Congressional
offices to constituents.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.510
But right now we work
only for Congress.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:18.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.340
Well, it --

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.640
&gt;&gt; Calvin DeSouza: It
depends on the product.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.940
We work with you to
set the deadline.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.240
So as soon as you put in a
request, we give you a call

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.470
and we start figuring
out what can we get

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.770
to you by your deadline?

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.660
Sometimes we may meet your first
deadline with a set of products

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.680
and then we come back
more at a later deadline.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.980
But we can work.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.280
Sometimes it's an
hour turnaround.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.260
We just had a new request
today that we got yesterday.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.560
&gt;&gt; Hannah Fischer: Yeah.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.860

got to get [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Hannah Fischer: Yeah.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.160
So it -- it also is very
much set by the requester.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.120
And they can request
whatever they want to request.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.570
And then we work
within that timeframe.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:05.480
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.800
We absolutely work with
federal agencies for their data.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.980
And I would say that
we also work

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.460
with geography and
maps downstairs.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.830
I see Jackie Nolan
in the audience.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:24.530
She often also gets
the data from agencies.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.810
And we work with her as
well for some of that data.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.860
Jackie, did you want
to say anything?

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.160
Okay [Laughs].

&gt;&gt; Hannah Fischer: Yeah.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.030
&gt;&gt; Calvin DeSouza: And then
our analysts have a good set

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.120
of contacts that they can
reach out to the exact person

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.790
who would be collecting
that data.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.270
So you can go through the
Congressional office to get it,

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.850
but then sometimes
you can reach directly

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:20.560
out to the person
if you know them.

The Esri platform
that we're using is --

what's the word -- flexive?

Is that the word?

Where if we make a map,

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.500
it should be viewable
on iPad or a tablet.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.160
But I think we're designing
mostly for desktop and tablets

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.610
and not for, like, phones.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.510

sometimes the House

and the Senate have
[inaudible] accounts.

Sometimes we can provide them
with the data or get them set

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.540
up on their [inaudible] account

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.950
to make the maps
on their website.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.990
So we can package the
data, give it to them,

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.860
and then they can
serve it up themselves.

the deputy legislative director

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.680
for Senator James
E. Risch of Idaho.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.680
And he will be discussing
the use of GIS in the Senate.

morning, everybody.

Thank you so much for being
able to join us this morning.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.070
It's been a great
interactive discussion already.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.850
Again, my name is Tim Petty.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:32.670
Not only am I a legislative
assistant to Senator Risch,

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:36.350
but I'm also part of a
cochair of a working group.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.920
The Senate GIS Working Group
has actually been functioning

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.300
since about 2011.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.810
Colin and Hannah and a number

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.920
of others have actually
participated on the Senate side.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.910
And now we also have a
House-side working group

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.210
as well.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.500
So it's been a real
pleasure to work with a lot

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.090
of the staff since 2011.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:02.890
And the whole concept behind
putting this together, I --

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.380
originally we were the --

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.100
Senate Risch and actually
Senator Blumenthal were the

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.400
first two cochairs.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.760
And then that staffer left
and we were able to pick

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.170
up Becca Steels from
Senator Wyden.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.290
And so the last two or
three years Senator Wyden

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.200
and Senator Risch were cochairs
of the GIS Working Group.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.570
And so we continue to strive
to just engage the staff

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:30.170
on the Hill on how to
better utilize GIS.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:34.410
The CRS and Library of Congress
has been a fabulous resource

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.850
for us.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.860
As you can only go so far
and have so much time,

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.010
and many times I've
turned over and needed help

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.450
to the CRS to give us support.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.750
So some of the questions

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.600
that were asked was
that's we as staff do.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.280
We come to CRS for the details.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.500
And they've been a
fabulous partner with us.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.740
And so over the last
six or seven years,

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.040
the website that I have here --

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.760
I'm going to talk and
Bonnie's going to help me,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.170
but she's also going to
participate a little bit in part

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.820
of the interactive discussion
of how we're actually using GIS

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.150
for my member and for
our staff and actually

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.640
for the constituents of Idaho.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.200
So most of these different
images, the thumbnail sketches

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:23.350
that you see here are
actually done by a lot

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.480
of the different interns
and/or working with Esri

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.890
to help us put these
different thumbnail sketches

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.200
up of different areas of Idaho.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.640
It's a very popular site for
a lot of our constituents

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.790
to use through the years.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.240
And we actually get a lot
of correspondence back

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.130
from our Idaho constituents
of these resources.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.880
So as Bonnie maybe click on
a few and just kind of open

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.150
up a few, as they open
up, it givens a little bit

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.460
of an idea how we're trying
to incorporate different type

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.550
of information back
to our constituents.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.910
So this website is
actually built and designed

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:59.240
for the purpose for the
constituents of Idaho.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.720
And so as Bonnie works through
those, it gives a little bit

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.670
of an idea of what those entail.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.000
So one of the other
questions that I'll highlight

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.790
as Bonnie brings up
just a really recent --

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:15.130
our latest post that we did,
which is a story map dealing

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.430
with Boulder White-Cloud.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.080
And one of the questions was,

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.150
"Can this actually
be implemented

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.060
to handheld devices
and/or iPhones or iPad?"

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.950
And the answer is yes.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.470
And so if Bonnie open up
the Boulder White-Cloud,

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.900
which I'm going to kind of
go through, as you can see,

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.590
it also operates
right on the iPhone.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.690
And so the tools that we use --

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.410
actually, everything is
underpinning by Esri,

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.320
which actually was able
through the Library of Congress

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.500
to contract so that
every member --

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.160
both House and Senate members
actually have a full access

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.930
to a web-based Esri account
that they can actually utilize.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:59.300
And so when I actually go on,

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.840
build a GIS interactive
discussion,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.110
it immediately gets put
up on my members' website,

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:08.980
but it's all backed in by most
of the authoritative data source

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:14.570
that comes from federal
agencies, and/or data.gov,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.430
and resources that
we've been able

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.430
to gather and post these up.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.210
So with that said, what I want
to do is Bonnie and I are going

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.880
to just kind of quickly go
through how do we interact

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.630
with policy and with GIS?

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.630
And so this was a
long-term project

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:36.220
that my member had been working
on through many congresses.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.220
And this is Boulder
White-Cloud wilderness area.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.030
And so as Bonnie goes
through, you know,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.690
Senator Risch has
had many comments

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.490
on the floor in discussion.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.940
And what which wanted to
do was create a story map

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.180
of the background and
history of how long it took

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.400
for this particular area
within Idaho circled there

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.320
and then blown up a little
bit larger, which is part

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.220
of the western edge of the
Rocky Mountains in Idaho

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:06.680
in the area called Boulder
White-Cloud wilderness area.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.070
So we actually had one of the
interns who came and worked

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:13.930
for the Senator last
fall to actually do a lot

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:18.160
of the documentary and
writing to put this together.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.210
So we incorporated the language

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.160
in the Sawtooth National
Recreational area

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.500
and then built these
different datasets

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.550
on this continuous
area of discussion.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.500
So these three combination areas

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.520
and these three different
color areas talks

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.110
about three different
sections of some legislation

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.840
that took place multiple
Congresses ago.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.950
And then what we tried
to do was go back

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:48.650
and actually collect
these different bills

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:50.990
that were actually
submitted all the way back

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.670
into the 108th Congress.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.590
We're in the 115th now.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.620
Every Congress session's two
years, you can do the math.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.270
We've been working on
this policy project

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.440
for many, many years.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.590
And it gives references,
and you can go in

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:05.950
and actually see the bill

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.990
and then how it has transformed
throughout years from kind

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:14.060
of these big globs of
circles to actually starting

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.170
to put boundaries together.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.810
And then we give this history

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.160
of how those boundaries
were developed.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.370
And then we talked
about the stakeholders.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.730
And so what I would like to
do is just highlight some

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.570
of the stakeholder process.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.110
Because the shareholders,

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.170
through the many years,
were collecting data.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.910
A lot of town hall meetings,
a lot of the discussions

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.870
in this area for the Senator,
as well as the Congressman

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:38.260
that worked on this on both side

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.290
of the aisle really
went through this.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:45.000
And the best part that occurred
was a few years ago we started

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.200
working with the
Governor's Office of Idaho.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.270
And we got them involved
with the participation.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.700
So this actual dataset that
Bonnie's going to be going

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.480
through was working with the
Governor's Office in Idaho

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.780
for them to actually
start building and looking

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.590
at a multipurpose area where
we talked about hiking trails,

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:10.760
and snowmobile trails, and horse
trails, and off-road vehicles,

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.130
as well as areas that would be,
then, designated as wilderness.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.560
So it became a hugely
collaborative

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.920
stakeholder process.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.850
And we use the GIS and
these mapping tools

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:26.670
to allow the different
members, both House and Senate

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.350
and my boss, to actually
taking these devices and go

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.640
out to the town hall
meetings and actually talk

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.010
about the specific
areas of the trails.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.520
You can drill down, you can
open up and look at exactly

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.710
where these different
areas are at

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.650
and then allow the
stakeholders to give input

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:47.390
into what they were looking
at for a legislative bill.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:50.470
And so it just became
a fantastic tool.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:54.990
And so this actual
dataset resides in Idaho

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.370
in the Governor's Office.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:00.170
And so through Bonnie's
help -- and I wanted, yeah,

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.100
to go back in this and ask
Bonnie a few questions of what

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.000
that took so that we could
incorporate their data

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.830
and their dataset as a
state agency to work with --

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:14.280
what it took to work
with, like, Forest Service

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.390
and the federal agencies
to work together

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.060
and those steps that
process through.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.040
So if you want to talk, Bonnie,
a little bit about that process.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.340
&gt;&gt; Sure. Thanks, Tim.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.540
Basically the tools that the
House and the Senate have access

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.120
to allow you to do this sort

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.510
of private collaboration
with other users.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.960
So, for example, using a group

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.840
within the Senate's
online account,

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.550
they can privately collaborate
with the state CIO's office

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:40.780
and share maps and layers
and data back and forth

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.430
without necessarily
making it public, right?

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.420
Eventually that data can
become public, as we see here.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.890
But initially, while these kind

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.320
of policy discussions
were going on, you know,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.840
Tim's office really
just needed access

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.450
to that authoritative
information coming

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.750
from the state level.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.260
So the online tools
that they have access

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.560
to allow them to do that.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.740
And so, really, any
office within the House

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.390
and the Senate can follow
the same sort of model.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.690
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: Thank you, Bonnie.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.620
And that really became
the partnership

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.040
with really effective tools.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.120
And it was Esri and the resource
tools of GIS that give us

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:18.650
that ability to constantly
throughout each of the week go

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.640
through those reiterations
going back and forth --

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.840
where the boundaries were,
where the trails are,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.690
what part of are going
to be wilderness,

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.650
what areas were these
different --

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.530
and the different communities,
then, had the ability to see

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.560
that information, have
access to that information,

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.250
and then talk legibly about
what it is that we could

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.020
and could not do legislatively.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.890
So with those type of resources,

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.800
it really has transformed the
way we're able to now do policy

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.380
with the state agencies,
as well as the counties

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.560
because now the counties
are starting

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.720
to also become fully engaged
with these type of resources

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.980
as well, which when you get
out into those communities,

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.460
it's all about right there

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.220
where the boots are
on the ground, right?

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.950
It's not about what's
going to happen back here.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.710
And so from that, then we
got a final bill passed.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.310
We have web links to the
different members talking

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.750
about the final legislation.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.880
We actually put together
the boundaries,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.520
which looks very
different than the images

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.520
that we had previously, right?

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.280
It really started coming
together with the details

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.930
of what this all entailed.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.180
And then my senator
talking specifically

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.820
about the legislative and the
final bill, which then was able

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:38.080
to go and then President Obama
then signed the legislation

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.380
into law.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.680
And now that's what we have,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.990
the Boulder White-Cloud
wilderness area.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.790
And I love the quote that
we put up here at the end

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.060
with Congressman Mike Simpson.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.750
He said, "How do you
justify making Boulder

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.650
White-Cloud wilderness?"

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:54.950
I said, "I didn't.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:56.320
I don't even try."

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.430
I said, "Go up there
and spend a few nights,

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.170
it justifies itself."

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.180
And that's been the best part
about not only telling a story,

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.710
but it allows, then,
the community

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.400
to really participate
in that process.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.350
So I'm going to stop
there at this point.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:14.370
And see, I think
what we're going

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:16.010
to do is have the
House side, Tim, right?

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.310
And you're going do introduce,

00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.680
and then we'll take some
questions at the end

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.050
for both kind of the House

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.370
and the Senate side
collaboration that takes place.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.170
Thank you.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:34.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.340
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All right.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.500
Thank you, Tim and Bonnie.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.230
So as Tim mentioned,
following the presentation

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.110
from the House we're going
to open up to questions

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:45.570
for both of these groups.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.030
We have microphones on the
sides that we can pass along

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.280
to whoever's asking any question

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.320
so that we can all
hear the question

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.210
so that our video
recording can pick it up.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.970
So next I would like
to introduce Rae Best,

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:03.930
the House librarian,
and Nick Schumate,

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.380
the GIS specialist
in the House Library.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.330
And they will be
discussing the use of GIS

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.180
in the House of Representatives.

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.510
So please welcome Rae
Best and Nick Schumate.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:20.490
[ Applause ]

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:21.790
&gt;&gt; Rae Best: Good morning.

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.350
We're going to go ahead
and discuss the House

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.890
and how the House uses GIS.

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:29.890
And a lot of the same
things that Tim said

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:35.930
about what was going on in
the Senate is also going on --

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.750
is this -- there we go.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.790
Is also going on in the House.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.620
We do have a GIS
working group meeting

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.160
that is sponsored by
the House Library.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.240
We also teach classes
through the House Library.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.940
The beginning introduction
to GIS is taught

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.670
in the House Learn Center.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:01.520
Esri, Bonnie teaches
the other two classes,

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.070
one is constituent
correspondence

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:06.560
and one is story mapping.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.080
And it's always good to go ahead

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.580
and take the introduction
class first and go

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.380
on to Bonnie's more
expert classes.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:22.120
And as you can see,
I'm Rae Ellen Best.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.890
This is Nick Schumate
and Nate Bradley.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.780
And he will be talking
about getting a count

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.310
on the House side for GIS.

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.540
&gt;&gt; Nate Bradley: Good
morning, everyone.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.300
I just wanted to let you know

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.550
that as you observe the
numerous capabilities

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:45.300
of the Esri platform and
software tool and to get started

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.370
with the ability to create
your own interactive map

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:52.550
for your office, for analytical
study, I encourage you

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.250
to call the HIR -- Human
Information Resource --

00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.970
Customer Solution Service Desk.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:03.780
That is where we can immediately
create an account for you.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.460
We also have the ability -- if
you desire to get more involved

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.280
with capabilities
of the software,

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.460
we can give you software links
to an actual desktop copy

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.000
for the application tool.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
So the turnaround time

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.570
for creating an account we
have is less than 24 hours.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.990
But the team has been able
to get you established

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.190
and going a whole
lot sooner than that.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.030
So feel free to call them
and they'll get you going.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:30.330
Thank you.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:31.630
&gt;&gt; Rae Best: Okay.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:39.630
Next we're just going to talk
a little bit about HouseMAP.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:44.320
Esri has branded the
GIS product in the House

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.710
of Representatives as HouseMAP.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:52.330
There is a portal if you are
on the intranet in the House,

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.870
it's Library.House.gov/maps.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:54:01.580
That has detailed information on
classes, information about CRS

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.880
and how they build maps,

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.040
the Library of Congress
cartography department

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.550
and how they can help
you with mapping.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:15.910
So it is just a very
nice portal for HouseMAP.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:22.190
GIS is used in the House to
show policy just like Senator --

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:25.450
Representative Takano
said today on the national

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.220
and on the district level in
the House of Representatives.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.000
The district interests
are very important.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.380
A lot of members gather
constituent correspondence,

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.660
and then they map out that
constituent correspondence.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.110
And Nick will be showing
you a great example

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:47.130
of the Reagan National
Airport noise map today.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.760
And just visually communicating
with maps and getting in touch

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.460
with your constituents
and showing them

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.440
that you're interested
in certain issues

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.930
that they're interested in.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.110
So we're just going to --
we're going to go through,

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.920
I'm going to take
five representatives

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.700
and show you some
of the things and --

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.040
representatives and committees
and some maps from Esri.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.510
And Nick will do another five.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.190
And this map is Lou Barletta,

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:23.150
Congressman from Pennsylvania
11th Congressional District.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.430
He does Main Street tours,

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:30.160
sort of like Representative
Takano's map of businesses.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.700
He just stops by and talks with
people in his community and goes

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.750
through different counties
and different towns.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:42.080
Right here he is stopping by
the local library and looking

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.420
at the books in the collection.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:49.060
He's stopped by another --

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.290
a unique little store
called Eclectic Envy

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.170
in downtown Danville.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:56:00.630
He stopped by to discuss
historic preservation

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:02.080
of this site in Pennsylvania.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.990
So it really just shows him out

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.680
and about talking
to the community.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.430
And he has a nice way of
just giving a little synopsis

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:19.010
about his visits and also
meeting with the shopkeepers

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:23.490
or when he's visiting fire
stations with the firemen

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.790
and taking pictures with them.

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:35.810
Okay, another thing that
Congressman Lou Barletta does

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:40.650
of Pennsylvania 11th District
is he has his outreach hours.

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.160
So he never wants any of his
constituents to be too far

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.880
from a place where somebody
can hear their concerns.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:52.860
So he's done push pins as
the symbols in this map.

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:58.360
And so the blue push pins are
other outreach besides his

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.740
official outreach offices.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.070
This one is Karen
Boback's office.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.990
And she's actually a state
representative for Pennsylvania.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.200
And it tells you her
hours, where she's located,

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.350
etc. The red pins are
his official office --

00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:18.520
this one, okay -- is
his official offices.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.240
I don't know why this is not --

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.520
and so his office are open
from -- I'm not sure why,

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.780
this isn't doing it the right
way; okay, there we go --

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.800
9:00 to 5:00 at all times.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:35.320
He also gives a nice detail
at the bottom of this map,

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.520
gives you information about
all the district offices,

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.110
where you can go
and see outreach.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:44.040
And then at the very end he has
his official outreach offices,

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.350
of course, his office
in Washington,

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:49.440
D.C. and his other official
offices, district offices.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:58:00.100
Next one of the -- Mike Johnson,
which was a freshman member

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.200
in the 115th Congress,
made a pledge

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.310
to have a commitment
to civility.

00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:10.850
And he asked members on
both side of the aisle

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:13.210
to sign this commitment
that they will be civil

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:18.560
to each other, civil, you
know, in conferences, you know,

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.530
on committees, etc. And
this is a map of people

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.810
who have either signed
the commitment

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:28.580
or have mentioned the
commitment on the floor speech,

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.950
etc. So like I said,
this is bipartisan.

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.660
So you have Republicans.

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.800
And this was just for
the freshmen coming on.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.480
But a few seasoned Congressman

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.890
and Congresswoman have also
signed this commitment.

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:51.630
And here you can see
John Lewis who has been

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:55.450
in the House for a while.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.390
This is probably one of
the most complex maps we're

00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.690
showing today.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:03.510
And this is from the
Committee on Natural Resources.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:09.030
And it is -- it's actually
divided by districts,

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:11.340
which is very important in
the House of Representatives.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.950
We do everything by district.

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:18.820
And this is different natural
resources in people's districts.

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:22.270
So this is the great sand dunes.

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:31.780
This is another protected area.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.970
I don't know why it's --

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.750
It's just taking a
long time [inaudible].

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.240
So I don't know -- so this
is actually when it says one

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.540
of twelve, there's actually
twelve other information boxes

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.840
here that just aren't loading.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.250
It is actually a complex map,

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.780
so maybe today it's just
not loading as quickly.

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.920
This is some information
about the continental shelf

00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.050
and it being off limits to
oil and gas development.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:08.430
So this is just a really nice
map on -- on natural resources.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:12.860
Actually, it isn't all the
way loaded because I was going

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.500
to show you the legend.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.410
Like, the pink areas
are protected lands;

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:22.390
yellow might be the
Bureau of Natural Lands,

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.860
etc. But I'll just
show you the layers

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.640
because for some reason
the legend is not showing

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.110
on this presentation.

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:32.690
So these are the
different layers.

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.650
One thing that we usually use
in the House is this layer,

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.430
which is 115th Congressional
District, which tells you

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.730
about the Congressman --

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:41.660
a little bit about
the Congressman,

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:45.070
if they're a Republican
or Democrat,

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.720
usually what district
they're in.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.930
Also tells you the
square mileage --

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:52.950
square miles of their district.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.130
So it's a good place to
get that information.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.260
And this is just all the
other layers on this map,

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:03.230
wild and scenic rivers, critical
habitat of endangered species,

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:07.010
the Bureau of Land
Management, Forest Service.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:10.040
Okay, I'm going to go
on to the next map.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.970
This is a map that Esri made I'm
assuming somewhere around 2012

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.610
after Sandy hit the east coast.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.700
And this is a good
example of a slide map.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:27.280
Some of you remember New
Jersey and Seaside, New Jersey,

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.420
the amusement park at the beach?

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.950
And so here's the figure
eight for the racecars,

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:36.740
here's the roller coaster,
here's the parking lot.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.650
And just with this slide map it
just shows you the devastation.

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:42.550
There's no parking lot anymore.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:46.490
Nothing sort of shows you quite
like a map and the visualization

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.060
of before and after pictures.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.160
Some of you remember seeing the
roller coaster during high tide

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.730
actually in the water.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.080
There's no figure
eight here anymore.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.750
You know, the road is
completely sanded over.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:05.580
Another example is before.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.250
And this is in Mantoloking,
New Jersey

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:12.020
and actually breaking completely

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.500
through the peninsula
all the way

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.980
into the intercoastal waterway.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:22.770
And last is the Statue of
Liberty, a nice picture

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.660
of the Statue of Liberty
on a bright, sunny day.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.600
And then after Sandy, you
couldn't even get there

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.450
because the pier had been
completely wiped away.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.940
Okay? I'm going to
hand this over, then,

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:42.040
to Nick to show you five other
examples of how it is used

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.310
in the House -- how GIS
is used in the House.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:47.610
&gt;&gt; Nick Schumate:
Thank you, Rae.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.910
Hey, everybody.

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:50.210
How's it going?

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:51.510
Good. That's what
I want to hear.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.810
Okay. So here's a good example.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.110
So Rae talked earlier

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.190
about constituent
correspondence in the House.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.970
Don Beyer actually made
a really good map here.

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.830
He did a heat map of
correspondence in his district

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:07.600
in regards to noise complaints
about Reagan National Airport.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.080
So you can see here that what
he's done is he has created --

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.140
let me get that out of the
way for you -- he's created --

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.480
so you can see the
centers of issues,

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.240
and it kind of gives you
a visual representation

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.170
of where the noise is being
consolidated and where a lot

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.920
of people are having
issues with it.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.920
But what he did is he took it
and made a story map out of it.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.480
So you could go through
here if you want to,

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.000
but it's basically just
describing the issue,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.980
putting it in more detail, and
then he kind of gives solutions

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.950
that he's provided for
the reasons he's bringing

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.440
up legislation in regards to it

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.650
and why he's approaching
it the way he does.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.260
So this is all embedded
on his website

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.910
so his constituents can
better understand the issue

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.210
and what he's doing for it.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:53.800
So he's gotten a lot of detail
here, but he actually shows

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.820
that he embeds videos and
he's got news articles.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.980
And he's just got basically
everything you could possibly

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.280
want about it right here.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.860
Even his Twitter right here.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.320
So it's just a good way to
consolidate information,

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.620
create sort of a narrative,

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.530
and better tackle
the subject matter.

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:14.640
So here's one, Representative
McSally, Martha McSally.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.130
She went on a hike in the
Arizona National Scenic Trail.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.200
This is more of just kind of
a fun one that she made here.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.980
And, again, this is a story map.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.300
And if it loads, it's going to
show as you go down the list --

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.600
so on the left side
here it's going

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.210
to show pictures that she took.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:32.710
But on the right side it's
going to correlate to the part

01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.170
of the trail she was on.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.830
So you can almost, like, go
on a journey with her and see

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.740
where each picture was
taken, what was going on.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.580
Again, there's a video here.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.990
And as you keep going down,

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:43.500
it's going to show
the legs of the trail.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.980
I think it's 800 miles.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.780
I don't know if she did the
whole thing but -- not yet?

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.230
Okay, yeah [Laughs].

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.390
I couldn't do that,
Jesus [Laughs].

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.690
Anyhow, so she just goes
through and kind of maps it out.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:59.660
And so you can see, you
know, how the trail goes

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.720
and where she's gone on it
and everything like that.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.480
So it's just kind of a
fun way to communicate

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.560
with her constituency.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.420
As Mark Takano spoke
earlier, he showed a few maps.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.850
And I think they mentioned the
Title I funding and API scores.

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.160
So Title I being low-income
families in his district.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.800
And he kind of compares
it to academic success.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.990
And it's really great because
it's got the two maps here.

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:26.060
And this is another
policy issue, obviously.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.970
And as you move one
map, it moves the other.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.840
And if you zoom in, it
does the same thing.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.340
And so it's a good way to
create two data sources

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.640
and bring them together.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.940
It's a good way of
visualizing it.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.760
It's hard to do otherwise.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.300
So the visualization
really kinds

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.970
of accentuates the point here.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.270
Another one from Takano.

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:43.980
Actually, he mentioned
a little bit about this,

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:48.030
but he went on this
weird and wonderful tour.

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.670
Basically it just shows a lot
of the hotspots in his district.

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:52.970
I won't go through all of them.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:57.450
But there's, like, music
venues, theatres, racetracks.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.780
It gives a little bit more
information about each one.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.030
So you could go through here
and his constituents could go

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:06.950
through here and just see what
he's highlighting and what kind

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.010
of cool things there are
to do in the district.

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.510
So it's just a fun way to
engage with the constituency

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.890
and also provide more insight.

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.880
The last one I'm going to show
here is actually one Esri made.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.600
It's about healthcare.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.420
So basically it's
comparing access to doctors

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.170
with access to healthcare.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.470
And what you can do is --

01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:28.990
the data's a little old,
but you get the idea.

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:30.290
It's the slider here
is showing --

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:34.300
on the left side it's showing
the doctor office accessibility;

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300
on the right it's
doing healthcare.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.490
So you could also -- you
know, this is sort of like

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:40.790
when you're putting
those two maps

01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:42.310
but you're actually
overlaying them.

01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:44.700
And it's a good way to
compare as Rae showed

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.100
with the Hurricane Sandy.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.290
So it's a good way to kind
of create a different sort

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:53.070
of visualization that really
helps accentuate the points

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.370
you're trying to get at.

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:58.390
So those are just some examples
that the House has encountered

01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:02.150
and has come up in
our class as well.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.660
So this is just our
contact information.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.740
Again, I'm Nick,
this is Rae, Nate.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.460
I think we're going
to be doing Q&amp;A.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:14.510
So [inaudible] take it over.

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:17.070
[ Applause ]

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.380
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge:
Thank you very much.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.120
That was excellent
presentation, thank you.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.750
So at this point we'll open up
to questions for both the House

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.120
and the Senate groups.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.970
We'll be passing around these
microphones on the side.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:32.170
But if you have any questions
for either of these groups,

01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:33.810
please just raise your hand.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:36.110
We'll pass the microphone
to you.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.770
&gt;&gt; Very brief --
very brief question.

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:47.950
Tim Petty mentioned that you can
follow the maps on your iPhone.

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.620
My question is do you
need an Apple app for that

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.110
or can you also follow those
maps on an Android phone?

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:57.380
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: I would
probably look at Bonnie,

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.210
but I'm pretty sure
you can do it on both.

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:03.720
Both of them work well on both
an Android as well as an iPhone.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.330
And so we were very
pleased with it.

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:09.400
And actually, my chief of staff
uses it much more when he's

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.950
out in the field than
what my member does.

01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:18.150
My member prefers the iPad, but
he actually also put an Esri app

01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:20.810
that actually renders
even quicker

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:22.940
than if he just Googles it.

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.270
And so but you can
just go straight

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.660
to the Senator's website
and go into his map gallery,

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:30.080
and all of those different
renderings come up,

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.110
at least on my iPhone.

01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:36.180
I don't have an Android to
test it, but I'm pretty sure

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:39.510
that both of them
are interchangeable.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:49.050
[ Inaudible ]

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:50.350
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm not entirely sure

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:52.380
who this question
should be directed at,

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:57.520
but I was just wondering, so
the CRS people were talking

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.090
about how, like, the office
can request a map to be made

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:02.890
and then they'll make it.

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:06.040
But for the Representative
and Senate staffers,

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.340
it sounded like y'all had a lot

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.180
of interaction with
making the maps.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.380
And so I guess I was wondering
if maybe somebody could explain

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.680
that a little bit more.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.070
Like, how much involvement does
the staff have with map-making?

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:20.530
&gt;&gt; Nick Schumate:
All right, sure.

01:09:20.530 --> 01:09:23.300
So what we're doing is
we're providing the tools

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.730
to kind of create yourself.

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:27.320
I know that Esri helps
out member offices

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.200
if they have requests.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.370
We are offering kind of
the tools for each office

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.710
to kind of do it themselves.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.460
But sometimes that goes beyond
our scope and their scope

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.410
of the data that they need.

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:39.410
And so that's going to get
where you're kind of treading

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.890
that line between can
you do it yourself

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.610
or do you need professional
CRS support?

01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:45.660
And I'm sure CRS can
talk more about that.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.930
But they kind of provide
the more authoritative data,

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.210
whereas we're giving you the
tools to access that data.

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:54.660
So it's kind of if you need
the information researched

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.440
and need it, you know, put
together in that format

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.810
versus doing it yourself.

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:01.510
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: Yeah, and
that's actually perfect.

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:04.440
And so that combination,
so there's some scopes

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.610
where I've really need some
specific details from my member.

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:11.600
And so I actually called Jim and
Hannah and Colin and said hey --

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.590
and went over their
office and said this is --

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:15.860
I don't even know how
to go about doing this,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.620
but this is an end result.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.270
And they were fantastic.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.980
And they gave me a
first set of datasets.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.230
And I was able to
look at these maps

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:26.020
that they specifically
had in an issue an Idaho.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.410
And they said we're going to
take a little bit more time.

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:30.710
But I was able to ice
that for my member

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.610
and then give them more
information as they were able

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:35.710
to develop and kind
of build out.

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.010
And it had to do with
a boundary issue.

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:40.900
And so they actually went
back and worked with even some

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.180
of the federal agencies
to help understand

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.300
where the boundaries were,
which was part of the question.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.200
And so that was a fantastic
resource that's way beyond even

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.220
a lot of staff's scope.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.150
And trying -- that's part what
the working groups are also

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.350
about on the House and
the Senate, is to say,

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:00.980
"Try it as far as I can,
but if you need help,

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:04.570
then there's amazing people
that understand maps and GIS

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.800
that can carry it
the rest of the way."

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.080
&gt;&gt; Rae Best: I just wanted
to add one other thing is

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.620
when you get your password,
you're in a community.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.670
I work for the Office
of the Clerk

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.340
of the House of Representatives.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.930
So that's our umbrella
community.

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.080
But we have made
subset communities

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.380
in the House Library.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.680
So if we're working on a map,

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.650
we can give other librarians
permission to view that map,

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:38.270
criticize it, or add to,
etc. so that it lets you --

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.830
the GIS software
platform is just

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.720
so powerful it lets you make
subsets that you can, you know,

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.570
work on maps with other people

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.310
in your office or
your committee.

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:52.690
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little
bit about what the committee

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:57.130
on natural resources -- on how
they're using this type of tool

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:01.640
with their -- with their
legislation and policy concerns

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:07.070
since it's so detailed?

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.420
&gt;&gt; Rae Best: I probably
can't tell you too much

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.780
about what they do.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:15.660
We're just sort of illustrating
what the committees are doing

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.770
in the House.

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.100
And so you can go on their
committee page and look and see

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.530
if they have a map gallery.

01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:25.420
And the map that I showed
you didn't completely load

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:30.780
because it's an extremely
complex map with regulations

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.660
on it about not, you know,
drilling in certain areas,

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:38.250
etc. So if you go online
and look at that map,

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:44.910
it will give you some
idea of what policies

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:47.680
and what they're looking at, and
other maps that they're doing,

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.570
and, you know, other policies
that they're looking at.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.170
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: And I might be
able to follow up a little bit,

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:58.610
at least on the Senate side,
which there are several staff

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:01.660
on the Energy Natural Resource
Committee on the Senate

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.190
who actually come to
our working group.

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:06.590
Anne Hoefler actually
has a background in GIS.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:09.640
And so I know she's made
a number of requests

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.350
and has worked, actually,
with Esri and with Department

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:18.570
of Interior to help them
-- energy maps, line maps,

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:23.600
pipelines, those kind of areas,
federal lands specifically

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.900
to get pretty detailed.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:29.670
And I actually know that there's
a professional staff, Chance,

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:31.870
from the Senate Commerce
Committee who's

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:35.820
out here somewhere that
also is participating

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.390
in continually developing
background.

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.220
And his background
also is in GIS.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.490
So, of course, he's
a younger staffer.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.650
And those are the
greatest resources

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:46.390
that you usually can tap into.

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:48.600
Because they've actually had
the education and training

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.130
and they're bringing
it to those committees

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:55.800
and really have some great
resources to facilitate.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.960
So I'm excited of even where
the committees are heading,

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.040
at least on the Senate side
with utilizing these resources.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.050
&gt;&gt; We have a question
over here in back.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:07.900
&gt;&gt; You mention that you
had feedback or comments

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.660
from other individuals when
working on a map or you share it

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.090
with someone for
feedback; is there a way

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:15.600
that you track it internally,
like, on comments like you do

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.110
in SharePoint point or in Word,
or is there a feature in there

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:21.390
that allows you to do
that or activate it?

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.690
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: Yeah.

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.860
So with that, if I might because
I think you -- on the same is --

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:29.350
at least on the Senate same,
which is the Sam's website,

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:30.770
there's actually interactive.

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:36.240
Bonnie actually created a
how-to utilize some resources.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.660
So our offices uses its
constituent resources' IQ.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.350
And so we can data
mine that dataset

01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:49.560
and really get good input
from constituent responses,

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.640
which is what we used with
the Boulder White-Cloud

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.170
and some other projects as well,
is those datasets that come

01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:58.060
from the constituents who
communicate through all means

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.320
of communication -- email,
faxes, telephone conversations

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.500
when they call into the offices,
and from our state office

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.090
that put everything
into that resource.

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:12.450
And then we can data
mine kind of our own data

01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:16.010
in our interactions with our
constituency to the extent

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.570
that Bonnie has helped us
to actually give the --

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:20.470
like, down to zip code.

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:23.070
So we can actually see
where they're talking about

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:26.020
and from what why are they
actually dealing with that issue

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.000
because that's their backyard.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.030
Or are they discussing it just
because they're interested

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.450
in the issue 300 miles away.

01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:38.700
So we can get that reference and
use heat maps to actually know

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.670
and really hear what's
happening to those people

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.630
in that local community.

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.650
&gt;&gt; Nick Schumate: I just --
sorry, just want to follow up.

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.970
One last thing is
that our GIS platform

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:51.820
that Esri provides
also access to,

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.010
it's almost like its
own little community.

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:57.120
So, again, we're opposite
the clerk, but we're all part

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.280
of the House of Representatives
in our side.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.610
And so we can see what other
offices are publishing,

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:03.870
and who's publishing
them, and what comments

01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:05.560
and suggestions and
descriptions.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.590
And so it's almost like
social media, I guess,

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:09.840
maybe is an interesting
way to put it.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.580
But it's this whole
network that you can kind

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.830
of see what everyone
else is creating.

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:15.130
So.

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.100
&gt;&gt; We have a question over here.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.650
&gt;&gt; Is the Senate Library
involved in a similar way

01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:25.040
as the House in terms of
putting these tools --

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.770
making these tools
available or being part

01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:28.130
that have working group?

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:30.020
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: So
maybe Jeff could help.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.580
He's with the Senate
Sergeant at Arms.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.870
And so with our working
group, when someone wants

01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:39.300
to have access to
their accounts,

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.540
they can facilitate that.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.590
The Senate side library
probably ties into all

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.890
of Library of Congress.

01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:51.870
So I'll let Mary talk about
that a little bit more.

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:56.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: Can I put
you on the spot, Jessica?

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:59.580
[ Laughter ]

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.990
&gt;&gt; I work in the Senate Library.

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:05.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: Okay.

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.140
&gt;&gt; We're not currently
doing anything with GIS,

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.440
but that's part of [inaudible].

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.740
&gt;&gt; We had a question
in the back?

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.040
&gt;&gt; Over here.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.340
[ Inaudible ]

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.890
&gt;&gt; I sort of have -- I guess
it's a data integrity question.

01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:18.480
So I gathered from this morning,
you know, there's a lot of time

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.850
and effort and expertise
that goes

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:21.860
into creating these datasets.

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.540
I was looking kind of
at the Reagan example;

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.430
is there anything that you
kind of work with offices

01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:29.760
to ensure they're using
the data properly?

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.450
Because as we all know,
you know, hotspots,

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.820
that's the analysis,
all these things.

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.970
You can really make that data
look however you want it.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.280
So is there kind of any -- do
you just hand the data off,

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.580
or do you work with the offices

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.240
and make sure they're using it
properly in its intended use?

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.540
&gt;&gt; Nick Schumate: I mean,

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:48.440
for our office obviously
we don't have any oversight

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.740
over that.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.540
But when we're teaching the
classes, what we tell them is

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.390
that it's almost like when
you're writing a paper

01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:55.120
for school, cite your sources

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.320
and make sure you're
using good sources.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.850
Same thing, we show how to
get authoritative sources

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.880
through the system we provide.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.060
But, again, you could take
data and make your own data.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.360
It's really up to the office.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.660
And you just kind of want to see

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.960
where they're getting
their data from,

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.260
and that should be
fairly transparent.

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:16.370
But, again, it's up to
each office to do that.

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.670
So.

01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:22.830
&gt;&gt; Question about
archiving of maps either

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:26.370
for the House or the Senate.

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:29.210
I'm thinking of the historical
map about the wilderness area

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:34.290
in Idaho, what happens to that
once the senator maybe didn't

01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:36.090
have it on their
website anybody else

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.820
or maybe that's not a Senate --

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.980
the person isn't
a senator anymore.

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.150
What happens to that
great material?

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:46.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: After every
Congress the National Archives

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.920
gathers every member's
website and they would --

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.460
if it is embedded in their
website, it will be captured.

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:56.800
So that goes with
committees and with members.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.140
&gt;&gt; How would I find that, then?

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: You just
go on the National Archives.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:07.510
They have it by year and
by member or by committee.

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:10.290
[ Inaudible ]

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:11.960
&gt;&gt; Hi. Can you please talk

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.290
about your respective
GIS working groups

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:17.560
and how often you meet?

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.930
And I'm assuming that these
are open to staff and members.

01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:26.960
And kind of an example of
the topics you present.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: Okay.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.540
Ours is a lot newer
than the Senate's.

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.870
So we've been doing it what,

01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:34.250
for about a year now,
a year and a half.

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.540
We meet about three
or four times a year.

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:40.430
A lot of times since the
House is just getting started

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:44.030
with GIS, we do a lot
of just foundation type

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.730
of how to build a map.

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:49.840
CRS comes, Hannah's
at our meetings.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.960
The Congressional Cartography
Division of the Library

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.170
of Congress will also come.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.330
Sometimes we invite guest
speakers from federal agencies

01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:00.830
that have been using
GIS for a long time

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:03.270
to give a demonstration
on how they're using GIS.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:07.600
And yes, it is correct, members
can come, staffers can come.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600
And we pretty much welcome --

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.130
you know, I show up
at the Senate one,

01:20:12.130 --> 01:20:16.960
people from the Senate also show
up at the House working group.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.920
&gt;&gt; Tim Petty: So we've been
working a little bit longer

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.410
on this, since about 2011,
which there were four

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:26.780
of us that came together.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.850
And we just stared at
each other and said,

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:31.330
"So what are we going to do?"

01:20:31.330 --> 01:20:35.750
So the Senate side has tried
to do several different models

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:37.500
over the last several years.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.800
But what seems to be
the most effective

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.150
for us is what we tried to
do, as well as what the House,

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:47.860
is we try to bring in an
Executive Branch agency

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:50.040
to kick it off for the hour.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.490
We try to do it about every,
what, quarterly or so,

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:55.790
three or four times year,

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:58.020
four times a year,
sometimes we do five.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.540
We definitely incorporate
in February

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.060
when there's the
federal conference here

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.360
that Esri puts on.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.310
So they've been super in
allowing basically any

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:12.580
of the staff to come up over
to the federal conference.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.160
And then there's tons of classes
that they provide that a lot

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:20.090
of staff will participate in
for over two or three days.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:21.870
And that's extremely helpful.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.690
But most of the staff,
for the most part,

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:27.250
are wanting to just
learn how to use it.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.890
And so it's more of a how-to.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:32.520
So we kick it off with
someone presenting

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.820
from the Executive Branch.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.120
We bring in an agency.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.980
And then what we try to do
is have a staffer, then,

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.250
present one of their
most recent developments

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:46.520
and how they did it, how they
screwed it up, allow other staff

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.470
to interact on what maybe
they could do that might be

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:53.150
or insightful to them.

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:56.000
Obviously we talk about
data sources and where

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.120
in the heck did you get that?

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.330
And so we really
encourage the use of that.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:04.180
And since we when
live website-wise

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:08.160
with Esri providing the
whole back end, there's ways

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.620
and training to know what's
authoritative data sources.

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.340
It's actually coming
from data.gov.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.910
So we really try to emphasize
on the Senate-side staff,

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:19.700
if you just take
the federal data,

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:23.720
that's who your member
has oversight over.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.120
And so if you have questions,
then you go and find out from

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.870
that dataset who's producing
that information and where.

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:33.530
And then we really
encourage them to go find

01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:34.870
that staff person

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:38.050
in the Executive Branch that's
been putting that data together.

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:40.510
So those are kind of
things that have unfolded

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:42.580
over a while, six years now.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.970
So on the Senate side we've been
doing it for a little while.

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.730
I have a list of a
little over 100 staff.

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:52.450
We probably average 15
to 20 at every gathering,

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:53.750
and people come when they can.

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.690
&gt;&gt; Anyone else?

01:22:55.690 --> 01:23:04.510
Well, let's give a big hand
again to our folks [inaudible].

01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:12.530
[ Applause ]

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.300
&gt;&gt; Tim St. Onge: All right.

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.070
Thank you, again, Tim Petty,
Nick Schumate, Rae Best,

01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:19.130
and Nate Bradley
for presentations

01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:22.960
and for a really informative
question and answer session.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.350
Unfortunately, at this point
Congressman Bruce Westerman has

01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:27.650
had cancel.

01:23:27.650 --> 01:23:30.160
He was pull away to a
committee meeting as happens.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.180
So that leaves us with an
extra long lunch break.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:36.480
So we will be breaking for
lunch until 1:00 o'clock.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.810
That's when we will be moving to
GIS for the digital humanities.

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:44.640
So that will talk about digital
humanities, data visualization,

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.780
and story maps being
created here in the Library.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.980
So a lot of you I know
are very excited about.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.110
So, again, 1:00 p.m. we'll
be meeting back in this room.

01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:58.410
If you're visiting the Library
and need some lunch options,

01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:01.160
our cafeteria is just a couple
doors down right outside.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.670
We also have a bunch

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.550
of restaurants along
Pennsylvania Avenue

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:06.540
and along First Street outside.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:07.870
So, again, thank you so much

01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:09.550
to all our presenters
for the morning.

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:10.850
We'll be back at 1:00 o'clock

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:12.920
for our afternoon session
right here in this room.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.720
Thank you.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.670

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:21.530
