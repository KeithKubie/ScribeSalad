00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
- Good morning,

00:00:00.953 --> 00:00:02.150
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:02.983
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:04.940
I'm in Pakistan, and I'm in a village

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.970
just outside of Gujranwala.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.460
Today, I had a very special opportunity

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.620
to explore the village,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.500
we're gonna cook, we're gonna eat.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.940
It's about 8:00 am, the
air is crisp and clean,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.620
the sun is shining,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.940
it's gonna be a fantastic day.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.100
I'm gonna share everything
with you in this video,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.870
and we are getting
started, we're on our way

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.383
to go have breakfast first.

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.550
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.750
- (laughs)
- Oh Mika!

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.287
You've got the whole outfit!

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:36.140
(laughs)
Oh, that is awesome!

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.340
Okay, and we're on our way though,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.060
to walk around the village and we're

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.497
gonna have breakfast at a place.

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:43.440
(men singing)
(drums)

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.550
So the village is called Kot Yousaf.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.770
It's very calm, there's no cars,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.060
mostly walking and motorbikes.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.210
But then there's--

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.920
it's an entire community,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.990
and just enjoying this
cool morning breeze.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.042
This is great.

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:57.875
- Sheep!

00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:58.922
- Sheep! Goat!

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:00.400
- [Mika] Goat.
- [Woman] Goat.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.060
We've arrived to a
place called 'The Derra'

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.893
which is ...

00:01:02.893 --> 00:01:06.490
It's a place in the
community, like a open yard,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.430
court yard, they have
some of the best quality

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.870
buffaloes and animals.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.100
Kind of a relaxing courtyard,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.900
but I think the main purpose of this area

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.380
is to have conversations, to socialize.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.190
And this is where we're gonna hang out.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.190
Very cool.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.343
Good morning.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:24.174
(buffalo braying)

00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:25.670
(sniffing)
(bells)

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.010
You dare step into the buffalo pen.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.890
And most of the buffaloes are used for,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.590
for milking here.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.800
And then the milk is very
important for many things.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.730
Thank you to the buffaloes,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.010
for the desi ghee, and the cream,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.880
and a lot of the food
that we've been eating.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.360
And then finally, horses over here,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.190
and these horses are
used for tent pegging,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.023
which is a,

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:48.890
its an art, it's a sport, it's
a part of the culture here

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.640
and we're gonna have a chance to see them

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.685
perform it after we have breakfast.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.389
(grating radish)

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:55.580
(pan dinging)

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.390
They're preparing breakfast already,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.070
they're grating, they're peeling potatoes,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.720
grating it looks like radish.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.950
Big balls of dough
which they are kneading.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.880
And then it looks like they're gonna do

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.408
some of the cooking over on this side.

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:07.290
(ceramic lid clink)

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.553
Nice.

00:02:08.553 --> 00:02:10.391
(doumbek drum beat)

00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:14.380
(woman talking while preparing food)

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.213
They're gonna be making paratha

00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:17.430
with the ingredients that they're cooking.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.580
So they're preparing two versions,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.260
one is with the radish,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.070
which they shredded and then mixed with

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.530
a variety of spices, one is with potato,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.520
which she mixed with a variety of spices,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.990
and then she's got this
mallet, pound it up,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.240
so it's like mashing it, mashed potato,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.012
and it's gonna fill into
a roti and then fry.

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:37.458
(mallet pounding)

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.457
- [Ali] It's called saag.

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:39.813
- Ah, so it is like spinach,

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:40.840
but a type of spinach.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.970
- It looks like spinach, but,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.154
you find them in fields.

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.283
They grow wildly in fields.
- [Mark] Like a wild spinach.

00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:49.490
- [Ali] It's like a wild spinach.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.930
- [Mark] Wow.
- It's a delicacy

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.183
in this part of the world.
You have it in breakfast.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.050
- We're gonna have some lassee too.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.010
Oh man, I'm getting,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.742
just more and more excited
by the minute for breakfast.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:05.742
(doumbek drum beat)

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:12.580
(water hissing)

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:21.080
(stirring)
(woman talking)

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.260
- [Mark] And they're also making haloel,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.850
which is a sweet dessert
made from semolina.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.420
And so, they cook that
down until it browned,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.040
and then they just
added in some hot water,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.950
that kind of,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.783
wooshed,

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:31.792
and now back on the fire.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.671
(women talking)
(patting)

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:37.254
(pan sizzling)

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.370
Added on some pure desi ghee.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.750
And then stuck it onto the hot plate.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.583
That just,

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.700
smoked and sizzled,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.060
and then, as she's frying it,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.120
she continually adds
more and more desi ghee.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.500
Oh, that's gonna be,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.009
a flavor overload.

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.150
(woman speaking)

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.900
The way her hands move, and it's--

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.540
she's a beautiful,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.373
Auntie.

00:04:05.373 --> 00:04:07.240
She rolls out-- she's
now making the paratha's,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.720
she rolls out one ball of
dough into a circular shape,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.060
and then she rolls out a second one,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.540
because they gonna sandwiched together.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.540
Then she adds in some
of the potato mixture,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.400
or the radish mixture,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.140
then she flattens it out,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.973
into the center, adds the second layer,

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:25.930
oh, she added in some
desi ghee into the center,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.120
then she puts it on the hot
plate and just wipes it,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.420
smears it with desi ghee
before she flips it,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.620
so that gives it that, just golden,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.510
sizzily ...

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.890
Just perfect,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.460
crunchy,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.610
desi ghee buttery goodness,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.010
and it's just sizzling away.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.740
I think we're getting
ready to eat very soon.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.140
That looks so good!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.504
I'm so hungry now!

00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:49.504
(doumbek drum beat)

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:53.808
(people talking)

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.338
(sizzle)

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.283
Ohh, whoa!

00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:07.470
So we're all just sitting
down at the table,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.760
they put the table underneath the tree.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.137
This is beautiful, we've
got the cool breeze,

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:14.710
the paratha's are ready, the haloels,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.860
there's the different,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.280
variet-- oh, the chanana.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.690
The chickpeas, and then
the saag, the spinach dish,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.203
and then there's some
achar, there's a pickle.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.833
Thank you.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.149
- [Ali] There's some cream
- [Mark] There's cream.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.982
- [Ali] in it as well.
- [Mark] Or is that

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:31.095
desi ghee on the bottom?

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.364
- [Ali] That's desi ghee.
- [Woman] Desi ghee.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.100
- [Mark] Desi ghee. Whoa.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.910
As the honored guest,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.120
it really is a privilege
to begin the meal,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.380
to start the meal with some
of the saag, which is the,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.410
wild spinach, and she--
before she served it,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.380
she put in a whole heaping spoon

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.850
of desi ghee at the bottom
and then poured on the saag.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.510
So that was at the
bottom, stirred that in.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.010
Okay, I got to try that first.

00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:58.178
(laughs)

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.093
Oh wow!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.653
Mmmmm!

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:07.580
Oh! (laughs) That is amazing!

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.940
You taste the spinach-y-ness of it.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.190
But it's so light and fluffy!

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.803
That desi ghee just shines.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.233
I think this one is radish and potato?

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:18.112
- [Ali] Yeah, this one is potato,

00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:20.410
and this one is radish.
- [Mark] Radish?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.743
- [Ali] Put in on your plate.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.210
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.020
Look at how it's just
glistening with that butter,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.000
this one is fresh.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.960
I'm gonna rip,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.497
rip a piece of the paratha.

00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:34.910
And you can see how it's so thin also.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.140
And you can see that inside.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.170
And then it's also
typically eaten with yogurt.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.520
Dip a little bit of yogurt.

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:43.620
Ho...

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.957
oh thank you!

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:45.790
Mmm!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.510
Okay.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.710
And some lassee as well.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.680
Oh, that paratha is ...

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.890
It's stunning!

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.360
Again, just the,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.203
the desi ghee.

00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:56.939
It's just saturated with desi ghee,

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.490
which makes it so good!

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.550
But the desi ghee has been
sizzled on the hot plate

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.920
with that dough,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.180
with the thin layer of
radish, which has been spiced,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.210
you can taste the chili in there,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.250
you can taste the tumeric,
you can taste the cumin.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.226
And then he just handed
me a bowl of lassee.

00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:12.045
(upbeat techno music)

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:13.368
Ohhhh!

00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:14.700
And try some of the achar, the pickle--

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.533
this is a chili.

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.130
Oh! Oh I love it!

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.357
It's like a preserved chili, it's salty.

00:07:22.357 --> 00:07:23.190
Mmmm.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.440
That pickled flavor, oh, that's wonderful.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.410
Again, that's just a ...

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.420
A sharp contrast to the yogurt,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.893
to the paratha.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.417
The paratha is stunning, and that saag.

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:39.960
That saag just blew me away.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.760
- You gotta try this too, it's insane.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.888
- [Mark] Oh, that chana?

00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:43.970
(Mika singing)

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.570
Some of the chana with the puri.

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:50.260
You can just taste the
creamy-ness of that texture,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.500
and then you taste the sauce,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.230
I mean, it is the chickpea sauce which is

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.720
disintegrated as well.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.340
The tumeric in there,
the onions and garlic.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.200
Okay, now I gotta try the
haloel, the sweet ....

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.953
the sweet dessert that goes
along with the puris as well.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.720
It is sweet, but it
kind of has a honey-ish,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.086
floral taste to it.

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:09.270
(man speaking)

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.084
Scoop up a little bit of that saag,

00:08:11.084 --> 00:08:12.501
with the paratha.

00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:16.888
(laughing)

00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:17.721
That saag.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:21.480
That saag is award winning.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.610
Breakfast was spectacular.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.339
Everything made from scratch,

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:27.280
by the whole community coming together.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.460
I was just asking how many
people live in this village.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.200
About 700, he said.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.650
Then, one more thing I
was gonna tell you is,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.570
the word 'desi'.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.820
You hear desi a lot,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.680
we just had a desi breakfast,
which is the local breakfast.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.180
But, mostly, the word
you hear is 'desi ghee',

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.150
which is ...

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.860
So it's butter, clarified butter,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.900
but it's 'desi', which means it's local,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.670
so it's from the source.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.200
So whenever you hear 'desi ghee',

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.250
and I'll be using that term a lot,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.083
in Pakistan,

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:55.200
it means that's it the clarified butter,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.570
locally sourced.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.580
Could be, right from the buffaloes,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.985
right next to where you eat it.

00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:01.818
(tractor whirring)

00:09:01.818 --> 00:09:02.830
Oh, okay!

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.280
We're gonna take a quick tractor ride,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.820
or maybe drive the tractor.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.913
Plowing the field.

00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:12.877
Oh!

00:09:12.877 --> 00:09:15.460
Whoa!
(laughs)

00:09:16.902 --> 00:09:19.986
Hope I'm keeping the lines straight!

00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:23.153
(upbeat techno music)

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.470
A little bit dusty, but what a ride!

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.403
Oh, that was fun!

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.180
As we're sitting here drinking tea,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.690
they're starting to prepare the animals,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.560
especially the horses,
preparing the horses,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.880
because they're gonna show us the,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.210
tent pegging, which is a traditional,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.270
sport-- oh, which I
already mentioned before,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.320
but they're getting ready to demonstrate.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.183
What they're gonna pick up,

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:54.410
what they're gonna stab,
what they're gonna spear,

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.310
is called a 'kila', which
is this small piece of--

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.760
it's like a little wooden stake--

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.110
So they're gonna swing by with a spear,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.210
and stab it on their way up,

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.043
and that's the,

00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:04.260
that's the art, that's the sport.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.297
Tent Pegging.

00:10:05.297 --> 00:10:06.470
- [Man] This is how you
actually control it,

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.830
and take the thumb out, so,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.383
you have a strong grip.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.300
When you hit it,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.647
your whole arm, it bends back
and this is how is turns.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.905
(men speaking)

00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:21.905
(man yelling)
(horses galloping)

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.430
Really tough, that's so small,

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.593
that's such a small target.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:32.589
(upbeat techno music)
(horses galloping)

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:36.506
(people cheering and clapping)

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.580
We got back form the
horse display exhibition,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.980
which was incredible to see,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.813
and it's now time--

00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:01.470
as we were there, they were cooking lunch,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.460
they were preparing lunch.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.490
We're back at the,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.670
the family home now.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.870
There's a rice dish, which is like--

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.240
it's a pulao rice.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.740
There's tandoori roti,
fresh tandoori roti,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.710
there's chicken curry, and
there's a lentil dish as well.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.390
But, again, another home cooked meal.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.390
(doumbek drum beat)

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:27.447
First, I cannot wait to try this rice.

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:29.460
This is a desi chicken, it's a,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.650
a local,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.130
local chicken.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.453
Like a free range chicken.

00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:38.501
(men speaking)

00:11:38.501 --> 00:11:39.928
Mmm!

00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:40.761
Mmmm!

00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:43.970
Oh, that's so fluffy!

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.350
And so,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.183
airy!

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:48.660
The tumeric you taste, mmm,
you can taste the chili,

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.170
the chili heat a little
bit in the background.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.010
Next try the chicken and curry.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.340
Break off a piece of the chicken.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.090
Oh yeah, you can definitely
see the desi ghee in there.

00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:00.340
Mmm! But almost as a,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.960
okay, you can taste the cream in there.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.980
That's what it is, the
cream comes through,

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.170
the garlic, the--

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.325
so good!

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:09.492
(upbeat techno music)

00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:12.393
Oh, the black pepper in that!

00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:24.263
Taste that with the achar, the chili.

00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:27.649
Oh.

00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:30.676
Just.

00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:31.673
That rice is insane.

00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:32.506
It's so good.

00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:34.990
And then that chicken, with the,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.010
with the curry sauce,

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.710
and then following with the achar.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.990
It's such a honor to
have home cooked food.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.770
But you just taste the
difference of home cooked food,

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.960
made with so much love.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.760
Yeah. It is ...

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.450
This meal is spectacular.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.827
As was breakfast.

00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:59.934
Oh, that's the bite.

00:12:59.934 --> 00:13:00.767
- [Mark] Thank you so much!
- [Man] Mark, thanks

00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:02.058
- a lot man.
- [Mark] Yes.

00:13:02.058 --> 00:13:02.891
That was.

00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:04.157
That was so special.

00:13:04.157 --> 00:13:05.189
Thank you so much!

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:06.264
- [Man] Thank you.
- [Mark] That was amazing!

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:07.696
Thank you so much.
- [Man] Thank you!

00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:09.454
- [Mark] Thank you. Bye bye!

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:10.610
(laughs)

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.873
(car door)

00:13:11.873 --> 00:13:13.560
Whoa okay!

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.800
Ali just said, that
was a marathon of food,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.030
and activities.
- [Ali] That was a

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.863
rollercoaster ride.
- [Mark] A rollercoaster

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:20.222
- [Ali] Food and activities and whatnot.

00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:21.239
(laughs)
But we had fun.

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:23.434
These guys were very hospitable,

00:13:23.434 --> 00:13:24.267
- Whoa!
- [Ali] Amazing.

00:13:24.267 --> 00:13:26.030
- [Mark] They really took care of us,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.990
I love how the entire community gathered.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.790
My huge thanks to the
entire Bagdhi family,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.260
who are from Kot Yousaf Village,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.190
just outside of Gujranwala.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.023
But they are,

00:13:37.023 --> 00:13:37.900
yeah, what a,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.230
what a display of hospitality.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.650
Thank you very much!

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.120
Okay, the plan for the rest of the day is,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.260
we are driving now,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.650
it's gonna be about a three hour drive,

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.640
we're driving almost to Islamabad, right?

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.530
- [Ali] Yeah, we are
driving towards Islamabad,

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.626
but we will be having dinner at Chaklala.

00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.013
- [Mark] Chaklala, which
is just before Islamabad.

00:13:54.013 --> 00:13:54.990
It's another village?

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.733
- Yes, another village
just before Islamabad.

00:13:57.733 --> 00:14:00.900
(upbeat techno music)

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.930
- [Mark] . Hi. Nice to meet you. Mark.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.750
Tonight, this is kind of a surprise,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.430
but we have a special
opportunity to hang out

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.560
and meet Mr. Yasir Sarfraz.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.040
And, he,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.980
has this incredible

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.850
150 year old mansion

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.510
in the countryside, in a village.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.753
So we've been invited for dinner tonight.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:32.680
And then,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.020
yeah, what a,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.740
what a location, it's like a castle.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.793
- [Yasir] Simple and home made and desi.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.650
What is this one?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.960
Chicken?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.793
- [Mark] Nice.

00:14:42.793 --> 00:14:44.290
- [Yasir] This is like,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.433
local chicken,

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:47.262
what do you call it?

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.095
Desi chicken.

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:48.948
Organic--
- [Mark] Desi chicken.

00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:50.178
- [Yasir] Organic, yeah.

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:51.186
This is,

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:52.228
- [Man] Mutton.

00:14:52.228 --> 00:14:53.061
- [Yasir] This is mutton.
- [Mark] Mutton.

00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:54.330
- [Yasir] This is also,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.910
like a local meat.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.610
Yeah, this is also spinach.
- [Mark] Okay.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.320
- [Yasir] But, generally,
the spinach, which is,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.330
generally eaten with this.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.265
- Thank you.
- [Yasir] Are you

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:04.098
recording me?

00:15:04.098 --> 00:15:06.286
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:07.650
- [Yasir] And now it,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.470
used to be considered, not it's not.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.310
It's cold, and it doesn't--

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.143
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:15:12.143 --> 00:15:12.976
- [Yasir] They're made very good, so.

00:15:12.976 --> 00:15:14.737
- [Mark] Okay, I'll try
some of that saag, actually.

00:15:14.737 --> 00:15:15.837
(doumbek drum beat)
(singing)

00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:17.890
- [Yasir] That's actually
spinach and cheese.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.077
- [Mark] We're all
sitting down at the table

00:15:19.077 --> 00:15:20.640
in the dining room.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.733
Oh wow!

00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:29.033
Oh, the mutton curry.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.550
Okay, next up to taste, the saag.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.880
And that's eaten with
a special corn bread,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.360
which is that thick,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.210
thick corn bread.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.843
Oh yeah!

00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:45.330
Oh, it's so creamy, it's so,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.253
spinach-y, but it's got that,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.240

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.316

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.113

desi chicken, a local,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.630

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.767
Oh!

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:08.600
I mean, again,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.900

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.850
you can tell it's not,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.580

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.740
- [Yasir] The roll you
ate in the afternoon,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.964
- [Mark] Yeah.
- [Yasir] That was Punjabi.

00:16:16.964 --> 00:16:17.877
And this is from our region.

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.223

00:16:26.995 --> 00:16:27.828
Mmm!

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.187
Yeah, it's almost,

00:16:30.187 --> 00:16:31.620
almost like a bread pudding.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.550
You can taste the spices in
it and the cardamom maybe.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.250
And then there's raisins in there.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.019
Oh, and nuts too!

(clapping)

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.090

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.340

00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:29.763
