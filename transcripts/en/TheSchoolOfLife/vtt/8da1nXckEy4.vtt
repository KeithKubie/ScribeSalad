00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.760
Once, we were all dressed by someone else.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.540
Parents picked out a T-shirt; the school dictated what colour our trousers should be.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.620
But at some point, we were granted the opportunity to discover who we might be in the world of clothes.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.900
We had to decide for ourselves about collars and necklines, fit,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.420
colours, patterns, textures and what goes (or doesn’t) with what.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.960
We learnt to speak about ourselves in the language of garments.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.560
Despite the potential silliness and exaggeration of sections of the fashion industry,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.200
assembling a wardrobe is a serious and meaningful exercise

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.120
Based on our looks or background, others are always liable to come to quick and,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.960
not very rounded decisions about who we are.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.620
Too often, their judgment doesn’t quite get us right.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.260
They might assume that because of where we come from, we must be quite snobbish or rather resentful;

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.040
based on our work we might get typecast as dour or superficial;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.540
the fact that we’re very sporty might lead people to see us as not terribly intelligent;

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.920
or an attachment to a particular political outlook might be associated with being unnervingly earnest.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.300
Clothes provide us with a major opportunity to correct some of these assumptions.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.580
When we get dressed, we are, in effect, operating as a tour guide, offering to show people around ourselves

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.940
We’re highlighting interesting or attractive things about who we are and,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.220
in the process, we’re clearing up misconceptions.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.360
We’re acting like artists painting a self-portrait:

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
deliberately guiding the viewer’s perception of who they might be.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.700
In 1961, the English painter Peter Blake portrayed himself wearing a denim jacket, jeans and trainers.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.780
He was deliberately nuancing the view most of his contemporaries would have had of him:

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
based on knowing that he was a successful and rather intellectual painter.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.820
He might have been thought of as slightly aloof and highly refined;

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.320
detached from, and censorious of, ordinary life.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.400
But his clothes speak about very different aspects of his personality:

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.440
they go out of their way to tell us that he’s quite modest; he’s interested in talking about pop music;

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.840
he sees his art largely as a kind of manual labour.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.900
His clothes, like ours, give us a crucial introduction to the self.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.440
This explains the curious phenomenon whereby if we’re staying with good friends,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.560
we can spend a lot less time thinking about our clothes,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.900
compared with the anxiety about what to wear that can grip us with strangers.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.400
With good friends, we might sit around in a dressing gown or just hastily slip on any old jumper.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.100
They know who we are already; they’re not relying on our clothes for clues.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.280
It’s a strange but profound fact that certain items of clothing can excite us.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.340
When we put them on or see others wearing them, we’re turned on:

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.240
a particular style of jacket, the right kind of shoes or the perfect shirt might prove so erotic,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.280
we could almost do without a person wearing them.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.360
It’s tempting to see this kind of fetishism as simply deluded but

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.360
it is alerting us in an exaggerated way to a much more general and very normal idea:

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.120
that certain clothes make us very happy.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.540
They capture values that we’re drawn and want to get closer to.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.080
The erotic component is just an extension of a more general and understandable sympathy.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080
The French novelist Stendhal wrote:

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.040
‘Beauty is the promise of happiness’

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.740
and every item of clothing we’re drawn to&nbsp;contains an allusion to a different sort of happiness.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.140
We might see a very desirable kind of competence and confidence in a particular pair of boots;

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.040
we might meet generosity in a woollen coat or a touching kind of innocence in a hemline;

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.680
a particular watchstrap may sum up dignity;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.780
the way a specific collar encases the neck could strike us as commanding and authoritative.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.860
The classic fetishist might be pushing their particular attachments to a maximum

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.760
and be rather restricted in the choice of items they favour, but they are latching onto a general theme:

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.880
clothes embody values that enchant and beguile us.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.560
By choosing particular sorts of clothes, we are shoring-up our more fragile or tentative characteristics.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.360
We’re both communicating to others who we are and strategically reminding ourselves.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.660
Our wardrobes contain some of our most carefully-written lines of autobiography.
