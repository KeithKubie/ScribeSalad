00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.140
You guys,
Tim Ferriss here,
author of the four hour body.

2
00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.230
I wanted to show you some new tricks that I've picked up in the last few years.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.450
This one was related to hamstring flexibility.

4
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:11.020
I have notoriously terrible hamstring mobility.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.980
We just can't even touch the ground.
My legs bent type of issues.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
And the first time I was ever in a yoga class and other guys considered me the

7
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:24.880
flexible dude was after doing zero yoga.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.050
It was after doing a combination of exercises,
it's probably six to eight,

9
00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:32.380
but I'll show you two of them that had a particularly large impact and I want to

10
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:36.730
give credit where credit is due.
These are directly from Jersey Grigorik.

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.960
You have to look this guy up.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.740
He's incredible checkout some of these videos on youtube as a four time or five

13
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.260
time Olympic weightlifting world champion.

14
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.220
He is in his sixties and is still more mobile and stronger than I am.

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.340
And a can do everything cold.
He's incredible.

16
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.550
The program that he created is called the happy body,
so you can look up uh,

17
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.090
Gregorick Jersey,
Gregorick,
Greg O,
r e k.
Grigorik.

18
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.860
And,
uh,
definitely take a look.
But these are two that I found very helpful.
And a,

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.530
you should look at the entire program though because it does piece together very

20
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:13.150
well.
So the first is,
uh,
is as follows.

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.060
We're going to be on your back and uh,
this is a hamstring stretch,

22
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.120
but it's also an abdominal exercise of sorts.

23
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.150
And of course I'm probably not doing this perfectly,

24
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:23.740
but I'll show you what has helped me in any case.

25
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.140
So I'm going to come here and arms are overhead.
I'm going to take an inhale,

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.740
I'm going to finish my terminal knee extension,
pull my toes back and I'll,

27
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.350
I'll demonstrate first.
So Watch,

28
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.550
okay,
so I'm only going to do six or so.
Reps did that.
Now,

29
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.720
a few key components here.
You want your legs to oh,

30
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.300
totally straight as straight as possible.

31
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:12.620
So you're going to have to contract your vastus medialis and your quads to

32
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.660
really lock it toes back.

33
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.140
And when you come up,

34
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.600
I did add one little thing to this,
uh,

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.300
which is probably,
uh,
some type of sacrilege,

36
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.310
but I will go as far as I can hook.

37
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.780
And then I'll bring my hips back,

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.360
almost like what's called a pipe pulse in gymnastics.
So I'll do that.
Six reps,

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.480
that's it.
And in that Max Range,

40
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:45.260
I'm only staying there for a half second to a second.
It's very,
very short.
Okay.

41
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.010
That's exercise one.
Literally I might do one set of those in the morning.
Okay.

42
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.960
And then I would do other exercises for low back squat,
et Cetera,

43
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.650
uh,
which Jersey prescribes.
So you should take a look at the full program,

44
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:02.140
but the other hamstring specific exercise and he has many that I found very

45
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.280
helpful is using dumbbells.

46
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.360
And uh,
there are a number of different variations of this,

47
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.050
but you'll notice I have a wide stance.

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
My toes are pointing out and I'll show you what you want to try to do.

49
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.760
And I may not execute this perfectly,

50
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.761
but you do not want to round at the back or particularly the low back.

51
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.050
This is a hamstring stretch.
So you want it to kind of lead with your gut,

52
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.470
if that makes sense.
Lead with your lower abdomen.
So you're going to be here.

53
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.120
Same breathing sequence.

54
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.650
I'm taking a big breath in stretch completely exercise.
Exhale,

55
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.490
this is what it looks like,
and I'm pulling my toes back.
Okay,

56
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.050
so straight legs again,

57
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.200
that's one rep,
that's it.

58
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.830
So you're not spending a lot of time again at that Max end of your range.

59
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.020
It's very,
very brief.
And I will typically just go down for it again,

60
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:12.220
a half a second,
maybe quarter second at most a second.
So it looks like this

61
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660
toes back,
legs completely contracted,

62
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.860
not this

63
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.940
up.
And then shrug
down.

64
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.430
Exhale.
That's the second rep.
You do five or six of that.
That's it.
Okay.

65
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.630
Now Jersey would most likely have you go through multiple rounds of this.

66
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.700
Uh,
and I would agree that that is ideal,

67
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but in a very rushed situation,
in the morning of five minutes,

68
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.020
you can get a lot out of those two exercises.
Um,

69
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.730
but please give credit to Jersey and check out his program.

70
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.140
So Jersey Grigorik again,
j e R,
Z y Olympic lifting.

71
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.830
If you just search that,
you'll find tons and tons on him.
Uh,

72
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.640
do me a favor and get his book or the DVDs.
He's incredible.

73
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.400
One of the most amazing teachers I've ever met.
So there you have it.

74
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:13.270
Hope those help.
If you enjoyed that video,
let's talk about a list.

75
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.050

Jamie Foxx,
undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing.

76
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.140
Laird Hamilton.
The list goes on and on.
What do they have in common?

77
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.770
They're sharing their secrets,
their morning routines,
favorite books,
