Hello Vsauce. Michael here,
and I've got a dozen DONGs for you today.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.579
These are things you can do online now,
guys. In the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:11.860
"I of It" you play not as a super action
hero, but rather

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.190
as the actual letter 'I.'
You elongate and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.779
shrink yourself to grab onto ledges and
awkwardly locomote. If you want more

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:20.390
letters,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.090
upgrade your life to the Roman numeral
calculator. For instance,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480
191 times

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.239
7 is 1337. If you brain isn't
challenged, take these quizzes

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.840
suggested by "MadebyNotch."
You listen to classic songs from

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.200
NES or SNES games and with the help of
hints prove your worth

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.170
by identifying them. If tragedy is more
your style, go with "Zombies Took My

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.840
Daughter,"

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.510
an emotional action game where you have very
little time to find your lost kin

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.039
and plenty of zombies to hide from or blow-up.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.840
Too many graphics?
Go textile

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.910
with "EauDeParkour's" 'YouFindYourselfInARoom.' Here

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.110
you have to type your next move.
What's neat is that the computer receiving your

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.430
inputs eventually gets frustrated with you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.910
and things get pretty twisted.
Twist around shapes with Jasmine's mind warping

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.740
suggestion.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.480
You use six different keys to rotate
pieces to fit snugly

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.580
in all kinds of new ways.
And if you're forever alone,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.160
enjoy the company of Myself, where you solve
puzzles by doing one thing

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.080
and then restarting, using the ghost of your
former attempt as a tool.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.090
Now as a bonus, yourself and your ghosts
have different abilities

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.340
and it gets pretty satisfying. If you
still don't know how to upside down text,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.110
do like "Nix4222"

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.540
and get to ToolsGeek. They'll flip text
that you can copy and paste

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.440
anywhere. I've seen a lot of creative
uses of annotation,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.580
but "wtfdany" made one where you can beat him

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.780
up.
Just click and boom! Instant results.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.970
Do you like a YouTube video and wish
you could loop it?

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.190
Well, "Griever179" showed me that you
can delete 'tube,'

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.160
replace it with 'repeat' and be sent to
a site that plays the video

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.250
over and over and over again forever.
Control YouTube even more

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.370
with the Video Time Machine.
This site's curatorss

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.850
verify dates and organize videos. So, say
if I wanted to watch television and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.850
commercials from

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
the year I was born.
Ta-da! A huge list of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.940
awesomeness to scroll through and
nostalgia about. For 99 cents you can get

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.380
the whole time machine as an app on your
iPhone, so it never leaves your side.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.720
I leave you with flip books. 'BloodyRenegadeX' makes stories that will blow

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.690
your snot off.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.030
But more personally, Frenzy Woods made a
super cool flip book

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.160
of the Vsauce outro. Check his work out,
he sent a lot of great ones.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.020
And hey, what a perfect way to end my
reminder that...

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.200
As always,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.480
thanks for watching.
