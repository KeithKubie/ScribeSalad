00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.989
In the last video we
established a reasonable

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.204
upper bound on the
1-year forward settlement

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:08.550
price of gold. We
established that at $1150

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.138
which is essentially
the sport price plus the

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:15.568
borrowing rate to borrow
$1000, plus the carrying

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.179
cost of the gold. What I
want to do in this video

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.197
is to think of a reasonable
lower bound. To do

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:23.869
that let's imagine a
world where instead of

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.822
the forward settlement
price being $1150, let's

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:34.994
imagine a world where the forward
settlement price is $1050.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.929
It's still higher that the spot
price. Let's think of it from the

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.794
the point of view of
someone who wants to hold

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:45.602
gold in a year. Let's say
that you are that someone

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:52.267
and right now you have $1000
that you want to use to

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:55.863
give you gold. You want
to hold the gold for

00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:57.556
the long term. You have 2 options here.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:02.776
You could just buy gold
now. Buy 1 ounce with

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:07.675
your $1000 right now.
When you go forward a year

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:12.337
from then your going to
have that 1 once of gold

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:14.664
plus you're going have
to pay the carrying cost.

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:17.863
The safety deposit box and
the insurance on the gold.

00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:21.067
You're going to have 1
ounce of gold minus $50.

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:22.543
That's what you're going have to pay.

00:01:22.543 --> 00:01:24.948
The other option, you say
hey look instead of putting

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:27.806
my $1000 into gold right
now, let me put my $1000

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.392
into a risk-free bond.
Into a risk-free bond.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:39.574
Risk-free bond, and at
the same time agree to

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:42.664
be the buyer on the
1-year forward settlement.

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:47.190
On the 1-year forward
contract. I'm agreed to

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.595
to be the buyer at $1050.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:51.997
If you go forward a year,
your $1000 risk-free

00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:54.866
bond is going to give
you 5% interest a year.

00:01:54.866 --> 00:02:00.881
You're going to have
$1050. This is just the

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.127
interest on your bond.
Then you can use that

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:07.683
to go and buy the gold.
Which you all ready locked

00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:11.934
in the price by agreeing
to be the buyer on the

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:17.779
forward contract. Then you buy the gold.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.158
In both situations you end
up with an ounce of gold

00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:24.467
a year from now starting with your $1000.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.529
In this situation you
just have an ounce of gold

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.357
and you didn't have to
pay any carrying cost.

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:30.633
In this situation you
have the ounce of gold

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:32.575
and you did have to pay carrying cost.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:35.204
So, clearly any rational
person, assuming their

00:02:35.204 --> 00:02:37.983
buying the gold for the
long term, would want to do

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:41.402
this situation. They
save $50 over the course

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:46.269
of the year. Really, the
rational price, if this

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.361
were to happen everyone
would want to be the

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.592
buyers over here. We're
talking about $1050 price.

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:53.562
That's right over here.
This was the price in

00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:55.467
the last example. Everyone
would want to be the

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.270
buyer on the futures contract
or the forward contract.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.217
That would increase the price over there.

00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:04.108
Knowing you'd have less
buyers on the spot contract.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:07.129
That would decrease the price over there.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.186
In general this price
seems too low. The price

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:14.123
at which people would
be neutral is if this

00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:18.689
price was $50 higher.
Then it becomes completely

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.787
equivalent. A rational lower
bound given all of this,

00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:27.020
would have been a price of $1100. $1100.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.108
In general just going
back to the last video,

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.921
a ration upper bound
will be the spot price

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:34.986
plus the carrying cost
and the rate at which

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:38.388
someone could borrow money.
A rational lower bound

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:48.669
will be the spot price
plus the risk-free interest

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.953
rate and the carrying
cost. In general, the only

00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:53.162
difference between those
upper and lower bound

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:57.156
is this rate and this rate.
This rate and this rate.

00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:59.389
If these were the same the rational price

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.735
would be the same. If
these both were 10%, then

00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:06.122
the rational price would
$1150. These were both

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:08.945
5% the rational price, the
upper and the lower bound

00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:11.594
would have been $1100.
