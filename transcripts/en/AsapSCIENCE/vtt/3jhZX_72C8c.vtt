00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
We've all had moments where we felt
desperate to eat anything

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.800
But what if your only option was human flesh?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.700
Most of us have heard of cannibalism 
but what happens when you eat humans?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.780
If we first look at insects, snails, fish or amphibians,
we can see that cannibalism is abundant.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.100
For example, crab spider mothers lay
unfertilized nurse eggs for her spiderlings to feast on

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.300
and once the eggs are consumed, she offers herself
to be eaten entirely in the process called Matriphagy

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
But when it comes to mammals, cannibalism
is more rare; often triggered by environmental stressors

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.140
like when rabbits eat their young
under stressful situations.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.980
French paleontologists found human examples
from 100 000 years old neanderthal bones

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.980
which showed signs of breaking
as a way to extract marrow and eat brains

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.240
and tool cut marks suggesting
that the tongue and thigh were eaten as well

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.040
But even in the 20th century,
medicinal cannaibalism was used in Europe

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.400
where human blood was prescribed as a remedy.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.140
Which brings us to the first issue

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.980
Without proper care and preparation,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.120
you run the risk of contracting any bloodborne disease
like Hepatitits or Ebola that your victim may be carrying.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.660
As well the risk of infection from
the deceased's Ecoli and other gut bacteria.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.120
Speaking of blood, we're definitely red meat.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
This is due to myoglobin, an iron and oxygen
binding protein found in muscle tissue.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.780
Your nutritional value?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.020
Well your thigh is around 10 000 calories, your heart 700, and your entire body around 81 000 calories.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.660
But about half of these calories come from adipose or fat tissue so you aren't the best meat for those on a diet.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.940
And even though anecdotal accounts say
we taste somewhere between pork and veal,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.860
and a cute culinary robot identified us as bacon

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.320
There's still an even greater risk
in something called prions.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.400
Though not fully understood, prions are versions
of a normal protein that has had its shape altered

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.600
and not only loses its function but becomes infectious.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.780
These distorted proteins can influence other
similar healthy proteins and change them as well,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.640
causing a chain reaction and creating disease.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.800
In particular, prion disease creates holes in the brain

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.260
giving it a spongiform appearance
and ultimately causing death.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.480
But unlike viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasitic infections which contain DNA or RNA, prions don't,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.080
meaning they can't be killed with radiation or heat.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.480
These incredibly infectious prions could be present
in any nervous tissue including organs and muscles.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.360
But are most common in the brain
and spinal nerve tissues

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
Meaning if you happened to consume meat
with prions in it, your risk of infection is high.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.560
Eat the brain and that risk goes much higher.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
In the 1950s, researchers discovered 
that several members of the Foray people,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.640
a tribal group in Papua New Guinea 
were suffering from a disease

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.860
called "Kuru" or "Laughing Disease"
which caused those infected to lose control

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.460
of their emotions, then bodily functions,
eventually succumbing to death

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.280
It turns out that Kuru was a prion disease
which was contracted through their funeral practices.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.340
The Foray people believed
it was better for the body

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.660
to be eaten by the people who loved
them than by worms or insects.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.200
And though the practie is believed to have stopped,
the incubation of prion disease can take up to 50 years

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.860
meaning new cases could still reveal themselves.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.400
So while eating human flesh isn't 
neccesarily always bad for you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040
especially if it lacks prions,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.120
doing so carries incredibly high risks
that probably aren't worth it.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.920
Just stick with the steak, unless
of course you're not human in which case

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.200
there are a tonne of shocking animals 
that practice cannibalism.
