how it is that a pre-human ape became a

how it is that a pre-human ape became a
 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.920
how it is that a pre-human ape became a
human and it's a question that Darwin

human and it's a question that Darwin
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.010
human and it's a question that Darwin
had no idea about really and that we've

had no idea about really and that we've

until recently and I think we still have
 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.720
until recently and I think we still have
a long way to go and until we have a

a long way to go and until we have a

one of the great questions of the future

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639
one of the great questions of the future
 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.820
one of the great questions of the future
is whether or not that group will be

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
is whether or not that group will be
 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.610
is whether or not that group will be
achieved by unanimous pooling of the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.740

of the great problems of the world such
 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.370
of the great problems of the world such
as climate change or food shortage or

the threat of aggression or whether or
 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.070
the threat of aggression or whether or
not our the gloomy view would be that

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
not our the gloomy view would be that
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.170

the single united human group will be

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180
the single united human group will be
 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.560
the single united human group will be
achieved by domination and I think

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570
achieved by domination and I think
 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.939
achieved by domination and I think
that's on the whole unlikely I think

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949
that's on the whole unlikely I think
 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.499
that's on the whole unlikely I think
that the great value of the

technological advances that have been
 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.279
technological advances that have been
happening in the last decades is that

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289
happening in the last decades is that
 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.740
happening in the last decades is that
people communicate enormous ly better

than they used to so that when there is

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139
than they used to so that when there is
 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.610
than they used to so that when there is
a problem in Fiji then the whole the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620
a problem in Fiji then the whole the
 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.860
a problem in Fiji then the whole the
rest the world knows about it when there

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870
rest the world knows about it when there

is an earthquake in Haiti then within a

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409
is an earthquake in Haiti then within a
 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.350

few hours everybody in the world knows

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360
few hours everybody in the world knows
 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.589
few hours everybody in the world knows
about it and is rushing to help and one

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599
about it and is rushing to help and one
 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.029
about it and is rushing to help and one
of the consequences of that sort of

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039
of the consequences of that sort of
 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.249
of the consequences of that sort of
communication ability is that the

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259
communication ability is that the
 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.770
communication ability is that the
dispossessed get a little bit more power

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780
dispossessed get a little bit more power
 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.469
dispossessed get a little bit more power
so in a general sense I feel that the

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479
so in a general sense I feel that the
 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.909
so in a general sense I feel that the
world is becoming increasingly

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
world is becoming increasingly
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.120
world is becoming increasingly
democratic there are more voices to

democratic there are more voices to
 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.649
democratic there are more voices to
those that traditionally would have had

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659
those that traditionally would have had
 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.659
those that traditionally would have had
very little power indeed and that's the

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669
very little power indeed and that's the
 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.120
very little power indeed and that's the
kind of dynamic that will help avert a

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130
kind of dynamic that will help avert a
 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.300

sense for us to work together

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669
 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.499
well in 1970 I was a newly minted

well in 1970 I was a newly minted
 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.749

undergraduate looking for a research
 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.920
undergraduate looking for a research
project and I discovered about the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930
project and I discovered about the
 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.350
project and I discovered about the
chimpanzee project and at that time I

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360
chimpanzee project and at that time I
 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.200
chimpanzee project and at that time I
was much more interested in questions

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210
was much more interested in questions
 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.739
was much more interested in questions
about what is responsible for species

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:06.749
about what is responsible for species
 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.320
about what is responsible for species

I was in anything particular about close

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319
I was in anything particular about close

relatives of humans I wasn't
particularly interested in chimpanzees

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490
particularly interested in chimpanzees

species and it was very lucky time

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860
species and it was very lucky time
 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.439
species and it was very lucky time
because Jane Goodall was looking for

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449
because Jane Goodall was looking for
 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.230
because Jane Goodall was looking for
people to help her in her study so I

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240
people to help her in her study so I
 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.879
people to help her in her study so I
wrote to her and three week three months

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:31.889
wrote to her and three week three months
 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.610
wrote to her and three week three months
later I think I was in Western Tanzania

at her site in in Gombe

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.040
she had a young son Grubb who was then

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050
she had a young son Grubb who was then
 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.550
she had a young son Grubb who was then
something like five or six years old and

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560
something like five or six years old and
 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.320
something like five or six years old and
so she was not spending much time at

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330
so she was not spending much time at
 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.260
so she was not spending much time at
this field site she was living mostly in

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.270
this field site she was living mostly in
 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.090

range of behaviors so as I walked about
 

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.869
range of behaviors so as I walked about
with chimpanzees I was seeing how they

00:10:07.869 --> 00:10:07.879
with chimpanzees I was seeing how they
 

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:10.359
with chimpanzees I was seeing how they
were interfacing with the forest in a

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:10.369
were interfacing with the forest in a
 

00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:14.669
were interfacing with the forest in a
very very direct way and seeing how they

00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:14.679
very very direct way and seeing how they
 

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:19.569
very very direct way and seeing how they
had their behavior shaped by this primal

00:10:19.569 --> 00:10:19.579
had their behavior shaped by this primal
 

00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:24.489
had their behavior shaped by this primal

were traveling per day the amount of
 

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:29.859
were traveling per day the amount of
energy that they had for social

you don't understand the way animals
 

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:58.059
you don't understand the way animals
experience the wild and I think also you

00:10:58.059 --> 00:10:58.069
experience the wild and I think also you
 

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:59.829

ancestors only a few thousand years ago
 

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.259
ancestors only a few thousand years ago
responded to the wild so it's a

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:05.269
responded to the wild so it's a
 

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:07.900

wonderful foundation for thinking about

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:07.910
wonderful foundation for thinking about
 

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.129
wonderful foundation for thinking about
the influence of the natural world on

the influence of the natural world on
 

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:14.229
the influence of the natural world on
the more complex richer forms of social

behavior

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:17.650
 

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.290
so one of the things that happens with

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.300
so one of the things that happens with
 

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.310
so one of the things that happens with
chimpanzees is that they they use sticks

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.320
chimpanzees is that they they use sticks
 

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.269
chimpanzees is that they they use sticks
a bit like toys and it turns out that

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279
a bit like toys and it turns out that
 

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:31.950
a bit like toys and it turns out that
the juvenile females use sticks in a way

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:31.960
the juvenile females use sticks in a way
 

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.750
the juvenile females use sticks in a way
that I suppose is rather unfamiliar to

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760
that I suppose is rather unfamiliar to
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.190
that I suppose is rather unfamiliar to
us but basically they just carry them

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200
us but basically they just carry them
 

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.930
us but basically they just carry them
around they'll just break off a stick

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:36.940
around they'll just break off a stick
 

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.600
around they'll just break off a stick
and and just carry it on their back on

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:39.610
and and just carry it on their back on
 

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.269
and and just carry it on their back on
their tummy keep it with them sit with

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279
their tummy keep it with them sit with
 

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:44.070
their tummy keep it with them sit with
it while they're feeding and then after

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.080
it while they're feeding and then after
 

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.510
it while they're feeding and then after
a few hours sometimes if just a few

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:45.520
a few hours sometimes if just a few
 

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.810
a few hours sometimes if just a few
minutes let it go males will break off a

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:48.820
minutes let it go males will break off a
 

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.300
minutes let it go males will break off a
stick and and then guess what males will

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:51.310
stick and and then guess what males will
 

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.390
stick and and then guess what males will
do with it they'll use it to hit others

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.400
do with it they'll use it to hit others
 

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.610
do with it they'll use it to hit others
or throw it at others so it's kind of

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:56.620
or throw it at others so it's kind of
 

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.590
or throw it at others so it's kind of
like kids in the playground you know

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600
like kids in the playground you know
 

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.540
like kids in the playground you know
they're not allowed any guns are not

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:00.550
they're not allowed any guns are not
 

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.329
they're not allowed any guns are not
allowed any dolls and what happens so

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339
allowed any dolls and what happens so
 

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:07.200
allowed any dolls and what happens so
they the boys will pick up a rock and

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.210
they the boys will pick up a rock and
 

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.150
they the boys will pick up a rock and
use it as a gun and the girls may pick

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160
use it as a gun and the girls may pick
 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.050
use it as a gun and the girls may pick
up a gun and use it as a doll

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060
up a gun and use it as a doll
 

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.970
up a gun and use it as a doll
well this gave the inspiration for a

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:17.980
well this gave the inspiration for a
 

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.750
well this gave the inspiration for a
study in which an undergraduate Rob

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760
study in which an undergraduate Rob
 

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.780
study in which an undergraduate Rob
Tennyson has tested what a baby does to

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:27.790
Tennyson has tested what a baby does to
 

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.140
Tennyson has tested what a baby does to
play with a balloon both before and

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:31.150
play with a balloon both before and
 

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:35.310
play with a balloon both before and
after it sees somebody hitting the

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320
after it sees somebody hitting the
 

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.490
after it sees somebody hitting the
balloon so this was a kind of shock

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:38.500
balloon so this was a kind of shock
 

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.449
balloon so this was a kind of shock
because first of all it turns out that

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:42.459
because first of all it turns out that
 

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:45.390
because first of all it turns out that
if you allow a baby to play with a

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:45.400
if you allow a baby to play with a
 

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.060
if you allow a baby to play with a
balloon and then allow it to watch both

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.070
balloon and then allow it to watch both
 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.090
balloon and then allow it to watch both
men hitting a balloon women hitting a

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.100
men hitting a balloon women hitting a
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.519
men hitting a balloon women hitting a
balloon men cradling a balloon women

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:53.529
balloon men cradling a balloon women
 

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:56.250
balloon men cradling a balloon women
cradling a balloon then what the babies

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:56.260
cradling a balloon then what the babies
 

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.210
cradling a balloon then what the babies
do is change their behavior in one

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:00.220
do is change their behavior in one
 

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.790
do is change their behavior in one
particular way girls don't change their

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800
particular way girls don't change their
 

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.530
particular way girls don't change their
behavior they hit the balloon before

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:04.540
behavior they hit the balloon before
 

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.940
behavior they hit the balloon before
watching they hit the balloon after

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:05.950
watching they hit the balloon after
 

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.610
watching they hit the balloon after
watching no difference the boys hit the

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:08.620
watching no difference the boys hit the
 

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.260
watching no difference the boys hit the
balloon before watching but after

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.270
balloon before watching but after
 

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.720
balloon before watching but after
watching then it turns out they hit the

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:12.730
watching then it turns out they hit the
 

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.019
watching then it turns out they hit the
balloon twice as much and what are they

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:16.029
balloon twice as much and what are they
 

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:18.720
balloon twice as much and what are they
watching while both boys and girls tend

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:18.730
watching while both boys and girls tend
 

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.430
watching while both boys and girls tend
to watch hitting more than cradling

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440
to watch hitting more than cradling
 

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.470
to watch hitting more than cradling
because hitting is just a little bit

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480
because hitting is just a little bit
 

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.970
because hitting is just a little bit
more exciting more interesting but

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:23.980
more exciting more interesting but
 

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.960
more exciting more interesting but
here's the amazing thing

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:24.970
here's the amazing thing
 

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:30.060
here's the amazing thing
the boys watched the man hitting and the

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.070
the boys watched the man hitting and the
 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.350
the boys watched the man hitting and the
more they watched the man

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360
more they watched the man
 

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.319
more they watched the man
hitting than the more they hit and the

00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:34.329
hitting than the more they hit and the
 

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:37.949
hitting than the more they hit and the
girls watched the woman hitting and the

00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959
girls watched the woman hitting and the
 

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:39.810
girls watched the woman hitting and the
more they watched the woman hitting the

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:39.820
more they watched the woman hitting the
 

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.060
more they watched the woman hitting the
more they hit so this is domestic

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.070
more they hit so this is domestic
 

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.340
more they hit so this is domestic

babies are picking up on their own

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600
babies are picking up on their own
 

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.750
babies are picking up on their own
gender and are responding by modeling

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:54.760
gender and are responding by modeling
 

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.240
gender and are responding by modeling
their behavior on their gender so it's a

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.250
their behavior on their gender so it's a
 

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.740
their behavior on their gender so it's a
wonderful interaction of biology and

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:58.750
wonderful interaction of biology and
 

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.630
wonderful interaction of biology and
culture because you know the boys are

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:00.640
culture because you know the boys are
 

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.130
culture because you know the boys are
hitting more than the girls as a

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.140
hitting more than the girls as a
 

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.710
hitting more than the girls as a
consequence of watching and so that's

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720
consequence of watching and so that's
 

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.300
consequence of watching and so that's
something from within you know that's

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.310
something from within you know that's
 

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.790
something from within you know that's
that's some biological system that is

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800
that's some biological system that is
 

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.350
that's some biological system that is
causing that and yet they've both been

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360
causing that and yet they've both been
 

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.120
causing that and yet they've both been
socialized because they're both saying

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.130
socialized because they're both saying
 

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.269
socialized because they're both saying
hey you know mommy or daddy is doing

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:26.490
 

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.600
well I mean uh when you look at primate

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.610
well I mean uh when you look at primate
 

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.160
well I mean uh when you look at primate
and we look at humans it's very clear

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.170
and we look at humans it's very clear
 

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.480
and we look at humans it's very clear
that in the majority of species

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.490
that in the majority of species
 

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.550

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.560
are in many ways more aggressive than
females and this aggression plays out in

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:39.570
females and this aggression plays out in
 

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.050
females and this aggression plays out in
a particular way so if you just talk

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060
a particular way so if you just talk
 

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.940
a particular way so if you just talk
about gossip if you just talk about the

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:45.950
about gossip if you just talk about the
 

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.139

relatively low level kinds of
 

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:49.670
relatively low level kinds of
aggressiveness actually there's there's

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680
aggressiveness actually there's there's
 

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.139

no difference between men and women

it's when the aggression is really

it's when the aggression is really
 

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.250
it's when the aggression is really

whereas in minor accidents men and women
 

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:20.750
whereas in minor accidents men and women
are are equally likely so there's all

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760
are are equally likely so there's all
 

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.579
are are equally likely so there's all
sorts of evidence that the men are more

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:22.589
sorts of evidence that the men are more
 

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:28.570
sorts of evidence that the men are more
violent than women and this is surely

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:28.580
violent than women and this is surely
 

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.790

the cooking is I mean a sense it's it's

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:11.730
the cooking is I mean a sense it's it's
 

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.150
the cooking is I mean a sense it's it's
old news but I think what's what's

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160
old news but I think what's what's
 

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.970
old news but I think what's what's
interesting about it is that only

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980
interesting about it is that only
 

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.650
interesting about it is that only
recently we started thinking about the

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660
recently we started thinking about the
 

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.020
recently we started thinking about the
fact that this really makes humans very

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.030
fact that this really makes humans very
 

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.700

different from our close relatives
 

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.370
different from our close relatives
because not close relatives you know you

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380
because not close relatives you know you
 

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.659
because not close relatives you know you
never get women couldn't for men

00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:26.669
never get women couldn't for men
 

00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:28.549
never get women couldn't for men
as it were I mean there's no for anybody

00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559
as it were I mean there's no for anybody
 

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:32.029
as it were I mean there's no for anybody
because and so here we have a radical

00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039
because and so here we have a radical
 

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.940

economy as we have it today then the
 

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.720
economy as we have it today then the
result is that you have this huge

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:47.730
result is that you have this huge
 

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.749

so in in the United States if you don't

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980
so in in the United States if you don't
 

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.220
so in in the United States if you don't
believe in evolutionary theory or if you

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.230
believe in evolutionary theory or if you
 

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.049
believe in evolutionary theory or if you
do believe in evolutionary theory then

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059
do believe in evolutionary theory then

do believe in evolutionary theory then
it means it's harder for you to commit

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559
it means it's harder for you to commit
 

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:45.470
it means it's harder for you to commit
yourself to a religious group that has

yourself to a religious group that has
huge significance and so I think the

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.330
huge significance and so I think the
 

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.080
huge significance and so I think the
answer to why it is that evolutionary

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.090
answer to why it is that evolutionary
 

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.750
answer to why it is that evolutionary
theory is difficult for people in the

theory is difficult for people in the
 

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.400
theory is difficult for people in the
States to believe is that religious

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:57.410
States to believe is that religious
 

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.830
States to believe is that religious
systems are so incredibly prevalent and

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840
systems are so incredibly prevalent and
 

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.110
systems are so incredibly prevalent and
why is that I guess I think it it

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120
why is that I guess I think it it
 

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.850
why is that I guess I think it it
something to do with the United States

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860
something to do with the United States
 

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.840
something to do with the United States
being a rural country and there's a lot

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:08.850
being a rural country and there's a lot
 

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.620
being a rural country and there's a lot
of association between rural living and

of association between rural living and
the importance of religious systems you

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700
the importance of religious systems you
 

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.430
the importance of religious systems you
see it in the Middle East

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440
see it in the Middle East
 

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:22.010
see it in the Middle East
you see it in Iran I suspect that as the

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020
you see it in Iran I suspect that as the
 

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.470
you see it in Iran I suspect that as the
world becomes more urbanized you know

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480
world becomes more urbanized you know
 

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.930
world becomes more urbanized you know
we've just passed the point where 50% of

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940
we've just passed the point where 50% of

we've just passed the point where 50% of
the world's population live in cities I

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.030
the world's population live in cities I
 

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.030
the world's population live in cities I
think as this tendency increases

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.040
think as this tendency increases
 

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.000
think as this tendency increases
probably the importance of religious

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.010
probably the importance of religious
 

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.910
probably the importance of religious
belief systems will start declining or

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:37.920
belief systems will start declining or
 

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.600
belief systems will start declining or
will continue to decline and that one of

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:41.610
will continue to decline and that one of
 

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.940
will continue to decline and that one of
the consequences will be that there will

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:43.950
the consequences will be that there will
 

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.080
the consequences will be that there will
be increasing willingness to accept even

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.090
be increasing willingness to accept even
 

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.240
be increasing willingness to accept even
those aspects of science that challenge

those aspects of science that challenge

those aspects of science that challenge

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.390
 

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.210
cooking is one of just the huge

00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220
cooking is one of just the huge
 

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.880
cooking is one of just the huge
influences on the availability of energy

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:02.890
influences on the availability of energy
 

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.789
influences on the availability of energy
and ultimately couldn't does much more

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799
and ultimately couldn't does much more
 

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:07.980
and ultimately couldn't does much more
than provide energy but the first great

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:07.990
than provide energy but the first great
 

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.640
than provide energy but the first great
thing it does which has not amazingly

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:11.650
thing it does which has not amazingly
 

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.370

been appreciated until very recently is

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.380
been appreciated until very recently is
 

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.169
been appreciated until very recently is
that cooking gives us more energy than

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:16.179
that cooking gives us more energy than
 

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:19.110
that cooking gives us more energy than
eating our food raw and when our

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120
eating our food raw and when our
 

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.020
eating our food raw and when our
ancestors first learned to cook then the

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.030
ancestors first learned to cook then the
 

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.570
ancestors first learned to cook then the
great huge initial impact would have

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:24.580
great huge initial impact would have
 

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.210
great huge initial impact would have
been that they got so much more energy

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:27.220
been that they got so much more energy
 

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.890
been that they got so much more energy
that they would have had more babies

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:28.900
that they would have had more babies
 

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.690
that they would have had more babies
than they had before and their babies

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:30.700
than they had before and their babies
 

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.370
than they had before and their babies
were to survive better and the adults

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:32.380
were to survive better and the adults
 

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.740
were to survive better and the adults
would have survived better simply

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:34.750
would have survived better simply
 

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.370
would have survived better simply
because they were able to eat more and

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380
because they were able to eat more and
 

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.240
because they were able to eat more and
have more regular menstrual cycles and

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.250
have more regular menstrual cycles and
 

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.010
have more regular menstrual cycles and
put more energy into the immune system

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:44.020
put more energy into the immune system
 

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.640
put more energy into the immune system
so the first big thing about cooking is

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:46.650
so the first big thing about cooking is
 

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.880
so the first big thing about cooking is
it gives us a huge increase but we don't

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:50.890
it gives us a huge increase but we don't
 

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.049
it gives us a huge increase but we don't
know yet how much but a big increase in

00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059
know yet how much but a big increase in
 

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:56.370
know yet how much but a big increase in
how much energy we get out of our food

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.380
how much energy we get out of our food
 

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.700
how much energy we get out of our food
when I was studying chimpanzees I would

when I was studying chimpanzees I would
 

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.260
when I was studying chimpanzees I would
normally take sandwiches with me but

normally take sandwiches with me but
there were days when one for one reason

there were days when one for one reason
 

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.220
there were days when one for one reason
or another I didn't and because I was

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.230
or another I didn't and because I was

studying the feeding behaviour of
 

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:11.220
studying the feeding behaviour of
chimpanzees I would regularly eat what

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:11.230
chimpanzees I would regularly eat what
 

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.560

they in fact I yet as everything that

with well the the short story is that I

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960
with well the the short story is that I
 

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.500
with well the the short story is that I
realized after a bit that I simply could

not get enough energy out of a
chimpanzee diet and then I started

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:53.169
chimpanzee diet and then I started
 

00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:55.409
chimpanzee diet and then I started
thinking well what what would be the

00:23:55.409 --> 00:23:55.419
thinking well what what would be the
 

00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:57.390
thinking well what what would be the
best place that you could get a raw diet

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400
best place that you could get a raw diet
 

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.120
best place that you could get a raw diet
in the wild and there may be better

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.130
in the wild and there may be better

places than a chimpanzee forest I don't

places than a chimpanzee forest I don't
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.780
places than a chimpanzee forest I don't
think there are many and this set me off

well because we were eating cooked food

well because we were eating cooked food
and the cook food was great for us we

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960
and the cook food was great for us we
 

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.930
and the cook food was great for us we
didn't need raw food anymore so get rid

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940
didn't need raw food anymore so get rid
 

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.909
didn't need raw food anymore so get rid
of the ability to do it and that's what

of the ability to do it and that's what

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:21.290
possibilities that relate the size of
 

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.010
possibilities that relate the size of
the brain to what has happened to the

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.020
the brain to what has happened to the
 

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.620
the brain to what has happened to the
reduction of our guts and the background

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:26.630
reduction of our guts and the background
 

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.590
reduction of our guts and the background
for this is that in order to understand

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600
for this is that in order to understand
 

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.960
for this is that in order to understand
how brains get big over evolutionary

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:31.970
how brains get big over evolutionary
 

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.750
how brains get big over evolutionary
time you have to think both about the

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760
time you have to think both about the
 

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.520
time you have to think both about the
advantages of being smart because that's

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:36.530
advantages of being smart because that's
 

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:41.170
advantages of being smart because that's
why of big brain of course and the costs

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:41.180
why of big brain of course and the costs
 

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.140
why of big brain of course and the costs
of fueling the brain because though our

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.150
of fueling the brain because though our
 

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.530
of fueling the brain because though our
brains are represent only was it 2.5

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:47.540
brains are represent only was it 2.5
 

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.930
brains are represent only was it 2.5
percent of our the weight of our body

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:49.940
percent of our the weight of our body
 

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.740
percent of our the weight of our body
they represent about 20% of our basal

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:53.750
they represent about 20% of our basal
 

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.500
they represent about 20% of our basal
metabolic rate so they are

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.510
metabolic rate so they are
 

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.610
metabolic rate so they are
disproportionately hungry in terms of

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:57.620
disproportionately hungry in terms of
 

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.070
disproportionately hungry in terms of
the amount of calories they consume and

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080
the amount of calories they consume and
 

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.810
the amount of calories they consume and
that means that to have a big brain you

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:01.820
that means that to have a big brain you
 

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.180
that means that to have a big brain you
have to supply calories to it at a high

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.190
have to supply calories to it at a high
 

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.510
have to supply calories to it at a high
rate so how do we do that well is it by

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520
rate so how do we do that well is it by
 

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.080
rate so how do we do that well is it by
having a high basal metabolic rate not

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.090
having a high basal metabolic rate not
 

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.590
having a high basal metabolic rate not
at all

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600
at all
 

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.270
at all
we have exactly the basal metabolic rate

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:13.280
we have exactly the basal metabolic rate
 

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.400
we have exactly the basal metabolic rate
expected of any other primate is it by

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.410
expected of any other primate is it by
 

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.310
expected of any other primate is it by
taking some of the energy that we use to

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320
taking some of the energy that we use to
 

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.170
taking some of the energy that we use to
feed some other organ and supplying it

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.180
feed some other organ and supplying it
 

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.810
feed some other organ and supplying it
to the brain yes it has to be so which

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:25.820
to the brain yes it has to be so which
 

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.690
to the brain yes it has to be so which
organ is it well in the primates the

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:28.700
organ is it well in the primates the
 

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.410
organ is it well in the primates the
only way that they can find energy to

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:32.420
only way that they can find energy to
 

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.020
only way that they can find energy to
give to their brains as it were is I

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.030
give to their brains as it were is I
 

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.940
give to their brains as it were is I
shouldn't say the only way but a major

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:36.950
shouldn't say the only way but a major
 

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.580
shouldn't say the only way but a major
way is through reduction of the size of

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:39.590
way is through reduction of the size of
 

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.860
way is through reduction of the size of
the gut those primates that happen to

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:41.870
the gut those primates that happen to
 

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.170
the gut those primates that happen to
have small guts because they happen to

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:44.180
have small guts because they happen to
 

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.830
have small guts because they happen to
be evolved to eat a high quality diet

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840
be evolved to eat a high quality diet
 

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.920
be evolved to eat a high quality diet
are able to have some spare energy that

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:50.930
are able to have some spare energy that
 

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.990
are able to have some spare energy that
they would have used for bits of the gut

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000
they would have used for bits of the gut
 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.030
they would have used for bits of the gut
they no longer have and they divert that

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:55.040
they no longer have and they divert that
 

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.580
they no longer have and they divert that
to the brain in other words primates the

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:57.590
to the brain in other words primates the
 

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.190
to the brain in other words primates the
small guts have big brains well we have

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200
small guts have big brains well we have
 

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.800
small guts have big brains well we have
the smallest guts of all we have the

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:02.810
the smallest guts of all we have the
 

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.110
the smallest guts of all we have the
biggest brains of all so it looks as

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120
biggest brains of all so it looks as
 

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.280
biggest brains of all so it looks as
though there's a connection there and

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:06.290
though there's a connection there and
 

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.380
though there's a connection there and
since the reason for our small guts is

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.390
since the reason for our small guts is
 

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.810
since the reason for our small guts is
the fact that we cook that suggests that

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:10.820
the fact that we cook that suggests that
 

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.910
the fact that we cook that suggests that
it's cooking that really facilitated

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:12.920
it's cooking that really facilitated
 

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.790
it's cooking that really facilitated
this and by the way the time when our

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:15.800
this and by the way the time when our
 

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.880
this and by the way the time when our
brain really takes off in in size it was

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:18.890
brain really takes off in in size it was
 

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.100
brain really takes off in in size it was
about two million years ago the reason

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.110
about two million years ago the reason
 

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.120
about two million years ago the reason
that it looks as though we started

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.130
that it looks as though we started
 

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.310
that it looks as though we started
cooking about two million years ago is

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320
cooking about two million years ago is
 

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.550
cooking about two million years ago is
that it's it's around that time 1.9 that

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:27.560
that it's it's around that time 1.9 that
 

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.340
that it's it's around that time 1.9 that
you first see evidence of

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:30.350
you first see evidence of
 

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.269
you first see evidence of
our ancestors having two signals that

00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279
our ancestors having two signals that
 

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:38.320
our ancestors having two signals that
are associated with a regard and that is

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:38.330
are associated with a regard and that is
 

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.360
are associated with a regard and that is
a narrower ribcage and a narrower pelvis

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:42.370
a narrower ribcage and a narrower pelvis
 

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.870
a narrower ribcage and a narrower pelvis
in addition you have for the first time

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880
in addition you have for the first time
 

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.850
in addition you have for the first time
or note not the first time at that point

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.860
or note not the first time at that point
 

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.340
or note not the first time at that point
you have the biggest drop in the history

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:51.350
you have the biggest drop in the history
 

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.080
you have the biggest drop in the history
of human evolution in the size of the

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.090
of human evolution in the size of the
 

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.480
of human evolution in the size of the
teeth and chewing teeth

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:55.490
teeth and chewing teeth
 

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.159
teeth and chewing teeth
well that's associated with another

00:29:57.159 --> 00:29:57.169
well that's associated with another
 

00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:59.379
well that's associated with another
effect of cooking which is it makes your

00:29:59.379 --> 00:29:59.389
effect of cooking which is it makes your
 

00:29:59.389 --> 00:30:01.960
effect of cooking which is it makes your
food softer and because it makes you

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:01.970
food softer and because it makes you
 

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.789
food softer and because it makes you
food softer you don't need big teeth

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799
food softer you don't need big teeth
 

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:06.399
food softer you don't need big teeth
small teeth seems to be an advantage

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:06.409
small teeth seems to be an advantage
 

00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:09.340
small teeth seems to be an advantage
because maybe because they're less

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:09.350
because maybe because they're less
 

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.340
because maybe because they're less
easily damaged and big teeth so that

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.350
easily damaged and big teeth so that
 

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.139
easily damaged and big teeth so that
happens then and there was a third thing

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:14.149
happens then and there was a third thing
 

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:15.549
happens then and there was a third thing
that happens around the same time which

00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559
that happens around the same time which
 

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:17.950
that happens around the same time which
is that this is the point in our

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960
is that this is the point in our
 

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.590
is that this is the point in our
evolution when we stopped being a plike

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600
evolution when we stopped being a plike
 

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.409
evolution when we stopped being a plike
in the sense that we abandoned the the

00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:25.419
in the sense that we abandoned the the
 

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:29.680
in the sense that we abandoned the the
morphology of the shoulder and the upper

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:29.690
morphology of the shoulder and the upper
 

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.830
morphology of the shoulder and the upper
arms that allowed us to climb now for

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840
arms that allowed us to climb now for
 

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.100
arms that allowed us to climb now for
the first time why we look like us and

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.110
the first time why we look like us and
 

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.539
the first time why we look like us and
that means that we're not very good at

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:37.549
that means that we're not very good at
 

00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:41.350
that means that we're not very good at
climbing in trees well that means that

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360
climbing in trees well that means that
 

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.129
climbing in trees well that means that
we stepped on the ground and how are you

00:30:45.129 --> 00:30:45.139
we stepped on the ground and how are you
 

00:30:45.139 --> 00:30:47.350
we stepped on the ground and how are you
going to sleep on the ground in the

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360
going to sleep on the ground in the
 

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.060
going to sleep on the ground in the
middle of Africa with elephants and

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.070
middle of Africa with elephants and
 

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.769
middle of Africa with elephants and
rhinoceroses and lions and leopards

around the only way that you would be

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720
around the only way that you would be
 

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.240
around the only way that you would be
willing to sleep on that like that

willing to sleep on that like that
nowadays is by the fire if you're out in

00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039
nowadays is by the fire if you're out in
 

00:30:58.039 --> 00:31:00.490
nowadays is by the fire if you're out in
the open and so that suggests that that

was a time when our ancestors first

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:03.350
was a time when our ancestors first

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.220
the ground lose the climbing adaptations
softened the food get the teeth smaller

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:12.230
softened the food get the teeth smaller

taking some food off the fire as soon as
 

00:35:36.009 --> 00:35:39.239
taking some food off the fire as soon as
the cooks back is turned and you see

small-scale societies the the bachelors
 

00:35:44.799 --> 00:35:49.140
small-scale societies the the bachelors
are are thin and and hungry and nobody's

there to cook for them and they have a
 

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:54.959
there to cook for them and they have a
problem and the married men are superior

problem and the married men are superior
 

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:57.690
problem and the married men are superior
to them and kind of keep them down so

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:57.700
to them and kind of keep them down so
 

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.849
to them and kind of keep them down so
that's one of the dynamics but it means

00:35:59.849 --> 00:35:59.859
that's one of the dynamics but it means
 

00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:01.859
that's one of the dynamics but it means
that it's great for husbands and wives

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:01.869
that it's great for husbands and wives
 

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:03.089
that it's great for husbands and wives
to eat together and of course the

00:36:03.089 --> 00:36:03.099
to eat together and of course the
 

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:05.279
to eat together and of course the
children are there and then it can

00:36:05.279 --> 00:36:05.289
children are there and then it can
 

00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:07.739
children are there and then it can
extend easily to others in the camp and

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:07.749
extend easily to others in the camp and
 

00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:10.319
extend easily to others in the camp and
suddenly got a rosy feeling and and now

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:10.329
suddenly got a rosy feeling and and now
 

00:36:10.329 --> 00:36:12.599
suddenly got a rosy feeling and and now
now you can afford maybe in a sort of

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:12.609
now you can afford maybe in a sort of
 

00:36:12.609 --> 00:36:14.519
now you can afford maybe in a sort of
regulated way to give food out to those

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:14.529
regulated way to give food out to those
 

00:36:14.529 --> 00:36:18.950
regulated way to give food out to those
that don't have it

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.079
I don't know how the numeration ships

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:21.089
I don't know how the numeration ships
 

00:36:21.089 --> 00:36:22.760
I don't know how the numeration ships
are going or where they will go I just

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:22.770
are going or where they will go I just
 

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.500
are going or where they will go I just
think there's going to be many fewer

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:24.510
think there's going to be many fewer
 

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.599
think there's going to be many fewer
constraints in the future there I think

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:26.609
constraints in the future there I think
 

00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:28.310
constraints in the future there I think
in the past this has been a major

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320
in the past this has been a major
 

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.980
in the past this has been a major
constraint the fact that you needed to

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:30.990
constraint the fact that you needed to
 

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.530
constraint the fact that you needed to
have somebody in the household cooking

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540
have somebody in the household cooking
 

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.320
have somebody in the household cooking
for others and it was the women for I

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:36.330
for others and it was the women for I
 

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.329
for others and it was the women for I
think reasons because men were able to

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339
think reasons because men were able to
 

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:41.060
think reasons because men were able to
get away with it that is increasingly

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.070
get away with it that is increasingly
 

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.210
get away with it that is increasingly
going to go away and isn't that great

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:43.220
going to go away and isn't that great
 

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.710
going to go away and isn't that great
you know we can get away from one

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720
you know we can get away from one
 

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.920
you know we can get away from one
particular source of of sexist

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:48.930
particular source of of sexist
 

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:53.300
particular source of of sexist
unfairness and I think it heralds a a

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:53.310
unfairness and I think it heralds a a
 

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.820
unfairness and I think it heralds a a
much more exciting world in which women

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:55.830
much more exciting world in which women
 

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.450
much more exciting world in which women
are able to participate in the the

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:58.460
are able to participate in the the
 

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.770
are able to participate in the the
professions and the life of the

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780
professions and the life of the
 

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.349
professions and the life of the
community to a far greater extent than

community to a far greater extent than
 

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:07.730
community to a far greater extent than
before

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740
 

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.359
very bothered by the fact that humans

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:11.369
very bothered by the fact that humans
 

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:14.480
very bothered by the fact that humans
have not taken on board the degree to

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.490
have not taken on board the degree to
 

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:19.310
have not taken on board the degree to
which we are a dangerous species there's

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320
which we are a dangerous species there's
 

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.660
which we are a dangerous species there's
a very wide sense that the default

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:23.670
a very wide sense that the default
 

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.470
a very wide sense that the default
conditions for humans if no bad person

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480
conditions for humans if no bad person
 

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.570
conditions for humans if no bad person
comes along is that we'll all live in

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:29.580
comes along is that we'll all live in
 

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.890
comes along is that we'll all live in
peace together I'm kept up at night by

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:33.900
peace together I'm kept up at night by
 

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.000
peace together I'm kept up at night by
the notion that that's a dangerous

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.010
the notion that that's a dangerous
 

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.960
the notion that that's a dangerous
concept because it underestimates the

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:41.970
concept because it underestimates the
 

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.160
concept because it underestimates the
propensity for things going wrong and

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:45.170
propensity for things going wrong and
 

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:48.770
propensity for things going wrong and
I'm hoping that just as more more people

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780
I'm hoping that just as more more people
 

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.090
I'm hoping that just as more more people
will understand evolutionary theory

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:50.100
will understand evolutionary theory
 

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.400
will understand evolutionary theory
where we come from and be real about us

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:52.410
where we come from and be real about us
 

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.050
where we come from and be real about us
in that way more and more people will

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060
in that way more and more people will
 

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.120
in that way more and more people will
appreciate that we do have to take into

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.130
appreciate that we do have to take into
 

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.500
appreciate that we do have to take into
account our aggressive propensity

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:57.510
account our aggressive propensity
 

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:00.410
account our aggressive propensity
because when you do that then you can

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420
because when you do that then you can
 

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.420
because when you do that then you can
design a safe world then you can

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:02.430
design a safe world then you can
 

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.859
design a safe world then you can
recognize when dangers coming so just as

00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:05.869
recognize when dangers coming so just as
 

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:08.359
recognize when dangers coming so just as
people do recognize that men are

00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:08.369
people do recognize that men are
 

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:10.520
people do recognize that men are
dangerous as potential rapists and we

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:10.530
dangerous as potential rapists and we
 

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.170
dangerous as potential rapists and we
take back the night and we don't allow

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180
take back the night and we don't allow
 

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.980
take back the night and we don't allow
people to have dark areas in cities

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:15.990
people to have dark areas in cities
 

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.430
people to have dark areas in cities
where it's simply foolhardy for a young

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440
where it's simply foolhardy for a young
 

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.620
where it's simply foolhardy for a young
woman to walk alone so life is safer if

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:24.630
woman to walk alone so life is safer if
 

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.890
woman to walk alone so life is safer if
we recognize the dangers and anticipate

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900
we recognize the dangers and anticipate
 

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.180
we recognize the dangers and anticipate
them and that way we got a great future

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.190
 

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.290
well in the same way that we're doing

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:35.300
well in the same way that we're doing
 

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.020
well in the same way that we're doing
now I mean look what happened in Kenya

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.030
now I mean look what happened in Kenya
 

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.720
now I mean look what happened in Kenya
in 2008 you know there was a contested

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:40.730
in 2008 you know there was a contested
 

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.990
in 2008 you know there was a contested
election and stomache 2,000 people died

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000
election and stomache 2,000 people died
 

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.510
election and stomache 2,000 people died
and that could have turned into a Rondon

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520
and that could have turned into a Rondon
 

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.060
and that could have turned into a Rondon
genocide but actually there was huge

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.070
genocide but actually there was huge
 

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.390
genocide but actually there was huge
intervention and it was resented by the

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400
intervention and it was resented by the
 

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.270
intervention and it was resented by the
president of Kenya but people slowly

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280
president of Kenya but people slowly
 

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.450
president of Kenya but people slowly
came in with a single voice led by Kofi

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:58.460
came in with a single voice led by Kofi
 

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.370
came in with a single voice led by Kofi
Annan and said look you know we

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:00.380
Annan and said look you know we
 

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.430
Annan and said look you know we
recognize a tremendous danger here we

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440
recognize a tremendous danger here we
 

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.970
recognize a tremendous danger here we
really care they worked for an intense

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:06.980
really care they worked for an intense
 

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.060
really care they worked for an intense
couple of months in particular and what

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.070
couple of months in particular and what
 

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.850
couple of months in particular and what
happens you end up with the president

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:12.860
happens you end up with the president
 

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.590
happens you end up with the president
and the prime minister from the rival

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:14.600
and the prime minister from the rival
 

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.060
and the prime minister from the rival
parties and they're working together

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.070
parties and they're working together
 

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:18.280
parties and they're working together
doesn't mean that peace will always

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.290
doesn't mean that peace will always
 

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.140
doesn't mean that peace will always
happen there there may be further

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.150
happen there there may be further
 

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.650
happen there there may be further
conflict but people are sensitive now to

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:23.660
conflict but people are sensitive now to
 

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.080
conflict but people are sensitive now to
the dangers and and that's what I think

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.090
the dangers and and that's what I think
 

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.960
the dangers and and that's what I think
is really important
