00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:02.385
- Scarlett and Hansol's teacher gave them

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.369
a system of linear equations to solve.

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:05.922
They each took a few steps that lead

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.825
to the systems shown in the table below.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:08.788
So this is the teacher system.

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.308
This is what Scarlett got
after taking some steps.

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:12.909
This is what Hansol got.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.106
Which of them obtained a system

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.019
that is equivalent to
the teacher's system?

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.681
And just to remind ourselves,

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.701
an equivalent system is a system

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:21.303
that has, or at least for our purposes,

00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:23.822
is a system that has the same solution,

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:25.320
or the same solution set.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.898
So if there is a certain xy

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:28.268
that satisfies this system

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:31.160
in order for Scarlett's
system to be equivalent

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.458
it needs to have the same solution.

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:34.967
So let's look at this.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.406
So Scarlett, let's see,

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:39.159
let's see if we can match these up.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.465
So her second equation here,

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.473
so this is interesting,

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:49.235
her second equation 14x - 7y = 2

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.813
over here the teacher has an equation

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:54.133
14x - 7y = 7.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.745
So this is interesting because the ratio

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:59.334
between x and y is the same,

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.354
but then your constant term,

00:01:01.354 --> 00:01:04.744
the constant term is
going to be different.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.114
And I would make the claim

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:09.109
that this alone tells you
that Scarlett's system

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.629
is not equivalent to the teacher.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.624
And you're saying, well,
how can I say that?

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:16.690
Well, these two equations if you were

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.128
to write them into slope intercept form,

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:20.590
you would see because the ratio

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.895
between x and y, the x
and y terms is the same.

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:25.637
You're going to have the same slope,

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:27.273
but you're going to have
different Y intercepts.

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:28.690
In fact, we can actually solve for that.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.072
So this equation right over here

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:32.927
we can write it as if we, let's see,

00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:35.133
if we subtract 14x from both sides

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.761
you get -7y - 14,

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.721
woops, -7y =,

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.892
is equal to -14x + 7

00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:47.749
and we could divide both sides by -7.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.485
You get y = 2x -1 so that's this...

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.321
All I did is algebraically
manipulate this.

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.643
This is this line and I could even try

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:58.046
to graph it so let's do that.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:00.484
So I'll draw a quick coordinate.

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:02.087
This is just going to be very rough.

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.084
Quick coordinate axis right over there,

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:06.138
and then this line,

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:08.901
this line would look something like this.

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.457
So its y intercept is -1
and it has a slope of 2.

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:16.196
So let me draw a line with a slope of,

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:19.071
a line with a slope of 2 might look

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.493
something like that.

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.935
So that's this line right over here

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.499
or this one right over there,

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.753
and let's see.

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.992
This one over here is going to be,

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:35.058
if we do the same algebra,

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.296
we're going to have

00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:41.156
- 7y = -14x + 2,

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.028
or y = , I'm just
dividing everything by -7,

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:49.423
2x - 2/7

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:52.018
so this is going to look
something like this.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:56.522
Its y intercept is -2/7 so
it's like right over there.

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:59.401
So this line is going
to look something like,

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:00.377
I'm going to draw my best,

00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.791
my best attempt at drawing it,

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:05.257
it's going to look something...

00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:07.294
Actually that's not quite right.

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.462
It's going to look something like...

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.551
I'll actually just start
it right over here.

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.082
It's going to look something like,

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:14.592
something like this.

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:16.228
It's going to have the same slope,

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.608
and obviously it goes in
this direction as well.

00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:20.686
Actually, let me just draw that.

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:22.706
So it's going to have the same slope,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.643
but at different y intercepts.

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:27.744
That doesn't look right,
but you get the idea.

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:29.509
These two lines are parallel.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.507
So these two lines are parallel

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:33.386
so any coordinate that satisfies this one

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:34.942
is not going to satisfy this one.

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.868
They have no points in common.

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:37.786
They are parallel.

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.166
That's the definition of parallel.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.567
Since this and this have
no points in common,

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.448
there's no way that some solution set

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.503
that satisfies this would satisfy this

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:49.964
'cause any xy that satisfies this

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:52.448
can't satisfy this or vice versa.

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:53.249
They're parallel.

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.364
There are no points.

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:56.824
These two things will never intersect.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:00.006
So Scarlett does not have
an equivalent system.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.502
Now what about Hansol?

00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:04.104
Well, we see Hansol has the same thing

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:05.346
going on here.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:09.688
5x - y, 5x - y, but then the constant term

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:13.101
is different, -6, positive 3.

00:04:13.101 --> 00:04:16.502
So this and this also
represent parallel lines.

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:19.091
Any xy pair that satisfies this,

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.204
there's no way that it's
going to satisfy this.

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:23.003
These two lines don't intersect.

00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:24.489
They are parallel.

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:28.651
So Hansol's system is
not equivalent either.
