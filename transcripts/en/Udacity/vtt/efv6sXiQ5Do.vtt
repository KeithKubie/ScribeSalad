00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To solve this problem, I started with a force diagram

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and this green square here is going to represent our green car.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As always, we have the weight force pushing down mg

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we also have each of the four springs pushing up on a car.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We have four separate spring forces here, four forces pushing up on the car.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In order for this car body to be at rest not accelerating,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it must be the case that these four forces from the springs combine

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
must perfectly balance the weight force mg.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can now say that four times the force of one spring must be equal to the weight force.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Using Hooke's law here and then doing a little bit of algebra

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we find that the change in x the distance away from the equilibrium point

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that these springs get pushed is equal to mg/4&lt;i&gt;K for one of the springs.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And plugging in values for all these constants, I find that Î”x is equal to 5 cm. Good work!
