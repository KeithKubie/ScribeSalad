stuck there with your damn imagination

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
stuck there with your damn imagination
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.660
stuck there with your damn imagination
freaking out it's like and if that's not

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
freaking out it's like and if that's not
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340
freaking out it's like and if that's not
and then maybe you have a heart attacks

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
and then maybe you have a heart attacks
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990
and then maybe you have a heart attacks
because you're so terrified and you die

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
because you're so terrified and you die
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.590
because you're so terrified and you die
it's like you know so that's the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
it's like you know so that's the
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.190
it's like you know so that's the
elevator

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
elevator
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630
elevator
well it's no bloody wonder there no

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
well it's no bloody wonder there no
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100
well it's no bloody wonder there no
one's gonna get into something like that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
one's gonna get into something like that
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750
one's gonna get into something like that
and then maybe underneath that is your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
and then maybe underneath that is your
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.119
and then maybe underneath that is your
distrust in the mechanisms of society

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
distrust in the mechanisms of society
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.540
distrust in the mechanisms of society
right because you know a normal person

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
right because you know a normal person
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180
right because you know a normal person
those weird creatures they'll get an

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
those weird creatures they'll get an
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709
those weird creatures they'll get an
elevator what the hell they don't care

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
elevator what the hell they don't care
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209
elevator what the hell they don't care
and partly it's because they have an

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
and partly it's because they have an
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.329
and partly it's because they have an
implicit belief even if the thing stops

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
implicit belief even if the thing stops
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.590
implicit belief even if the thing stops
somebody will come along and rescue them

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
somebody will come along and rescue them
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300
somebody will come along and rescue them
and usually you don't even think about

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
and usually you don't even think about
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.660
and usually you don't even think about
it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
it
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399
it
right it's like no what the hell it's an

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
right it's like no what the hell it's an
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.880
right it's like no what the hell it's an
elevator it's like the danger is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
elevator it's like the danger is
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.850
elevator it's like the danger is
invisible to you and it's partly because

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
invisible to you and it's partly because
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920
invisible to you and it's partly because
you implicitly trust the structure and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
you implicitly trust the structure and
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.690
you implicitly trust the structure and
so maybe you go into the unconscious

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
so maybe you go into the unconscious
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149
so maybe you go into the unconscious
presuppositions of the person who is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
presuppositions of the person who is
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160
presuppositions of the person who is
terrified of the elevator in the subways

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
terrified of the elevator in the subways
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.359
terrified of the elevator in the subways
and you find out they have a real

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
and you find out they have a real
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.280
and you find out they have a real
problem with trusting Authority that's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
problem with trusting Authority that's
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.630
problem with trusting Authority that's
partly why they don't get along with

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
partly why they don't get along with
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160
partly why they don't get along with
their husband why they've never been

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
their husband why they've never been
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380
their husband why they've never been
able to stand up for themselves so then

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
able to stand up for themselves so then
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420
able to stand up for themselves so then
you say okay well you're afraid of the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
you say okay well you're afraid of the
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859
you say okay well you're afraid of the
damn elevator but it's not an elevator

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
damn elevator but it's not an elevator
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.350
damn elevator but it's not an elevator
it's a tomb and the tomb is partly you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
it's a tomb and the tomb is partly you
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.569
it's a tomb and the tomb is partly you
and partly it's partly the elevator and

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
and partly it's partly the elevator and
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300
and partly it's partly the elevator and
partly your unconscious mind and so well

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
partly your unconscious mind and so well
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399
partly your unconscious mind and so well
what can you handle can you go and look

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
what can you handle can you go and look
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859
what can you handle can you go and look
at an elevator from 10 feet away it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
at an elevator from 10 feet away it's
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.920

four and a half feet we're gonna go from
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780
four and a half feet we're gonna go from
that elevator we're gonna look at the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
that elevator we're gonna look at the
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149
that elevator we're gonna look at the
damn thing until you're bored of it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
damn thing until you're bored of it
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950
damn thing until you're bored of it

because that's what we're trying to you
should be bored of the elevator because

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
should be bored of the elevator because
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.029
should be bored of the elevator because
then you're not afraid of it obviously

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
then you're not afraid of it obviously
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.130
then you're not afraid of it obviously
it's like it's an elevator you just

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
it's like it's an elevator you just
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.440
it's like it's an elevator you just
don't notice it right all these things

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
don't notice it right all these things
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790

most of you there's not a chance you'd
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.080
most of you there's not a chance you'd
be able to identify the gender of the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
be able to identify the gender of the
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180
be able to identify the gender of the
person who's sitting next to you unless

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
person who's sitting next to you unless
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.440
person who's sitting next to you unless
you know them it's like you just don't

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
you know them it's like you just don't
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.540
you know them it's like you just don't
remember anything and why should you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
remember anything and why should you
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.760
remember anything and why should you
everything works like you don't have to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
everything works like you don't have to
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.150
everything works like you don't have to
pay attention to it it's like is that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
pay attention to it it's like is that
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.870
pay attention to it it's like is that
staying up yeah it's still up yeah still

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
staying up yeah it's still up yeah still
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.220
staying up yeah it's still up yeah still
up still up if it's like really no you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
up still up if it's like really no you
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.660
up still up if it's like really no you
know you get bored of that real quick

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
know you get bored of that real quick
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.970
know you get bored of that real quick
and so then you just ignore it and but

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
and so then you just ignore it and but
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.330
and so then you just ignore it and but
the agoraphobic has had that veil of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
the agoraphobic has had that veil of
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.190
the agoraphobic has had that veil of
ignorance torn away and what they see

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
ignorance torn away and what they see
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.380
ignorance torn away and what they see
behind it is mortal threat and so that's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
behind it is mortal threat and so that's
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.670
behind it is mortal threat and so that's
really what you're helping them deal

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
really what you're helping them deal
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.700
really what you're helping them deal
with and so this week there are four and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
with and so this week there are four and
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.110
with and so this week there are four and
a half feet from the elevator next week

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
a half feet from the elevator next week
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.460
a half feet from the elevator next week
they're a foot from the elevator in the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
they're a foot from the elevator in the
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.950
they're a foot from the elevator in the
week after that the horrible gates of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960
week after that the horrible gates of
 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.380
week after that the horrible gates of
Hell open and they look inside and they

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
Hell open and they look inside and they
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.960
Hell open and they look inside and they
don't run and so hey they're tougher

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
don't run and so hey they're tougher
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.610
don't run and so hey they're tougher
than they thought they were and that's
