Do you remember in the first lesson when I was pretty scared of that snake?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.710
Well, it's a pretty common fear to have. But there's another animal that I'm

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.824
not scared of, that a lot of people are afraid of. And that's sharks, I love

00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.304
sharks. One of the main reasons why I love sharks is because my big brother

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:17.706
Jay, is a professional shark diver. He takes me diving with him. He sends me

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:21.321
awesome pictures of him and sharks. And tells me how much he enjoys swimming

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.200
with these beautiful creatures.
