00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.830
We're asked to solve for x.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.560
Let me just rewrite
this equation

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.550
so that the absolute
values really pop out.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:12.210
So this is 8 times the
absolute value of x plus 7

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.140
plus 4-- in that same color--
is equal to negative 6 times

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.475
the absolute value
of x plus 7 plus 6.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.965
Now the key here-- at first
it looks kind of daunting.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.900
It's this complex equation.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.664
You have these
absolute values in it.

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.080
But the way to
think about this is

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.642
if you could solve for the
absolute value expression,

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:39.100
you could then-- it then turns
into a much simpler problem,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.710
then you can take it from there.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.500
So you could almost treat this
expression-- the absolute value

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130
of x plus 7, you can just
treat it as a variable,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.610
and then once you
solve for that,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.940
it becomes a simpler
absolute value problem.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
So let's try to do that.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.910
Let's try to solve
for not x first.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.632
We're just going to solve for
the absolute value of x plus 7.

00:00:57.632 --> 00:00:58.590
You'll see what I mean.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.309
So I want to get all of the
absolute values of x plus 7

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.100
on the left-hand side,
so I want to get rid

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.970
of this one on the
right-hand side.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.910
Easiest way to get
rid of it is to add

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.606
6 times the absolute value of x
plus 7 to the right-hand side.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:16.980
We can't, of course, only do
that to the right-hand side.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.650
If these two things
are equal and we

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.644
are being told
that they are, then

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:22.060
if you add something
on this side,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.726
the only way that the
equality will hold

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:25.660
is if you still do it
on the left-hand side.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.650
So let's do that, so plus 6
times the absolute value of x

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.220
plus 7.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.740
And I want to get all
of these constant terms

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.920
on to the right-hand side.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.410
So I want to get rid
of this positive 4.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.797
Easiest way is to subtract
4 right over there,

00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:43.380
but if we do it on
the left-hand side,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
we have to do it on the
right-hand side as well.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.710
And so what does this get us?

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.620
So our left-hand side, if
I have 8 of something--

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.580
and in this case the something
is absolute values of x plus

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.430
7's-- but if I have 8 of
something and I add 6 of that

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.720
same something, I now
have 14 of that something.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.360
So that's going to be
14 absolute values of x

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.596
plus 7, 14 times the
absolute value of x plus 7.

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:16.330
The 4 and the negative 4 cancel
out, and that was intentional.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.930
The negative 6 and the
6 x plus 7's cancel out,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.250
or absolute values of
x plus 7's cancel out,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.650
and that was intentional.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.080
And then we're left with 6
minus 4, which is just 2.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.720
So that's going
to be equal to 2.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.350
Now just as promised,
we want to solve

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590
for the absolute
value of x plus 7,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.970
so let's divide both
sides by 14 to get rid

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.459
of that coefficient
there, or that factor,

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.500
or whatever you want to
call it, the thing that's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200
multiplying the absolute
value of x plus 7.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.930
So we'll divide
both sides by 14,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.860
and we are left with
the absolute value

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.410
of x plus 7 is equal to 2/14.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.500
They're both divisible by 2, so
this is the same thing as 1/7.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.140
So just as promised,
we've now solved

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.180
for the absolute
value of x plus 7,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.050
but we really need
to solve for x.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.300
So how can we
reason through this?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.460
So if I take the absolute value
of something and I got you 1/7,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.320
there's two possible things that
I took the absolute value of.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.850
I could have taken the
absolute value of positive 1/7,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.770
or I could've taken the
absolute value of negative 1/7.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.900
So this thing that we're
taking the absolute value

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.360
of-- so x plus 7-- could
be equal to positive 1/7,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.600
or x plus 7 could be
equal to negative 1/7.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.580
And just think about
that for a second.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.410
If this thing right over
here were equal to 1/7,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.870
you take its absolute
value, it'd be 1/7.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.090
If this thing was negative 1/7,
you take its absolute value,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.590
it would be positive 1/7.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.390
So that's how we got this.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.470
So now let's just solve for x.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.550
So if we subtract
7 from both sides

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.160
for this left-hand
equation, we get

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.570
x is equal to 1/7
minus-- and 7 we

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:17.640
can rewrite as 49/7, which
is equal to negative 48/7.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.829
So that's one possibility for x.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.600
And then the other
possibility we

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.680
would get x is equal to-- so we
have negative 1/7 minus 49/7.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.670
We're just subtracting
7 from both sides.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.770
That's what 49/7 is.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.170
And then this gets
us to negative 50/7.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.640
So the two solutions
to this what we thought

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.850
was a complicated
equation are negative

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.130
48/7 and negative 50/7.
