00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.000
Recall that the equation for a normal distribution is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.800
1 over root 2 pi sigma squared, e to the

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.170
minus x minus mu quantity squared, over 2 sigma squared,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.570
where mu is the mean and sigma is the standard

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860
deviation. Sigma squared is the variance. If we know

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.270
the form of this equation. It's not hard to look

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.980
at all of these equations and figure out the values

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.580
for the mean. Standard deviation and variance. They are five,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.090
12, and 144. Zero, five,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.290
and 25. Eight, one, and one. And zero, one, and one.
