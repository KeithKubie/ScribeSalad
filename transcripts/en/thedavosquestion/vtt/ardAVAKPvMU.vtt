KOHEI NISHIYAMA &gt;&gt; Hi, this is Kohei Nishiyama.
Ah-I'm the founder of CUUSOO dot com based

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.400
in Japan. And-um-the question was should CEO
have an ethic like a doctor or-or lawyer.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.370
Um-the answer is yes but-um-you know-CEO could
be-be different in their styles. So I would

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:31.470
say-ah-um-yes, but like I would advise CEO
to know more about their end users and if

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.250
they know what their end users are doing expecting
their expectations of company and CEO, then

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.630
the code of conduct should be really easy
to understand for each CEOs and then that

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.540
feeling should be that ethical base for the
CEO.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.690
So my answer to-to the question should CEOs
have an ethical code, the answer is yes. Just

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.600
by knowing their users, they can meet their
expectations.
