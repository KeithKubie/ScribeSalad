00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.210
During a lecture on his newly
discovered alkali metals,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.240
Humphry Davy gave a dramatic
demonstration as to the possible origin

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.520
of the force of a volcanic eruption.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.900
Knighted just the day before,
Sir Humphry gave his lecture

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.570
to a packed audience right here
in the lecture theatre of the Royal Institution,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
where a young Michael Faraday
was sat at the back taking notes.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.040
Faraday's notebook, which he
presented to Davy, is an important record

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.590
since Davy himself did not leave accurate
details of his demonstration lectures.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.680
This is Faradays' account of the lecture
given by Davy on Friday 10th April 1812,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.080
where he describes Davy's experiment
to simulate the volcanic eruption.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.480
It consisted of a miniature volcano.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.480
He had built upon a square board
a pile of earth and stones

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.800
in the form of a mountain crater.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Openings and fissures were left
in the top and the sides of this mountain

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.100
in which was put
pieces of the metal potassium.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.259
Sir Humphry Davy took a bottle of water

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.640
and poured some of its
contents into the fissures.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.200
The beauty and violence
of this demonstration

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.299
depends on the incredibly
reactive metal potassium

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.960
that Davy had discovered
just a few years before.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.000
Its reaction with water produces
the flammable gas hydrogen

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.200
and it also burns in the air
with this beautiful purple flame.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.709
Although Davy suggested

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.590
this might be a possible explanation
for volcanic activity and earthquakes,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.920
we now know that this isn't
due to such chemical reactions.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.659
Nevertheless, Davy's spectacular demonstrations,
illustrating natural phenomena

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.790
which very few members of the audience
would have seen at the time,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.310
would have been extremely impressive
and it's little wonder that they contributed

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.129
to his reputation as one of the
most brilliant lecturers of the day.
