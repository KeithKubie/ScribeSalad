00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.480
- [Evan] If you want to understand why at weddings across America and the world this year

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.109
thousands, probably millions of people will be lunging their pinky fingers over their heads,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.500
you have to go back to 1967.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.140
67 was the year that James brown recorded a song called

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.940
Cold Sweat, a watershed moment in the history of music because it ushered in the era

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.160
of funk.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.640
Now of course you could go back earlier than this. Music styles are always being born out of what came before.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.419
But James brown in the 1960s was funk. And Cold Sweat is the record where he first solidified this new sound.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.639
What makes Cold Sweat so funky is that all of the instruments making it up work toward enhancing

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.820
the rhythm. Gone are the melodic chord progressions of R&amp;B and Soul which Mark Browns earlier career.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.689
Everything in Cold Sweat; the guitars, the horns, the bass, even Brown's voice were used like drums.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.689
You can hear it. The harmonics are static, the rhythm is everything and the drums themselves are doing something

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.360
even more interesting.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.300
- [Clyde Stubblefield] I just start playin...

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.320
- [Evan] That's Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James Brown and probably the most

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.360
influential musician of the 20th century that you've never heard of. The drumbeat from Cold Sweat takes the classic

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.820
4/4 beat of popular music which sounds like this:

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.780

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.219
and adds syncopation or unexpected emphasis at different moments that make it sound more like this:

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.070
This signature syncopation of Clyde Stubblefield define the sound of Funk for decades to come,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.000
but it had a far greater impact than that.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.680
This drum solo you're hearing right now from a 1968 live performance is the most sampled beat in the history of music appearing in over

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.080
1300 tracks, including:

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.540
There's a reason Stubblefield's drumming and the cadence of funk is so danceable.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.580
The study out of Denmark in 2014 showed that people were most likely to want to dance

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.940
when the rhythm of a song was moderately syncopated,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.500
to uniform and it can get boring to complex like jazz music for example,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.360
and people can't keep up. The rhythmic complexity of funk, hip hop which is an outgrowth of funk and EDM

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.180
is just enough that your brain wants to fill in the gaps

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.240
with Dancing.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.040
In other words funk music is in the Goldilocks zone for making people wanna move.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.340
You can draw a straight line from Cold Sweat to Bruno Mars's 24- Karat Magic

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.080
It inherits and refines the same lessons that James Brown learned exactly 50 years ago.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.160
Just listen to the syncopation in the drumbeat:

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.999
24-Karat Magic is essentially made up of that drum plus a number of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.429
synthesizers that play the role of guitar bass and horn sections from Brown's music.

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:41.320
They have the same percussive quality, the signature of Funk.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.940
Here, listen.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.220
To me Bruno Mars is a vessel and 24-karat Magic is a time machine.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.700
It travels back to James Brown, but it makes some important stops in the history of Funk along the way.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.360
It'so secret that Mars is pulling most aggressively from the early 1980s,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.820
an era that many see is marking the decline of Funk music

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.060
before it's major resurgence in the samples of hip hop a few years later.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.600
By 1980 Sly Stone, Bootsy Collins

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.480
and George Clinton had largely finished taking Funk on its cosmic trip across the universe.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.520
But the sounds of 24-karat Magic come right out of the 80s, when Funk came back to Earth,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.220
sort of, and fully embraced the synthesizer.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.080
Everybody knows Rick James

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.020
- Cocaine's a hell of a drug.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.760
- [Evan] But there are a lot of great acts that have been largely forgotten by pop culture,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.960
like Midnight Star.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.480
Those high-pitched synth plucks,  sound familiar?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.739
There are other great groups from this period, ike Cameo and The Gap Band,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.200
but for my money the artist Mars is most indebted to here is Roger Troutman.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.980
- Every time I would use the voice box people will be dancing until I use it,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.379
and when I started using it, they would look up like

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.531
and it would seeme to hypnotize them in a way.

00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:13.700
And it really works watch this.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.200
♫Ladies and gentlemen you're watching Video Show♫

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.780
- [Evan] This vocoder part at the beginning of 24-Karat Magic is a direct nod to Troutman in his band Zapp,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.660
who took the voice box further artistically than any other artist.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.100
Roger Troutman was the best at 80's Electro-Funk using the same repertoire of glittering shining synthesizers,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.980
that give 24-Karat Magic all it's color.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.639
This is what Bruno mars and his producers have done.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.389
They've channeled a long tradition in the instruments and the beats and the energy of this music.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.840
A part of that tradition is iconic,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.620
part of it is forgotten.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.000
But the good news is that 24-Karat Magic doesn't discriminate.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.180
It remembers the complete history,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.200
and hopefully when you're dancing to it at parties this year

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.640
you do too.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.140
I love Funk music so much.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.740
That was so much fun to make. Thank you guys for watching that. There's a new Nerdwriter video every Wednesday,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.139
so if you click that box right over there, you can get more videos like this.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.130
Thank you for that

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.681
and thank you to VRV for sponsoring this video.

00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:44.969
VRV is a great service that pulls together a lot of great content channels like

Mondo, Cartoon Hangover.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.420

And once you get that combo pack I'd recommend that you watch

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.680
Hunter x Hunter, which is a Shounen Battle Anime that kind of

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.173
deconstruct that genre, really cool.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.820
Also on Tested Adam Savage's One Day Builds is awesome.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.920
The guy from Mythbusters, really really cool.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:29.189
Thank you guys so much again for watching me indulge my love of funk music. I'll see you all- Oh!

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:32.493
I got this motherfucker!

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.300
It was heavier than I thought. Thank you.
