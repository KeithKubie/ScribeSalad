00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.890
PROFESSOR: Hi, I'm Sal.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.340
Today we will be doing problem
number 4 of fall 2009, exam 1.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.230
Now before you attempt the
problems there's certain

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.520
background information that
you should know before

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.040
attempting it.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.320
One is knowledge in
ionic bonding.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700
Because the problem
deals with ions.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.815
Two, how to draw an energy-level
diagram.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.590
That's very important.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.010
And three, what Madelung's
Constant is.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.920
Now before attempting the
problem, it's a good thing to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.330
read the whole problem in detail
and make sure you don't

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.930
skip anything out of it.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.170
So that you get all
the information

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.130
that's given to you.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.100
Because that's very important.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.120
So the problem reads
as follows.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.140
For a given cation, c and
anion a, show that the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.130
following four energy
states on the same

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.470
energy-level diagram.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.850
1, Ions in infinite
separation.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.900
2, 9-pair c and a, c stands for
cation, a stands anion.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.080
3, An ion line, c a c a c a,
just a repetitive line of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.720
anions and cations.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.220
And 4, crystalline
solid of c a.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.460
So a three-dimensional crystal
structure with t and a.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.330
And it says also that, assume
that the comparison is based

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.450
upon identical numbers of
ions in all four states.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.410
The diagram need not to be drawn
to scale, however you

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.740
must convey relative values of
different energy states.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.470
So that's the problem reads.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.550
Now if you recall from lecture
there's an important equation

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.280
that actually describes the
energy between two ions,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.470
between a cation and an anion.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.380
And this energy is directly
proportional to the product of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.750
the two charges.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.970
And it's inversely proportional
to the separation

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.860
distance between them.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.060
And it's multiplied
by some constants.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.260
So what does this mean?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.380
Well the fact that it's directly
proportional to the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.800
product of your two charges
means that your energy for any

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.820
ion or anything that
ionically bonds,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.060
it's going to be negative.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.290
Because your z minus will be
negative and that's the whole

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.020
value of your energy
will be negative.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.980
And that's what dictates
stability.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.100
How negative the energy is.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.910
So with that in mind,
we can go ahead

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.990
and start the problem.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.520
So we have a cation
a and anion c.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.200
Now I like to draw diagrams,
or draw little pictures

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.160
because that helps me when
I'm solving the problem.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.620
So I'm just going to
draw pictures of a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.680
cation and an anion.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.250
So I have a cation, c and
then I have an anion, a.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.680
So c and a, and the value of r
naught from our equation is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.350
pretty much the separation
distance between the two.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.010
So project this up,
this is r naught.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.170
And if you look from the
picture, r naught is just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.900
simply the radius of your
cation plus the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.140
radius of your anion.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.530
Now this is already describing
the energy between just a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.930
cation and an anion with these
magnitude of charges.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.240
So all that tells me is that,
this is already answering

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.490
number 2, pretty much from the
problem that we're asked for,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.980
which is the ion pair.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.290
So the problem asked you to draw
an energy-level diagram.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.310
That's what I'm going
to do over here.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.540
So I'm going to go ahead
and start drawing the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.010
energy-level diagram.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.730
Now I'm going to go ahead and
label my energy axis to be

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.740
positive to be up.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.790
And I'm going to draw a
baseline of 0 here.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.880
So I know that to be able to
incorporate my ion pair--

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.880
like I said the energy is
negative, so if the energy

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.965
goes up to here and let's say
the value of the energy here

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:22.810
is 0, then that ion pair should
lie somewhere below it.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.100
So I'm going to go ahead
and draw this line.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.480
And I'll label this, s 2 for
our energy level diagram.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.730
So this is the ion pair.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.270
Now number 1 says ions at
infinite separation.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.190
What is the energy of two
charged species that are

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.480
separated by infinity?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.940
Well if you look at your
equation, your equation tells

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.890
you that it's inversely
proportional to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.120
the separation distance.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.500
So all that tells you is that
if you divide by infinity,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.260
your energy should
be essentially 0.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.330
Which makes physical sense
because those two charged

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.500
species can't feel each other
when they're separated.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.870
So this is actually already
my number 1, which is 0.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.360
Separated away.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.820
So now we need to find what the
energy is of an ion pair.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.440
Which is the line of c a.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.880
So we want to draw
a little picture.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.060
It's pretty much going to
be a repetition of that.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.700
And if I draw a line--

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.990
that's not very straight--

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.170
I'm going to draw a bunch
of cations and anions.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.830
Essentially I can just imagine
that it extends to

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.840
infinity in both ways.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.120
So with my energy between these
two ions right here is

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.500
given by my equation, then I
should be able to figure out

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.090
what the energy is of
the whole system.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.650
Because we're talking about
electrostatic interaction,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.900
which you can just
add linearly.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.240
So I can make one assumption.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.920
But look at my cation and anion
pair, I can go ahead and

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.200
simplify my life by letting
z plus be 1.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.430
So I'll write that down.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:14.560
I'll let z plus equal to
plus 1, which is the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.510
charge on our cation.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.100
And I'll let z minus equal minus
1, which is the charge

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.650
on the anion.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.350
So that's to help
with the math.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.690
So if I come back over here and
if I look at my equation

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.230
line then I know that
if I draw--

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.130
let's see-- a reference
access here.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.270
Then the separation
between the cation

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.165
and anion is r naught.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.160
And between the cation and
the other cation is

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.700
going to be 2 r naught.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.110
And it's going to
extend for that.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.100
So if I go ahead and relabel my
energy equation for a line.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.120
I'll go ahead and call it e line
of function of r naught.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.050
It's simply going to be the
first one, which is going to

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:08.420
be negative e squared over 4 pi
epsilon naught, r naught,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.310
multiply the 1 over
minus 1 over n.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.040
So that's the energy between
these two ions.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.030
So now because the energy is
electrostatic, this cation

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.310
also feels the repulsion
of this other cation.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.690
So therefore with that you
have got to add what that

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.490
interaction is.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.470
So the product of the two
charges is plus 1, which gives

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.870
it a plus in front
of your equation.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.040
And I end up getting e squared
over 4 pi epsilon naught.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.110
Now here's something
that you should

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.660
pay particular attention.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.030
The separation between these
two cation is not r naught.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.610
It's actually 2 r naught.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.950
Because of where exactly where
it sits on the line.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:04.620
So my separation distance now
becomes 2 r naught and it's

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.860
multiplied by the same 1
minus 1 over n factor.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.390
Then if you repeat it again,
you're analyzing the

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.800
interaction energy between the
cation and the other anion

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.640
that's next on the line.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.880
So as you can see you end
up getting this nice--

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.480
4 pi epsilon naught, 3 r naught,
1 minus 1 over n.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.550
And essentially it repeats
until it ends.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.290
Now I'm just analyzing
on the right side.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.130
Because it extends, it's an
infinite line, because it

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.350
extends from negative infinity
to infinity, then you can also

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.760
assume that there's an
anion to the left.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.330
So all you really have to do
is, you take your overall

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.730
energy for the right side and
you multiply it by 2.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.300
Because it's additive.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.200
So this whole thing gets
multiplied by 2.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.210
And that's essentially what
the energy is of a line.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.550
Now in order to be able to
know where it lies on the

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.270
energy-level diagram, it's
important to try to get it

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.640
into the same basic form as
the energy of an ion pair,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.530
just something simple
like over there.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.330
So just by looking at the
equation I know there's a lot

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.090
of factors here that
are common.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.590
Like that e squared, 4 pi
epsilon naught, even r naught

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.920
and this factor can all come
out of the equation.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.290
You can take it out.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:40.510
So if I do that, my equation of
my line then simply becomes

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:48.160
negative e squared over
4 pi epsilon naught.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.720
Now I'm going to go ahead and
take out the r naught as well.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.830
And I'm going to multiply
it by the factor.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.950
And essentially what
stays from here is

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.570
just your 1 over 1.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.970
From this one it's your 1/2
and then your 1/3 and then

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.670
we're happy.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.650
And because I also took out the
negative, I want to make

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.130
sure that I take out the
negative from all

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.470
the other ones too.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:17.420
So this product then gets
multiplied by 1 minus 1 over

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.540
2, plus 1/3 minus 1/4 plus...

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.930
and it goes on forever.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:31.760
Now it so happens that this is
actually a series that we have

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.490
an answer or an answer to.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.960
And this product that's being
multiplied by your fundamental

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.440
base of your equation
is just simply--

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.590
oh sorry I forgot the times 2,
don't forget that, that's very

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.510
important because you're summing
from both sides--

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:56.290
this essentially right here it's
simply arised because of

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.260
your geometry.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.950
You're analyzing your systems.
And this value happens to be

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.470
greater than 1, which
is a good thing.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:10.280
And the value of this
is actually 1.386.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.720
So the fact that the whole
equation is still negative,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.470
because we're talking about
coulombic interaction between

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.860
a negative charged species and
a positive charged species.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.950
And we're multiplying that by a
value that is greater than 1

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.570
this means that if this is 1
right here, then our energy

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.410
level diagram should
lie somewhere below

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.660
it, like right here.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.831
So this is 3.

00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:42.350
And that's your ion line.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.280
Now in real life we know
that crystals don't

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.660
exist in lines really.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.800
Or they're not just an ion pair.
it's literally something

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.850
that is three-dimensional and
has an ordered structure.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.700
Sometimes could be different
geometries, but normally it's

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.860
a cubic structure.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.810
So because that forms in nature,
then that tells me

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.610
that the energy of a
three-dimensional crystal,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.680
which is the fourth one that
we need to put on the

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.980
energy-level diagram,
the value should be

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.050
greater than 1.386.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.175
And this value of 1.386 is
actually Madelung's Constant,

00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:23.895
which you should know.

00:12:23.895 --> 00:12:28.530
It was a required preliminary
to the problem.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:39.050
So I know that below this
value of 1.386 I have my

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.790
three-dimensional crystal.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.810
Now an energy-level diagram is
pretty much quantized by

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.090
different steps.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:55.710
Now what is quantizing
our problem here?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.460
Well this is 0 because
our energy is 0.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.860
So we can almost assume that
we're multiplying--

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.560
or that the Madelung's Constant
for ion pair with

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.110
infinite separation is 0.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.120
And this is 1, so we can assume
that the Madelung

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.130
Constant is 1 or we know that
it's 1 for the ion pair.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.950
So if I start writing this out
on the side here-- give me

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.680
some space--

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.510
I know that's one.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.530
I'm going to go ahead and
label this by Madelung's

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.510
Constant, which is 1.386.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.900
So I come over here.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.150
Relabel this.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.810
This value here's is 1.386.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.320
And this value here has to be
greater than 1.386 for a

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.960
three-dimensional crystal.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.470
And this little diagram here is
the answer to your question

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.700
from the exam.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.990
So when you take the exam you
don't really have to go

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.470
through all this math to
answer the problem.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.330
If you know the material from
lecture, then the solution

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.310
should be very straight-forward
very easily.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.910
And also if you keep in mind
that there's a lot of material

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.720
that you need to know before you
take the exam, and knowing

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.180
how to absorb that material and
apply it will help you in

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.140
solving these type of
problems, which

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.810
can be pretty difficult.
