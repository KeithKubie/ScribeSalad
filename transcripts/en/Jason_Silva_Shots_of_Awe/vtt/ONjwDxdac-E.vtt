00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.940
JASON SILVA: We are definitely
witnessing a phase change,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.490
a turning point in
America's relationship

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580
with cannabis sativa.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.450
That's right, the
marijuana plant,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.210
a sacrament that's been
used for thousands of years,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.836
in all kinds of contexts,
for promoting healing,

00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:41.210
for promoting transformation,
for promoting spirituality.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.340
And every day we're learning
a host of new benefits

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.960
that are associated
with the plant.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.980
Now, I think it's kind
of amazing, not just

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.660
for the fact that this
plant is nontoxic, and has

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.350
so many medicinal and
therapeutic benefits,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.800
but also for the fact
as a sacred sacrament,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.640
this raises the issue
of cognitive liberty,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.192
the fact that as adults, if
we're not hurting anybody else,

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:02.650
we should have the
right to explore

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.390
the contours of our
own consciousness

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.532
without any mediation
or legislation

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.740
on the part of somebody else.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.970
Prohibition, as Abraham
Lincoln used to say,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.390
goes beyond the
bounds of reason,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.160
and attempts to legislate
a man's appetite

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.180
by making a crime of
things that are not crimes.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.900
I'm paraphrasing, but
you get the point.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.830
But I think now the
majority of Americans

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.610
support marijuana legalization.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.020
We're seeing more and more
states embrace this issue

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.896
of cognitive freedom.

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:26.770
And I think we're going
to see transformation

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.520
in consciousness.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.230
Not to mention that
marijuana is extraordinarily

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.070
sensitive to initial
rhetorical conditions.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.310
It's what Timothy Leary used
to describe as set and setting.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.180
So by changing the
context, by changing

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.660
the culture in which people
partake in this visionary herb,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.710
you're changing the very nature
of the medicine's effects.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.790
Experiments in Colorado are
raising the stage in which

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.270
people enjoy their cannabis.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.130
We're talking
culinary experiences,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.235
we're talking classical
music venues and concerts.

00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:56.165
We're talking special cinemas
with vaporizing rooms, where

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:58.980
people can prime their
brains for enhanced cinematic

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980
diversion.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.960
It's a new world,
and it's a world

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.980
that it's going to be
interesting to see how it all

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.480
unfolds.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.550
Cognitive thrills await us
that we cannot even imagine.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.740
