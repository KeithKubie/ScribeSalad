00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,440
Tweet,
like first of all,

2
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:05,490
what is it about Nigerians that
do so well in this country?

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:08,070
That's one of the things,
if you look at like Nigerian immigrants,

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,610
like successful ratios of,
of different immigration groups.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,320
Nigerians in particular are
extraordinarily successful
upon immigrating to

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:20,060
America. I think it's a family.
A family thing is like when,

7
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,880
when your family's decided and we get the
opportunity to move to a better place,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,570
right?

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,620
The thing is that the whole persona is
we're going to be able to sustain this

10
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,610
forever. So my kids are not going
to just play around in sports.

11
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,750
Cause that's not guarantee.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,840
What is guaranteed is the fact that
you're going to go to school and you're

13
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,690
gonna become a doctor because you're
going to get a job anywhere world that you

14
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,650
want. That's why majority
of them are doctors, right?

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,370
Majority of doctors engineered because
these are jobs that high demand jobs.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,390
You always going to get a job
anywhere. Yeah. And so that's all.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,650
That's all we push.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,660
You're going to be a doctor or are you
going to be a a Nigeria? I'm an engineer.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,100
None of them are saying, you're going to
be a professional athlete. My parents,

20
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,990
hell no.
They didn't care for that.

21
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,630
Like I lied to them the first couple
of years that I was wrestling.

22
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,430
I didn't tell him that.
You know,

23
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:13,140
my brother is a doctorate in pharmacy
in Dallas. My little brother,

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,471
you know,

25
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,940
could have gotten the NFL who was a s l
a football player played at University

26
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,960
of Houston and University of Arizona.
You know, my sister now is in college.

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,020
She's in nursing school in college.
Like that's just what we push.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,280
We want you to get a job that you can
provide for your family forever. Yeah.

29
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:32,130
They remind me of Koreans and a
lot of ways. Absolutely. Yeah.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Super hardworking and appreciate once
they've gotten to a place like America

31
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,770
where there really is no
ceiling on the possibility.

32
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,980
You could do anything you want once you
get here, if you work hard. Absolutely.

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,000
And then this is,

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,960
that's another thing that's dear
to my heart is one of your Nigeria,

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,580
like when you're in a situation that
we were sad, my mom was a teacher.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,030
My mom owned a store to to a little
convenience store there and we did little

37
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:04,740
jobs on the side were told certain things
on the side and on top of it raising

38
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:05,820
three boys,

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,550
rowdy boys like that.

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,660
That's what we, and in the school we
did, it wasn't like, oh there's the card.

41
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:17,250
The bus is going to pick you up at
three 7:00 AM to go to school. Nah,

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,960
the school was two miles away. Three miles
away. You walk in, you got get going.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,190
Don't be late cause if you got,

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,130
if he was late he was going to get
a whooping before school started.

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,840
That's how it was and especially the
education system is so high because you

46
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,900
miss,
you miss a couple of answers on the tests.

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,130
You had to go out and get a sweat and you
are going to get whipped in school for

48
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:42,320
the answers that you missed. That
would be you in school. Yeah,

49
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,130
absolutely. The teacher, the teacher,
the teacher was on, first of all,

50
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:51,960
it's not teacher, his uncle and aunt,
that's your uncle and your aunt in school.

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,790
They knew your parents did to your family.

52
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,240
They were going to whip you in
school if you decided to, to mess up.

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,020
And that's how it was. So that's why
there's a lot of these smart Nigerians.

54
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,890
They'd get out and if there is no
freaking job or we've got to somehow make

55
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,470
money, it's so fucked up cause I
don't want people to beat kids,

56
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,710
but God damn when you put kids
under that kind of pressure,

57
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,900
my parents put me in Catholic school for
one year and I got excellent grades and

58
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,710
afterwards I was fucking terrible,
terrible man.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,350
And I remember my stepfather
said something to me, he said,

60
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,720
your grades were only good when you
were in Catholic school. I was like,

61
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,050
this guy was fucking terrified down. I'm
like, I'm like, it ain't a good move.

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,030
I mean, it's like they were
threatening me all the time.

63
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,640
They wanted to beat me and make
me sit on a nail in the closet.
