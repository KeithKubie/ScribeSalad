00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: So thank you
everybody for being here today.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
We're all very excited
to welcome a great chef

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.520
to the Google office.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.580
He just released a new
cookbook, which, if you want,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.920
is back over on that table.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.320
You can see it up here.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.310
He's going to be demoing
two recipes for us, the crab

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.320
cakes and the pumpkin salad.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.450
So if you have questions,
we'll do a Q&amp;A towards the end.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.698
But throughout, just
enjoy, learn, and have fun.

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:37.740
So thank you.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.656
JEREMY SEWALL: Thanks.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
So both these recipes
are in the book.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.290
And they're really very easy.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.410
And I encourage people
to-- if you like food,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.840
I always encourage people to
get outside your comfort zone

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.256
once in a while and do something
you've never done before.

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:57.100
And these a really easy
recipes that are pretty doable.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.330
I think with a little
bit of patience,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.040
a good bottle of wine, and some
time, you can figure these out.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.690
And they're very
seasonal, so this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.149
is from the fall
section the book.

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.940
It's with pumpkins.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.512
Obviously, pumpkins you see
everywhere now to nauseum.

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:13.595
Every store has a pumpkin.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:16.350
The smaller ones are
called sugar pumpkins.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.200
And they're a
little bit sweeter.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.154
They're really good.

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:19.570
And the lettuce
we're going to use

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.320
is called frisee, which
is a little bit bitter.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.528
It's a little hearty lettuce.

00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:24.577
It's In the chicory family.

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.910
It's got a sweet bitterness
to it, which is really good.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.960
And then ricotta cheese and
a real simple vinaigrette.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.919
And I'll explain each
section as we go along.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:35.210
And then we'll get to taste it.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.080
Everyone as a kid,
you carved pumpkins.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.950
You got the top out.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.410
You scooped the seeds out.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.580
And you toast the
seeds, hopefully.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.280
But I'm just going
to show you the chef

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.720
way, how you tackle pumpkin.

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:49.030
They can be really delicious.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.010
So, really easy,
just cut the top off.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.600
We cut the bottom off.

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:01.340
And really, that's
just so it sits flat

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.042
so it doesn't wobble
too much on you.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.250
And everyone should have
one of these in their house.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.340
It's a really good vegetable
peeler, really heavy-duty,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390
really sharp,
really a great thing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.330
to have around for shaving
cheese or anything.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.230
And these are strong
enough-- those actually

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.800
peel a pumpkin--
thanks very much.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.170
And this is a lot easier
than trying to take a knife

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.980
and peel it from the outside.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.177
It's lot safer.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.260
You peel the pumpkin like
you're peeling an apple.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.590
It's a little thicker
skin, and sometimes you've

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.590
got to go over it twice.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.985
But that just gives you an
idea of how easy that can be.

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.235
Just peel it all the way down.

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:47.880
So I'm not going to
peel the whole thing.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.410
But that just gives you an idea.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.701
And then we're going to cut it.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.660
And then for this recipe I cut
it in, usually, four or six.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.701
This is a little bit
bigger, so we could probably

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.560
cut it into six.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.105
But first we cut it
in half, then in half.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:06.340
And what we want to do is
just scrape the seeds out.

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.180
And there's
actually-- you can see

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.102
there's a lot of
seeds in a pumpkin.

00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:12.310
And they're really delicious.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.810
So you just scrape it all out.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.690
And then from that
part, what we end up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.680
doing is, before we
cook it, from here what

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.425
we do is take this
piece, cut that in half.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.190
And then we just cut it into
little wedges like this.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.174
And then from here-- you
can see how easy that is.

00:03:39.174 --> 00:03:41.340
From here, we just toss
these in a little olive oil,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.048
and we bake them.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.860
And this is what they
look like at the end.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.680
Now, you don't want to bake
them so much that they're mushy.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.320
But they're soft, so you can
eat them cold in a salad.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.560
And they pick up the
flavor really nice.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.226
And they have great
flavor, great color.

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:53.940
They're a really
beautiful, autumn color.

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.570
So that's what that looks like.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.230
And then the seeds-- a
little bit of the trick

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.220
is if you actually
scrape all the seeds,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.580
and then you put this in
water and just mix it around,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.790
all the seeds separate
from everything else.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.540
And you just peel
them off the top.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.590
Once you get the seeds
and you rinse them off--

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.640
and you see how
easy they separate.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.631
And you rinse them
off, and you dry them.

00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.589
And then we toss them in
a little bit of butter

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.459
and toasted cardamom.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.394
And you toast them.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.810
And that's what
they come up with.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.851
They're just really little
crunchy pumpkin seeds.

00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.250
They're absolutely delicious,
and it's really easy.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.510
So to make the
salad, again, it's

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.910
just simple autumn
salad, our frisee.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.830
And that's the root, where it
grows in the ground like that.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.940
Just trim that end off.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.120
Trim a little off the top, where
it might be a little wilted

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.659
or beat up from handling.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.825
And then I just cut in half.

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:55.080
I'm just going to spread out.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.190
Oh my God, it's so easy.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.690
So here it is, our roasted
pumpkin, our frisee.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.800
And this vinaigrette
is we took curry.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.960
And we put dried curry
powder in a dry saute pan.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280
And you put it on a low heat.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.040
And you toast the curry.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.760
And as it starts
to get hot, it'll

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.346
start to change the flavor.

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.345
And you'll smell this
great toasted curry aroma.

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.053
And as soon as you
start to smell and see

00:05:23.053 --> 00:05:25.777
that toast a little bit,
you pour olive oil over it.

00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:27.860
Let that warm up, and then
you set it to the side.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.901
And you just let that all
kind of steep together.

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:31.980
And that's how
you get curry oil.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.450
So this is just curry
oil and lemon juice.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.925
That's all this
is, really simple.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.150
We just drizzle just
enough to coat everything.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.400
You don't want it to be soupy.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.350
And then this here is
just ricotta cheese,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.640
a little bit of cream to thin
it out, a little chili flake.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.330
Now, chili flakes add a
little bit of spice to it.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.720
If you don't like that
spice, don't use them.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.269
You just want to thin this
out, a little bit creamy.

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:59.310
And we season everything.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.802
Now salt is kind of--
it's a great tool.

00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:03.260
You don't want food
to taste salty,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.310
but salt helps bring
out the natural flavors

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.739
of most any food.

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:07.780
You won't taste the salt.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.225
It doesn't have to taste salty.

00:06:09.225 --> 00:06:13.724
So a little bit-- and again,
if you don't like curry,

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:14.390
don't use curry.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.376
You can just use lemon
juice and olive oil.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.000
If there's another
spice that you like,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.090
like cumin or coriander
might work really

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.587
well in this, if you
want to mix up the spice.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:23.295
There's no rules.

00:06:25.372 --> 00:06:27.330
The food police will not
show up and arrest you

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.455
if you use the wrong spice.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.330
So to plate this out
like this, it's so easy.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.550
We just a little bit of ricotta
on the bottom of the plate,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.456
spread that around.

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:41.330
And that's going to be
the base of the salad.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.842
And then in here we have
our pumpkin, our frisee,

00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:47.060
and our dressing.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.851
And we season it with
a little bit of salt.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.570
I normally season
with salt and pepper,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.457
because pepper's a
little bit spicy.

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.040
And since I have the chili flake
in here, I held back on that.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.929
I just don't want too much
heat or spice in there.

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:02.595
That might fight with
the other flavors.

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:07.500
So then we just to build
it a little bit high.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.620
We want it to look confused
but organized, as we say.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.845
Then our toasted seeds,
and we just-- over the top.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.662
And then if you're really
trying to impress somebody,

00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:25.245
make it fancy.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.695
We just drizzle a little bit of
vinaigrette around the outside.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.030
And if you notice-- I think,
one thing about this dish

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.640
is it has all those
earth tones that

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080
are associated with
autumn, the orange pumpkin,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.100
and the toasted brown
seeds, and the yellows,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.524
and in the deeper greens.

00:07:43.524 --> 00:07:45.190
I mean, that looks
like fall on a plate.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.240
So that's really it.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.670
So that's what our sugar
pumpkin salad with toasted seeds

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.820
and curry looks like.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.475
We're going to taste a bunch.

00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:54.433
SOUS CHEF: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:56.917 --> 00:07:57.750
JEREMY SEWALL: Sure.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.110
Great, come on up
and try these, guys.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.818
Do we have forks?

00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.970
OK, so we're going to do-- the
next thing we're going to make,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.590
it's really simple.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.923
We're going to make a crab cake.

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:13.600
Again, I think it's a
really simple recipe.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.100
It's in the book.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.933
I think it's something
that's really doable.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.437
It's not that bad
to make at home.

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:20.020
This is a great
holiday one, if you're

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.240
cooking around the
holidays, because you

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.140
can make these a
day ahead, Keep them

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.220
in the refrigerator
for a day or two.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.230
They keep really well.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.770
Once they're made, they're
pretty easy to serve,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.395
so really easy.

00:08:31.395 --> 00:08:33.360
But really what it
starts with is-- this

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.744
is Jonah crab meat, which
is a local crab here

00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:39.730
to New England, usually northern
New England, from the Cape

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.860
up to the Gulf of Maine.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.340
Gulf of Maine and up towards
Canada is where most of them

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.440
come from.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.700
And it's one of the smaller
commercially-caught crabs.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.634
When you think of crabs, you
think Alaskan King crab--

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.050
what's that show,
Deadliest Catch.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.810
Those are what most
people think of crab.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.697
So those are sometimes
six feet across span.

00:09:02.697 --> 00:09:04.280
These are called
Jonah, or rock crabs,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.555
which are about this big.

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:07.680
And it's a little bit more
work to get the meat out

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.471
of the shell than it
is in the larger ones.

00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:10.510
But it is local.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.780
It is really good.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.520
I always encourage people to try
to source out fresh crab meat,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.280
instead of-- and you can make
this with most any kind of crab

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.780
met.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.915
But if you buy pasteurized
or anything like that,

00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:22.540
generally, you lose
some of the flavor.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.690
It gets a little watery.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.480
So this time of year in,
especially food shops and fish

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.650
markets, fresh Jonah
crab meat is available.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.390
So it's just really simple.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.180
I picked it for shells,
squeeze the moisture out.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.260
So we just have some dry,
straight-up crab meat here.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.301
We're going to mix in a
little bit of mayonnaise.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.530
This is just chopped cilantro.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.250
And again, if you don't
love cilantro, don't use it.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.400
Use an herb that you like,
like fresh dill, or chives,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.010
or rosemary, or parsley.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.470
Anything like that is
really good in there.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.614
This is just a little red bell
pepper and red onion minced up.

00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:00.780
We use a little bit of that.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.812
An egg, and I'm not
going to quite use

00:10:05.812 --> 00:10:07.770
the whole egg, because
it's just a small batch.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.180
But egg is just really
used-- is a little bit

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.990
of a binder to hold
it all together.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.476
A little bit of fresh lemon
juice, a bit of lemon zest.

00:10:19.476 --> 00:10:21.725
So if you don't have one of
these at home, you should.

00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:22.766
It's called a microplane.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.531
They come in fine--
fine grating like this.

00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:27.530
And they do bigger ones.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.660
This is great-- great for kind
of zesting fruit really easy,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.660
and then grating cheese
over the top of stuff.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.750
If you burn your toast,
if you run this across it,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.666
it cleans it right up.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.404
In our kitchens--
don't tell anyone.

00:10:43.404 --> 00:10:44.070
It's our secret.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.190
But if you burn a piece
of fish on the edge,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.404
you scrape this across the
burnt edge of the fish.

00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:49.320
It cleans it right up.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.454
It's a pretty cool
tool to have around.

00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:53.120
And we seem to go
through a lot of them,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.624
because I'm always
looking for one.

00:10:54.624 --> 00:10:56.790
So a little fresh lemon
zest really makes it bright.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.240
And then this is just Tabasco.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.571
And this is just-- Tabasco
is high in vinegar.

00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:07.570
So it's a vinegar sauce.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.940
So it adds acid, which
like salt, kind of helps

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.790
flavors pop out and
a little bit of heat.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.870
And I don't want it to be
hot, but I just-- a little bit

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.780
of heat in the
background there will

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.425
help develop some of
the other flavors.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.120
You never want to
taste the Tabasco,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.770
but it should be in there.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.000
A little salt, we
mix this together.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.180
So really what it
is-- it's about 50%

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.170
crab meat, 55% crab
meat, and then 45% to 50%

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.680
of everything else combined.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.020
So it's really at least
half or more crab meat.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.610
All mixed in there.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.420
It's a little bit
wet, but that's OK.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.280
It's seasoned well.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.970
Everything's in there,
nice proportion.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.553
And these are panko
breadcrumbs, which

00:11:46.553 --> 00:11:48.520
is just-- they're
sold everywhere now.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.150
When I started
cooking years ago,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.437
only specialty stores had them.

00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:54.770
It's just a Japanese white
breadcrumb, really versatile,

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.370
really easy to
find, easy to use.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.020
We just fold in a
little bit, until we

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.580
get the consistency of the
crab cake that we want.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.786
So where it's moist
but not sticky,

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:06.340
and it'll still hold together.

00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:10.410
And again, if you don't like
peppers, don't put peppers in.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.470
If you don't like Tabasco,
don't put Tabasco.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.350
Sriracha's really good in there.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.230
I really encourage people-- when
you're cooking at home, just

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.330
do stuff that you like.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.300
Follow a recipe.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.000
So maybe sometimes you
understand how something works.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.540
But after that, make food
that you want to eat.

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.550
OK, so you can see
it coming together.

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:35.640
And that's about right
where we want it,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.490
where it's still--
it's coming together.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.698
It's a little damp to the
touch, but it's not sticky.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.980
Let those breadcrumbs soak in.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.006
And then this is-- it's
called a ring mold.

00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:50.380
And every kitchen
has a gazillion

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.270
of these thrown throughout
the kitchen, different sizes.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.130
This is what you make
things-- it's really easy.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.914
This is a great thing to use,
because you get the right size.

00:12:58.914 --> 00:13:01.330
And you want everything-- one
of the most important things

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.621
in a restaurant is consistency.

00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:05.370
So if four of you were
eating dinner in a restaurant

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.560
and you all order the crab
cake, and one was bigger

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.310
than the other, everyone
would be like, what's that.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.620
So this is built for
speed and consistency.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.215
So I know when they're
making crab cakes at work,

00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:17.980
they know to put breadcrumb in,
fill this thing up, breadcrumb

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.670
on top, and it's
the same every time.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.370
So that's one of
our little tools.

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:25.470
A little breadcrumb
in the bottom of this.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.200
We just pack the ring mold.

00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:40.645
Really push it down so
it all comes together.

00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:48.150
Then we do a little
breadcrumb on top.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.825
There are some recipes
where you bread crab cakes.

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:54.950
That's a different process.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.489
That's where you
take the crab cake.

00:13:56.489 --> 00:13:57.530
You roll it in the flour.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.410
Then you roll it in eggs.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.190
Then you roll it in breadcrumbs.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.398
And you can do that too,
and they come out wonderful.

00:14:01.398 --> 00:14:03.090
This is just a little easier.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.910
And I love-- I think the
best part about crab cake

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.872
is the crab.

00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:10.080
And sometimes if you have
too much breading on there,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.030
you don't get
enough of the crab.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.446
So I just bread
the top and bottom

00:14:12.446 --> 00:14:13.900
and get that nice and crispy.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.430
So it's crispy on the
top to bottom, hopefully.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:23.747
And then you have a nice,
creamy, crab middle.

00:14:23.747 --> 00:14:24.580
So that's really it.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.810
And then we try not to burn it.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.040
So I got this a little hot.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.870
Vegetable oil, or
canola oil, really

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.670
is what you guys should
cook with at home.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.220
Don't cook with olive oil.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.150
So if you buy a nice
olive oil-- olive oil

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.620
is not meant to be cooked with.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.420
So it's called-- you can see
how you see that smoking.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.130
So that's called a
flashpoint in oil.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.490
So if oil gets too hot, and
it starts to break down,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.100
the flavor start to really
change, is when it's smoking.

00:14:50.471 --> 00:14:52.220
Olive oil isn't a meant
to be cooked with.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.803
It's meant to be made dressings
with and drizzle over the top.

00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:57.570
Because olive oil-- if you
ate a spoonful of olive oil,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.529
it has a unique flavor.

00:14:58.529 --> 00:14:59.111
It's pleasant.

00:14:59.111 --> 00:15:00.580
It's meant to be
eaten on its own

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.760
or dressed over
top of the stuff.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.922
Vegetable oil, not so much.

00:15:04.922 --> 00:15:06.130
It's meant to be cooked with.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.689
So the temperature
can get hotter.

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:09.230
I'm just going to
let that get crisp.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.410
Oh my God, that's so easy.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.810
So you see-- just nice and
even, so enough oil in there

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.000
where the entire thing's
coated on the bottom.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.050
Get a nice, crispy crust.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.830
And what I would do-- when
you're making these at home,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.830
at this point, from there
you throw in the oven.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.830
You flip it over,
you've got a nice brown

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.444
on top, nice even,
beautiful golden brown.

00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:29.360
You throw in the oven.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.580
It'll brown on the bottom,
and it'll warm through.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.690
If I brown it on the
stove, on both tops,

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.750
it'll be hot on the top
and bottom and crispy.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.270
But it'd be cold in the middle.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.221
So from here, in the
oven for a few minutes.

00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:40.720
Let it get warm all
the way through.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.390
And you're ready
to go, super easy.

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:45.790
I know everyone's going to
go home and make crab cakes.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.330
I can tell.

00:15:51.747 --> 00:15:52.955
Let that cook another second.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:57.180
So one of the things we've
paired this with in the book

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.720
is we did squash.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
And I think in the book,
it's Hubbard squash.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.890
I don't remember every last
detail of every recipe.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.260
But I remember most of them.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.800
So Hubbard squash
is a local squash.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.529
It's kind of a
funny shape to it.

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:09.070
It's called an
heirloom squash, which

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.717
means a really old variety.

00:16:10.717 --> 00:16:12.550
Most of the squash that
you see in the store

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.580
are your typical butternut
squash or acorn squash,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.150
which look like a large acorn.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.170
Just never buy those again,
ever in your entire life.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.310
Just promise me that,
if you'll do one thing.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.850
There's so many more
interesting, flavorful squash

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.770
out there in the world that
just have an amazing flavor.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.025
I mean, you could do this--
and we do a little squash puree

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:33.275
with this and pickled chilies.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.570
If you did this with
pumpkin, or Hubbard squash,

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.340
or there's these big funky
ones called Long Island cheese

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.460
pumpkins, amazing flavors.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.916
All kinds of stuff
out there that

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:47.540
have much better
flavor than butternut.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.764
They have this rich,
deep, earthy, fall flavor.

00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:50.430
They're amazing.

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:53.630
Nothing against butternut,
but there's lots of cool stuff

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.129
out there.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.290
It's really simple.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.815
If you think about fall,
think about fall flavors.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.720
As the weather
turns cold-- and boy

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.720
we've had a really mild
fall-- but I mean, for all us,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.410
what you want to eat, and
what you kind of-- it changes.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.200
You start to crave
things that are warm,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.390
and hearty, and nurturing.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.220
And these are some
of those things that

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.079
make you feel really
good about eating.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.774
And in the summer,
you crave tomatoes,

00:17:18.774 --> 00:17:20.440
and you crave corn
and all those things.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.634
In the fall and the
winter, the colder

00:17:22.634 --> 00:17:24.300
it is and the more
the weather changes--

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.841
that's kind of unique
to New England.

00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:28.830
And that's what we talked about
in the book, how as the seasons

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.860
change, you want to
eat different things.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.900
And as a cook or a
chef in a kitchen,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.740
you want to cook
different things.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.740
You get to work and use
these different things.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.110
And that's-- there's season's
everywhere, obviously.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.560
But what happens in New
England is truly unique.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.954
It's a region that's so
defined by the seasons.

00:17:43.954 --> 00:17:45.870
And we're so defined to
what's available to us

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:46.911
throughout those seasons.

00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:48.420
So these are just
some-- and what

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.600
we do is we talk about, in the
book, the guys who grow stuff,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.342
who brew stuff, who catch
stuff, and how that ties back

00:17:54.342 --> 00:17:56.300
to the restaurants and
how they bring it to us.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.150
And how that
changes what we cook

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.760
and eat throughout the year.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.080
And this is just a couple
of small examples of that.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.640
So please grab a crab
cake and try one.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.060
And hopefully they're not bad.

00:18:09.034 --> 00:18:09.950
Well, thank you, guys.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.330
I'm going to hang out
over there and sign books

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.079
for a few minutes, if
anyone's interested.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:15.450
And i thank you,
guys, for coming down.
