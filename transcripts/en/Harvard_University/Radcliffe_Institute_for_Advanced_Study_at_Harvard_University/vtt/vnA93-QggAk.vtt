00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.870
- Good evening, everybody.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.720
I'm Jennifer Roberts.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.370
I'm the faculty
director for the arts

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.399
here at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:12.190
Welcome to you all.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.880
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.490
It's great to see
so many people here

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.120
for our opening celebration
for our new exhibition

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.480
in the Johnson-Kulukundis
Gallery of the work of Anna Von

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.500
Mertens.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.030
Now for those of
you who have not

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.390
attended an art opening
at Radcliffe before,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.470
this is how it goes.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.170
It's basically a
two venue event.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.580
We'll be spending the next 45
to 50 minutes in this room.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.950
Anna will be giving
a short presentation

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.730
about her exhibition and
its place in the history

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.990
of her larger body of work.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.890
And then she and I will
have a quick conversation

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.770
with whatever time is
remaining after her talk.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.410
Then we'll all get up and make
our way over to Byerly Hall

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.190
to see the exhibition, which
is just two buildings down.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.480
And that will last
until around 7 o'clock.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.980
All right.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.590
So I first came across
Anna's work in 2006

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.060
in the fall 2006 issue of
Cabinet Magazine, which

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.750
featured two quilts from
her celebrated series titled

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.550
As the Stars Go By.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.470
And these hand stitched works
trace the paths of stars

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.360
as they appear silently pivoting
over epic or disastrous events

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.380
in human history.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410
I had to squint to
make out the details

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.367
in the images in the magazine.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.950
And for reasons that
will become clear

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.700
when you go over to the gallery
Anna's work really does not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.115
reproduce easily or well.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.990
So I had to squint to
make out these details.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.730
But I was really transfixed
by the richness of her work,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.520
particularly the
way it so rigorously

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.730
and also elegantly
collapsed a whole series

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.050
of seemingly essential,
seemingly eternal oppositions--

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.620
craft and computation,
science and domesticity,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.840
affect and
indifference, closeness

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.870
and distance, body and mind.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.160
I promptly sent her an email.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.220
And this was the first
and only artist fan

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.670
letter I have ever written.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.220
10, 11 years went by, stars
silently gliding overhead.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.550
And I took on this position as
faculty director of the arts

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.180
at Radcliffe.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.360
And I found myself charged
with the task of inviting

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.290
contemporary artists to show
work in our contemporary art

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.760
gallery.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.860
This brought about
my second email

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.460
to Anna, which ultimately
brought about this exhibition.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.630
Radcliffe's goal as
many of you know,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.140
is to foster
intellectual engagement

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.290
across multiple different
fields and communities

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.182
within and beyond Harvard.

00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:48.890
And I could think of
no one better suited

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.750
to make that kind
of connectivity

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.170
happen in our gallery than Anna.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.090
As she developed
her exhibition, she

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.570
visited campus several times
in order to do research.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.060
And she found herself
spending a lot of time

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.540
at the Harvard College
Observatory studying the women

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.050
computers so they were
called who analyzed the glass

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.770
plate astronomical photographs
there at around the turn

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.200
of the 20th century.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.480
Anna will have much more to
say about all this in her talk.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.550
But before welcoming
her to the podium,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.770
I want to take a moment to
thank a few of the people

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.930
and the communities
that made this quite

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.180
complex exhibition possible.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.570
Within Radcliffe I want to
thank Meg Rotzel and Joe

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.230
Zane of the Arts Program team,
the whole Academic Ventures

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.020
team--

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.690
particularly Sean
O'Donnell who has

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.030
organized the programming
and curricular

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.860
outreach for this exhibition--

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.160
the Dean's Office for its
support of the complexities

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.570
of this show.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.780
I want to thank Alyssa Goodman,
who is Radcliffe Faculty

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.670
Director in Science
who also happens

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.700
to be an astronomer
who kindly advised us

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.500
on many such matters.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.750
And any errors in that
department I must assure you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.152
are our own.

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:01.610
We also had generous help and
consultation from the Harvard

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.560
University Archives,
the Harvard Smithsonian

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.880
Center for Astrophysics, and
the Harvard College Observatory.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.710
Now an essential part
of this exhibition

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.140
is the book that accompanies it.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.970
This is the book here.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.430
You will see this
again in the gallery.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.019
This is something
that started out

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.180
as an idea for a small brochure.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.600
But it became much more
ambitious and beautiful

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.430
than it had any right to be.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.420
And for that we are thankful
to Anna's dedication

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.910
to the publication,
to the editing

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.610
wizardry of Rachel Vogel
and Victoria Waters,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.110
and to John Kramer--

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.152
our brilliant book designer.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:40.610
There are several copies of
the book in the gallery for you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.620
to look at when you enter
the space this evening.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.340
We also have a limited number
of complimentary copies

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.660
for visitors to the exhibition.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.480
So if you would like
to request a copy,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.670
there will be cards
in the gallery

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.740
that you can pick
up with instructions

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.460
for signing up online to
get a copy of the book.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.040
There will also be some for
sale at the Carpenter Center

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.170
Bookstore starting
I believe next week.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.240
I also want to mention
that with this exhibition

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.656
we're experimenting at Radcliffe
with a new program called

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:13.100
the Gallery Series in which
we're inviting students,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.720
faculty, and staff to respond
to the exhibition on view

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.240
in a series of events
in the gallery space

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.470
that will extend throughout the
entire range of the exhibition.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.410
These events are organized
by Academic Ventures.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.440
If you go to
onviewatradcliffe.org

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.900
you'll be able to see a list
of these events, which include

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.800
everything from displays of
the historic astronomical glass

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.330
plates to live performances
by Harvard musicians, dancers,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.210
and vocalists.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.710
All right.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.970
So I know you're all
eager to hear from Anna.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.790
And I'm equally eager
to introduce her.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.790
Anna Von Mertens received
her Bachelor's Degree

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.910
in Visual Arts from Brown
University and her MFA

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.070
from the California
College of the Arts.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.500
Her work is in
the collections of

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.780
and has been shown in
numerous exhibitions

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.360
throughout the United
States, including the MFA

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.390
Boston, the Berkeley Art Museum,
the Smithsonian American Art

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.050
Museum, the RISD Museum, the
Boston Center for the Arts,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.440
Mills College Art Museum,
Ballroom Marfa, the deCordova

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.580
Sculpture Park and Museum
just down the street along

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.540
with many other collections.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.350
She is the recipient of a Louis
Comfort Tiffany Foundation

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.660
Biennial Award and a
United States Artist

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.300
Fellowship in the Visual Arts.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.420
We're very honored to have her
and her work here at Radcliffe.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.970
It's been a really thrilling
and stimulating process

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.760
for me working with
Anna on this exhibition.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.120
I and we have all learned
a great deal already.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.490
For example, I know a
lot more about quilting

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.120
than I ever did before.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.320
But I also happen to know
about the period luminosity

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.920
relation in variable stars now.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.270
Anna will enlighten you about
this as well I understand.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.070
Please join me in welcoming her.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.528
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.070
- Hi, thank you, Jennifer,
for that introduction.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.430
And thank you, Jennifer, really
for being as excited as I

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.780
have been about this project.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.840
So that has been such a joy to
work with you this past year.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.180
And thank you to the
folks at the Radcliffe

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.700
and at the Observatory in
support of this project.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.940
So this story has many
beginnings like all stories do.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.960
And I've chosen this beginning,
because when Jennifer invited

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.780
me to do an exhibition
here at the Radcliffe,

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.610
because my work
is research based

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.760
she offered to tour the
various archives on campus

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.590
and see some of the collections
in the various libraries,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.710
all of which were remarkable.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.440
But when we got here to the
Harvard College Observatory

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.490
I knew we needed to look no
further, because housed here

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.570
are over 500,000 glass plate
photographs of the night sky.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.840
And these photographs were
taken started in the 1880s all

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.850
the way through the 1990s.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.610
And they were taken at
observation stations set up

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.980
by Harvard around
the globe in both

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.764
the northern and
southern hemispheres.

00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:13.930
And this is the oldest and
most comprehensive record

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.150
of the night sky on the planet.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.020
And so Jennifer and I got to
see some of these glass plates

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.180
on our first visit there.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.920
And most of the
plates look like this.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.240
They are negatives.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.240
And they are made by coating
a plate of glass and emulsion,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.070
exposing that plate of glass
to starlight through telescope.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:37.400
And each star registers
as a tiny black dot.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.799
This was a new kind of
technology-- this dry plate

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.460
photography.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.850
And with this new technology
came an enormous influx

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.920
of data to be analyzed.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.822
And Edward Pickering, the man
shown here in this photograph,

00:08:48.822 --> 00:08:50.780
was the director of the
observatory at the time

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.940
that this new technology
was developed.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.850
And he was progressive
but also practical.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.830
And he realized that
if he hired women

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.330
in the role of
analyzing these glass

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.630
plates that they were a
cheaper labor force than men.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.180
And so that's what he did during
his more than 40 year tenure

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.890
as director.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.020
He hired over 80
women in this job.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.890
And their task was to ascertain
the brightness of the stars,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.670
as well as their color
spectra, because at the time

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.350
the sky was an
unmapped territory.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.210
Very little was known
about the composition

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.480
of the stars and the
relationship to one another.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.400
So they set about this task.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.700
And Henrietta Leavitt, who is
the subject of my exhibition,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.652
is one of the Harvard computers.

00:09:31.652 --> 00:09:33.110
And as Jennifer
mentioned, they are

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.420
known as computers--
the Harvard computers.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.040
And she was one of these women.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.040
And she excelled at
the stellar magnitude

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.770
work, which sounds so simple to
gauge the brightness of a star.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.760
But you saw how tiny those
specks were in those plates.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.310
And so simply locating a
star on one of those plates

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.800
and comparing one star to
another on a single plate

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.270
is a task enough.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.440
But the results varied
from plate to plate.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.399
Different telescopes
produced different results.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.690
Even the viewing conditions,
of course, were different.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.480
But even the color of the
temperature of starlight

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.060
affected that emulsion
in divergent ways.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.210
So to make a single
determination

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.880
you had to assimilate all
these sort of little bits

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.040
of information and
form a hold-- hold

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.110
those pieces of
information in your mind

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.850
to make a single
determination much

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.390
less that same determination
for hundreds and thousands

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.100
of stars.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.550
And the women often worked in
this way taking a glass plate.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.760
And the emulsion was on
one side of the plate.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.419
And on the other side
they could mark in ink

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:38.960
some notations if
they were following

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.080
a certain sequence of interest
or noting certain stars.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.500
And here you see markings from
several different computers.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.260
This sequence-- this photograph
taken by Jennifer Roberts--

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.170
this lower letter sequence
here is typical of the research

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.250
methods of Henrietta Leavitt.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.380
And you can see here
in another example

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.470
of one of those plates
another lettered sequence.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.810
And here you note that one
of the stars is marked VAR.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.130
It's short for variable star.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.520
And as part of this
stellar magnitude work

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.380
these variable stars
were identified.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.320
And variable stars are stars
that pulse from bright to dim

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.274
and bright again over
varying expanses of time.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.690
So I won't go into
the intricacies

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.980
of how they located--

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.160
imagine one of those specks
over a random period of time

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.910
changing in size and
then reducing again--

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.270
I won't go into the intricacies
of how they determined

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.145
these variable stars.

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:29.070
But rest assured
it was intricate.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.220
Here's an example of
the impeccable pages

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.287
of Henrietta Levitt's logbooks.

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:35.370
I think they're beautiful.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.620
And they're compositions
on their own.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.830
And you can see here alongside
the columns of her magnitude

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.370
work she often would sketch
these sequences of the stars

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.946
with these little
pencil drawings.

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:48.570
And here you can see
that she's located

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.390
another new variable star.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.150
And just as Henrietta Leavitt
excelled at the stellar

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.480
magnitude work, she
was an all-star--

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.339
terrible pun.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.630
I was like, promised myself
I wasn't going to say that.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.450
She was an all-star at
identifying variable stars.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.100
And so here's her paper
in 1908 publishing

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.100
an almost ridiculous amount of
1,777 variable stars located

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.530
in the Magellanic Clouds alone.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.472
And Henrietta Leavitt identified
more than 2,400 variable stars

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:18.180
in her lifetime, which
was more than half

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.660
of all known variable
stars at the time.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.120
So you know, those numbers
just speak for themselves.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.259
And in this 1908 paper
she has a simple sentence

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.550
that it is worthy of notice
that the brighter the star,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.920
the longer it takes
for a star to pulse

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.010
and the dimmer a star, the
shorter period of time.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.930
And I love that she
used the word notice,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.670
because notice I
think is considered

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.340
a sort of passive action, right?

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.290
It's almost something that
you sort of come across.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.770
And you realize here what
an active, powerful action

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.757
noticing actually is.

00:12:48.757 --> 00:12:51.090
And then I just want to-- two
sentences down I just want

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.755
to read this--

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:52.630
I love this sentence.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.130
Like, all right.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.213
I'm just going to read it.

00:12:54.213 --> 00:12:56.940
"This is especially striking in
the case of number 821, which

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.120
has a period of 127
days as 89 observations

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.880
with 45 returns of maximum
give an average deviation

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.800
from the light curve of
only 6/100 of a magnitude."

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.640
So that's just a
ridiculous sentence, right?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:07.890
That's--

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:08.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.260
--going into a
single variable star.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.800
So just again multiply
these calculations

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.190
and these observations
again and again and again.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.870
So she notices
this relationship.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.510
And she follows up
in 1912 her findings

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.680
that indeed the length of how
long a star takes to pulse

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.010
is indeed directly linked
to how bright that star is.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.570
And she graphs
this relationship.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.810
And a smooth logarithmic
curve is produced.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.280
Astronomers
immediately knew this

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.430
had enormous ramifications,
because now you could just

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.370
look at a variable star, see
how long it took to pulse,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.620
and plug that into the
curve and determine

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.490
how bright that star should be.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.460
And I like that
you're like, I thought

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.430
I came to an art lecture.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.556
No, this is just astronomy.

00:13:48.556 --> 00:13:49.221
We're going to--

00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:50.630
I will get to the
art eventually.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.130
OK.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.800
So how bright that
star should be

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.457
and then if that star is not
as bright as it should be,

00:13:55.457 --> 00:13:57.540
astronomers could calculate
the amount of distance

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.610
causing that light to dim.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.490
So now astronomers had a
distance ladder to the stars.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.040
They could tell how
far away stars were.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.890
And this was immediately put
to use determining the size

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.900
and shape of our Milky Way.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.990
And then Edwin Hubble
locating a variable star

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.700
in the Andromeda
Nebula as it was

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.430
called at the time determined
that that variable star

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.917
and therefore Andromeda was
so far outside the scope--

00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:22.500
I mean so far away, that it was
outside the scope of our Milky

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.640
Way Galaxy--

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.400
therefore, putting to rest the
debate whether our galaxy was

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.610
the extent of our universe as
many people thought at the time

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.851
or if there were these
island galaxies beyond.

00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:34.850
And so these galaxies
were identified beyond us.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.475
And then Edwin Hubble
went even farther

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.220
not only identifying
these galaxies.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.051
But the farther away galaxies
were from us, the faster

00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:42.300
they were moving away from us.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.640
So he's proving that--
or demonstrating

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.800
that the universe is expanding.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.720
So all of these
discoveries sort of

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.060
tumbled forth in a 15
year period of time

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.940
from Leavitt's findings.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.130
The tragic part of this
story is that Levitt

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.240
died of cancer just as these
findings were coming to light.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.140
So finding out about the life
and work of Henrietta Leavitt

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.420
I was inspired to make a kind of
tribute to that life and work.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.100
And I've decided
to show the stars

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.710
on the morning of her birth
above the place of her birth

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.230
and then the stars
again on her death

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.640
above the place of her death.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.759
And I did this by using
star calculation software.

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:20.550
I could type in the
latitude and longitude,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.890
type in the time and
date, and see the stars--

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.671
a kind of time traveling
to that place in time--

00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:27.420
see the stars that
were seen on that night

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.510
and project them onto fabric.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.590
I traced each star
with chalk and then

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.960
assigned my own
magnitudes system.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.560
I assigned a numeric value based
on how bright that star was.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.930
And then playing time
forward on my computer

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.810
I would trace that path
of light with chalk,

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.480
go back to my computer,
restart the time,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.710
play time forward, trace
another path of light

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.940
and so again and again and again
until I had this trajectory

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.400
of the stars across the sky.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.710
And then taking
my numeric system

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.492
I corresponded that
to thread color.

00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:58.950
So depending on
how bright the star

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.980
was it got a color
through the grayscale.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.010
And then I wanted to show a
several hour passage of time

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.290
the stars on that morning
as the light faded

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.740
from you with the rising of
the sun and then on the evening

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.140
the brightest stars
first returning into view

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.700
and the light--
starlight returning

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.370
the view as the sunset on
the evening of her death.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.477
So with each star I would
take its original thread color

00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:24.810
depending on its brightness
and then change thread color

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.700
every couple of
inches as I sewed

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.800
so that each line
path of light faded

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.020
into the black background.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.800
And what you got is this sort
of curtain of light pulled back.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.020
And what is held in
between, of course,

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.220
is the span of Henrietta
Leavitt's life.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.907
I also joked with myself that
is also a pole in my studio

00:16:41.907 --> 00:16:42.990
is what's held in between.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.190
But luckily in the gallery
there are no poles.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.190
So here's this space in between.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.850
And with this exhibition I want
to ask the question of what

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.070
meaning is held in a
single life and then

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.860
what meaning do we
hold collectively.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.010
And echoed in that question is
another question-- what meaning

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.050
is held in a single action?

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.290
And what meaning is built with
the repetition of that action,

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.650
because Henrietta Leavitt
repeated many actions--

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.310
observations and calculations
again and again and again.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.240
And certainly in
my own practice,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.300
I repeat actions
of the sewn stitch

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.650
and the mark made again
and again and again.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.859
And we all repeat actions
in our daily lives

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.190
that we hope builds into
a cumulative meaning,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.369
whether we're building a home,
a community, a discovery,

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:27.599
a work of art.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.950
But what remains in
that single action?

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.010
So as Jennifer said I'm
thrilled that this story can

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.440
be told in richer detail
through the publication

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.640
that we produced.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.590
I'm so grateful to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.180
and for the folks
here that supported

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.620
the making of this book.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.720
It includes writings
by myself and an essay

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.320
by Jennifer Roberts and a
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.230
book designed by John Kramer.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.632
So that is one
beginning to this story.

00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:56.340
I'm going to go back
in time a little bit

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.890
and talk about
another beginning.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.350
And in that, I always knew
I wanted to be an artist.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.140
But it wasn't until I made
a simple patchwork quilt

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.080
that I realized I wanted the
quilts to be the medium that I

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.730
put my ideas into.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.360
And that is because quilts
have such rich contexts--

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.350
associations with
the bed and intimacy

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.190
and the home and the body and
of history and women's work.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.470
But it wasn't until I
thought about moving blankets

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.684
that this idea solidified,
because moving blankets

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:22.350
are also quilts.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.390
They are three
layers sewn together.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.420
But instead of
solidifying the home,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.100
they speak about a
home in transition.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.560
They-- protecting an
object in transition.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.060
And so with that,
I started thinking

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.250
about navigating this
space between the familiar

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.020
and the unfamiliar, the
known and the unknown.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.420
And my work centered there--

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.340
started to revolve
around themes of mapping,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.560
defining this territory,
defining the space.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.860
So the first piece I made
using quilt as my medium

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.530
was the logical starting
point-- self portrait.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.620
And in it I made a map of my
own body-- a topographical map.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.120
And by getting
underneath the fabric

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.720
and using a laser leveler and my
beloved husband sitting there--

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.320
patient husband-- in shock
followed that beam of light

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.900
around my body, lowered
the laser leveler,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.940
and followed it a quarter
inch again and again

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.152
and again until we had a
topographic map of my body.

00:19:11.152 --> 00:19:13.110
If we had known how long
this would have taken,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.318
I would have chosen a much
more comfortable position,

00:19:15.318 --> 00:19:16.710
because it was like hours later.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.620
So I had this chalk pattern.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.560
I then sewed it.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.250
Here's a detail of the
topographic map of my head

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.814
and my nose as the high point.

00:19:23.814 --> 00:19:25.230
And here's a detail
of my shoulder

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.410
with my arm across my chest.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.587
And the red square
references both a girl

00:19:29.587 --> 00:19:31.920
getting our period for the
first time and the acute sort

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.740
of awareness that accompanies
that rite of passage

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.550
as well as in several
traditional cultures

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.680
a bride needing to show
the nuptial sheets to prove

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.920
her virginity.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.120
So I was playing with these
public and private spheres--

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.330
this idea of revealing
versus concealing,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.390
of exposing versus comforting
using those associations

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.370
of the quilt, of the bed.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.230
Here in this
installation each quilt

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.810
has a map in its stitch
pattern of some sort.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.480
And it's-- that map is
oriented towards north.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.500
And I want to cite--

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.900
I deliberately chose
showing these quilts

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.780
in the form of the
bed as bed sculptures

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.820
citing the work in the
space of the everyday--

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.100
the space that we
existed in and walk in.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.260
Here's another piece
sort of speaking

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.590
to these public and private
spheres coming together--

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.050
here talking about subjective
and objective versions

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.110
of color.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.370
On the left hardware
store paint chips--

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.090
an industrial kind
of color that I then

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.900
hand dye so already activating
that relationship between so

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.970
the personal and the commercial.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.199
But then on the right, making
my own systems for color

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.740
and determining my
own personal paint

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.690
chips that I also hand dyed.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.032
And the stitch pattern
speaks to this relationship.

00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:42.490
There are two different patterns
of the same circuit board.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.680
So the circuitry is
different on each piece.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.680
But the vias, which are plated
holes allowing information

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.240
to pass from one layer of the
circuit board to another--

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.915
those are the same
pattern on each piece.

00:20:52.915 --> 00:20:55.540
So I'm talking about where there
are those areas of connection,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.090
where there's these
possibilities for communication

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.310
and understanding, and where
these layers are separate.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.624
And the final bed sculpture
I'll touch on tonight--

00:21:04.624 --> 00:21:06.040
the forefront
sculpture is dealing

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.340
with my personal relationship
with the American landscape.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.880
But the piece in back is--s
I wanted to show is the first

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.590
moving blanket sort
of I ever made--

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.360
my version of a moving blanket.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.040
And because moving blankets you
know have that parallel line

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.750
zigzag--

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.220
that's their stitch pattern.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.410
So here I have parallel
lines hand stitched.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.390
But at the northern border
of the United States

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.464
it shifts 90 degrees.

00:21:26.464 --> 00:21:28.630
And then at the southern
border of the United States

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.520
it shifts 90 degrees again.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.250
And this was a political context
for the American identity

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.082
the American landscape.

00:21:35.082 --> 00:21:36.790
And what's interesting
is that this piece

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.880
gets activated, because
it is seen as a sculpture.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.890
When you walk around
the piece the parallel

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.620
lines inside the United States
get surfaced on one direction.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.547
But when you walk
around to the other side

00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:49.630
the parallel lines in the
other direction surface.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.090
And the lines within
the United States sink.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.570
So as you walk around there's
this sort of pulsing--

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.550
again, terrible puns tonight--

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.850
variable star sort of but
this pulsing that happens--

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.680
this sort of
sinister omnipresence

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.710
of the United States,
this piece made in 2003

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.170
at the beginning of the
second war with Iraq.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.950
So that climate
was very present.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.350
And then I moved to the wall.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.400
I had enjoyed this using
the associations of the bed.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.309
But I started to feel
limited by that scope.

00:22:20.309 --> 00:22:21.850
And I started thinking
about the wall

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.130
and realized that my
work belonged on the wall

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.790
as soon as I engaged
in the act of looking.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.980
I started to think about the
wall as sort of in opposition

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.560
to the viewer, not
necessarily a confrontation

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.250
but simply a surface that
we engaging that action

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.150
of looking.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.690
And if I engage that act, the
works belonged on the wall.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.900
And to me the most age old
form of looking is star gazing.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.560
It's a way that we look out
into the heavens to sort

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.270
of more specifically
register physically

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.280
and internally where we are.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.930
And this is the
series that Jennifer

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.450
referenced in her introduction
As the Stars Go By.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.780
And it is the first time I used
the star calculation software.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.210
And it shows as Jennifer
mentioned the stars

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.412
above violent moments
in American history.

00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:05.620
So here are the stars that
Christopher Columbus first

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.280
saw in 1492 when he
first sighted land up

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.320
to current events
such as the beginning

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.420
of the second war
with Iraq where bombs

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.740
were falling over Baghdad.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.750
And you see the
constellation of Scorpio

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.780
tracking across the sky.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.700
And I wanted to set up that
really specific act of viewing.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.510
So each piece has
the aspect ratio

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.110
of a movie screen encompassing
an individual scope of vision

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.630
so again really
calling into question--

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.699
very specifically locating
the viewer at a vantage point,

00:23:34.699 --> 00:23:36.490
and then calling into
question whether this

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.150
was an active or passive role,
if the viewer was complicit

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.030
or a bystander in these events.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.790
Another event chosen--
the Tet Offensive

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.750
during the Vietnam War.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.060
And all these events were
chosen as pivot points--

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.160
sort of where what came before
is separate from what follows.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.670
So here as the
American psyche shifted

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.770
during the Tet
Offensive-- this moment

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.920
in time being demonstrated.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.652
And the final event
I'll touch on--

00:24:02.652 --> 00:24:04.360
the assassination of
Martin Luther King--

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.940
so these are the stars seen
from the balcony of the Lorraine

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.870
Motel in the direction
the shots are fired--

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.990
that hour span of time
between when Martin Luther

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.280
King was shot and an hour later
when he was pronounced dead.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.290
And these events are--

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.780
these works are certainly
intended as a memorial

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.780
to these pieces, as a
awareness of these events.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.960
But there also was this
strange, cold comfort

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.480
in this natural cycle continuing
despite the violence below.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.650
So as Jennifer said this was
her introduction to my work

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.460
and so yet another beginning
to this story and the final one

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.460
I'll touch on tonight.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.544
And I don't know if
Jennifer specified.

00:24:45.544 --> 00:24:46.960
But she did send
me that fan mail.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.150
And I did reply back
saying, thank you very much.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.250
But I love that it
was that same email

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.990
chain that she
responded to 10 years

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.566
later when she invited me--

00:24:54.566 --> 00:24:55.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.470
--here to the Radcliffe.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.370
So to me that's like
another bridge of time

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.070
that this exhibition connects.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.299
So fast forward 10 years
I made a lot of work

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.590
in between that didn't have
anything do with the stars.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.020
But at the time that
Jennifer contacted me

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.360
I was fascinated again
with the heavens.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.600
And I had just finished
this body of work,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.840
which was based on a new
structure in the universe--

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.120
the largest known
structure of the cosmos--

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.610
that as a new
contemporary finding.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.880
And cosmologists realized
that if you subtract

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.190
the expansion of the
universe, what is revealed

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.170
is this kind of
cosmic watershed.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.170
You can see how galaxies
cluster with each other.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.820
So certain-- towards these
basins of attraction--

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.110
so there's these pull as these
galaxies flow towards one basin

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.400
and diverge away to another one.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.240
So what gets defined is
this gravitational boundary

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.980
of our galaxy super cluster.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.860
And keep in mind this
super cluster includes

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.420
100,000 galaxies-- so
just a incomprehensible

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.400
sort of ocean of space.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.170
But this gravitational
boundary is

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.840
defined of what
galaxies float together

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.940
towards a central
basin of attraction

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.160
versus a neighboring
super cluster--

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.700
a very close neighbor
that diverges away.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.247
And what interested
me as an artist

00:26:11.247 --> 00:26:13.330
is that you could take
this model and sort of play

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.910
with it as if you might
sculpt clay and look

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.210
at these rotated views.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.070
So this is just
the same structure.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.330
But seen from a
different point of view.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.660
And I, of course, get lost
in the mountain of data

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.770
that goes into this finding.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.970
So what I did was return
to a very elemental form

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.740
of drawing-- the
gesture drawing.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.490
And with chalk I just sort
of establish a spine--

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.080
establish some primary
limbs and then went into it

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.480
with hand stitching
to find my way

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.240
and built this sort of--
the imagery back up again.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.900
And what interests me is that
we are talking about the largest

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.460
known structure in the cosmos--

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.050
this great expansive space.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.120
But these feel so
connected in many ways

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.200
to that first quilt I showed
you-- that self-portrait.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.390
But these are very
connected to the body

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.890
certainly through the active
hand stitching and that gesture

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.512
drawing in the
proportion of the works.

00:27:05.512 --> 00:27:07.070
And-- but this finding--

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.980
this contemporary finding
from only a few years ago

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.400
still uses Henrietta
Leavitt's foundational work

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.340
as a tool to build
this finding from.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.980
So several of these
works from this series

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.140
are included in the
gallery next door

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.330
as kind of demonstrating
the farthest reach

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.730
of that arm of her findings--

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.850
and yet again the bridging
another expansive time

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.650
with this exhibition.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.860
And then the final work
I'll talk about tonight

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.940
is the drawing.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.630
I-- as we call
it-- the drawing--

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.500
I decided to draw a positive
and negative plate of the Orion

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.610
Nebula.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.440
And an impetus
behind this drawing

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.340
was to respect these objects,
these plates as objects

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.740
that have carried a
story through time.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.660
And that is what I
believe objects can do

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.690
is carry a story.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.070
Just as quilts have carried
often a story from generation

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.860
to generation to
generation through time,

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.640
these plates have carried
many layers of the story.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.720
There is the technology itself--

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.480
that the dry plate photography.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.640
Then the fact that this
plate was-- this glass

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.300
was shipped to Peru, where
somewhat miraculously Harvard

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.440
had established an
observatory in the 1890s.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.930
It captured the starlight from
the sky on this date in 1897.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.720
And then that plate traveled
around the tip of South America

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.195
back to Cambridge where these
women spent time looking.

00:28:30.195 --> 00:28:32.570
And I do-- in the presence of
these plates I keep looking

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.300
at Lindsay who is in
the center who I--

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.760
graciously hosted me so many
times at the observatory.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.890
But in the presence
of these plates

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.689
I did feel the presence
of these women.

00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:43.730
I felt that there is a
way that their presence is

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.430
embodied in these objects.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.430
And then you know, the
fact of their archive--

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.220
that they are stored up the
hill here at the observatory

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.740
for more than 100 years--
that an archive is

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.120
its own kind of marvel.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.950
So there's all these
layers to that story

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.260
that I feel are
told in the details

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.100
of the emotion in that border
as well as the stars themselves.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.700
And part of-- one layer of that
story which Jennifer addresses

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.340
in her essay in
our publication is

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.390
that because these plates
are the oldest and most

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.520
comprehensive record
of the night sky,

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.820
they hold great historical
astronomical value.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.860
And so they're being digitized.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.550
And that digitization process
includes scanning the plates.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.230
And then if there
are any markings

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.330
on the plates from
the Harvard computers,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.880
those markings are wiped clean.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.010
And then the plate is
rescanned for a sort

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.261
of more cleaner, purer view
of the astronomical data.

00:29:38.261 --> 00:29:39.260
And something is gained.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.630
But certainly something
is lost in that process.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.700
And Jennifer speaks
eloquently in her essay

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.370
to that sort of
urgency of holding

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:51.650
the space open for the story
of these women to be told.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.820
And so I wanted to sort
of in making this drawing

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.380
sort of pay respect to the hours
spent looking by these women.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.920
And I actually hadn't made a
pencil drawing as an artist

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.490
ever.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.080
I hadn't made a pencil
drawing in 20 years.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.246
So I didn't even know if I
could really pull it off.

00:30:08.246 --> 00:30:12.080
But I just figured I would
just begin and find my way.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.950
And I started by drawing
a grid onto the paper

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.200
just as Henrietta Leavitt
often superimposed

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.990
a grid over her plates
to help orient herself.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.400
And then I just began.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.260
And star by star--

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.010
as you see the grid slowly
forming and disappearing--

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.270
star by star I found my way.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.500
And I knew that--

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.940
I knew it was a
large undertaking

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.650
to try to make this drawing.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.795
I don't think I realized quite
how large an undertaking.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:41.420
So this drawing
actually took me longer

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.610
to make than the stitch
dipped it took me

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.340
to sew, because every
time I picked up

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.740
my pencil it was like I
had to start all over again

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.890
and refind my way back in.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.470
But in that process
and in mirroring

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.090
the process of Leavitt--

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.070
the active looking,
the active observing--

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.960
I found that I wanted
to pay attention,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.210
that these stars
held my attention.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.120
And it was actually a joy to
pay attention-- that every day I

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.370
walked into my studio
through my studio door

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.440
into my studio I was
excited to be there.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.130
So with that action I
returned to my question

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.710
of what meaning is
held in a single action

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.350
and what meaning is built
with its repetition.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.320
And I think part of the goal of
this exhibition and part of all

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.810
of you here tonight-- we can
hold together collectively

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.210
the meaning that
Henrietta Leavitt built.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.520
But thinking about that
single action-- what meaning

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:34.530
is held there in my attention
being captured by these stars

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.560
I think about Henrietta
Leavitt's life.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.870
And very little correspondence
remains from her life.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.578
There's very little
known about her life.

00:31:40.578 --> 00:31:44.830
But what from I could find
here in the Harvard archives

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.500
reinforce that indeed she was
deeply committed and engaged

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.240
and passionate about this work.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.730
And I find great comfort
there, that in the specificity,

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.870
in the beauty, in the
uniqueness of that single action

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.370
there is meaning.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:02.890
Thank you.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.306
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.370
- OK.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.430
We've got about 10 minutes, a
little longer for discussion.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.930
Thank you.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.080
That was a fantastic talk.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.830
You already answered
most of the questions

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.360
I was planning to ask you.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.530
- But I said it so fast.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:32.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.935
We have to review some of it.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.010
- I guess I'd like to
start by asking you

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.340
a little bit about your process.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.830
One of the things that's been
striking to me in learning

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.350
about your work is the
way you have really

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.550
taken advantage of-- you've
learned about and absorbed

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.970
so many of the massive
technological developments

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.550
that have happened in
astronomy since the time

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.931
that Henrietta
Leavitt was working.

00:33:00.931 --> 00:33:02.680
Those are part of your
work in the way you

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.850
use data and the way
you use visualization.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:11.470
There have also been major
developments in sewing,

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.910
for example, say, the
industrial sewing machine.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:20.560
And I wanted to ask you about
why, given these developments,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.130
you choose to sew
your quilts by hand?

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.220
Every one of those
stitches is hand stitched.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.180
You could just send a
digital file off and have

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.720
these quilts made industrially.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.620
And they-- that would
be a lot faster.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.550
That's for sure.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.995
But you choose not to.

00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:46.780
You choose to take
this intensive big data

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.410
information from the
world of astronomy

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.670
and turn it into the hand.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.670
And I wonder if you could
just talk a little bit

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.460
about how and why you do that.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.200
- Sure.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.627
Well in one basic way hand--
when you hand stitch, you--

00:34:04.627 --> 00:34:06.460
and I do this rocking
motion, because that's

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.429
the rocking motion that
you do when you stitch.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.469
You sort of stack these
stitches onto a needle

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.090
and then pull it through.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.210
You have a single line of
thread, whereas with a machine

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.190
you have these two
threads that interlock.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.360
And you create a solid line.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.600
But with that hand stitching
you have this dotted line.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.360
And I've talked to you before
about this sort of the--

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.736
I call it the uncertainty
of the stitch--

00:34:27.736 --> 00:34:29.110
that there is this
way that there

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.850
is with the dotted
line an uncertainty.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.889
So translating this data
into the dotted line sort of

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:39.139
activates it in
this different way.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.350
But there's also a way that I--

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.659
just as I made my
way star by star

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:47.860
in the drawing that
finding my way sort of inch

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.489
by inch through this
terrain is an important part

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.159
of the process.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.570
This idea of mapping and going
back to that elemental theme

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.970
in my work of sort of
navigating that space

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.890
between the familiar
and the unfamiliar--

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.120
that the pace of sewing and that
sort of navigating that space

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.230
is central to the work.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.260
- So the stitch disappears--

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.040
like half the time
it disappears.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.550
- Exactly.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.050
Right.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.170
Well 50% of the stitch
is on the underside.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.670
Right.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.610
Exactly.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.110
- Great.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.970
I wonder if you could talk a
little bit about your working

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.200
routine.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.100
One of the things
that you've spoken

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.770
about in terms of
your admiration

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.010
for Henrietta Leavitt was her--

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.680
not just the intricacy of
her work and the noticing

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.570
but just the sheer stamina and
persistence of spending years

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.869
sitting at the observatory
looking at these plates.

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:45.660
And I wonder if you
could talk a little bit

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.860
about how your work--

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.280
how you see your work
relating to her work

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.080
in that way in terms of routine
and persistence perhaps.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.300
- Yeah, well and
that is why I work--

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.580
that I have research
based work, because

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.030
for me going out and
living in these archives

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.670
and experiencing them and
then having this story--

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.920
that story carries
me through the work.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.200
So if I just set
out and was sort of

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.580
like an endurance
artist of like,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.680
I will just repeat this
gesture over and over

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.140
and over again, it would
feel like an empty gesture.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.110
But-- and I know in some ways
it's like almost too heartfelt.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:22.710
But I felt--

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.860
I mean I felt Henrietta Leavitt
like every step of the way

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.640
in this process.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.610
And her story really carried
me through that work.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.500
And then when I
asked that question--

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.900
like what meaning is held
in a single gesture--

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.630
I think for me it was really
central to my own practice--

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.300
like sometimes I
do feel ridiculous

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.080
that I spend these hours
and hours making this work

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.670
but realizing that there
was real joy in it.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.920
I really locked in on
the sort of specificity--

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.714
that each of those
stars was so specific.

00:36:51.714 --> 00:36:53.880
And each of the stitch that
you make is so specific,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.200
and sort of diving into that and
embracing that specificity did

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.650
produce such satisfaction.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:03.120
So there was this way learning
that Henrietta Leavitt died

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.780
before, you know, the impact of
her findings was truly known,

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.820
feeling such a sense of
loss, and then feeling

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.050
such encouragement that
she was so deeply satisfied

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:13.620
by the work.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.930
And realizing that I, too,
feel that same satisfaction.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.630
So it is genuine--

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.920
--in case you didn't notice.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.990
- And that's another reason
that the machine stitch

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.990
wouldn't make sense as well.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:34.800
So I wanted to ask you to talk
a little more about the drawing

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.480
and in particular about the--

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.860
your decision to depict both a
positive and a negative plate.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.230
It would have been faster
and easier certainly

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.410
to choose one or the other.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:47.910
But--

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.954
- Negative-- the negative
is easier to draw.

00:37:49.954 --> 00:37:51.120
- Negative would be easiest.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.970
No, exactly.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:58.060
And I mean we both noted when we
visited the observatory house--

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.090
what's stunning
and defamiliarizing

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.710
about the plates
is that you expect

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.701
to go see a bunch of images of
the black sky with white stars

00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:05.200
on it.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.560
But for the most part it's
this milky surface with dots

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.390
that look very much
like a graphite drawing

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.670
in the first place.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.090
But Leavitt used
the juxtaposition

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.250
of positive and
negative plates to help

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.980
her locate variable stars.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.920
So she would put one
on top of the other.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.700
And if a star had varied
between the two exposures,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.230
you would see this
tiny misalignment

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.370
in the way the
light came through.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.790
So she's using positive
and negative in a way

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.704
to locate certain
kinds of stars.

00:38:38.704 --> 00:38:40.620
And I wonder if you could
just talk more about

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.762
how that relationship has--

00:38:43.762 --> 00:38:45.720
what that has meant for
you both in the drawing

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.053
and in your work more generally.

00:38:47.053 --> 00:38:50.580
The quilts too strike me
as being very much invested

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:55.140
in this very-- this kind of
high contrast relationship

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.910
between dark and light as well.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:57.660
- Right.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.600
Well absolutely
the initial spark

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.380
was that the positive
and negative plates

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.740
were so relevant to Leavitt's
own process of finding--

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.500
identifying these
variable stars.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.100
And the Orion
Nebula, which I drew

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.777
was the first place you
looked for those stars and is

00:39:13.777 --> 00:39:14.860
a birthplace of the stars.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.410
But I'll leave that to
Alyssa over there and Joel.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:22.150
So yes, but so there was this
like scientific connection.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.540
But then I realized
in my work so often I

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.470
set up these poles of sort of
positive and negative, life

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.270
and death and the diptych.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.050
I've touched on these you know
public and private, subjective

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.854
and objective that I so often--

00:39:35.854 --> 00:39:37.770
that I was doing it
through each body of work.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:39.895
I was like, oh, that one
was about black and white.

00:39:39.895 --> 00:39:42.510
And this one-- you know, so
that I set up these poles.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.670
And then I navigate
the space in between.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.860
So with these positive and
negatives in some ways,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.640
it is an inverse.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.030
It is a flip relationship.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.740
But in drawing the stars,
especially in those middle

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.120
range stars how you perceive
a middle range star--

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.290
so you know a sort of star
that's not bright and not tiny

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.822
but those middle range stars--

00:40:02.822 --> 00:40:05.030
really appeared so differently
on the positive plates

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.010
and appeared almost as different
stars in the negative so that

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.380
to me this sort of gray
area of-- or where there's

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.920
these touch points
that no longer polarize

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.800
the two extremes was
an interesting terrain

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.902
to navigate.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.300
- I'm curious
about your decision

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:29.660
to move into biography
for this project

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:34.800
and what that means for
you in terms of your work

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.260
maybe going forward as well.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.590
In your past work you
have had some moments

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.880
of self-portraiture.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.000
Portraiture has been part
of your work in the past.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.380
You've also worked with enormous
cultural and historical events

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.360
that haven't always
been tied cleanly

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.010
to the life of a single person.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.430
But here you're really working
on a biographical level

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.950
for perhaps the
first time, at least

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:05.460
in such a sustained
way in your work.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.100
How has that-- how
has-- how do you

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.435
see this over the span of
your own work than the way

00:41:13.435 --> 00:41:14.310
you think about time?

00:41:18.344 --> 00:41:20.510
- I was like wasn't expecting
the kicker at the end.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.322
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:24.010
- That was just a possible
example of something

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.220
you might say.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.720
- Well I was-- what
I was laughing--

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.011
what I was thinking about
when we were putting together

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:32.150
the book that Henrietta
Leavitt's logbook page is

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.850
on the cover.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.975
And I was remembering when
we were putting together

00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:37.940
the book that I was just so
enamored of her life and so--

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.579
I mean deeply respectful of
her life and accomplishments

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:43.370
that it was like Leavitt,
Leavitt, Leavitt.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.690
And then eventually
I was like, oh, wait.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.523
Actually I should be
in this book somewhere.

00:41:46.523 --> 00:41:48.230
I forget-- so there
was a way that

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.890
like that was just so enjoyable
really working specifically

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.860
on her story and
her life and wanting

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:59.000
to carry that story forward
that it felt no longer about me.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.880
But I-- what you just made
me realize that-- and yes,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.670
in some ways this body of work
has had that unique angle.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.760
But I realized all of my
bodies of work were like that.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.430
So in that series
As the Stars Go By,

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.260
these historical moments
that I depicted--

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.816
I became so passionate about--

00:42:14.816 --> 00:42:16.190
like the massacre
at Wounded Knee

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:19.160
was one event-- and sort of
really specifically telling

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.870
that story.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.640
So in that exhibition
I actually had

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.854
these sort of epic summaries
of the events that occurred.

00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:28.270
And that became
part of the piece.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.340
So in a lot of ways
it was a return

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.580
to that using
quilts as a vehicle

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.000
to carry a story through time
so really embracing and leaning

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.870
into the story behind the work.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:44.362
So in that way this exhibition
only reinforced that urge.

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.070
And then you added
time at the end there.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:46.861
And I was like, oh.

00:42:46.861 --> 00:42:47.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:47.784 --> 00:42:52.340
So I'm like going to have to
come back to that somehow.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.150
- Well it does seem that all--

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.800
each of the star
quilts, for example,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.580
usually depict a few hours
in the sky as the stars

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.450
move across the sky.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.680
Of course, it's actually
the Earth that's

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.790
moving and not the stars.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.831
I just wanted to make it
clear that I recognize--

00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:10.782
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.782 --> 00:43:12.230
--that I, in fact,
did know that.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.910
Yeah, we've got that.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:20.300
Anyway so you have these
multiple hour spans.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.960
But the quilts also have
a really strongly locative

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.964
quality to them.

00:43:25.964 --> 00:43:27.380
If you go into the
gallery, you'll

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.460
see that the birth panel
and the death panel--

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.710
one's over Lancaster,
Massachusetts.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.940
And one's over Cambridge.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.940
And they're taken at, of
course, different times

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.040
and also from different
points on the Earth.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.180
And the arc of the stars has
a slightly different radius

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.120
to it.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.940
So you really get a
sense looking at these

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.520
that you're looking not
just at a span of time,

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.880
but a specific point in space.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.100
And it just strikes
me that that's

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.310
part of what's so powerful
about this exhibition

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:05.460
and these works, is that despite
the cosmic vision of the quilts

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.440
and the sort of epic
histories that they discuss,

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.580
it always does come down, almost
as in a perspectival system,

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.570
down to a single
body experiencing

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.620
these cosmic events.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.510
So--

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:21.020
- Well said.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.520
Thank you.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.260
- Yeah.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.530
- That's why we
make a good team.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.240
I have one more question.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.120
And then let's go
look at the work.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.200
We've talked so much about the
relationship between your work

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.340
and astronomy or quilting--
all these other disciplinary

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.190
fields.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.960
But you're also an artist.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.110
And your work sits in a field
of art history as well--

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:53.510
a certain march of modern
and contemporary art.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.300
And I wonder if you'd
like to say anything

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.112
about how your work fits
into the history of art.

00:45:00.112 --> 00:45:01.820
We, for example, have
talked a little bit

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.710
about the way your quilts call
up Frank Stella's black stripe

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.180
paintings.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.740
But there are
multiple other ways

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.280
in terms of minimalism,
conceptual art that one

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.200
could talk art historically
about this work.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.380
And I just thought I'd
give you an opportunity

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.000
to say whatever
you wanted to say.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.249
- That is definitely your job.

00:45:21.249 --> 00:45:22.950
You're the art historian.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.950
But OK.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.290
I'll give it a shot.

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.750
- I just take my cues from you.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.120
So--

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.210
- Well I think my-- you know,
I've been working with this

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.680
medium of quilt--

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.030
quilts is primarily my meaning.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.600
This drawing is as I told you
I kind of out of left field.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.300
So I sort of have--

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.590
I don't think it's a
perfect term but working

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.050
with this idea of
conceptual craft.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.870
And the contemporary
art world is

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.780
more sort of encompassing
and embracing of that.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.180
But like I've been around
it for a little while now.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.460
And that-- it was a tough
road to sort of navigate down.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.820
So for me it was really locating
myself deeply in objects.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.440
As I said, I do feel
like these objects

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.490
can sort of carry this story
but really coming at it

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:08.660
from a conceptual practice.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.480
So I really identify more
as a conceptual artist

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.560
in that it's research based.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.280
But it is really the idea
that drives the idea forward.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.990
And the more I can
step out of the way--

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.880
I mean I love the star
calculation software,

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.630
because I'm like you're telling
me what these arcs will be.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:28.080
And so they are a drawn line
but as prescribed by the system.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.590
And so for me it's really
marrying that story--

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.290
you know, the idea of a
story with conceptual art

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.220
that I've said
this before that I

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.750
feel like story gets a bad rap.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.480
Or it feels very quaint
or very gendered.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.365
And conceptual art has a certain
sort of appeal and sexiness

00:46:46.365 --> 00:46:46.865
behind it.

00:46:46.865 --> 00:46:49.640
And I was like, hey, I want some
of that-- that conceptual art

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.280
really is just a story
that drives the work.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.885
And so I am leaning
into that story.

00:46:56.885 --> 00:46:58.510
- Maybe you should
be an art historian.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.810
[LAUGHTER] That's very good.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.710
OK.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:06.130
We are not going to have
an audience Q&amp;A. That

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.570
is what the opening is for.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:13.620
So with a reminder to
check onviewatradcliffe.org

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.730
for the many events
that will be happening

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.850
in the gallery going forward
over the next couple months.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.000
I will release us all
to go see the work.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.980
And please join me in thanking
Anna again for her wonderful--

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:25.980
--talk.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.130
