00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome back.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.130
We're almost done learning all
the rules or laws of angles

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.420
that we need to start
playing the angle game.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.550
So let's just teach
you a couple of more.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.200
So let's say I have two
parallel lines, and you may not

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.700
know what a parallel line is
and I will explain

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.850
it to you now.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.570
So I have one line like this --
you probably have an intuition

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.330
what a parallel line means.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.140
That's one of my parallel
lines, and let me make the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.540
green one the other
parallel line.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.910
So parallel lines, and I'm
just drawing part of them.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.320
We assume that they keep on
going forever because these are

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.080
abstract notions -- this light
blue line keeps going and going

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.880
on and on and on off the screen
and same for this green line.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.930
And parallel lines are two
lines in the same plane.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.310
And a plane is just kind of
you can kind of use like a

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.270
flat surface is a plane.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.630
We won't go into
three-dimensional space

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.450
in geometry class.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.990
But they're on the same plane
and you can view this plane as

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.130
the screen of your computer
right now or the piece of paper

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.610
you're working on that never
intersect each other and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.960
they're two separate lines.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620
Obviously if they were drawn
on top of each other then

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.410
they intersect each
other everywhere.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.500
So it's really just two
lines on a plane that never

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.640
intersect each other.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.840
That's a parallel line.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.210
If you've already learned your
algebra and you're familiar

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.190
with slope, parallel lines are
two lines that have the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.430
same slope, right?

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.160
They kind of increase or
decrease at the same rate.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.540
But they have different
y intercepts.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.800
If you don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.510
don't worry about it.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.670
I think you know what a
parallel line means.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.840
You've seen this -- parallel
parking, what's parallel

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080
parking is when you park a car
right next to another car

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.970
without having the two cars
intersect, because if the cars

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.690
did intersect you would have to
call your insurance company.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.710
But anyway, so those
are parallel lines.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.440
The blue and the green
lines are parallel.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.210
And I will introduce you to
a new complicated geometry

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050
term called a transversal.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.800
All a transversal is is
another line that actually

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.940
intersects those two lines.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.320
That's a transversal.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.310
Fancy word for something
very simple, transversal.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.370
Let me write it down just
to write something down.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.745
Transversal.

00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:18.690
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.510
It crosses the other two lines.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.640
I was thinking of mnemonics
for transversals, but I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.390
probably was thinking of
things inappropriate.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.710
But anyway

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.810
going on with the geometry.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.710
So we have a transversal
that intersects the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.660
two parallel lines.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.910
What we're going to do is think
of a bunch of -- and actually

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.060
if it intersects one
of them it's going to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.320
intersect the other.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.380
I'll let you think about that.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.940
There's no way that I can draw
something that intersects one

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.750
parallel line that doesn't
intersect the other, as long as

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.800
this line keeps going forever.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.790
I think that that might be
pretty obvious to you.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.690
But what I want to do
is explore the angles

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.640
of a transversal.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.180
So the first thing I'm
going to do is explore

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.490
the corresponding angles.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.500
So let's say corresponding
angles are kind of the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.890
same angle at each of
the parallel lines.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.000
That's how I think of them.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.240
So this angle, this angle,
and this angle are

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.260
corresponding angles.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.890
They kind of play the same
role where the transversal

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.830
intersects each of the lines.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.820
As you can imagine, and as it
looks from my amazingly neat

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.390
drawing -- I'm normally not
this good -- that these are

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.780
going to be equal
to each other.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.500
So if this is x, this
is also going to be x.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
If we know that then we could
use, actually the rules that we

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.510
just learned to figure out
everything else about

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.390
all of these lines.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.740
Because if this is x then what
is this going to be right here?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.260
What is this angle going
to be in magenta?

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.970
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.990
Well, these are opposite
angles, right?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.785
They're on opposite
side of crossing lines

00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:03.810
so this is also x.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.940
 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.410
And similar we can do
the same thing here.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.030
This is the opposite angle of
this angle, so this is also x.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.580
 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.010
Let me pick a good color.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.520
What is yellow?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.180
What is this angle going to be?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.310
Well, just like we
were doing before.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.090
Look, we have this huge
angle here, right?

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.910
This angle, this whole
angle is 180 degrees.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.860
So x and this yellow angle are
supplementary, so we could call

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:47.000
this angle y, and this is
equal to 180 minus x, right?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.300
And we're just using
supplementary angles here.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260
Well, if this angle is y, then
this angle is opposite to y.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.100
So this angle is also y.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.560
Fascinating.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.220
And similarly, if we have x up
here and x is supplementary to

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.920
this angle as well, right?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.600
So this is equal to 180 minus
x where it also equals y.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.330
And then opposite angles,
this is also equal to y.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.170
So there's all sorts of
geometry words and rules that

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.170
fall out of this, and I'll
review them real fast but

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.090
it's really nothing fancy.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.850
All I did is I started
off with the notion of

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.850
corresponding angles.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.320
I said well, this x
is equal to this x.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.350
I said, oh well, if those are
equal to each other, well not

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.810
even if -- I mean if this is x
and this is also x because

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.590
they're opposite, and the
same thing for this.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.260
Then, well, if this is x and
this is x and those equal

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.750
each other, as they should
because those are also

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.750
corresponding angles.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.310
These two magenta angles
are playing the same role.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.270
They're both kind of
the bottom left angle.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.970
That's how I think about it.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.420
We went around, we used
supplementary angles to kind

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.820
of derive well, these y
angles are also the same.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.000
This y angle is equal to
this y angle because

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.290
they're corresponding.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.270
This y angle is equal to
this y angle because

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.660
it's corresponding.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.800
So corresponding angles
are equal to each other.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.820
It makes sense, they're kind
of playing the same role.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.270
The bottom right, if you look
at the bottom right angle.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.020
So corresponding
angles are equal.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:22.870
 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.130
That's my shorthand notation.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.360
And we've really just
derived everything already.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.650
That's all you really
have to know.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.040
But if you wanted to kind of
skip a step, you also know

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:46.530
the alternate interior
angles are equal.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.320
So what do I mean by
alternate interior angles?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.980
Well, the interior angles are
kind of the angles that are

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.560
closer to each other in the two
parallel lines, but they're on

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.410
opposite side of
the transversal.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.850
That's a very complicated way
of saying this orange angle and

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.300
this magenta angle right here.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.760
These are alternate interior
angles, and we've already

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.630
proved if this is
x then that is x.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.420
So these are alternate
interior angles.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.570
This x and then that x
are alternate interior.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.220
And actually this y and this y
are also alternate interior,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.120
and we already proved that
they equal each other.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.520
Then the last term that you'll
see in geometry is alternate --

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.360
I'm not going to write the
whole thing -- alternate

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.800
exterior angle.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.760
Alternate exterior
angles are also equal.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.970
That's the angles on the kind
of further away from each other

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.270
on the parallel lines, but
they're still alternate.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.790
So an example of that is this x
up here and this x down here,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.540
right, because they're on the
outsides of the two parallel

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.000
lines, right -- one's on
top, one's on bottom.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.470
Then they're on opposite
sides, on alternate sides,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.680
of the transversal.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.720
These are just fancy words,
but I think hopefully

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.770
you have the intuition.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.410
Corresponding a angles make
the most sense to me.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.180
Then everything else proves out
just through opposite angles

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.450
and supplementary angles.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:18.150
But alternate exterior is
that angle and that angle.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.880
Then the other alternate
exterior is this y and this y.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.870
Those are also equal.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.150
So if you know these, you know
pretty much everything you need

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.190
to know about parallel lines.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.300
The last thing I'm going to
teach you in order to play the

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.780
geometry game with full force
is just that the angles in a

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.140
triangle add up to 180 degrees.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.770
 

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.580
So let me just draw a
triangle, a kind of

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.580
random looking triangle.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.300
That's my random
looking triangle.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.690
And if this is x, this
is y, and this is z.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.380
We know that the angles of a
triangle -- x degrees plus y

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:06.910
degrees plus z degrees are
equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.580
So if I said that this is
equal to, I don't know, 30

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.240
degrees, this is equal to,
I don't know, 70 degrees.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.170
Then what does z equal?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:23.650
Well, we would say 30 plus 70
plus z is equal to 180, or

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.740
100 plus z is equal to 180.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.150
Subtract 100 from both sides.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.480
z would be equal to 80 degrees.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.150
We'll see variations of this
where you get two of the angles

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.250
and you can use this property
to figure out the third.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.450
With everything we've now
learned, I think we're

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.290
ready to kind of ease
into the angle game.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.510
I'll see you in the next video.
