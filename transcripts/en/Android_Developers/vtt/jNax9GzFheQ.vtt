KATHRYN SHIH: Almost
everyone on the Studio team

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.140
has a development
background, so we're all

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.320
very familiar with the love/hate
relationship you build up

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.510
with the tools you use.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.590
And that's why we
started building Studio,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.320
because we wanted it to
be as easy as possible

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.690
to ship Android apps.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.360
But, of course, I'm saying
this because I'm on the team.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.380
So instead of
listening to me, we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.850
asked a bunch of
Android developers

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.600
why they choose to use Studio.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.570
MATT LAROCHE: The reason
our team at Strava

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.940
uses Android Studio is because
it's built for Android.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.690
The new emulator feels
like using a phone,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.774
but it's on your computer.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.356
For a long time,
what we were doing is

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:32.170
we were deploying to
our phone in our hand,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.050
then looking up at the
screen, looking down.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.170
It's even faster to just
look next to your IDE

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.585
and see it on your screen.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:39.960
Getting the latest
from Google is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.090
kind of like sitting
outside of their office

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.980
and asking for an update,
but a little easier.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.970
SRDJAN PANTIC: I'm a member of
the Android team in Netflix.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.000
And we are using the
Android Studio as best way

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.730
to develop Netflix
app on Android.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610
You don't really think
about core checks

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.910
until you need them, right?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.480
So, for example, you're
trying to look up the string,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.690
and you pass
integer value to it.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.915
That's example, and
Android Studio core check

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:06.660
would actually find
the potential problem

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.670
that you will have.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.170
SOFIYA TASKOVA:
Android Studio helps

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.150
me remember where I came
from and where I want to go.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.730
It keeps me in the flow,
so I can code faster.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.950
I use a lot of the
little shortcuts,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.610
like find usages or
go to whatever classes

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.680
extend the current class.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.110
The navigation that
I use on it keeps

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
a sort of replica of
my trail of thoughts.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260
All these shortcuts help
me fly through the code.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.987
And at Hipmunk, we love to fly.

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.320
KATHRYN SHIH: All of the
professional Android developers

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.140
we talk to use Android
Studio for their apps.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.450
And their feedback has
been really important

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.660
for us to know to focus on
things like speed, smarts,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.890
and platform support.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
Our hope is that this lets them
spend their time concentrating

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.440
on building amazing experiences
for their end users.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.200
MATT LAROCHE: I don't
understand, like,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.150
why this video exists.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.893
It's like, Android
Studio is really good.

00:01:57.893 --> 00:01:58.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.130
It's like, what else
are you going to use?
