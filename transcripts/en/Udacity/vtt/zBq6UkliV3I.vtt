00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.965
Inserting the row, Madhya Pradesh, 28, 50.0, 60

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:06.970
into our aadhaar table would be allowed, despite the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.560
fact that it's sort of gibberish. Madhya Pradesh's

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.980
size will be stored as 50.0 square kilometers and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.870
it's population would be stored as 60. The

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.580
interesting thing here is that the capital would be

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.920
stored as 28, a string which doesn't really make

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.570
much sense. But, in any case, the data would

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.110
still be stored. You should always be careful to define the data

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.930
types for your columns in a sensible way. For example, storing numbers as

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.030
strings is problematic. Since it disallows

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.980
us from doing numerical computations on

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.560
the column. For example, taking the average value or finding the minimum value.
