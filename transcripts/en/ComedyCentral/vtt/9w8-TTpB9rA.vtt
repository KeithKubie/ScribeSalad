 - SNL honestly hasn't
 changed that much.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.878
 What's really changed is you.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.946 size:88% position:44%
  Life fucked you so
  hard to the point

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.616 line:0%
 that recurring characters
 and famous actors struggling

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.385 align:start size:88% position:13%
to read cue cards isn't
what it used to be.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.721 size:88% position:44%
  SNL isn't for you anymore.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.390
 You don't even know who most
 of the musical guests are.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.993
 The Weeknd is just
 one guy, not a band.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.961 size:88% position:44%
 My bones are frail.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.164 size:88% position:44%
  It's hard to admit
  that you're older,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.932
 the gray pubes are coming in,

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.536 align:start position:0%
 and that Beck Bennett is this
 generation's Phil Hartman.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:37.837
Oh yes.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.508
 Let that sink in for a
 minute, why don't ya?

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.612
 Ninjas suck.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.247
 If you have to fight
 a bunch of ninjas,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.782
they all get knocked out easily.

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:53.419 size:88% position:44%
 If you have to fight one by
 itself, it takes forever.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.021 line:0%
They're either an empty promise

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.622 align:start size:88% position:13%
 or a lingering fart
 on the elevator

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.659 size:88% position:44%
  that needs to just
  slowly fade away.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.668
 Folks rant and rave about how
 brilliantly bad The Room is,

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.037 size:88% position:44%
 but honestly, it's
 just really boring.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
 An excentric, rich,
 foreign weirdo named Tommy,

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.209
 who has the same type
 of Eurotrash accent

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.512
 as every man that lets a girl
 poop on his chest in a porn

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.682
 is amusing for about
 the first 15 minutes.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.984
And he sincerely tried his best.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.053 size:88% position:44%
  He did as good a
  job making a movie

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.021
 as I would running
 the obstacle courses

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:30.490 size:88% position:44%
  on American Ninja Warrior.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:34.293 align:start position:0%
 There are truly bad movies
 like the 2015 Fantastic Four,

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.828
 or Jupiter Accending

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.064 size:88% position:44%
 that cost hundreds
 of millions to make

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.799
and have an army
of crew members,

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:43.236 align:start position:0%
  and yet they make no sense
  and contains zero fun.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.004 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Before we make fun
  of Tommy Wiseau

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.707 align:start position:0%
 and the way he says, "You're
 tearing me apart, Lisa",

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.442
 let's remember every
 six months a bunch

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.511
 of British white guys
 pretend to be Egyptian

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.046
 and scream a lot, and
 that is so much worse.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.815 size:84% position:42%
  I'm looking at you, Noah,

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.884
gods of Egypt, exegists,

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:02.021 size:88% position:44%
  everything else I've seen
  on a plane when I'm alone.
