00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:20.288
Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the main greenhouse gas in climate change.

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.656
So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere?

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:28.256
Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun,

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:31.788
which heats the Earth's surface with more energy

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:34.421
in one hour than the whole world uses in a year.

00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.771
Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs,

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.838
take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air,

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.605
mix them together, and BAM!

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.188
They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates

00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:49.121
such as glucose and sucrose.

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:52.072
The process is called photosynthesis.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:54.239
When animals like us eat those plants

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.388
our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth.

00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:00.771
Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process,

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.138
and are released through waste.

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:08.205
If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:12.656
and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:18.055
As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:24.287
But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth.

00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:28.138
When this happens, they're compressed under tons of pressure,

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.240
and turned into carbon-based fossil fuels

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.604
like oil, coal or natural gas.

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:37.955
Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been pulling those fossil fuels out of the ground

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:41.572
and burning them, activating the stored energy

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:44.305
to make electricity and power engines.

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:52.671
But the thing is it also releases millions of years worth of stored CO2 back into the air.

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:57.021
In addition, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2.

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.188
But plants do the opposite.

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:04.620
Trees suck up huge amounts of CO2, which balances the cycle.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.304
Thus, deforestation reduces the plants that store CO2.

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:11.939
We're attacking the cycle from both sides.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.256
Think of it like a computer. A computer can operate a few programs at a time, right?

00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:20.421
Normally, when you've finished with a document, you save, and you close it,

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.921
so as not to overwork the computer.

00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.071
Then, imagine you stopped closing your documents.

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:28.505
So they were all open at once.

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:30.355
Your computer wouldn't be able to process it all.

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:33.971
It would start to slow down, and then to freeze, and eventually it would crash.

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:38.471
Which might be where our environment is heading if we keep overloading the carbon cycle.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:41.688
So is there any way to rebalance the ecosystem?

00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:46.771
What about technology? Technology is defined as a technique to solve a problem.

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:52.005
And so, sustainable technologies are those whose output is equal to their input.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.855
They do not create negative externalities,

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.788
such as CO2, in the present or the future.

00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:01.288
They sort of cancel themselves out to solve the problem.

00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:04.788
To achieve this, we need to invent sustainable technologies.

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:09.005
If we put all the ideas and technologies ever created into one circle,

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.438
then invention is the pushing of the boundaries of that circle.

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:15.672
And the area outside of the circle is infinite,

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:18.989
meaning the potential for invention is limitless.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.556
Think about some of the incredible clean technologies we have today. [Wind; Electric &amp; Solar Cars; Biogas]

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.439
[Biofuels; Photosynthetic Algae; Compost] All those ideas have one thing in common.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:29.288
They all came from people. People innovate.

00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:34.921
People create. It's the limitless potential of creative people

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:39.371
to build unimagined technologies that is going to stop climate change

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:45.455
and rebalance the ecosystem. And that is something to be hopeful about.
