1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,340
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:05,860
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,030
December 19th,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,200
2016 what's going on out?
Um,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,530
oh Jesus Christ, my fucking
computer. Every five seconds.

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,900
Do you want to download this?
Do you want to do this now?

7
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:23,650
Do you want to do it in an hour? Should
I remind you later on tonight? Lay.

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,180
Give me some fucking space.
Jesus Christ.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,480
He's fucking God. Damn. I Dunno man.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,160
I'm not going to do this shit at all.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,630
Just the level with which that sits
fucking, I guess because of technology,

12
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:42,470
I am able to do this. You know,
if it was back in the day,

13
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:46,970
I would not be able to do this. What is
this you, you ask, maybe you didn't ask.

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,040
Maybe I'm doing that thing where
I'm putting words in your mouth,

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,510
but if you did ask, you know,
but doing a podcast, you know,

16
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,600
I guess there's always a price
to pay and I think that the,

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,660
I think that that's one to grow on.
Maybe that's the lesson.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,910
I swear to God, I want to start
a fucking church. I got to do it.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,740
You guys been watching that?
Uh, that woman from a king
of Queens, she played, uh,

20
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,340
the beautiful wife, you know,
to the guy who drives the truck.

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,740
Did you know that? Well, how they've
always done comps. The honeymooners. Hey,

22
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,430
I fucking drive a bus and you know,
I'm,

23
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm the wise crack can be
pretty wife. Well, Ralph,

24
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,140
maybe if you weren't a fucking eight,
Yay.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,190
One of these days. Alice power, right?

26
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:40,240
The baby maker right now what they did
sound like that little fucking ice box in

27
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:44,860
the corner, you know? And then
you get into the 60s, right?

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,000
Sixties was like the Blue Ball era of,
uh,

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,610
of sitcoms.
You know what I mean?

30
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,780
Yet I dream of Jeannie and the fucking
guy would teach us, wouldn't banger.

31
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,810
I've talked about this shit before.
I remember watching as a kid.

32
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:01,510
It's like you've got, why don't you like
rubbing up against her or something?

33
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,210
You know? I didn't even know
what sex was. You know why?

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,710
Because it was no internet.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,910
Now if there was internet back when I
was watching that show and I was like

36
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,170
seven or eight, uh, you know, I would
have been like, why does any, well, hey,

37
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,340
you're fucking prefers jockey style
over the fucking genie lamp. You know,

38
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,560
I would know all this extra shit.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,630
That's what the fuck is wrong with
kids nowadays. It's like they just,

40
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,980
they take care of Alamo. I'm
going on. An old man ran,

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,330
they get on these fucking computers,
right? That parents are like me.

42
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,150
They don't know how to work them. They're
not even interested in them. You know,

43
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,930
we're in the fucking corner
making homemade apple side
of getting ready for the

44
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,310
holidays.
You know,

45
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,070
wearing a Christmas sweater that
we think actually looks good.

46
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,700
We're not wearing it.
Ironically. Well like got, this
is my Christmas sweater, Joe.

47
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,680
My fucking mother's sell this together
for me when I was in high school still

48
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:56,300
fits. You know, sweaters always
still fits because they stretch.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,630
They like the sweatpants for just your
torso. You know that it takes a while.

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,350
Like, if you have a homemade sweater,
you know, one of those lobster fishermen,

51
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,080
ones that your mom would make,
you know,

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,410
and she just give it to you in the bag
that she bought the yarn and you know,

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,680
then one day you look at it and some
fucking moths started eating at it and you

54
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,080
just like,

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,080
is it the 18 hundreds really a
fucking caterpillar learn God,

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,240
it's fucking pilots license
and now as eating my sweater,

57
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,241
this is like so fucking 1826 how is
this happening right now for the love of

58
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,290
God? Mom, can you go to
the Ray on store? You know,

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,110
can you make me a fucking polyester?
Did his sweater.

60
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,920
How about why don't you do that?
Why can't you do that? I mean,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
Jesus Christ is fucking children doing it.
Sweatshops around the world.

62
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,440
You got to come and meet with yard.

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,600
That's the problem with all the
mothers nowadays. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,470
That did them in the fucking yard.
They just won't let go of it.

65
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,220
I'm just fucking with you. What kind of
woman knows how to knit anymore? You know,

66
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,720
trying to find a woman that knows how to
knit is like trying to find a guy that

67
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,300
knows, still knows how to
hunt. You know what I mean?

68
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,450
And that even goes for
the fucking rednecks.

69
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,010
You're not doing it the way
you fucking, you're, you're,

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
you're way less fucking,

71
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:24,041
I don't know what four wheeler
fucking ancestors hunted,

72
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,390
almost talk myself into a
corner and I was like, God,

73
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,690
I don't want to do the Hacky,
you know,

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,250
saying your grandfather who first had
sex with the fucking relative, you know,

75
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,530
I didn't want to say that.
I don't, I didn't, I didn't
want to go down that road.

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,770
I don't even know if that's true,
but how the fuck did that start?

77
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,243
You know what I mean?

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,340
One fucking guy bangs his sister and
then all of a sudden everybody out there

79
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:49,460
that has a four wheeler, it's
still on it. You know what I mean?

80
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:50,870
Okay.

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,600
They can just take like,
they don't have Facebook.

82
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,110
You don't have to be lonely.
I like,

83
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,090
have they gotten more aggressive on that
farmers only where they've really just

84
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,540
started shitting on fucking city folk.
You know what I mean?

85
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,190
City folk just don't get it

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,700
and they still make
themselves look stupid.

87
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,990
City folk just don't get it.
They could go with global warming,

88
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:21,260
they could go with overpopulation,
they could go with quality of air,

89
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,090
quality of life space.

90
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,500
There's so many different
directions that hey,

91
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,720
you want to come back to my place and
you'd go there and it's like some fucking

92
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:32,900
city apartment. You know what I mean?
With like the kitchen is in the bedroom,

93
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,161
you know in the bed.

94
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:37,430
Folds down from the wall that you
could fucking attack them that way.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,700
You know what I mean? Someone true
to try to come through their window.

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,410
May City folks just don't get it and
then they go to this spread, right?

97
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:47,910
Yeah.

98
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,250
Fucker.
Get your own parking space.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,210
You're not driving around the block
like fucking nine hours trying to find

100
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,800
alternative side of the street. Fucking
parking. There's all these things.

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,450
Water levels rising.
You know,

102
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,150
I saw this one of these man in the street
things I've been watching that debt

103
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:08,270
channel Vice, you guys watched the vice
channel. It's a fucking great channel.

104
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,810
Reminds me a lot of ways,
a little bit of, um,

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,790
MTV during the early days were like,
they had a lot of funny promo commercials.

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,230
I don't know why more fucking networks
don't do that. Cause you know,

107
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,900
he usually fast forward, I turned the
channel when there's a commercial,

108
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,570
but they got like,
they have funny fucking commercials.

109
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:30,050
Like there's some talk show on there,
these two black dudes right now,

110
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:33,870
at least one black dude and one
guy sort of Puerto Rican maybe. Um,

111
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,560
maybe he's light skinned. I don't know.
I'm too white to understand. Right.

112
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,060
So that they do a talk show.

113
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,850
So they're hyping it and they're showing
like the New York City, you know,

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,690
skyline like they always do
before talk show. And it was a,

115
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,010
I'm going to fuck up the joke. It was
something like, no big guests, no band,

116
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:53,860
no audience, no white dudes.
And then they cut to the Promo.

117
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,780
Somebody comes out, you know, and I can't
know what the fuck was. I was watching,

118
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,591
I was like,
this is funny.

119
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,780
This looks like way back in the
day when I would see like Randy,

120
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:04,640
the redwoods agenda, taxi driver, you
know, they would have like funny promos.

121
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,710
I Dunno why they ever got away
from that. But, um, anyways,

122
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,200
Oh, speaking of that,
speaking of [inaudible],

123
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,390
um,

124
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,530
I saw a fucking front man this weekend
in a band that was fucking unbelievable,

125
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:25,100
right? I went down, um, uh,
the other day I did, uh,

126
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,380
the dark matter podcast, um,
which is Dave Navarro's podcast.

127
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,980
And um,
had a great time on that.

128
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,390
And afterwards they were like, yeah, hey,
Dave's doing his show down at the Roxy.

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,700
You want to come down Friday, Saturday
night, I guess. I mean, I'm on,

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,790
I'm in the dark here.
Literally, no pun intended.

131
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,750
I didn't know he did the
Christmas show every year. Um,

132
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,040
and it was like an all star lineup.

133
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,110
You don't know who the
fuck's coming out and um,

134
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,910
you just go to the show and then they
just start bringing people out. And, um,

135
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,210
so I went down there to go
see the show and I mean,

136
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,330
I knew it was going to be good.
Dude was fucking ridiculous,

137
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,790
the amount of people
that they had coming out,

138
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,490
which of course I'm going to fucking
forget the names and everything, but uh,

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,570
you just, you know, some will
come out, this guy could,

140
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,660
they sang Stuart's saying the
immigrant song and something else.

141
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,980
It fucking murdered it.

142
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,010
I never even heard of the guy fucking
murdered at the band was unbelievable.

143
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,350
The viral was killing it.
And then they,

144
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,710
then they brought out Macy
gray and then she sang, uh,

145
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,080
the fuck did she sing?
She sang the pretenders brass in pocket,

146
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,790
and then she's saying Radiohead
creep. I was just like, Jesus Christ,

147
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,301
what the fuck?

148
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,680
And then they brought out Cypress Hill
and Nolan was doing like their own style

149
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:46,940
of music to everybody would like switch
it up. So then they bring out this,

150
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,990
they get this fucking intro,
which no performer wants to get,

151
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,340
right? The guy goes to do the
intro and he just goes, uh, yeah,

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,910
Billy Morrison was there. Just
fucking everybody. Right goes, um,

153
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,210
by this next guy, you know, people
suggested him for this show. Uh,

154
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,910
you know, first few like
gay, you know, we don't know.

155
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,500
We don't know if he's right for this show.

156
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,670
And then we saw him and he
absolutely blew us away.

157
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,290
Our jaws were on the ground. I'm telling
you, this fucking guy is unbelievable,

158
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,570
Yada Yada. And I'm thinking, I was
in the crowd going, oh no, not that.

159
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:28,070
That intro was to fucking war. You can't
follow it. It's, I can stand up comedy.

160
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
This guy he's wanting to on
a bachelor in commerce today,

161
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,140
he reinvented the Mike Stand.
Eddie Murphy was still doing stand up.

162
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,220
He for this guy to write from it.
You know,

163
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:40,320
they start giving you a
fucking intro like that.

164
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,470
You're just in the back like guy,
hey, tone it down, tone it down.

165
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:48,000
Right to this guy came out and
totally fucking lived up to it.

166
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,620
It's, this guy's a rapper. I man,

167
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,470
I don't know shit about hip hop or
anything like this Guy Post Malone.

168
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,670
So the guy on stage for whatever reason
said this guy's responsible for Justin

169
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,450
Bieber's career.
Right?

170
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,320
Which I don't know why you would say
that in front of a bunch of fucking 40 to

171
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,810
50 something year old white people,
right.

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,380
So this dude comes walking out and
there's a few people bowing like Ba,

173
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,800
you know, like five people because
of the Justin Bieber thing.

174
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,260
I love people in their forties and 50s
who fucking talk about how bad Justin

175
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,190
Bieber's music is. It's like, really? It
doesn't speak to you. You fucking dope.

176
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:31,080
It's not for you. You know what I mean?
That's like getting mad at the fucking,

177
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,270
I don't insult the guy, but you
know what I mean? It's, it's for,

178
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,720
it's for younger people. You know
what I mean? I think hat like,

179
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't understand people getting in
their forties and 50s and they just, they,

180
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,240
they don't understand that,
um,

181
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,190
somebody perspective as a 20 something
year old is not going to seem like the

182
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:54,210
same as theirs.
And we sitting there going like,

183
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,360
what the fuck is he talking about?
I'm like, that's bullshit. That's a,

184
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,580
that's a stupid blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. And it's like, yeah, yeah.

185
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,990
That's what you did when you
were there that age and somebody,

186
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,160
he'll be in his forties and look
back at himself at 2123 going,

187
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:09,150
what the fuck was I thinking?
Right. Somehow like four
or five people don't get,

188
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,110
and they're literally Boeing,
you know Justin Bieber at a show.

189
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,640
Justin Bieber isn't that.

190
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,190
So this guy comes fucking walking out and
he just walks up to the microphone and

191
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,710
he goes, what's up la?
I'm drunk as fuck. Right?

192
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:27,270
So immediately the crowd just starts
cheering and he goes, I, you know,

193
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm usually,
you know,

194
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,910
I'm a rapper and everybody I was
assuming in the crowd was like,

195
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,220
we're going like, yeah, I'm
completely unfamiliar with you.

196
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,450
I am a white guy pushing 50 I
have no idea who you are. Right?

197
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,460
So they start playing
rage against the machine,

198
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:48,420
killing in the name of, and I'm like
going, Oh God, uh, rappers gonna sink.

199
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,800
Do they got the auto tune on? You
know, is this gonna be like a,

200
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,300
is he going to have too much
deodorant under his arms?

201
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,630
Like fucking ll cool j when he did the
Unplug, what's going to happen here?

202
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,290
Do this guy,
this guy fucking murdered the son,

203
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,950
fucking murdered this song.
Tell,

204
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,060
just took the whole thing to another
level and it never came back down again.

205
00:12:11,061 --> 00:12:13,980
Everybody else matched this guy.
This fucking dude was unbelievable.

206
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,330
He sang that song and then he's saying
Alison chains would and fucking murdered

207
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:24,520
both of them. Um, and you
literally felt it in the crowd.

208
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,770
Everybody on their phones go like,
who the fuck is this guy?

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,400
I gotta download some of his shit.
Um,

210
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,680
oh,
he's hilarious thing.

211
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:37,540
So later on that weekend I'm watching
vice and there's another funny promo.

212
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,670
He's sitting there, that
Guy Post Malone, right?

213
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,720
And I was sitting there with near gone.

214
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,750
That's the fucking guy I saw that
the guy that murdered that song,

215
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,470
those two songs. Right. So, um,

216
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,840
he was talking about conspiracy theory.

217
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,850
I don't even know what
the commercial was about.

218
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,770
It was just him talking to another guy.
I'm telling you,

219
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,690
very like early days of MTV.

220
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,250
He was just talking about
conspiracy theory and, uh,

221
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,860
being able to teleport.

222
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,860
And he was just going
like say is area 51 right?

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,060
Which of course he picks that rather
than saying San Diego, okay, he goes,

224
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,000
here's area 51 right here.
Here's Australia.

225
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,780
If you want to fly from area
51 to Australia, you've got
to fly all the way here.

226
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,170
You know,
and he draws the arc too.

227
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,240
We just didn't draw straight lines like
someone actually understands aviation,

228
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:23,680
right?
Cause this is what creeped me out.

229
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,810
Cause if you just do a straight line
and be like, all right, this guy's,

230
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,320
this guy's out of his mind. But the
second he drew the arc, I'm like, Oh fuck,

231
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:33,550
I'm buying into this theory. Right?
And he goes, um, and he goes,

232
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,600
well with teleportation,

233
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:39,130
they just do stuff like this and he just
takes the paper and the x were area 51

234
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:43,240
was in the x for Australia is he just
takes the paper and he just folds and he

235
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,360
pushes them together. He
goes, it's like that. He goes,

236
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,420
I know you guys think I'm out of my mind,
but I know this shit is true.

237
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,440
And I was like, this guy's brain.
That's what my brain tells me, you know,

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,520
so I, I don't know anything about
any of his, uh, and he was, uh,

239
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,260
any of his music, but I'm definitely
gonna Watch, download some of his shit.

240
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,430
If anybody knows what is best
album is or whatever, you know,

241
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,540
a good jump off point for
that guy. Um, it would be,

242
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,070
it would be a be tremendous.
Um, so anyways, oh by the way,

243
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,210
Navarro fucking killed the
guitar solo in that too.

244
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,490
I was wondering how the
hell he was going to do it.

245
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,290
Now I don't know if they came up with a,
a,

246
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:27,040
an effects pedal that made
the noise that the dude from a

247
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,650
yeah.

248
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,650
You know, fucking rage against
the machine. You know, cause he,

249
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,480
when he came out of here that will, those
weird sounds that he made. I don't know.

250
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,240
You know, I was in over my head
musically about fucking 15 minutes ago,

251
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,770
but whatever. And I want to thank
everybody at dark matter for, uh,

252
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,360
for hooking me up, um,
to see that show. Uh,

253
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,700
it was fucking great, man. Just a
great God damn show. So, of course,

254
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:53,030
I talked to Dean del Rey
who sees everything. He
goes, oh yeah, man. He goes,

255
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:58,031
I went to that show at like the fifth
anniversary and it was like fucking Ozzie,

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,960
Lemmy and Steven Tyler. And I
was just like, Oh fuck you man.

257
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,590
Fucking, you never going to beat
Dean del Ray with the fucking, uh,

258
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,450
I went to a concert story, fucking
guy seen everything. So anyways,

259
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,800
so I'm watching this vice channel.

260
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,670
I know I'm just plowing through this
shit fucking all over the place. Um,

261
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,900
and my wife just kept, you know,
recording this shit. They recruit,

262
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,520
she recorded something
about, um, like Dj's,

263
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,820
uh, she recorded something about
these, the fucking kids of those,

264
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,230
you know, oil barons or whatever,
oil money in Saudi Arabia.

265
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,180
So watching both of these,
right, the Dj thing, you know,

266
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,730
it's just something I'd seen before the
show and how much money that they're

267
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:51,170
making in I'm in Vegas. And, uh,

268
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:55,460
it was funny though actually actually
actually asking a couple of them what the

269
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:58,550
future was and a few of them understood
it in a few of them are just like, yeah,

270
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,880
it's never going to end. It's like, dude,

271
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,390
at some point you're going to be the
bgs in January of 1980 it happens to all

272
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,430
genres of music and the in the,

273
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:11,940
yeah,

274
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,860
so few bands figure out how to do it,

275
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:18,030
how to age gracefully
from one era to another.

276
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,490
Um, and like I was saying like, yeah,

277
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,260
I think I was talking about that and I
can't remember what fucking podcast is.

278
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,490
You have to, I don't know how to do
it, but somehow you have to, like,

279
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:33,470
your music has to age with you so you
don't look like a fucking moron. Um,

280
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,630
like Justin Bieber has got to write some
fucking middle aged shit when he's in

281
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,710
his middle age, you know, cause he
can't be singing about whatever the,

282
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,560
whatever the fuck he sings about. You
know what I mean? It looks stupid at 40,

283
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,370
you know, and it makes every people,
everybody in the crowd feels old.

284
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,860
Then you start on, my God,
we're gonna die. You know,

285
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,370
you just see your mortality
when they come out.

286
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,370
The first time that I saw that was when,
uh,

287
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,120
okay,

288
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,810
like 10 years ago when David Lee Roth
came back with van Halen and I went to go

289
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:07,900
see van Halen, I was like, oh my God,
this is going to be fucking great, right?

290
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,080
I can't believe he's back.
I saw a diamond,

291
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:14,310
Dave went on the Itam and smile
tours can be easily thrown, you know,

292
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,270
just thinking can be throwing fucking
kicks and jumping off the stage to the

293
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,700
fucking split. Right. And a dude,

294
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:25,220
he came walking out on stage and I
sweated within two other guy, God.

295
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,770
And like within five seconds
like, ah, fuck, he's all Damo old,

296
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,540
we're going to die.

297
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,130
Like this wave of fucking depression

298
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,280
just hit me, you know, until I've really
realized like, wait a minute, like,

299
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,120
you know, guitarists and
drummers don't get old. I mean
they do, but like, you know,

300
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,010
they can still fucking, you know, if
they have a technique or whatever,

301
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:53,730
they can still fucking
still fucking shred.

302
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:56,550
And I forgot that Eddie and Alex had
been playing again for like 50 fucking

303
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,860
years and they were unbelievable.

304
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,430
The singer has it the worst
because your voice naturally drops.

305
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,350
And of course everyone from my era
actually fucking sang, you know,

306
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,040
not to shit on Justin Bieber born.

307
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,410
I was watching that Dj thing on
the vice channel. They fucking, um,

308
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,030
okay.

309
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,890
He shows up at some, some pool party,
you know, where everybody's fucking,

310
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,840
you know,
turning the cameras around,

311
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:25,140
doing selfies and the peace sign
and the duck lips and all that shit.

312
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,120
And he shows up to sing his song and
he's just clearly fucking lip sinking.

313
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,290
He's not even trying to do a good
job and everybody's freaking out.

314
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,310
There was a few times,
like he took the mic away from his mouth,

315
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:43,020
pointed at the crowd. He could still
hear him singing and nobody gave a shit.

316
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,690
There was no band,
there was nothing.

317
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,210
And all these Yolo do, we're going fucking
nuts. It's like, how is that acceptable?

318
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,830
I don't know that, that shit makes
me feel old. Like back in the day,

319
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,440
if you ever got caught Milli Vanilli oh,
the whole fucking,

320
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,130
he milli Vanilli Milli add vanilla lead
his whole fucking way through that.

321
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,420
Nobody gave a shit 20, 20, 30
fucking years earlier. You know,

322
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,100
I guess it's cause those guys
tactically never even sang on the track.

323
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,600
I dunno, everybody's doing
fucking commercials now.
I mean, it's just back in.

324
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,510
It's the whole thing is just changed.
He just do whatever you want.

325
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,580
You don't have to sing. You
can fucking hear, you know,

326
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,290
you can lip sync you away with yours,

327
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,160
your hit song through a commercial
for fucking under roofs. And uh,

328
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,760
it actually equates to more
album downloads. Evidently

329
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,900
I should just be sitting
on a porch right now,

330
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,000
watching young people
walking by yelling at them.

331
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,990
That's what this podcast is just
slowly becoming. Um, so anyways,

332
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm watching that channel and uh,

333
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,830
the next thing near recorded
was a, this thing about the, uh,

334
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,480
it looked like those same guys that
I saw when I was in London. The, uh,

335
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,390
Middle Eastern do to fly on a cargo plane,

336
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:59,391
fly in all their fucking cars
with this same ridiculous rap,

337
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,170
you know, or maybe it's a paid job. I
think it's a wrap that they put on there.

338
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,890
You know what I mean? They got like the
fucking a, it's like that marriage finish.

339
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,680
Like those three people in
Shanna now with the gold suits,

340
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:14,490
they'll do that to like
Mercedes and all that. Well,

341
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,990
when they're back in the country,

342
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,100
another status symbol is to own a,
uh,

343
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,160
like endangered species or a exotic
animals is they call them in these fucking

344
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:26,904
guys.

345
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,140
They owned like a cheetahs
and Lions and tigers.

346
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,770
It was the most disturbing fucking thing.

347
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,220
And I don't even be coming at
this and like a Peter Away,

348
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:41,700
I just sat there going like,
dude, that is a fucking lion.

349
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,000
You've got it on a leash. And
these things kept, you know,

350
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,880
they have their friends and they'd sort
of lunge at him and then the friends

351
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,990
would jump out of the way and be
like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, like laughing.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,620
It's just like you saw how big these
fucking things where it's just like

353
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,030
they could like sorta like
at the 30% like bitch,

354
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:05,420
slap a refrigerator and the thing
would tip over and go flying across the

355
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,460
fucking room.
You know what I mean?

356
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:08,850
Okay.

357
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,380
And these guys are fucking with DC,
so this fucking lay goes over there.

358
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:18,330
This white lady making white people look,
look fucking stupid as shit. She's like,

359
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,580
she fucking goes over to
this guy's goddamn house.

360
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,570
He's got a giant fucking lion. All
right? And he goes, well, we'll get,

361
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,730
or a tiger Isam Shit.
And he goes, all right,

362
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:33,760
we'll get you comfortable with let
you play with some smaller ones first.

363
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,970
So she's playing with these
little ones in immediately I say,

364
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,070
I wouldn't fuck with that.
A long time ago I was on Opie and Anthony.

365
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,850
They brought in a fucking
baby tiger and little worlds,

366
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:45,010
little white ones or some shit.
And they asked me if they wanted a whole,

367
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,350
if I wanted to hold it. I was
like, no. The thing was upset.

368
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,910
It didn't want to fucking be there.

369
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,230
And I've been scratched by a house
cat fucking killed right now.

370
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,410
All it got me with one goddamn
cloth when write down my forearm,

371
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:59,650
I had to put all this shit on it so I
wouldn't get some sort of goddamn disease.

372
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,560
And I'm looking at this,

373
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:05,500
this cute little baby tiger or a lion,

374
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,110
whatever the fuck it was.
A little sick. Freedom.

375
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,830
Roy wants the Mariah Carey one where
it's all fucking white, you know?

376
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
And uh, I'm just looking at the
size of its fucking pause. I'm like,

377
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,320
that things pause already.
A like four times the size of a house cat.

378
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,570
I've got scratched by a house cat.
This thing's in a bad mood. I don't,

379
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:25,600
I don't want to fuck, I don't want
to deal with the thing. You know,

380
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,090
it's funny because actually scratched
Anthony, if I remember correctly,

381
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:32,710
and he had to get like a tetanus shot
or something,

382
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:36,580
some sort of ointment and to be put
on his fucking neck. So anyways,

383
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:40,540
so this lady goes in there, right? And
she's playing with them. She's like,

384
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,440
oh my God,
this is so durable and um,

385
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,160
was really not impressed with the
intellect of the woman that I thought they

386
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,840
could have got somebody
alive fucking smarter. Right.

387
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,980
So then she goes outside
to meet this lion.

388
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,440
Yeah.

389
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,300
Okay.
This lioness,

390
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,310
and there's no way to describe
to you how big a fucking line is.

391
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:05,700
It's not very often that you get to see
a person standing next to a God damn

392
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,990
line.
She walks up to the t in the general area,

393
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:11,920
this thing and the things
immediately looking at,

394
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,810
or the way a fucking wild animal
looks at you. You know what I mean?

395
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,330
It's the same way.
I've always said this is the same way,

396
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,300
like a fucking hooker looks at you
where there's no bullshit. You know,

397
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,210
you don't know bar. Some
woman looks at you, you know,
should we get fall, you know,

398
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:26,950
she's just trying to get a fucking drink.
They'll hook it looks at you. It's,

399
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:31,700
it's the real deal. Like, yeah,
I will fuck you. Okay. You
have to. Circumstances are,

400
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,580
are, you know, if you've got the
money, I will fuck you. Right.

401
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,220
It's the same thing with like lions.
They looking at you like,

402
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,740
if the opportunity arises I will kill you.

403
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,340
You know, dogs don't look at you like
that fucking lines looking, you know,

404
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,710
cats attempted housecats,
you know,

405
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,660
you turn around and he'd catch
them stock in you and shit,

406
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,770
but then you look at them and then
they fucking run away. All right,

407
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,870
picture a cat doing that.
A house cat.

408
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,440
But you turn around and it's a line and
it doesn't run away if fucking lunges at

409
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,320
you or maybe it gives you that
refrigerator bitch slap, right?

410
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:08,321
So this fucking thing is looking at her
and he's the owner who has no training

411
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,660
whatsoever. Brings his fucking
thing. I'll do, my palms were sweaty.

412
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,220
I, I had to get, well, when I was watching
it in bed, I literally stood up going,

413
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:22,730
what the fuck are you doing?
So the thing comes over,

414
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:26,180
immediately starts crawling on top of her,
it's on top of her.

415
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,170
And then she puts her hands on the side
of the thing and starts like, like,

416
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,810
you know,
rubbing it like it's a giant dog.

417
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,100
And all I remember was that does that
youtube video of that stunt men who worked

418
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,940
with bears and he had brought us some
sort of relative in there who wanted to

419
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:44,720
learn how to work with bears. And he told
him to keep his hands down by his side.

420
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,230
And the bear came up in like
stood up on its back legs,

421
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,910
put its paws on the dude's shoulder.

422
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,510
And he instinctively put his
hands on either side of the bear,

423
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,530
which the bear took as like an aggressive
move and one of the fight and it

424
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:01,130
fucking killed this guy. So she puts
her hands down and I see that I go,

425
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,200
oh fuck is this thing like a bear? I
don't fucking know. And all of a sudden,

426
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,100
um,

427
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,030
she got just a little bit scared and
then the thing like collapsed down on her

428
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,190
and it got weird really quick.

429
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,190
And then the guy stood up with this rope
fucking leash and like quickly tries to

430
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:24,590
pull the lion away, what she does and
this woman gets up like, ha ha, that was,

431
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,810
that was I.

432
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,470
And I feel like that was like a spiritual
experience of what it's like, bitch,

433
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:32,090
you almost got fucking killed.
And then the guy goes, yeah,

434
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:36,680
you got scared and it senses
your fear and then Oh God,

435
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,850
thank God she didn't make any high pitch
noise like the sound of an animal like

436
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:42,950
suffering. You know what I mean?
Do you have any like a dog toy?

437
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:45,020
You know when they bite on it and
it makes that high pitch noise,

438
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,410
it excites the Predator in them.
And um,

439
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,760
so I say the Nia,

440
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:57,320
I go how far into this show before they
show as somebody who got killed. I go,

441
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,170
I say about 17 minutes.
They didn't,

442
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:05,171
it was at the end of the show and they
were just like two weeks after we left.

443
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,900
Um, so this fucking woman,
basically the housekeeper comes in,

444
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,350
all right,
she didn't fucking do anything.

445
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,310
She's not like these fucking guys
who for some reason like it's,

446
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:23,010
it's just total like male ego shit trying
to outdo the other fucking rich guy

447
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,650
down the street that
they get these things,

448
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,010
they don't know anything about
the animals. They fucking,

449
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,200
at least that's the way it was presented.

450
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:32,840
They didn't know shit about the fucking
animals. And then they were like, no,

451
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,560
that thing has a better life.
Live in here. It's walking
around in a fucking cage.

452
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,730
You know, it's like, dude, what do you
want to walk around in a cage? I mean,

453
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:44,040
you could always get knifed. You could
get killed the way an animal couldn't in

454
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,873
the wild.

455
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,523
Okay?

456
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,130
It's a fucking lion who's killing a
lion other than another human being.

457
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,110
Um, so anyways, uh,

458
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,980
this fucking housekeeper came in and uh,

459
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,780
she got mauled by these fucking lines
and they bring the woman in and the guy

460
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:08,350
tried to say a dog did it.
And they were like, ah,

461
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:13,180
these injuries are a little more than
a dog. And then the owner is like,

462
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,890
well, whatever, do you
mean? It's like, well,

463
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:19,891
she's missing her left arm and the claw
marks on this f so you know what the

464
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:23,710
fucking asshole did? He had
three lions. He went home,

465
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,540
he shot all of them, and then burn
their bodies out in the desert. So we,

466
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,930
you know, so nothing would fucking happen
to them. And, uh, it was just like, yeah.

467
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,200
It's like, yeah, there you go.
They go fucking inevitable.

468
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,310
They had like cheetahs disguise riding
in a fucking six wheeled Mercedes with a

469
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:40,840
fucking Cheetah.

470
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,290
Yeah.

471
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,960
And that woman's getting in
the car going, oh, it's, it's,

472
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,130
it's acting just like a dog. It's
padding. It's looking out the window.

473
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,910
Maybe they had to get somebody, I'm
not saying she was not as smart person,

474
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:01,650
she just wasn't very aware
of the situation I feel. And
I just kept hearing like,

475
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,761
it was back in the day,

476
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:07,290
like 50 def jam comics did bits about
how white people fuck with wild animals.

477
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,680
And so in a way I'm like,
oh, this is good for once.

478
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:15,100
It's not white people being idiots with
wild animals, you know, now it's Arabs.

479
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,620
Let's, let's, uh, you know,

480
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,100
take a little heat off of Whitey and
then they bring this white lady in there

481
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,750
and she fucking does everything that,
you know,

482
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,430
every one of those bits says that we do.

483
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,380
So anyways, um, let's get to some of the,
uh, some of the reads here for the week.

484
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,330
If I can,
if my fucking

485
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:32,900
okay.

486
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,730
Computer isn't gonna tell me to
fucking, I dunno. Update something. Um,

487
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,130
oh Jesus. Here we go. Here we
go. Oh wait, I have to promote

488
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,750
this thing real quick. All right. I was
supposed to promote this regular hero,

489
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,443
um,

490
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,390
year in review.

491
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,840
You can donate now and be irregular
hero to change your life today.

492
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:56,800
These people work around the world
to help the disadvantaged. They, uh,

493
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,710
they are a not another
yet another nonprofit.

494
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,960
And I'm assuming that because
it's on my podcast that this is a,

495
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,393
uh,

496
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,890
this is actually a legit one.
You know,

497
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,220
they help out with hurricane Matthew,
skid row at risk youth.

498
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,830
Um, oh, regularly heroes
show [inaudible] oh fuck.

499
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:23,950
I've done one of these. Oh, this is,
what's this Steve Simone thing, right.

500
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:28,090
The regular heroes show has been a
great fun and awareness raiser thanks to

501
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:32,470
comedians. Bill Berg, Gabriel
Iglesias, Dane Cook, Daniel Tosh.

502
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,090
Chris had WIC.

503
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,230
Chris Delea the world at the world
famous comedy store and the Improv. Yeah.

504
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:39,670
This is actually legit one in a,

505
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,780
in a world where so many of
these nonprofits are, um,

506
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,560
I'll complete horse shit.
This is actually a legit one,

507
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,680
which is a very nice thing. Um, because
everything is a fucking nonprofit.

508
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,460
Like you remember that,
that that lady from a couple months back,

509
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,290
she,
uh,

510
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,150
she lost her job at that
nonprofit yet another nonprofit.

511
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,920
Uh, when she said that horrible
shit about Michelle Obama, you know,

512
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:13,650
and of course wrote it like a
dope. She said something like, uh,

513
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,930
it will be so refreshing to have a classy,
beautiful,

514
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:20,740
dignified first lady in the White House.
You mean that trophy wife?

515
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:28,000
Well, cause she wears a red blouse. All
of a sudden she's fucking, uh, you know,

516
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,220
a better person. She wrote, I'm
tired of seeing a ape in heels,

517
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,140
not Ann a n a ape in heels.
And ape is capitalized.

518
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,760
Like it's a, I don't know somebody's
name or some shit like that.

519
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:47,170
And so of course she gets fucking,
she gets bounced out of this nonprofit.

520
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:50,800
She gets fired because everybody knows
that makes you less racist. You're racist,

521
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,300
and then you lose your job.
And then you go, oh, wait a
minute, what was I thinking?

522
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,250
Everybody is equal. Um,
so anyways, then the, uh,

523
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,890
the fucking mayor from this town,

524
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,490
Clay County is something Virginia,
Virginia,

525
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:10,990
West Virginia I guess
backed up her Goddamn, uh,

526
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,350
why you would do that. You know,
even if you were raised as,

527
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,410
you'd think you'd be smart enough
to keep your fucking mouth shut,

528
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,230
this person co-signed or
what the other person said.

529
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,650
And then the mayor had to fucking
resigned. So anyways, they actually,

530
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,890
so they fired the first lady who said
it from the Clay County Development

531
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,240
Corporation, nonprofit. There a
corporation that develops shit and,

532
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,450
but it's not for profit.
Well, let me ask you this.

533
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,250
How is this woman not homeless?

534
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:42,940
I don't get how you work for a
nonprofit and you're not homeless.

535
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,420
If there is no profit, how do they pay
you? This is what all corporations do.

536
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm in business.

537
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:55,390
I'm in business with a certain corporation
that claims in 90 to $180 million

538
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:59,740
loss a year. And the people I work
with are buying mansions out here,

539
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,030
redoing them.

540
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,580
I don't know how that works.

541
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,300
That's actually a different thing because
they're not considered a nonprofit.

542
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,480
They're considered a business entity.
And if he,

543
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,740
if you don't show that
you've earned any money,

544
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:19,270
then you don't have to pay any taxes.
Um, so the corporation doesn't,

545
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,000
but then everybody draws a salary.
Now you have to pay taxes on,

546
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,870
um, on the salary that you drew.
But however, if you just say,

547
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,340
and you're not making a profit,
you don't have to pay any taxes.

548
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:35,800
And I would think that all that extra
money that you didn't pay taxes on,

549
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:39,090
you then use disperse amongst
your employees. Right?

550
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,030
So rather than making a million a year,

551
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:43,670
you make 2 million a year and
then you pay taxes on that. Right.

552
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,270
I Dunno how it works.
I don't know. You know,

553
00:32:46,271 --> 00:32:48,730
I'm too stupid to figure out
how that shit works. But, um,

554
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,711
for the life of me,

555
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:54,500
I looked up this nonprofit
trying to figure out what
the fuck they do. I cannot,

556
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,320
I can't figure it out. So anyways,
they fired this fucking lady and um,

557
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:00,770
okay.

558
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,150
Then like a month later, they just
reinstated her. They just reinstated or,

559
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,750
and uh, I don't know. To me
that is the Trump influence.

560
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,850
I think that that's what
everybody learned from Trump.

561
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,440
It's just like you just say, Hey, you
know, that's locker room talk or a,

562
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,300
you know, [inaudible] he's fired.
And because back back. Yeah.

563
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,720
You know, I left, I left for six
weeks in our back. Uh, you know,

564
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,070
and what I love with media is there
is no follow up after the first story.

565
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:31,090
The first story has done this, this,

566
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,220
there's the whole fucking everybody
flipping out. Let's go burn the witch.

567
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,990
And then once it dies down, then you
just bring the person back and nobody,

568
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,380
they've moved on to something else.
Um, I don't know. It's really bizarre.

569
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:45,710
I just don't know how somebody could
fucking be in business with somebody like

570
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:50,340
that. It's fucking nuts. Anyways,
all right, me on these, uh, oh Jesus.

571
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,460
Bateau both bought me undies. Me On
these rubbing up on your card. We do do,

572
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:59,660
do me undies. Me On ds. It's
like a sheepskin fucking suck.

573
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,940
It's so fucking soft up
against your taped. You know,

574
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:08,960
you fucking love it. Um, your Dick,

575
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:13,370
you will pay two with a pair of fucking
me undies. Why would you paint your deck?

576
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:17,120
I don't know. How many fucking
times can I sing this picture?

577
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,320
A world in a world we're putting on a
new pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

578
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,490
You're stepping into a better day,
you know, I bet. Where's me undies?

579
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,670
Who lives in me undies? Lifestyle
is Mariah Carey. I know.

580
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,980
It's the second time I brought her up,
but that fucking channel,

581
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,390
Nia keeps watching on one of these reality
shows that's following Mariah Carey

582
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:38,660
around. Dude, she's fucking
hilarious. Every fucking shot.

583
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:43,340
She's like laying in a bed in an evening
gown with heels on full makeup and

584
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,930
everything with a glass of wine.

585
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,210
It's like in the 1950s what people thought
rich people did all day just laying

586
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:58,100
around with like, you know, some fucking
$300,000 diamond necklace. It's like,

587
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:02,750
we get it. You're a diva. Jesus Christ.
You never wear sweatpants, you know?

588
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,430
Does he have a fucking white
Zinfandel over there? Um,

589
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,960
anyways, it says, think about it.

590
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,100
Underwear is the first thing you put on
in the last thing you take off unless

591
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:16,490
you weird. You know what if you
don't like your torso, what have you,

592
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:20,140
one of those guys that fucks with his
shirt on, you know, you sweaty tee shirt.

593
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,440
Right. You know what I mean?
It's still like a tee shirt off.

594
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,310
Yeah.

595
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,821
You know,
ladies,

596
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:30,090
if you're fucking a guy wears man titch
that's when you know he's really letting

597
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:33,870
you win is when he takes the t shirt off
to of Jesus. But why would you say that?

598
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,150
All right. Think about it.
Underwear. It's very blah, blah blah.

599
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,290
Why would you settle anything less than
the best feeling underwear on the planet?

600
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,720
Me undies focuses solely on producing the
most comfortable underwear you've ever

Um,

602
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,930
my friends at me and he sent me a few
pairs a while back and now I can't imagine

603
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,510
wearing anything else.
Why do you keep putting out in the copy?

604
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,580
You sent me two pairs.
I warm one.

605
00:35:56,581 --> 00:36:01,020
I liked the other with a Greg Louganis
cut and I don't, I wasn't in that shape.

606
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,810
You know, you send me the Olympic
diver fucking Skippy's there. You know

607
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,630
Jesus Christ. I went from muffin top to
like, I dunno what the fuck croissant.

608
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,990
What's the next one up the pastry ladder.
Um,

609
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,470
it really makes each day that much
better for the price of two cocktails.

696
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,050
Seatgeek everyone buying tickets online
for sports and concert has been a

697
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:34,040
confusing process for a
long time. Yes, it has.

698

It's always been hard to find the best
deal for that game or show you want to go

699
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,780
to and none of those older
tickets sites want to change that,

700
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,220
but [inaudible] is different.

701
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,720

so according to the emails,

716
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,310
somebody wanted me to look at this
fucking thing and it's simply says crazy

717
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,660
Asian sport. Saw this on reddit. Neat. Uh,

718
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,980
and needed you to see a merry Christmas.
Twinkle lies.

719
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,000
All right,
let's see what this is.

720
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,740
Oh my God. All right. Let me hit pause
here. This is basically, this is,

721
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,520
I want to go to this.

722
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,150
Yeah.

723
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,640
All right.
There's this whole group of fucking dudes.

724
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,570
They're all dressed in white.
Oh my God.

725
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,350
They're all huddled around a pole and
there's a guy sitting on top of the

726
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:23,351
fucking pole and then another group of
dudes come in wearing orange shirts and

727
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,580
the fucking,

728
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,470
they all have on like Olympic
boxing headgear and that when,

729
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,890
when the fucking orange dudes come in,
they tried to knock the guy off the Paul.

730
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,770
This is like fucking
ads fighting each other.

731
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,070
Yeah,

732
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,110
dude,
you fucking asshole.

733
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,760
How can you show me this and
not tell me what sport this is?

734
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,100
They tried to knock the guy off the
fucking pole. What is this called?

735
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,970
And what happens is,
is basically everybody gets piled on.

736
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,480
Once the orange crew comes in,
oh, there's a weak guy. He turned,

737
00:43:56,481 --> 00:44:00,680
he ran the other fucking way. They
start jumping up on top of each other.

738
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,720
Oh my God.
That would be so fucking claustrophobic.

739
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:04,550
It's basically like a rugby scrum.

740
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,820
If you could throw fucking punches and
you climb and just imagine a rugby scrum

741
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,890
and rather than the ball,

742
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,820
one of the rugby dudes was sitting up on
a pole and they tried to fucking knock

743
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,773
them off.

744
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,323
Wow,
dude.

745
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,080
They're just kicking each other in
the face. I swear to God, you know,

746
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,890
how the fuck did I get so lucky to
be born in this goddamn country?

747
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:31,950
Where do they at least pretend to
give a shit about your wellbeing?

748
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,460
And you like that is a fucking
hardcore sport. You know what?

749
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,960
Hat's off the fucking Asia right there.
I would love to see them and try to get,

750
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,300
this is barbaric.
Tried to do it in our country.

751
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,720
Like is everybody's listening
from America? My country,

752
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:47,640
I should say this is barbaric.
This is,

753
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,730
this is promoting violence against
people at different kinds of shirts on.

754
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,860
Let me, I don't even understand what is,
what is, what is the purpose of this? Um,

755
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,800
can you please tell me
the name of that sport?

756
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,430
Am I ever gonna get
over this fucking cough?

757
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,810
Haven't smoked a cigar and forever I'm
getting eight hours sleep. Not really.

758
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,190
You know, Nias tossing and turning on
every fucking minute. Now I literally,

759
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,024
you know, I, I,

760
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,020
I sleep in bed for like half the night
and then after awhile I just ended up

761
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:19,950
going upstairs and it fall asleep.
You know, I want to do the same thing.

762
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:23,700
Like when the baby comes, I'm just going
to be one of the baby cries too much.

763
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,770
I'm just going to be like,
you know what,

764
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,850
I can't deal with either one of you and
I'm going to go upstairs and I'm going

765
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:32,940
to put it on an evening
gown like Mariah Carey and

766
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,350
in lay here with my fucking diamonds on.

767
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,730
I Dunno, maybe it's just for
the show, but I just look at it,

768
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,960
it's like this person is out of their,

769
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,120
at some point it's just completely
lost touch of reality. Um,

770
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,330
there's something about that when you
get like backup dancers and they're all

771
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,300
hanging on your every word and they,
and they literally want to be you.

772
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,340
Like there's no way to keep,

773
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,840
keep yourself tethered to any sort
of fucking reality. Um, alright.

774
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,090
Advice, age, different
story. First of all,

775
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:07,350
did I talk about everything I wanted to
fucking talk about this week? Um, oh,

776
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:11,610
let's talk about how you guys don't want
your up. If you'd like to the podcast,

777
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,080
you can still start right now,
man.

778
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:16,380
I've been trying to do a half hour cardio
every single day cause this, you know,

779
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:20,310
between Thanksgiving and, um, new year's,

780
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,000
she eat all of this fucking shit.
You put on weight and then you've got it.

781
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,930
You just start the year behind the
eight ball by the eight ball. Right.

782
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,940
I was like,
I'm not fucking doing that.

783
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,870
So as of December 1st I've
been trying to do a cardio,

784
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,890
a half hour of cardio every
single fucking day. And um,

785
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,340
of course I fucked up. Right? I, um,

786
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,551
what did I do?
I,

787
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:48,551
I made it through the first 11 days and
then December 12th I had a busy morning

788
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,530
and you really got to knock it out in
the morning, which I didn't. And uh,

789
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:53,850
the day got longer and longer.

790
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:58,380
And then I came home and he was watching
some fucking TV and she was just like,

791
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:02,070
I need comfort. And I was just like, all
right, acting like I was a good husband,

792
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:04,120
rather than like, I don't want to
get on that fucking elliptical again.

793
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:09,030
So I missed a half hour. On the
12th, 13th, I did my half hour.

794
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:13,050
So I had 12 out of 13 days.
14th I missed.

795
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,170
Then I was like, fuck, this is becoming a
trend now. I owe that machine down there.

796
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,940
60 minutes plus the 30 foot today.
That was Friday, December 15th.

797
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,100
So I got on that elliptical,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

798
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,250
The Dodo, no baby baby red cakes. Um,

799
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,490
I got on the thing that I did,
um, an hour and 11 minutes,

800
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,560
71 minutes out of the 90 minutes.

801
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,130
I just looked at it like it
was a basketball game or a
sporting event and I was

802
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:46,150
down by 90 points.
And so the next day I started my day,

803
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,300
I was down 19 points plus the 30 I had
to do and I ended up doing an hour on the

804
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:54,484
elliptical.

805
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,810
So now I was up 11 minutes
and then I liked it.

806
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:02,200
I liked the results of doing a
fucking hour. So then, uh, on,

807
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,090
say I did a an hour and four minutes.

808
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,830
So then now I'm up. I was down
90 minutes now I was up, uh,

809
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,770
an hour and 15,
also known as 75 minutes.

810
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:18,580
And then yesterday I did
an hour and 15 minutes. Uh,

811
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:22,780
so I don't even know what I'm up at
this point. 45 minutes plus an extra 45.

812
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,050
I'm actually up 90 minutes, something like
that. I don't know what the fuck it is.

813
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:28,090
I can't really remember,
but all I wanted to do,

814
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,880
I was going to do a half hour every
day and that was going to be a seal.

815
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:37,060
31 days there'll be 15 and a
half hours of cardio, but, uh,

816
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,450
now I think I'm just going to do hours
every day for the rest of the fucking

817
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,660
year. I weighed myself the
other day. I was one 77.

818
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,200
Now when I came back from fucking Europe,
I was a buck 90,

819
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,110
so I've taken 13 pounds off since,
um,

820
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:51,780
okay.

821
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:56,600
Since that trip. So I dunno, it's
all about the fucking cardio. Um,

822
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,160
I would love to do that. You know,
if I, if you don't, the reality is,

823
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,720
is if you've got an elliptical every
day and did fucking 60 minutes,

824
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,110
if he just did that, you know,
and, and when you do that,

825
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,080
when you put together a playlist,
that's when you gotta love. I tell you,

826
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,110
you got to love like bands like
iron maiden or they have six,

827
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:17,130
seven minutes songs, you know, at least
the songs, or at least four minutes,

828
00:49:17,131 --> 00:49:19,440
which is a huge fucking chunk,
you know?

829
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:21,930
And I just put my sweatshirt
over the clock and I'm just like,

830
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,650
I just peek at the clock after
every song's done. All right,

831
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,980
so if you just do want
to half hour of cardio,

832
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:33,540
you gotta listen to rhyme of the ancient
mariner. It's a 13 minute song, you know?

833
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,140
Yeah.

834
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,790
Hey there, right buddy? Hey chip.
Marriner the whole fucking thing there.

835
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,753
You got to change

836
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,920
by, by the De de de, De, De, De, De, De,
De, De, De, De, de, De, de. [inaudible].

837
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,880
He listened to the whole fucking
thing. The courtesy, the party,

838
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,663
right?

839
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:51,810
Yeah.

840
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,130
You're going to go from fucking
27 minutes down to 14 minutes.

841
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,750
He like this a fucking joke.
I always try to put it on.

842
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,580
You don't have it come on time.
It was like 21 minutes, you know,

843
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,770
and then I just covered up
because the next time I look,

844
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:07,470
I'm going to be in single digits. I'll
be down to like eight or nine minutes.

845
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:11,610
It's fucking tremendous.
But, um, anyways, I, uh,

846
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,031
a buddy of mine,

847
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:17,840
my drum teacher was showing me
this fucking song this week and uh,

848
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:18,980
I dunno how I slept in this one.

849
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,990
I've always been a big Soundgarden fan
to somehow I never heard that song rhino

850
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,870
sore and a, as always, Matt came
on with the sickest fucking drums.

851
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,060
Uh, I become obsessed with that
song in that fucking album.

852
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,670
And uh, and I saw it, I thought
it said 2016 I was like,
oh, they got back together.

853
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,000
This is their latest shit.
And then I looked again and said in 1996

854
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,010
every fucking thing that I listened to,
I don't know what happened,

855
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,940
but I think part of it,

856
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,390
cause I got old and then I was also like
trying to fucking get somewhere as a

857
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:51,110
comedian.

858
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,110
I just completely missed out on like 20
years of music and like half the shit

859
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:59,780
people show me. I'm like, oh,
that sounds fucking, you know,

860
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:03,440
it always sounds like it's brand new to
me when that come out. And they're like,

861
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:07,070
yeah, like 2002. I'm like, ah, I just,

862
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,720
I just can't get contemporary.

863
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:12,320
I got 20 years of Shit I got
to fucking sift through. Um,

864
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,700
so if there's any other drugs out there,
you know,

865
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:20,840
part of my lessons is
they'll play shit at the end,

866
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,120
like ear training, Shit. Like you gotta
try to figure out the groove you got. Oh,

867
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,170
you got to figure out what
time signature was in.

868
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,050
And this was to figure out
what time signature was in.

869
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:34,790
And of course I was fucking it
up and a few drummers out there,

870
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,060
it's in six.
But if you count the eighth notes,

871
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:41,660
you just count up to 12 in the
phrasing is seven and five.

872
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,190
Um, and I would play it for you on
here, but I always just feel like,

873
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:50,600
because I do advertising,
if I play any music, um,

874
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:54,410
that all of a sudden somebody's
going to come after me and be like,

875
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,630
you owe us money cause you
made money off of me on these,

876
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,080
why you played our fucking
song or whatever. Um, anyways,

877
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,990
but do you guys think of
the Patriots yesterday?

878
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,220
Everybody's flipping out about our
defense. Like I don't know what the big,

879
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,880
you know, we beat the Ravens and
the Ravens, they, you know, there's,

880
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,420
they got that subs guy,

881
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:17,390
but back in the day add Suggs they
had ray Lewis and they had ed reed.

882
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,810
So they're big three is basically
down to one dude and you know,

883
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,610
they're not who the fuck they were.

884
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:30,380
And then we beat the Broncos in mile
high where we never fucking went,

885
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:34,820
but they basically navigating got
a rookie quarterback. I Dunno,

886
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,180
I get so frustrated with the Patriots
because it seems like they only protect

887
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:41,900
their offensive players. They've been,
I know I've been bitching about this,

888
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:45,680
but they just, you know, that fucking
cornerback, whatever the fuck his name is,

889
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,990
Taylor Lib, whatever the fuck his
name is. He, when he was with us,

890
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,730
that whole side of his whole squadron
section of the field was just shut down.

891
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:59,300
What didn't we like about that?
Why didn't we just keep that guy?

892
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,970
You know, we always, we got fucking wide
receivers. We got fucking a quarterback.

893
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,880
That's where we keep all our fuck
them. You know what, this is my theory.

894
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,840
Bill Belicheck is such a defensive genius.
I think he just thinks like,

895
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:16,450
you know what? I don't fucking
need, uh, you know, I don't,

896
00:53:16,451 --> 00:53:20,680
I don't look at it as my fucking computer
just decided, you know, I said, act,

897
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,270
do you know, contact me in
an hour. Now it's like, all
right, an hour's gone by now.

898
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:28,050
It's just sinking with my fucking
phone. Like, who's doing this?

899
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,580
So weird. Just like all these fucking
satellites just fucking pointed at yet.

900
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:36,460
I don't know. Anyways. Um,

901
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,020
I think he just is convinced that he
can take any second round draft pick,

902
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,290
train this person into being a n NFL
quality player at that position slash

903
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,820
borderline all pro view.
And if you become an all pro,

904
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,790
Danny just fucking gets ready
at the second you want money.

905
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:57,683
Okay.

906
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:02,290
Just fucking been doing it forever.
But back in the day, you know,

907
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,430
we'd keep McGuinness, we kept Grable. So
our defense, I felt like had an identity.

908
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:10,120
Now it's like every three years it's like
a whole new fucking defense drives me

909
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,320
up the fucking wall.

910
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,090
Okay.

911
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,030
I Dunno, we'll see. Cause I
watched the giants, you know,

912
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:20,710
and you know like all patriots fans, every
year when the giants go on their run,

913
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,640
you get this sickening feeling
in your stomach going like,

914
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,620
oh fuck yet you want to play him again?
Cause we got to beat him one time,

915
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,110
you know? And I was sitting
there going like, all right,

916
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:32,470
well they lost Tom [inaudible]. This
is going to be huge. And Lo and behold,

917
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:36,610
they're doing it again. They're on
another fucking run. All right. Yeah,

918
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,770
the defense looks fucking amazing.
You know,

919
00:54:38,771 --> 00:54:41,740
I'm not saying a defense
doesn't look good, but it
does not look as good as this.

920
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,910
And um, I dunno, that's the giants thing.

921
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,300
Like the only thing about the giants as
they don't score any fucking points for

922
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:53,560
whatever fucking reason they got eli who's
a goddamn beast. They got the fucking,

923
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,970
uh, they got the diva there.
What's his name? Uh, uh, how do I,

924
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,000
I don't,
my short term memory's for shit.

925
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,480
I just thought why it,

926
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,450
I can't fucking remember his last name
is the same name as the fucking soccer

927
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,820
player with all the tattoos
is married to the spice girl

928
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,730
backup bend it like Beckham, Odell
Beckham. There you go. See that?

929
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,850
I'm learning how my fucking old brainworks
now I've got to go on one of those

930
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:25,440
brain exercise websites that try to help
you with your short term memory. Um,

931
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,230
I dunno, I'm fascinated how they can
have him at wide receiver. You know,

932
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:33,660
I don't know if they play in that
Cruz guy a bunch of fucking money,

933
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:35,580
but they got eli,
they're able to keep him.

934
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:36,780
But then on the other side of the ball,

935
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:40,630
they got JPP and if he didn't
fucking mess up his hand like they,

936
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,080
they seem to be,
they're more balanced.

937
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:44,683
Okay.

938
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,000
You know? So what if Chandler Jones
wanted money? Fucking earned it.

939
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,150
Sometimes I just feel like we're getting,
I don't know.

940
00:55:53,151 --> 00:55:54,080
What the fuck do you build?

941
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,930
How many Superbowls do they have to
win before you realize bill Belichick's

942
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:58,580
knows what he's doing. I know, I know.

943
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,870
I'm just looking at the NFC west and
they just seems like they're stronger.

944
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,650
I'll tell you right now, the Dallas
cowboys, you buy it, sell it. I'm selling.

945
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:09,380
I don't believe in him.
I don't believe in the Dallas cowboys.

946
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:11,090
I don't believe in that coach.
I Dunno about, you know,

947
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,640
this is just totally based on, I
look at that guy and I go, I don't,

948
00:56:13,641 --> 00:56:17,840
I don't believe in that guy.
I just don't.

949
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,890
Uh, Pete Carroll is a fucking beast.
Eli is an animal and their coach,

950
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:24,070
who

951
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,910
I swear to God,

952
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:29,320
looks like he wants
some radio contest is a,

953
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,330
is a, is a wolf in sheep's
clothing, is a wolf and upper deck.

954
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,590
Fucking eating a pretzel and get
mustard all over his face clothing. Um,

955
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,100
I think one of those teams, and this
is really isn't going out on a limb,

956
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,330
I think one of those two
teams goes to the, uh,

957
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,830
to the Superbowl and having watched
both teams, I think I would rather play,

958
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,400
um, I rather play Seattle. And that's only
because Seattle, you know, once you went,

959
00:56:56,401 --> 00:57:00,040
a couple of you went to win a Superbowl,
you go to back to back. You know,

960
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,680
they lost too many guys.
Um,

961
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,270
not to say that they could beat the
patriots every fucking beat us this year.

962
00:57:06,271 --> 00:57:10,050
But uh, we'll see. We'll see. I
never fucking believe in my team,

963
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,280
you know what I mean? I don't know why.
I always just see the fucking, you know,

964
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:19,020
why are we doing this?
Why are we doing that? Um,

965
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:21,570
so anyways, we shall see. But uh,

966
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,210
be nice to play the giants
again and finally fucking win.

967
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,290
We'd actually would have to win that
game or else Tom Brady would forever just

968
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:31,950
get ripped on sports, talk radio,
buy all his mouth breathing dopes.

969
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:32,450
They will be like,

970
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,870
don't,
don't do it man.

971
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,780
Like it was this one on
one game like Tom Brady.

972
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:49,940
Every Superbowl has not let his team
down the field for the winning score.

973
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,980
He's had to do that. Every super
bowl that he's been in, you know,

974
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,500
and four out of six times the defense
went out and did their job and two times

975
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,870
they did not.
Um,

976
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:07,400
and I'm not taking it away from fucking
Eli because two times Eli beat our

977
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:12,140
defense, but he beat our defense.
He did not be Tom Brady. However,

978
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,070
when you're the quarterback, you
take all the blame, you know,

979
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,360
all you gotta do is look at Dan Marino
and the ridiculous level of Shit that

980
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:24,890
that guy takes, despite the fact,
all the records that that guy,

981
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:29,390
I've never run a study. It's just
did he have to tackle people too?

982
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:33,200
Was he supposed to run the ball up the
gut to fucking eat up some of the clock?

983
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,443
MMM.

984
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,830
I Dunno. It's just so fucking, uh, the
shit that Dan Marino gets is the dumbest.

985
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:46,420
It's the dumbest ever. This is how much
the game has changed. By the way. Uh,

986
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,780
I looked this up the other day just
because all they do is fucking throw the

987
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:54,340
ball and I looked up all time,
you know,

988
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,080
running backs, just rushing all time for
your career and I'll tell you right now,

989
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,880
what's his face?
Emmitt Smith.

990
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,940
No one's going to break that
fucking record the way, the way,

991
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,040
they just don't run the
fucking ball anymore.

992
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,360
No one's going to get anywhere near that
thing. Uh, let me look this shit up.

993
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,220
Like I looked it up yesterday

994
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,410
and um,

995
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,660
not now. I don't know. Install
these fucking things. Fuck off

996
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,010
Christ.
It's like a

997
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,900
fucking kid tugging at you,
Mommy. Mommy, Mommy. Um,

998
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:30,050
where we go all time NFL rushers.

999
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,070
Um, all right. Where the fuck
is it? Pro Football reference.

1000
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:40,240
This is the best thing ever.
So I look this shit up. Okay.

1001
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,660
And in the top 20, top 20, all like,

1002
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,700
as of right now, there's only
three active players in the top 20.

1003
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:54,270
The first seven are all retired.

1004
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:59,850
Okay. The, the, the, the highest ranking
one is Frank Gore who has 12,000,

1005
00:59:59,851 --> 01:00:04,770
931 yards. All right. Then you
got to go all the way down to 16.

1006
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:09,600
You got Adrian Peterson who granted took
a year off because he beat his kids up

1007
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,930
with something fun in the
woods. Uh, Adrian Peterson,

1008
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:17,430
and then he got Steven Jackson at 18.
All right, you go to the all time.

1009
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,930
Uh, where the fuck is it
passing? What the hell is it?

1010
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,870
Passing yards? How hard is it to
find that passing yards? All right,

1011
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:31,890
so there's only, there's
only, there's only a

1012
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,910
three active players. Top 20 rushing,
right? Starts at eight and ends at 18.

1013
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,270
All right.
Passing all time.

1014
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,650
There's in the top 14,
there's six active players,

1015
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,610
six active players in the top 14 all time.

1016
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:54,790
There's only eight of the qbs in the
history of the NFL that is thrown as many

1017
01:00:54,861 --> 01:00:59,861
or more yards than six current fucking
players and the top two all time.

1018
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,610
Or Peyton manning and Brett Farve,
Peyton manning just retired last year.

1019
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,960
Brett Farve retired six years ago.

1020
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,510
It's fucking unbelievable.
Like how much this game has changed.

1021
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,510
And there's only two really
old school names, uh,

1022
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:17,960
in the top 20 is Johnny Unitas.

1023
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:23,610
Where's the other one in
Fran Tarkington and uh, once,

1024
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,980
what's his face like a

1025
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:32,760
John Elway Warren Moon. That class? Uh,

1026
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,600
Dan Fouts, Joe Montana, they
came in, they did their damage

1027
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:42,890
to Kerry Collins is in the fucking,
he's 16th all time. So here you go.

1028
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:46,110
So you got Peyton Manning's one.
Brett Farve is to drew.

1029
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,110
Brees is three was 65,462 yards.
He's,

1030
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,600
he's less than 7,000 yards.
Let's, uh, about six,

1031
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,320
6,500 yards away from owning the record.

1032
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,310
Dan Marino's fourth, then
it's Tom Brady, John Elway,

1033
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:06,410
Warren Moon than Eli Manning is eight.
Then Fran target attendant.

1034
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,860
Ben Roethlisberger, Vinny
Testaverde, Philip Rivers,

1035
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,390
drew Bledsoe, Carson Palmer, Dan
Fouts. I've seen like everybody,

1036
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,340
all of these people play in my lifetime.
I catch the end of for integrity.

1037
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,040
Dan Fouts, Kerry Collins, Joe Montana,

1038
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,020
Johnny United site didn't see Dave
Craig boomers size and Donovan McNabb.

1039
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:33,360
All right, done. Move.
Natalie's is 21st all time. Um,

1040
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,560
that's how much the fucking game has
changed. It's, it's unbelievable.

1041
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,340
And what it is, is that these guys are
like throwing for four yards, five,

1042
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:47,790
six yards. That's shit used to give to
the running back. So I think Emmitt Smith,

1043
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,170
Walter Payton, those guys, no
one's going to touch them. I don't,

1044
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,750
I don't know how you'd get enough
fucking attempts to even do it. Um,

1045
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,890
was there a point to that bill? I'm,
yeah, just say they throw the ball a lot.

1046
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:02,770
I guess that's what I'm saying,
Jim or say completely changed.

1047
01:03:02,771 --> 01:03:05,670
And then another thing too is just
the way that they protect the fucking

1048
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,980
quarterback. You know, when
they call it the Tom Brady rule,

1049
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,160
because at time he turned around and
looked at the referee, said, Hey,

1050
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,980
somebody touched my jersey.
And the referee was like, Oh,

1051
01:03:13,981 --> 01:03:18,150
I'm sorry he fucking
threw the flag. Um, yeah,

1052
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,070
everybody calls it to Tom Brady rule,
which I love.

1053
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:23,160
I love that they call it the Tom
Brady rule. Cause it is, you know,

1054
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,270
you gotta protect your
quarterbacks. That's your money.
Everybody realizes that a,

1055
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:31,430
you know, when, when the best, you know,
everybody knows the fucking quarterback.

1056
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,410
That guy gets knocked out.
No one's going to watch the games.

1057
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:36,420
So they protect the hell out of him and
they're like, yeah, fuck everybody else.

1058
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,870
And uh, people who not into
sports, they're into offense.

1059
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,660
They want to see some action.
So they just stay, you know,

1060
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,160
now it's like a legal to cover fucker,
cover a fucking receiver, you know,

1061
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,160
to Dan Marino. I'm the shit you could
do during that guy's fucking career.

1062
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:53,790
And he's still through for like
60,000 fucking yards. I don't know.

1063
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,000
I always talk about steroids.
Right.

1064
01:03:57,001 --> 01:04:00,780
And then they put an asterisk next
to your name. You know, they don't,

1065
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:03,060
you don't have the same way they
don't give Barry bonds is just do,

1066
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:05,280
it's just like a, you're going to
sit there and tell me, you know,

1067
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,950
all of these fucking guys were
as good as Dan Marino with the,

1068
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,020
so putting up fuck out of
here. All right. Um, advice,

1069
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,020
age difference and history. Ah, dear bill,

1070
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:21,280
I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a
bill. Um, I'm a big fan of yours.

1071
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,310
I really enjoy your podcast. You'll
thank you very much. I appreciate it.

1072
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:28,900
I am 28 years old and in a relationship
with my girlfriend who's seven years

1073
01:04:28,901 --> 01:04:32,470
younger than me and who I plan on
marrying were really great together.

1074
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:37,180
I love her. Well congratulations.
The thing is, is as our
relationship has gone on,

1075
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,290
we've slashed, I've been getting some
static from people about our relationship.

1076
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,000
Well who gives a fuck what they think?

1077
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,770
Like I said,
she's seven years younger than me,

1078
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:48,960
but we've known each other for awhile.
We've met,

1079
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,700
when I was working at my first job as a
counselor at a camp when she was one of

1080
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:58,500
the kids. Oh Jesus. When we first
met, I was 17 and she was 10

1081
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,690
yeah, Yep, Yep. Man. That,

1082
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,260
that's that creepy thing.

1083
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,650
That's that creepy thing.
Cause some point you were like,

1084
01:05:08,651 --> 01:05:12,130
oh look at that little kid. That's the
woody Allen moment where you go, oh,

1085
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:16,600
isn't she adorable? And then at some
point the switch flips to being like, Hey,

1086
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,860
think I want to fuck that.
You know, there's, there's
no way to get around that,

1087
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:23,230
sir. You'd have to understand
that. So anyways, he says,

1088
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:25,900
nothing happened between us at
that point. Will, I would hope so.

1089
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,220
It wasn't until we reconnected years
later when we were older that we started

1090
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,980
talking again and really getting
to know each other. All right,

1091
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,240
well I guess that's fair, but people are
going to say some shit. Right. Anyway,

1092
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,020
I'm getting shit from some family
and friends because of our history.

1093
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,290
Just from an outside source.
I'd like to know what you think.

1094
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,090
Do you think it's strange or weird?

1095
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,650
I know there's people out there 15 to 20
years apart. It's just with our history,

1096
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:52,090
it throws people off again.

1097
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,000
What do you think from an
unbiased perspective perspective?

1098
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,830
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Yeah.

1099
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,780
The thing is is that you were 17 and
she was 10 when you first met her. Um,

1100
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,190
that's what makes it weird.

1101
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,860
MMM,
okay.

1102
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:10,380
Like my wife is 10 years younger than me,
but I didn't meet her until I was like,

1103
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:12,960
you know,
35 and she was 25.

1104
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,350
MMM.

1105
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,670
Hey Nia, come in. Here is a question.

1106
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,240
Somebody, uh, somebody, uh, 28,

1107
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,720
what do you say they are? Wendy,
what do you still out of breath for?

1108
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,970
Come here. Give me a place
to sit here, you know, Jesus.

1109
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,810
So this guy, he's dating
this woman, right? He wants
to marry, he's 28. She's 21.

1110
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:37,940
He said, the thing is that I
met her when I was a counselor.

1111
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,940
I was 17 she was only 10. He
goes obviously nothing. Yeah.

1112
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:41,863
What happened then?

1113
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,830
He goes,
obviously nothing happened then,

1114
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:48,290
but now that we're together
people are given a shit. And

1115
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,520
uh, I was saying how there was a 10 year
difference between us, but I, you know,

1116
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:56,470
I was 35. You were 25. Right. So Phil,
come on. So they're looking at you like,

1117
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:01,730
uh, you've been grooming her since
she was like seven years old.

1118
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,250
Yeah.
But he like met her,

1119
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,120
but then it didn't seem like
you didn't see her for awhile.

1120
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:08,680
Then they reconnected and
had all the choirs, which
happens, don't worry about it.

1121
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,180
Have, you know, everything's on the up
and up. Just just do your thing. Yeah.

1122
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,890
Is there family cool with it, you know,
is her family given him the side eye?

1123
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:21,490
Like he was grooming her or
seems to just be friends.

1124
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,660
What do you mean? His friends?
People that he knows it just like,

1125
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,640
this is what I would do.
I would just,

1126
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:31,150
whatever those Pete runs are giving
him shit about it. I wouldn't,

1127
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,540
if you meet new people, I wouldn't tell
them that that's how you first met him.

1128
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,880
Probably not.
I'm not.

1129
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:40,900
Everybody needs to know your entire
history and that way just because people

1130
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:45,370
will misinterpret it. But yeah. Have you
guys are fine. Your families are fine.

1131
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,900
Like don't worry about it.
Yeah.

1132
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,650
As long as nothing happened when
you were a counselor. Exactly.

1133
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,940
As long as you're sure nothing happened
when you were at council there,

1134
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:59,770
which I'm sure they didn't. He always
wants to push her on the swing. Oh God.

1135
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:00,963
I know.
It's bad.

1136
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,250
All right, well let's see.
I did it to you, sir. You're
gonna, you're gonna have to,

1137
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,320
you know, there's a certain level of shit
you're going to have to deal with. Um,

1138
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,603
where you going?

1139
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,080
I'm going, I'm going out to have a
little, a little breakfast with a friend.

1140
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,250
Well, I didn't like the vagueness of
that. Having a little with a friend.

1141
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,750
Yes. I'm going to have smoothies
with Chelsea Peretti. Oh,

1142
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:24,260
he didn't have to say that.
Smoothies. Chelsea Peretti.

1143
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,430
Yeah. Sacramento zone. Chelsea
Peretti from Sacramento or, yeah,

1144
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,650
she, she's from Sacramento. Oakland. No.

1145
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:39,860
Helis Sacramento soccer. She
does say hello. Um, yeah,

1146
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,190
she's white trash from a PLC.
Is she is,

1147
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:48,080
she's white trash from
northern California. She is,

1148
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,630
she's also a Republican. Um, anyway.

1149
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,730
All right. Where the fuck am I? Um, yeah
dude. Just, you know who gives a fuck?

1150
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,810
This is the deal. Once you get married,
you have a fucking kids and shit.

1151
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,090
You're never going to see anybody anyways.
So who gives a fuck?

1152
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,100
Who gives a fuck what people think?
Go out and do what makes you happy.

1153
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:12,880
Okay. As long as you're not hurting
anybody and you're not breaking a lot,

1154
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:15,010
please go out and do it before.

1155
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,880
Just being happy becomes
illegal because, uh, you know,

1156
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,270
just the level that the
population is going in, you know,

1157
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:23,740
I'm thinking by the end of my life,

1158
01:09:23,741 --> 01:09:25,390
I don't know what it's
going to be like over here.

1159
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:30,210
I hope we don't end up like China with
China. It's so fucking over populated.

1160
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,550
They got to like peep. Nobody drive
cars for like five fucking days.

1161
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:36,160
And just the shit that they're dealing
with is a, it's brutal over there.

1162
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,210
The white one. What are you doing? Yeah,
take the priests, take the priests.

1163
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,730
I still have the Prius everybody up.
I'm going to be selling the car.

1164
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,030
I just can't find the title.
So I sent,

1165
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,870
I sent in all the forms to the DMV.
Bye.

1166
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,270
Enjoy your smoothies in
big Hollywood phony. Bye.

1167
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,200
All right. Um, so I send it in

1168
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:06,060
to the local one and I fucked up.
Not only did I send it to the wrong DMV,

1169
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:09,890
I wrote for some reason 2017 on the
checks and they thought I was trying to be

1170
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,300
pull a fast one. So then, uh,

1171
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,030
I ended up having to send
it up to fucking Sacramento,

1172
01:10:15,031 --> 01:10:17,880
some waiting for that thing so I can
finally get rid of that other fucking car.

1173
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,290
Um, all right, here we go.
Girlfriend texts. Okay.

1174
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:26,560
Hey Bill, I'm in in a bit of a
tough situation. I think you are,

1175
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:30,130
you wrote in twice and we'd love
to hear your take on it. Uh,

1176
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:35,050
I'm 24 years old and was recently
seeing a 33 year old girl. Whoa.

1177
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:36,653
I love it.

1178
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:43,980
Bought a Doodoo Doodoo do
common rub my fucking balls.

1179
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:48,350
You a fucking nine years older.
Um,

1180
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,410
for about six months, uh, within the
time span, I cheated on her twice.

1181
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:55,450
I told her about it and
although she was upset,

1182
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:59,350
we agreed to get back together
and start over a new, uh,

1183
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:01,720
everything was relatively
fine until last week.

1184
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:05,860
I went to her house before she got off
of work to do some work on a computer.

1185
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,450
When I noticed her text messages opened.
Oh,

1186
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,650
mac computers are usually
linked to a person's phone.

1187
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:14,370
So I was able to see of her texts.

1188
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:19,860
I'm sure you know by now where
this is going. Oh, Jay. Jay's,

1189
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,460
um,
since she has gone through my text before,

1190
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:27,360
I figured I would take the
same evasive liberty. Well,

1191
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:30,850
you've fucked around on a twice. I would
think that she would be doing that. Uh,

1192
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:35,850
I found a particularly strange thread
from someone named Lauren who am I found

1193
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:40,440
out was actually her ex boyfriend and she
had it in her phone in a woman's name.

1194
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:45,000
Oh God. They were sexting back and forth,
talking dirty and exchanging pictures.

1195
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,410
I also found out she was sending
him videos of us having sex.

1196
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,290
What the fuck?

1197
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:59,330
What the fuck?
Whoa,

1198
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,150
dude. That's, I don't think that's legal.

1199
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:07,220
Is that legal weight? Did you can
see, oh wait, how does that work?

1200
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:08,820
If you could essentially let somebody,

1201
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,873
yeah,

1202
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,420
if you didn't know you will be in film,
but I don't think that that's legal.

1203
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,760
This is what I do know. I'm not a
lawyer and I have no idea what the lies.

1204
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:18,594
All right,
let's continue.

1205
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:23,810
I confronted her on it and at first she
minimized the entire situation saying it

1206
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,850
wasn't really that big of a deal.

1207
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,150
Since then, we've been going back
and forth arguing, you know what,

1208
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:37,151
you guys are both like not ready to be
in relationships remotely and thank God

1209
01:12:38,181 --> 01:12:41,240
you both found this out before
you got married and had kids.

1210
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:45,380
She sends apologize,
but I'm not sure really sure what to do.

1211
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,330
I did cheat on her.

1212
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,360
So does that even the playing field
or is the whole thing just rooted in

1213
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:57,020
disfunction and chaos? There
you go. Walk towards the light.

1214
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,130
I can't tell if I'm just lonely and
want her in my life again or if I should

1215
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:05,030
just walk away. Please help me here. I am
emotionally involved in this situation,

1216
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:09,830
so it's hard to make a clear objective
call to just walk away, walk away,

1217
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:12,950
and you need to do some work
on yourself because, uh,

1218
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,020
I think you're a fucked up dude. Um,
and I'm, I'm saying this with empathy.

1219
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,040
Uh,

1220
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,980
you are fucked up dude who's actually
relationship guy and probably would have

1221
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:25,940
just gotten married and fucking had
your own little fucking fruit stand or

1222
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,490
whatever, but something fucked
up happened to you as a kid.

1223
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,050
You got weird boundaries.

1224
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,250
So you get into relationships with
dysfunctional fucking people and then you

1225
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:38,690
could consider continue to fuck around
on the side and all that, that it's, um,

1226
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,220
it's actually a very common
thing. So I would say, uh,

1227
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:48,410
what you need is you need
to be single and, uh,

1228
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,650
you need to do some work on yourself.
I may would go to therapy,

1229
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,780
figure out what your deal is,

1230
01:13:53,781 --> 01:13:58,640
really figure out what the fuck it is
that you want in life and what it is that

1231
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,570
you looking for. And then just take a
baby step everyday walking towards it.

1232
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,420
That's what I would do, but I would
get out of this relationship. Um,

1233
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:10,880
and I would give her the same advice
to, um, [inaudible]. There you go. Yeah.

1234
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,350
Get out of it. And uh, and just know
that you're going to be fucking lonely.

1235
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,020
But did all it takes is like, do you
know, two to three months you'll be fine.

1236
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,230
You know what I mean?
Just make yourself go to the gym.

1237
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,370
What you got to do is you're breaking
a routine and you fucking use to this

1238
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:25,750
person being in your life.

1239
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,590
But like the further you go
without seeing that person,

1240
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,090
the more objective you can be.

1241
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:33,850
And you can look back and then one
day you're just going to be like,

1242
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:35,140
what the fuck was I thinking?

1243
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:37,283
MMM.

1244
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:42,130
And it can actually be funny to you or
you can really just see like, like, uh,

1245
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,560
like what the fuck is wrong with me?

1246
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:47,860
That I would do that to a person and what
is wrong with me that someone would do

1247
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:52,180
that to me and I would consider staying.
Uh, you need some self esteem. Have Buddy.

1248
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:57,680
Um, all right, girl with
pet rat. Oh, Jesus Christ.

1249
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:01,970
Dear Billy Christmas toes.
I don't know what that means.

1250
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,610
I've been listening to the
podcast for a long time.

1251
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:08,900
I recently came into a situation that
resulted in me having to make a decision

1252
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,500
instead of writing into you and
asking what to do in this situation.

1253
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:17,210
I decided to do what I thought you would
want me to do and right in with the

1254
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:18,044
results

1255
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,370
do don't base your life on what the
fuck you'd think I would want to do.

1256
01:15:22,371 --> 01:15:24,260
But this is already interesting.

1257
01:15:24,261 --> 01:15:28,610
Last month a girl I'd
been dating got a pet rat.

1258
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:34,100
Boy got a pet fucking rat.
Okay.

1259
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,360
Is it Angelina Jolie?

1260
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,630
Did she have a rat or if she has
Billy Bob's blood around her neck.

1261
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,930
We had been dating for about four
months and it was going well.

1262
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:47,020
I would say that if we were
together about six months,

1263
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:50,320
I would have moved in with them.
We really clicked well.

1264
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:52,930
She got a pet rat and I
wasn't down with that.

1265
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,810
Not because I had a problem
with a rat in a cage,

1266
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:01,230
but her taking the rat out of the cage
and holding it while we watched a movie

1267
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,660
bill, I can barely even stand a cat
on a lap because I don't trust them.

1268
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,070
So I voiced my concern and she laughed
them off and ended up being a bigger

1269
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,650
argument and eventually came
back around to the wreck.

1270
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:17,560
I told her it was me or the rat.

1271
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,950
She said she'd rather me, Oh, you missed
a word here. She'd rather have me,

1272
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:28,000
I guess, except it was a long
pause and some serious thought.

1273
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,220
I really liked this girl.
And honestly,

1274
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:33,970
if my devotion ever came down to choosing
between her and anything short of

1275
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:38,470
family or friends, uh, would
she, are any girl ever,

1276
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:43,690
except that dude you so emotional,
you skipping words here? Probably not.

1277
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,850
They'd say bail on the guy who's not
sure if he choose you or something that

1278
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:52,780
potentially spreads diseases.
Anyways, that's what happened.

1279
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,570
Merry Christmas to the burrs.
Um,

1280
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:56,730
okay.

1281
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:56,911
Yeah.

1282
01:16:56,911 --> 01:17:01,020
But what you're doing is she loves that
rat and you're making her get rid of

1283
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,280
something that she loves.

1284
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:06,780
So there's going to be I guess a pause.

1285
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:08,933
MMM.

1286
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:13,320
I Dunno.
I think that it was really bugging you.

1287
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,870
I think it was really fucking bothering
you and you let it simmer and then you

1288
01:17:19,871 --> 01:17:22,120
just fucking hit her with,
you know,

1289
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:26,980
you are ready to talk about this for days,
weeks,

1290
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:27,850
I don't know how long.

1291
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:32,380
And then you just fucking caught her off
guard and she's been bonding with this

1292
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:37,030
thing and you made or make a Sophie's
choice between you or the rat,

1293
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:43,600
which, um, I gotta tell you,

1294
01:17:43,601 --> 01:17:48,260
I don't know about that move.
I Dunno about that move.

1295
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,210
You could have easily just said,
listen,

1296
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:56,850
I respect the fact that you like a rat.
Okay.

1297
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:01,260
You know what the first thing I would do
is I would look up life expectancy of a

1298
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:04,980
rat. All right? And I don't
mean someone that snitches,

1299
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:09,180
cause I think everybody even I
know at this age is white as I am,

1300
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:14,490
that snitches get stitches.
No kidding. Um, all right.

1301
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Life expectancy. What
do you guys think? Huh?

1302
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,130
What's the overrun here?
How long can a fucking Ratliff,

1303
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,700
I'm going to say they
live six to eight years.

1304
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:31,410
You know, if those are the prices, right.
And I was the last person to fucking,

1305
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,770
I would say six, but I'm going
to say eight, eight years.
Life expectancy of a rat.

1306
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,000
Uh, two years, dude. It only lives
for fucking two years. All right?

1307
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:44,810
This is what you say to her.
If she hasn't gotten rid of the rat,

1308
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:49,410
come back and say, listen, I know
he loved that. Fucking rolling.

1309
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,600
Um, here's the deal. The
things only live two years.

1310
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:59,010
All right? I plan on being with you
in two years. Can you do me a favor?

1311
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:04,570
Make this be the only rat he
ever have. All right. Okay.

1312
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:06,790
She agrees to that thing and
then just put parameters.

1313
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:10,150
When I come over and we're
watching sleepless in Seattle,

1314
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,040
I don't want to have a threesome,
if you know what I mean.

1315
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,050
Just keep it in the fucking
cage when I'm not here.

1316
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,730
You want to roll around the floor, get
yellow fever, whatever the fuck you want,

1317
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:21,010
whatever. Fuck rats. Do you want to do
that? That's fine. I just, you know,

1318
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,610
I don't want to fucking deal
with the thing. You could've
done that, but you know,

1319
01:19:24,611 --> 01:19:28,670
you kind of made her like, what's
she going to do with the rat now?

1320
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:30,980
Like how do you get rid of a rat?

1321
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:35,780
Is there like a fucking adoption agencies
is make me feel bad about my dog again,

1322
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,390
which is of course been brutal. I'm
not gonna talk about it. All right. Um,

1323
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,200
yeah. You just let the fucking
thing go. Do you know those lines?

1324
01:19:46,201 --> 01:19:46,861
Do you know when the twins,

1325
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:50,610
those people have those fucking
lions and tigers and cheetahs,

1326
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,541
fern long enough time.

1327
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,300
They can't release them back into the
wild because they don't even know how to

1328
01:19:54,301 --> 01:19:57,660
fucking hunt anymore. You know what
I mean? That really blew my mind.

1329
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,990
They don't have to hunt anymore,
but they can murder a fucking housekeeper.

1330
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:04,800
I mean, it's just, how the fuck
do you have that in the house?

1331
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,010
There's no fucking,
this

1332
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:12,510
was in Kuwait, by the way. I don't
know why I said Saudi Arabia. Kuwait.

1333
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,940
Exotic
pet deaths.

1334
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,920
Let's see what we got here.
Lions. Tigers to come. Problems.

1335
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,173
Pets in golf.

1336
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:26,910
MMM.

1337
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:31,130
Big Cat killings. Modelings.
Big Cats escape, right?

1338
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,120
Here we go. This is 2014 this
is a website you want to go to?

1339
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:41,040
Big Cat. Big Cat rescue.
All right. Big Cat killings.

1340
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:46,350
Molly's and escapes.
2000 tens before a lion.

1341
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:50,370
Attacks on humans. Here's a video
I had to do. I want to watch this.

1342
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:56,550
And is it weird that I root for the
fucking animals? Oh, Jesus Christ.

1343
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,830
All right. To look at
those things. We will.

1344
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:01,770
I was talking to [inaudible] and we were
talking about these big cats like those

1345
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:03,690
big cats.
They literally,

1346
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:08,610
the Lamborghinis and
Ferraris of fucking of cats,

1347
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,630
you know of animals.
Oh my God.

1348
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:14,390
Okay.

1349
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:16,400
It's fucking,
it's got his fucking arm.

1350
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:20,210
It's got his fucking arm and
he's trying to slap at it.

1351
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,530
Oh my God.

1352
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,310
Jesus fucking you fucking idiot.

1353
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,710
This guy is trying to remain calm.

1354
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,000
This is too,
there's one guy,

1355
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:41,330
he's dealing with this lion
attacking him and then the fucking,

1356
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:45,890
there's another guy slapping at the
fucking lion and it's got his fucking leg.

1357
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:50,060
It's just sort of holding him.
He's almost away.

1358
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:51,590
He's almost away.

1359
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:59,890
Oh my God. He's bucking.
Got Him again. Dude.

1360
01:21:59,891 --> 01:22:03,670
You should've got the fuck out of there.
Get the fuck out of there. And this guy,

1361
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,430
he's still staying in the fucking cage.

1362
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,070
Oh, there you go. You're fucking dope.
Oh, this is like the top 10 all right,

1363
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:17,530
you got to go to this big cat rescue.org

1364
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:26,590
and this is another guy. He's getting
fucking bit by this goddamn thing.

1365
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,710
It's weird, man. When they decide
that they're going after somebody,

1366
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,930
like the other guy can just
totally be like, get the F,

1367
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,840
you'll the other guys like the
friend and the bark on, come on, man,

1368
01:22:34,841 --> 01:22:36,370
you don't need this.
You don't need this.

1369
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,760
This thing is just going
after this one fucking dude.

1370
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:45,610
Lion attack number rate. All right. Pet
in the back of the thing. He's patented.

1371
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:49,330
You know, it's a fucking line. And
then boom, oh, it's got his arm.

1372
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,790
I've seen this one.
It's got his fucking arm.

1373
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,710
Ah.

1374
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,630
Now his friends,
his friends are pulling.

1375
01:22:56,631 --> 01:23:00,170
It's a tug of war with this guy right now.
And the other guy is funny.

1376
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:02,420
He tries to hit the line,
but he's too afraid to go near it.

1377
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:05,920
So he keeps hitting his friend
who has it in his mouth.

1378
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:10,480
Wow. Lion attacks hunter.
I've seen this one.

1379
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:14,470
I don't like that one because they killed
the fucking light. Uh, Jesus Christ.

1380
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,250
You know what I gotta be honest with you.

1381
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:20,430
What you don't see in any of these
fucking videos is women that own fucking

1382
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:25,060
these things. You know, guys is just such
fucking dopes. Um, anyways. All right.

1383
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:28,720
That's the podcast for this week. And if
you guys miss last Thursday's podcasts,

1384
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,180
um, you gotta tune into
rich shied. Man, Amanda,

1385
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:36,310
this guy gives you basically a
standup comedy history class.

1386
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,710
He's one of my favorite guests
I've ever had on the podcast.

1387
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:43,360
I could have talked to him for like two
hours. You have to get his book. Um,

1388
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:45,240
you know,

1389
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,390
it's about his life as a standup comedian
was at walking through the ashes of

1390
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:52,750
standup. My life is a stand up comedian.
You gotta get the book because, you know,

1391
01:23:52,751 --> 01:23:56,200
he started to tell me those Johnny the
first time he did the tonight show,

1392
01:23:56,201 --> 01:24:00,100
he had cocaine bag, a little Baggie
of cocaine in his fucking pocket.

1393
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,320
He said the next time he did it,
um,

1394
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:08,380
he did a joke about heart attacks and
Johnny was really nervous about having a

1395
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:12,310
heart attack because he
