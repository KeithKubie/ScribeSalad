00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.890
We need to factor negative 12f
squared minus 38f, plus 22.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.200
So a good place to start is just
to see if, is there any

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.480
common factor for all three
of these terms?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.000
When we look at them,
they're all even.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.320
And we don't like a negative
number out here.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.130
So let's divide everything, or
let's factor out a negative 2.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.780
So this expression right here is
the same thing as negative

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.390
2 times-- what's negative 12f
squared divided by negative 2?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.920
It's positive 6f squared.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.680
Negative 38 divided by negative
2 is positive 19, so

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.750
it'll be positive 19f.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.350
And then 22 divided by negative
22-- oh, sorry, 22

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.620
divided by negative
2 is negative 11.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.830
So we've simplified it a bit.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.470
We have the 6f squared
plus 19f, minus 11.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.090
We'll just focus on that
part right now.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360
And the best way to factor this
thing, since we don't

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.810
have a 1 here as the coefficient
on the f squared,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.490
is to factor it by grouping.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.230
So we need to look for two
numbers whose product is 6

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.840
times negative 11.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.480
So two numbers, so a times b,
needs to be equal to 6 times

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.080
negative 11, or negative 66.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.230
And a plus b needs to
be equal to 19.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.190
So let's try a few
numbers here.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.170
So let's see, 22, I'm just
thinking of numbers that are

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.820
roughly 19 apart, because
they're going to be of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.530
different signs.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.880
So 22 and 3, I think
will work.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.430
Right.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.840
If we take 22 times negative 3,
that is negative 66, and 22

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.460
plus negative 3 is
equal to 19.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.990
And the way I kind of got pretty
close to this number

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.310
is, well, you know, they're
going to be of different

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.180
signs, so the positive versions
of them have to be

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.340
about 19 apart, and
that worked out.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.470
22 and negative 3.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.860
So now we can rewrite this 19f
right here as the sum of

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.870
negative 3f and 22f.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.440
That's the same thing as 19f.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.220
I just kind of broke it apart.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.320
And, of course, we have the
6f squared and we have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.800
the minus 11 here.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.410
Now, you're probably saying, hey
Sal, why did you put the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.240
22 here and the negative
3 there?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.680
Why didn't you do it the
other way around?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.340
Why didn't you put the 22 and
then the negative 3 there?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.590
And my main motivation for doing
it, I like to put the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.020
negative 3 on the same side with
the 6 because they have

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.710
the common factor of the 3.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.280
I like to put the 22 with the
negative 11, they have the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.430
same common factor of 11.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.660
So that's why I decided
to do it that way.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.700
So now let's do the grouping.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.140
And, of course, you can't forget
this negative 2 that we

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.850
have sitting out here
the whole time.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.370
So let me put that negative 2
out there, but that'll just

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.820
kind of hang out for awhile.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.630
But let's do some grouping.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.390
So let's group these
first two.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.785
And then we're going to group
this-- let me get a nice color

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:01.230
here-- and then we're going
to group this second two.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.840
Well, that's almost an
identical color.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.620
Let me do it in this
purple color.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.660
And then we can group that
second two right there.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.760
So these first two, we could
factor out a negative 3f, so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.700
it's negative 3f times-- 6f
squared divided by negative 3f

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.950
is negative 2f.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.080
And then negative 3f divided
by negative 3f is just

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.000
positive f.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.560
Actually, a better way to start,
instead of factoring

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.445
out a negative 3f, let's just
factor out 3f, so we don't

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:35.480
have a negative out here.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.435
We could do it either way.

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:39.520
But if we just factor
out a 3f, 6f squared

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.970
divided by 3f is 2f.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.330
And then negative 3f divided
by 3f is negative 1.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.510
So that's what that
factors into.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.800
And then that second part, in
that dark purple color, can

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.420
factor out an 11.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.600
And if we factor that out, 22f
divided by 11 is 2f, and

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.610
negative 11 divided by
11 is negative 1.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.150
And, of course, once again,
you have that negative 2

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.400
hanging out there.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.790
Now, inside the parentheses,
we have two terms, both of

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.640
which have 2f minus
1 as a factor.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.490
So we can factor that out.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.490
This whole thing is just an
exercise in doing the reverse

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.660
distributive property,
if you will.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.260
So let's factor that out, so
you have 2f minus 1, times

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.265
this 3f, and then times
that plus 11.

00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:45.920
Let me do that in the
same shade of

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.200
purple right over there.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.240
And you know, you can distribute
it if you like.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.760
2f minus 1 times 3f will give
you this term, 2f f minus 1

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.650
times 11 will give
you that term.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.010
And we can't forget that we
still have that negative 2

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.470
hanging out outside.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.800
I want to change the
colors on it.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.830
And we're done factoring it.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.980
Negative 12f squared minus 38f,
plus 22 is negative 2

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.230
times 2f minus 1, times
3f plus 11.
