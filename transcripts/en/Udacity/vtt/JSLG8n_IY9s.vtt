00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
So the answer is that we need to
consider a newer coordinate frame and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.910
we would refer to this as
the homogeneous coordinate system.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.500
Basically what we want to do is
actually take the two dimensions

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.930
that we were looking at before,
the x, y, and

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.050
the x prime and the y prime,
and a two dimensional matrix M.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.870
Let's start seeing if we can actually
represent this as a three vector.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.380
So so far we've looked at x and y.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.310
So we want to be able to take
this two dimensional x y and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.630
generate a new three vector.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.980
We can basically refer to this as x y
and the third vector being 1, and for

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.970
just sake of completeness and

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.630
what we will do with it
next let's call this a w.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.770
So what we basically doing is
we adding a third coordinate to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.740
every two dimensional point.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.750
So and what we did basically is
now we're coming up with x, y, w.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.640
And the thing we want to remember is
what basically w implies is again,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.680
my two dimensional vector, except
that now we are dividing both x and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.000
y with that third point here, w.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.087
Now of course there are certain subtle
things we need to pay attention to.

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:08.556
Here for example is my simple
two dimensional x and y.

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:12.023
I can basically look at
this point here 2 and 1,

00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:16.857
of course just looking at x 1,
y 1, the values would be 2 1.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:20.730
Now just keeping this convention
in mind, if I had omega,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.630
or w to be 1 this still makes
unreasonable sense 2, 1, 1 applies, but

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.633
then of course,
imagine I could work w to 2,

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:33.170
then 4, 2, 2 applies and
if I make w be 3, 6, 3, 3 applies.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.760
So, this point now can be
represented by this three vector

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.350
in all three of these values.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.880
One thing to note, w cannot be 0
because if you make this 0 x and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.660
y also would actually go to infinities,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.026
so of course when w is 0 we can
refer to that as an infinite point.

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:57.540
This point, 0, 0, 0 is not allowed
because we cannot have 0 over 0.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.400
That would be an indeterminate point.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.480
But all of a sudden, now we have
a lot of strength in our hands,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.660
when we actually now create
this new coordinate system,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.288
the homogeneous coordinate system,
with x, y, and w.

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:10.360
Let's see what that buys us.
