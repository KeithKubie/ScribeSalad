00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.551
TONI THOMPSON: I'd like to
introduce to you, my guests.

00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:04.400
This is Dan Cohen.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.130
Dan Cohen is the
founder of a program

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.870
called Music and Memory.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.140
And music and memory is what
this wonderful documentary

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.330
is about.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.760
The documentary is
called "Alive Inside".

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.660
And we have, also, Michael
Rossato-Bennett, too enliven

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.950
our conversation.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.660
So welcome.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.390
DAN COHEN: Great.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.460
TONI THOMPSON:
Welcome both of you.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.585
I'd like to start by talking
with Dan a little bit,

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:29.820
and find out what was the
genesis of this program?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.885
How did you get this
whole thing started?

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:33.849
DAN COHEN: So I'm
a social worker.

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:36.140
But I have, actually, a career
in technology companies.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.430
And in 2006, on the
radio, a journalist

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.240
was talking about how
iPods are ubiquitous.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.670
They're everywhere.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.840
And I thought, well, young
people all have them,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.454
many of us older adults.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.120
But if you're in a
nursing home, it just

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.470
didn't seem to be
a true statement.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.779
And so I googled iPods
and nursing homes.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.070
And even though there's 16,000
nursing homes in the US,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
I couldn't find one that was
providing people's own music

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950
to the residents of these homes.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.230
And so I called up a local home.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.317
I live on Long Island-- a
600-bed county facility--

00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:05.400
and I said, I know music's
already your number one

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.420
recreational activity.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.878
But can we see if
there's any added

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:10.544
value if we were to totally
personalize the music for them?

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:11.210
They said, sure.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.043
And I came in with my
laptop and some iPods.

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:15.360
And it was just an instant
and definitive hit.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.440
TONI THOMPSON: Wonderful.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.740
Now, did you have any
relationship with the nursing

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.760
home previously?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.890
Did you just call them
up, out of the blue?

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.190
DAN COHEN: No.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.356
Just called out of the blue.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:22.870
Yeah.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.440
TONI THOMPSON: That's wonderful.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.364
And what happened?

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.530
DAN COHEN: So I would come
in every couple of weeks.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.821
I wouldn't just say, oh,
here's the music that you said

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.842
or pretty much the
artist that you said.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.300
Because so much of the music
that I was going to give them,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.800
I knew would be
sort of so-so music.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.420
We're all used to listening
to so-so music on the radio.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.447
How often do you go
from station to station,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.530
trying to figure that out?

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.060
And that's why we're
all very specific.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.601
We can listen to
whatever we want to,

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:47.400
however long we want to.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.872
So I hung the list over time.

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:50.330
So every couple
weeks I'd come back

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.621
and get rid of the so-so music.

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:53.250
So that after two
or three months,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.260
every song of the 100,
200, 300-song playlist

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.010
was a song that
resonated with them.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.890
Or got them more upbeat,
or helped calm them down

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.929
if they were agitated.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:02.720
TONI THOMPSON: Wow.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.739
So it really is personalized
to quite a serious degree.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.280
DAN COHEN: It's
totally personalized.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.860
I mean, there's already plenty
of music that's by genre.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.480
Oh, they're 83,
give them Big Band.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.100
Well, no.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.990
Just to all the
Googlers, if anybody

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.930
thinks of their favorite
genre music of music,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630
if you were to say
your genre of music

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.360
and then have somebody else
guess your favorite musicians

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.820
or songs, you know, they're not
going to be able to do that.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.890
And so right now, best
practice is giving people

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.850
music they don't really
necessarily love.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.210
And so we're changing
that by using

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.340
the same digital music
culling and honing

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.650
that we all have access to.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.108
We kind of forget
about our elders,

00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:40.330
thinking, oh, they never
liked computers and stuff.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.130
They won't like this
stuff with the music,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.300
because it involves devices.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.522
And our approach is just
tell us what you like.

00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:47.480
We'll figure out what
you like, and here it is.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.860
And we'll take care of the tech.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.609
TONI THOMPSON: That's
a really good point.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.690
The technology is
fearsome for some people.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.720
And yet, here you are,
with your little device,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.700
your little iPod.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.409
And it turns into
a source of joy.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.950
DAN COHEN: Yeah,
it's pretty amazing.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.241
TONI THOMPSON: That's exciting.

00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.850
So where did you go from there?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.490
I understand now you've got
this wonderful program that's

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.100
in many nursing homes.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.954
Tell us about that.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.620
DAN COHEN: So the
program is now running

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.240
in every state in the US and
a number of other countries,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.960
in 2,800 facilities--
nursing homes,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.680
assisted-living facilities,
hospitals, hospices,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.136
home-care programs,
and adult-day programs.

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:24.299
It's wherever elders are being
served, and for elders at home.

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.840
Because we have materials for
people who are at home, to help

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.740
them do this themselves.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.909
And so in 15 states it's
become a public policy

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.450
to have Music and Memory, that
every person in a nursing home

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.450
should have their own music.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.410
And so our goal is to scale
this so every state has that,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.817
and everybody has access.

00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:42.150
TONI THOMPSON: That's wonderful.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.976
Now, you talked about
other countries.

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:45.600
Tell me a bit about
that, if you would.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.560
DAN COHEN: Sure.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.940
When the Henry video went viral,
it just fantastically just hit

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.440
the right chord, so to speak.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.690
I think it hit the right
chord because people are very

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.273
frustrated that there is nothing
you can do about Alzheimer's.

00:03:57.273 --> 00:03:59.590
Alzheimer's is a
terminal disease.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.862
And what was the question again?

00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:05.320
TONI THOMPSON: The
other countries.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.070
DAN COHEN: The other
countries, I'm sorry.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.230
So when it went viral, I
got feedback from emails,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900
from all over the world.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.500
And many people said, I
want to get this going here.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.920
So it's now running in Australia
and South Africa, in Israel,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.850
in Holland and the
UK, and Denmark.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.192
And many other countries
are interested as well.

00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:24.650
TONI THOMPSON: That
is so exciting.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.550
You must be really
gratified to have that.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.620
DAN COHEN: It's great.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.160
But the challenge is
out of every 100 persons

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.060
in a nursing homes, 98 of
them are sitting idle right.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.660
So that's the fact that
time and motion studies

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.810
show that that 90% of
people in nursing homes

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.039
are actually idle, and
half the people in homes

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.080
never ever get a visitor.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.579
So if you're in a nursing home
or you have a relative that's

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.224
in a nursing home, and there's
no family visiting you,

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:51.640
no friends, you're
kind of waiting

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.030
for your next med or next meal.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.460
It's kind of a
recipe for decline.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.500
So we really want to bring the
community back into facilities.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.760
We want to connect our
elders, whether they're

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.450
in a health care setting,
or they're at home

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.721
with their own music.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.470
TONI THOMPSON: So you
may or may not know,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.880
but Google has a very
strong volunteer policy,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.560
where they give
us the opportunity

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.290
to volunteer on our
own terms, basically.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.470
If I find a nonprofit that
I'd like to do some work for,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.160
I can do that.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.770
And Google will actually
subsidize my time,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.820
as well as make a donation.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.440
So talk to me about
how volunteers

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.354
fit into all of this.

00:05:27.354 --> 00:05:29.270
DAN COHEN: So volunteers
are really important.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.640
I mean, every day we're getting
people from around the country.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.220
And I didn't mention
Canada, which

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.900
has a very large implementation
of Music and Memory.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.160
They can get involved in
visiting the nursing home

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.150
or visiting a
hospice or a hospital

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.510
and helping them set up
their iTunes library.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.710
They can help them get donations
from the community of devices

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.960
or money to buy the music.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.320
The best thing is when
they really go one to one

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.364
and sit with individuals
who are, again,

00:05:57.364 --> 00:05:58.530
they're sitting there alone.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.080
And to have that
one-to-one time,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.340
we have students at
universities and high schools

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.720
that go in all over the US.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.600
And they're spending
that time with people,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.650
which is really valuable.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.420
And it's not only great for
the person who is elder.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.950
It turns out it's great
for the youth as well.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.579
They feel, wow, they got
to light up this person.

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:17.120
And this is the best
thing I've done.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.830
You know?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.010
That really gives them value and
helps build their confidence.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.096
And so it's a big win.

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:23.220
So we're working very hard.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.100
We have hundreds of high schools
and colleges that are involved.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.900
In Wisconsin, we have
a special program

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.800
where we're connecting
37 high schools

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.350
and colleges with
37 nursing homes

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.960
as a template for the nation.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.820
And we're going to
be rolling that out.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.820
It already is happening.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.460
Nursing homes and
schools don't really

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.400
have protocols for
this kind of stuff.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.060
Everybody's doing
their own thing.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.714
And so we're really
finalizing those protocols.

00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:51.880
TONI THOMPSON: That's great.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.785
And then that will
be distributed

00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:53.560
to whoever wants it?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.410
DAN COHEN: And then
it'll be distributed.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.334
All the other states we have
made this public policy.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.750
They're just going
to layer it in.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.130
TONI THOMPSON: That's fantastic.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.338
DAN COHEN: And that's how
we'll get tens of thousands

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.527
of schools and millions
of students involved.

00:07:03.527 --> 00:07:05.110
TONI THOMPSON: So
do you find students

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.450
are from all walks
of life, so to speak,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.020
different disciplines,
different reasons, and they're

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.375
attracted to the program?

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:12.000
DAN COHEN: Yes.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.250
I mean, sometimes people have
had a family member who maybe

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.970
currently has Alzheimer's
or is in a nursing home,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.820
or has other physical issues.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.040
Or it could be just somebody
that wants to help out.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.140
I mean, it's a wide
range of things, I think,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.740
that draw people to it.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.959
Or somebody has a
relative who has past.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.375
And they'd like
to give back-- oh,

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:34.610
I wish I had this for my
grandma or my grandma--

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.720
and want to get in and
do something around this.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.220
TONI THOMPSON: That
is so wonderful.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.700
So not to leave you out,
Michael, what I'd like to do

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.550
is have you talk a little bit
about how the film came to be.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.096
And where was that
happening, in your process?

00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:49.022
And we'll switch over
to Michael a little bit.

00:07:49.022 --> 00:07:50.480
MICHAEL ROSSATO
BENNETT: All right.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.380
So I'm a filmmaker.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:59.650
And I made a series of
short films for a nonprofit.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.560
So a friend of mine
worked at the nonprofit.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.110
And she called me
up and she said,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.210
that this nonprofit--
this was back before.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.360
I think you were
only in a couple

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.436
of nursing homes at the time,
maybe three or four, right?

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:15.560
DAN COHEN: I'll have to
look back and see how many.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.226
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Can't remember?

00:08:17.226 --> 00:08:20.120
I think he was in
about three or four.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.300
DAN COHEN: Seven or eight.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.580
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
OK, seven or eight.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.970
DAN COHEN: The ones listed
on the bottom of the movie.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:25.803
TONI THOMPSON: Cool.

00:08:25.803 --> 00:08:28.000
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: OK.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.530
So anyway, I was just given a
job, to go and shoot something.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:41.150
And I don't know if you've ever
been in a large public nursing

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.650
home.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.570
But for somebody that's never
been in a place like that,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.390
it's really overwhelming.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:53.730
I mean, sometimes--
not all, but many--

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.860
like entering a layer of
"Dante's Inferno", if you will.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.480
I mean, I remember the
first day I came there.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.560
And I walked through this sort
of gauntlet of about 100 people

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.675
sitting against the wall
in wheelchairs, like this.

00:09:07.675 --> 00:09:09.120
And one guy was going like this.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.800
And I just wanted to run.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.290
And it was very, very sad.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.470
And something like
what's the statistic?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.040
50% of nursing home residents
don't get any visitors.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.310
And some of them are
there for, like, 10 years.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:32.080
So it's a place of
loneliness, often.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.060
There are some
beautiful facilities.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.070
And actually, the
Music and Memory

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.590
has done a great job of
giving people in nursing homes

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:51.030
a tool so that they can connect,
instead of just be in a very

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.670
challenged care-giving role.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:10:00.120
Anyway, I mean, Henry is really
the spark of this whole story.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.170
Henry was put in front of me.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.860
And I literally had no
idea what to expect.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.370
And Dan had some music for him.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.000
I think was Cab Calloway,
and some gospel music.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.850
And I watched this man,
who a few minutes before

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.480
had been like this.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.280
And with the music
on him, I watched

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.340
his entire being, like, wake up.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.140
It was like somebody
plugged him in.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.840
And something sprang
alive inside of him.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.270
And I think we all
know that feeling.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.160
Right?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.910
That's just like when
we're on fire and alive.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.160
And it freaked me out, in a way.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.780
I mean, I started to cry.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.240
I had tears in my eyes.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.360
Because this was a
person who was gone.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.130
And then we just gave him music.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.250
And it went deep into his
mind and into his heart

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.870
and his memory and his body, and
his movement, and everything.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.010
And he came alive.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.080
Right?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.710
And I think that all of us, deep
down inside, we want to live.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.920
We want to live
sometimes more than we're

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.420
given the chance to live.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.980
That's why I decided I
wanted to make this film.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.590
Because if we could bring this
kind of life to these people,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.090
right?

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.030
And then, it brought
so much life to me.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.240
And I don't know if you've
seen the video with Henry?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.740
TONI THOMPSON: Yes, I have.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.156
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Yeah, OK.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:48.920
You know, the man that came
out of that shell was a poet.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.440
And he had a beautiful voice.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.030
And he had a whole life.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.240
And I got to feel it.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.030
And this is one of the
most amazing things

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.170
that this work has taught me.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.840
It is that people
with dementia actually

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.080
have something to teach us.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.160
We think of them.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.660
Our whole health care dynamic
is doing to or doing for.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.570
Especially with
people with dementia.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:23.500
The idea that we could do with
them is a totally novel idea.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.710
And that's what music gives
you the possibility to do.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.730
It gives you the
possibility to connect

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.740
on a very human, emotional, and
primal level with another human

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.540
being.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.520
I told you a story a little
bit earlier about last week.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.990
I was in a nursing
home, actually,

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.890
a Music and Memory facility
down in North Carolina.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:51.190
And there was this
woman, full-on dementia.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.610
And we gave her her music
and she started singing.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.640
It was this Italian song,
like, by Jay and the Americans,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.805
called Casa something or other.

00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:02.080
Does anybody know?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.720
She started singing.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.420
And I started singing with her.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.020
And she just looked
into my eyes.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.010
And she knew that she
didn't really know me.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.450
Like, she knew I wasn't
part of her life.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.340
But her eyes just
poured into me.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.170
And we sang together.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.485
And I swear to God,
I have never-- I

00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:27.946
felt like I was in a love story.

00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:28.820
You know what I mean?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.290
I felt like I was
in a love story.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.130
I have never had
that experience.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.300
I couldn't have that with you.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.596
You know?

00:13:37.596 --> 00:13:44.710
The thing about these minds
is that they've lost so much.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:52.700
But what's left is basically
our deepest emotional being.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.530
Some scientists call
it the embodied mind.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.060
It's what we've inherited
from dogs and whales.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:08.070
And our bodies, our emotions
are pretty much the same

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.480
as the emotions of
dogs and other animals.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.360
That's why we can identify
with them so much.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.271
You love your dog.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:15.770
Right?

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.510
TONI THOMPSON: I don't have one.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.130
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
You don't have one?

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:17.670
TONI THOMPSON: I do.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.940
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
You have a dog?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.110
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah, sure.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.859
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
You love your dog

00:14:20.859 --> 00:14:23.930
because they are so pure.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:29.220
And they touch a really pure
and elemental place in you.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.630
And this is really what I
love about this whole journey,

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.180
is what there is to learn
about ourselves and each other,

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.390
and about the way we can
connect with each other.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.710
I mean, that's what
happened with the film.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:49.780
Why did a film about nursing
homes and dementia and aging,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.590
why did that win Sundance?

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.370
Why did the Henry clip go viral?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.210
Because there's something in
these people that literally,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.530
I had never seen
before in my life.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.400
And I really don't
think we, as a culture,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.180
even have a word for it.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.960
There's some kind of thing that
these people have to teach us.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.760
And that's what
fascinated me, and why

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.057
I kept going for three years.

00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:16.890
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.170
Your passion really
shows in the film.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.440
And I hope all of you, who
are getting DVDs of this film,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.630
will take a chance to watch it.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.100
And you'll find it really,
really life affirming, and just

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.734
so pleasurable, to
see what is possible.

00:15:31.734 --> 00:15:34.150
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: I
call it the only good-news film

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.560
ever made about dementia.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.530
TONI THOMPSON: Oh my gosh.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.720
That's very apt.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.260
So tell me a little bit about
the Sundance experience.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.870
How did that happen?

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.270
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Oh my god.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.400
That was incredible.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.920
Like, you got to understand.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.684
Like, I literally
didn't think anybody

00:15:52.684 --> 00:15:53.850
would want to see this film.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.620
TONI THOMPSON: Seriously?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.870
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: Yeah.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.350
I mean, our culture isn't
that interested in aging.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.830
It's not interested.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.160
We take our elders that are too
much trouble to take care of

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.590
and we put them away, basically.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.090
We put them out of
sight and out of mind.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.920
Here we are at Google,
the absolute ground

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.600
zero for productive
young people.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.300
Right?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:18.800
You know?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.540
There's no old people here.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.460
I mean, I'm sure
there are, actually.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.874
There's me.

00:16:25.874 --> 00:16:27.290
TONI THOMPSON:
You'd be surprised.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.150
MICHAEL ROSSATO BENNETT:
Wait, did I hear anything?

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.191
TONI THOMPSON: It's true.

00:16:30.809 --> 00:16:32.350
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
So anyway, I

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.766
didn't think anybody
would see it.

00:16:33.766 --> 00:16:38.070
And I didn't even put it in.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.070
I didn't submit to Sundance.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.410
Because I was so broke
from making the film

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.480
that I said to my
wife, it's $100.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.380
They're never going to
want to see this film.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.360
Because it's about old people.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.056
And they only want films
about young people and guns.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:52.930
That was my thinking.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.242
TONI THOMPSON: Whoa.

00:16:54.242 --> 00:16:56.700
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: Anyway,
but my wife made me do it.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.080
And it was a long
story about it.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.510
I literally got it
into the mailbox

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.030
at literally the
last possible minute.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.260
I mean, literally,
the doors were

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.829
shutting at the 34th Street
post office, when I dove

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.349
through them and I put it in.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.140
And then Sundance
called and said,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.079
that 12,000 films
had been submitted.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.970
And they picked 16
for competition.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.750
And one was ours.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.369
And that was literally the
most amazing moment of my life.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:32.350
And then when we won
the Audience Award,

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.310
that was just beyond belief.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.880
And it's allowed
so much to happen.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.729
It's brought international
attention to Dan and his work.

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:42.770
TONI THOMPSON: Wonderful.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.990
MICHAEL ROSSATO
BENNETT: You know?

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.610
You don't know how many people
have come up to both of us

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.820
and said, oh my god, if
only I'd thought about this.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.290
I'm a composer, and
my mom plays violin.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.170
And if only I'd thought
to bring her her music.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:06.380
And when we started this,
nobody thought, wow,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.510
let's give people who
are dying their music.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.960
Oh, let's give people who
have dementia their music.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.940
Literally, it just
didn't hit their brains.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.730
And now I think that
honestly, in the culture,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.460
that there's been a shift.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.860
And we had some small
part to play in that.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.180
People now, it's
common human knowledge.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:31.700
I think.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.959
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:34.750
I'd love to know what
your audience thinks.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.570
But I think it's common
human knowledge now

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.360
that wait, music is important.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.260
It can bring back memories
in people with dementia.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.580
It holds a place in us
that we should investigate.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.600
Do you think people
know that, Dan?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.660
DAN COHEN: Oh yeah.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.330
Much more.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.060
So Henry video, which has
passed 13 million views now,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.530
that was hugely helpful.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.070
The film itself, again,
many people have seen it.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.759
But the media coverage has been
so generous around all of this.

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:05.800
Again, they don't have
good news stories to tell.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.280
So oh, here's some good
news about old people

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.970
who are dying with dementia or
old people in nursing homes.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.655
And so I would like to say,
that when it comes Thanksgiving

00:19:12.655 --> 00:19:14.280
time, and everybody's
around the table,

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.790
somebody's is going to say
about their grandma, who's

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.890
got dementia, oh, well who's
setting up her playlist?

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.440
Who's getting her her music?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.970
So it's just that common.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.560
So but still building, so you
don't have to wait for somebody

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.142
to have the light turn on.

00:19:30.142 --> 00:19:31.100
So we're getting there.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.360
It's still a process.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:32.870
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: Right.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:33.460
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.560
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
And about that idea,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:44.350
so one of my dreams was a little
population illustration here.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:51.150
This is the population pyramid
of human age in human history.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.160
Over the last
400,000 years, we've

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.960
had very few elders
on top, and lots

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.510
of young people on the bottom.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.010
OK?

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.380
TONI THOMPSON: Sure.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.170
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Right now, it looks like this.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.500
In Japan, it looks like this.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.730
By about 2050, it's
going to look like this.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:05.700
OK?

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.080
This is something absolutely
new in human history.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.240
A one-to-one relationship
between the very young

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.230
and the very old.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.150
This is earth shattering
in terms of how

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.470
it will affect our culture.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.370
How will it affect
our government?

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.510
This is big stuff.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.080
And right now, we have a
generation of young people

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.770
who, they're not
raised with the old.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:40.300
For most of human history,
the Google of the world

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.750
was the old people.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.160
The old people were the
carriers of the history,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.210
of the how to survive.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.400
Right now, any time we
need to survive, we Google.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.840
Right?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:01.720
But how do we create these
connections and preserve them?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.670
There's real wisdom.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.180
Wisdom is not, like, looking up
stuff and knowing your family

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.080
history.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.257
Wisdom is how do you
get through life?

00:21:12.257 --> 00:21:12.965
What's important?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.810
What does it take to
live a satisfying life?

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.270
And any older person
will tell you this.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.130
They probably wouldn't trade.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.670
They'd love to be 20.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.710
But they don't want
their 20-year-old self.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.720
Because they've learned so much.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.240
Right?

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.530
What about you?

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.863
TONI THOMPSON: Sure, absolutely.

00:21:34.863 --> 00:21:35.700
What about me?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.116
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Would you

00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:39.760
like to be 20 years
old, if you had to be

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.270
that 20-year-old mind as well?

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.380
TONI THOMPSON: No, I'd
want to bring along

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.636
my experience, of course.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.010
MICHAEL ROSSATO
BENNETT: Exactly.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.480
And so that's really what
I'm so interested in,

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.470
is this way of
creating connections

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.820
between the old and the young.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.400
And to really make
it-- you know what?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.570
What started this whole thing
was you were talking about Dan

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.400
said, on Thanksgiving,
how do you

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.230
find the playlist
for your elder?

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.950
And so I made an app.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.450
It's about 99% done.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.420
It's at memorydetective.com.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.730
And what I was trying to
do is create something

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.250
that would let
young people-- just

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.860
by asking a series
of questions--

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.370
find all of the songs that
their grandma or their dad

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:26.960
or somebody would want to find.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.300
And we're doing it with Spotify.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.760
And it's a great way
to spend some time

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.380
with your grandma or your dad.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:45.510
And so I encourage anybody
who's interested in going

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.720
on a musical journey, to
go there and try and find

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.600
some music for
somebody that you love.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.290
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.420
That sounds like a great idea.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.510
How about you, Dan?

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.220
I know that you've continued
to grow the Music and Memory

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:58.940
program.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.450
What kind of
outreach do you have

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.680
for people who are caring
for an elder person at home?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.710
DAN COHEN: Our website,
musicandmemory.org.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.890
I mean, we have resources.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.550
They can download a PDF, how to
create a personalized playlist

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.660
for a loved one at home.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.010
It's pretty simple, yes.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.192
And it facilitates
that communication.

00:23:16.192 --> 00:23:17.150
And here are the steps.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.320
And it's readily available.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.330
We talk about how
people can volunteer.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.020
Or we talk about how they
can raise money, do an iPod

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.666
drive, whatever,
how people can help

00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:30.540
be an ambassador in
their communities to help

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:37.270
bring health care organizations
on board, all of those things.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.690
TONI THOMPSON: That's fantastic.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.220
I was just taking
a look at our Dory,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.160
which has a question
from one of the Googlers.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.650
It says, can special
needs kids be

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.480
helped with personalized music?

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.510
Do either of you have
an opinion about that?

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.093
DAN COHEN: Well, I think it's a
matter of what's going on now.

00:23:54.093 --> 00:23:56.302
Special Ed is all over the
music already for the kids

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:57.301
who are on the spectrum.

00:23:57.301 --> 00:23:58.790
TONI THOMPSON: In a similar way?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.840
DAN COHEN: Well, not in
remembering, let's say.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.400
I know that number
one, there are

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.425
nursing homes that have kids
that are chronically ill.

00:24:05.425 --> 00:24:07.300
And they live there.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.240
And the number one request
that the people who

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.906
run these homes have
told me is the kids

00:24:10.906 --> 00:24:13.872
want their own devices,
whatever it is.

00:24:13.872 --> 00:24:15.830
And you'd think they'd
have them automatically.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.930
So yes, there's a lot of music.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.620
People come in.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.370
And the staff plays
a lot of music.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.120
But again, it's that
have having your own,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.280
the way we have our own.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.230
I don't think we've
gotten there yet.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.020
So the profession is very
attentive to the young.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.980
So yes, Special Ed, and classes.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.480
And the kids have
their devices that

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.685
are helping them communicate,
assistive communicative devices

00:24:34.685 --> 00:24:36.110
for people who
can't communicate.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.020
Maybe just on their tablet,
it just helps them speak.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.560
But a lot of that stuff,
that works for the young.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.030
It is not even thought
of for the elders.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.140
So we can apply that.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.900
You just can't take
the apps and such,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.190
from people who are young,
and bring them over.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.320
Because the subject
matter is for kids.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.300
So even though somebody
might have dementia,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.310
they know if you're
talking about kid stuff.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.280
A lot of stuff, the
software, the content,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.150
has to be re-papered, whatever.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.182
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah, repurposed.

00:25:08.182 --> 00:25:09.640
DAN COHEN: But in
terms of content,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.598
and the ability to help
people who can't speak,

00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:13.640
people who have
had a stroke, well,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.120
maybe they can do it with
an app and help them speak,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.420
even though they can't.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.170
Some people who can't
speak, they can sing a song.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.020
And sometimes they'll
sing the words.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.660
They'll sing a song and
put the words to an action

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.630
that they need to do.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.670
And it's to help
them communicate.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.910
And so the stroke is really
a very interesting kind

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.020
of usage of music as well.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.980
So there are a lot
of opportunities.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.256
We just need to have more, I
think, programming attention

00:25:38.256 --> 00:25:38.755
for elders.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.470
Here we have this Baby
Boomer generation out there.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.230
And many of us now, we're going
to bring our devices with us

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.830
wherever we go.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.780
But there's this gap.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.204
If we look at the
over 50, I mean,

00:25:51.204 --> 00:25:52.620
everything with
all the streaming,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.810
and all that discussion
in the media,

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.190
and all the hype
around streaming,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.240
well, I think we're forgetting.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.700
If somebody were
to do a survey--

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.158
and I've found nobody that's
captured the metrics on this--

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:02.700
for people over 50, how many
have access to their own music,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.460
whether they've downloaded the
songs, or they're streaming?

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.480
And I think that number's
going to be under 10%.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.330
And so you have
this massive cohort

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.730
of folks who have no music,
no help, and everything's

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.090
moving along way past them.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.760
And we have to whoa, slow down.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.840
So for the next 20
years or 30 years,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.700
there's going to be
a group of people

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.074
that are going to
need assistance

00:26:20.074 --> 00:26:21.934
in getting what will help them.

00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:23.850
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Yeah, treat streaming

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.240
is a wonderful solution.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.430
But I mean, most of the people
with dementia live at home.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.380
And there's a lot that
live in nursing homes.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.470
And a lot of the nursing
homes don't have wireless.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.110
They have wireless in one room.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.190
But in their rooms, they
don't have wireless.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.170
So the streaming solution
just doesn't work that well.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.610
But about people
with special needs,

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.490
I was shooting a
kid with autism, who

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.990
was just all over the place.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:58.530
He was an Energizer Bunny,
just running around the room.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.500
And then the woman came in.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.810
She started to just
play some music.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.540
And this kid just stopped.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.890
Like, the Energizer
Bunny just stopped.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.930
And yes, music can help
kids with special needs.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.220
And it is being used a lot.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.720
We're the only species
that actually does music.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.970
I mean, there's some argument.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.040
There's a lot of
communication, a lot

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.070
of sound in the natural world.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.100
But music-- melodic,
creative melodic thing-- it

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.790
might just be limited
to human beings.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.240
And it's actually been
integrated into our DNA.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.780
A primate will not
respond to a beat.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.000
But a baby child will.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.170
So you're hitting this very
deep part of our brains

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.560
in our bodies.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.840
And special needs kids
really respond to that.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.275
It's a tremendous tool.

00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:02.900
TONI THOMPSON: Yeah,
I'm sure we're all

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.220
going to be really surprised
at some of the work that

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.070
is coming out of this and coming
out of new efforts in research

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.110
and so forth.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.250
If anyone would like
to ask a question here,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.340
we do have microphones.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.330
So please feel free to come up.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.310
And I just want to hit one
more point with you, Dan.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.450
What are you focused on today?

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:23.950
This has been a
great program, and I

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.950
know you're working to get
it going on in other places.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.880
But are you thinking
in new directions yet?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.170
DAN COHEN: So we
definitely want to bring

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.750
in all this tablet technology.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.820
OK?

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.262
Because it turns
out that tablets

00:28:37.262 --> 00:28:38.970
can be used for people
who have dementia.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.780
Nobody thinks of that.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.030
Everybody knows "Angry Birds".

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.850
But they don't know that there
are lots of Alzheimer's apps.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.412
Either with those
names, if you use that

00:28:46.412 --> 00:28:48.870
as a key word, or things that
don't have that as a key word

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.940
but are still good--
brain fitness,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.462
relaxation, just games,
solitaire, blackjack.

00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:56.420
My father-in-law was
always with the blackjack,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.394
we played, or bowling.

00:28:57.394 --> 00:28:58.060
He was a bowler.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.230
But this is how he bowled now.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.730
Right?

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.366
So all that stuff
helps people reconnect.

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:03.990
And again, it's done
with someone else.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.290
You're not just saying,
here's your tablet.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.123
We'll see you later.

00:29:06.123 --> 00:29:10.550
For a lot of people it
becomes a point of connection.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.630
So often we visit people
in facilities or at home.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.690
And well, what do we do?

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:15.710
What do we say?

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.220
We kind of shrink from it
and can't wait to get out.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.290
But when you have
something in common,

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.440
that you can
communicate on, then it

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.620
facilitates communication
and relationship.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.676
And everybody feels better.

00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:30.050
Actually, when
people get visited

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:35.850
in any kind of health
care residential facility,

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.730
music, maybe you listen
to it for an hour.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.292
And that calmness, even
when the person leaves,

00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:43.000
just keeps going for
the rest of the day.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.940
TONI THOMPSON: Really?

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.290
DAN COHEN: And so I don't
think it matters so much what

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.331
the activity is, whether
it's music or just being

00:29:47.331 --> 00:29:49.690
together and doing something
with someone that is fun.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.495
TONI THOMPSON: It's
real stimulation.

00:29:50.495 --> 00:29:53.280
DAN COHEN: Well, it has a
more-than-we'd-expect kind

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.020
of outcome.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.540
TONI THOMPSON: That's great.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.090
So I see we have
a question here.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.654
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:30:00.654 --> 00:30:04.630
I have a question
about how do you

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:10.870
personalize the music for
the demand, for the person?

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.430
Because you say it's not
hey, here's the music,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.500
and everybody gets that.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:14.780
Right?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.654
So you buy one music
and give it to everyone.

00:30:16.654 --> 00:30:19.640
But then now, you have
to personalize music

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.930
to every person.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.460
So are you going to buy
music for each person?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.829
But in general, that's
kind of a very specific

00:30:27.829 --> 00:30:28.870
logistics-based question.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.960
But one thing I
was wondering was

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.360
if I get that DVD
now and go home,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.000
and give to my mother, who
is visiting from India,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.670
she would say, what
kind of a culture

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.920
puts old people into nursing
homes in the first place?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.003
TONI THOMPSON: Good point.

00:30:42.003 --> 00:30:43.750
AUDIENCE: And so
the broader question

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.939
is are we really solving the
broader problem here as well?

00:30:46.939 --> 00:30:48.022
DAN COHEN: Great question.

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:49.260
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
So one very core

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.920
logistic, how do you
go around things?

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.620
If I were to do that
from the ground up,

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.030
do I start buying songs
and put into devices?

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.485
How do you know the
person who can't remember,

00:30:59.485 --> 00:31:02.260
are they telling you what
type of music do they like?

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260
DAN COHEN: So there are
different parts to that.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.560
So number one, in terms of the
technology and the approach,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.200
there are different
ways to do that.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.150
In terms of identifying
someone's music,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.750
if they're unable to
communicate with you,

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.880
now we have a challenge.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.090
Right?

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.310
So we'll go to their families
or friends, or even staff

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.620
that have seen how
they react when

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.360
different live music comes in,
and tries to build that list.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.190
And if there's no
family around to ask,

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.430
we'll have to do trial
and error and just

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.042
OK, they were born in this year.

00:31:31.042 --> 00:31:33.250
We'll give them music between
when they were 10 or 20

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.280
or whatever, and
see what sticks.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.280
What do they respond to?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.321
What do they light up to?

00:31:37.321 --> 00:31:39.279
And slowly build
the list that way.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:41.570
In India-- you raise a great
question-- many countries,

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.910
it's take care of
your family at home.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.057
But the concept is the same.

00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:48.640
And it's just a
matter of applying it.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.460
So when I speak to people from
India, it's really just again,

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.060
it's communicating through
the sort of the systems

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.870
that people will listen to.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.390
And in nursing homes, we
already have a lot of music CDs.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.710
So we use the music CDs.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.390
We follow iTunes
terms and conditions.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.720
Because it allows you to
download once and sync

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.200
to an unlimited
number of devices.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.290
Windows Media Player doesn't
have that same allowance

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.748
in writing, that
anybody's told me.

00:32:12.748 --> 00:32:15.230
So that's sort of the legal
protection for the nursing

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:21.005
homes, is that they follow that
terms and conditions of iTunes.

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.380
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
I'd just

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.390
like to add something to that.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.080
Your question, you said,
what kind of culture

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.130
puts their elders
in nursing homes?

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.080
That's a huge
question, and one that

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.462
really should be addressed.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.160
And I think we have to change
the way we find our safety,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.280
the way we live together.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.410
We're going to have to
change that if we're going

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.690
to deal with global warming.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.380
We're going to have
to do that if we

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.330
deal with the
extinction of species,

00:32:55.330 --> 00:33:01.030
which we're doing tremendous
damage to the world with.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.450
So you know, Dan's doing a
great job in nursing homes.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.170
But I'm kind of
a problem solver.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.490
And I was, like, well,
what about all the people

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.730
that live at home?

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.230
You know?

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.610
There's more people
that live at home.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.450
And I was, like, OK.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.870
How do you do that?

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.402
How do you create the
most bang for the buck?

00:33:21.402 --> 00:33:23.360
And I was like, well, if
we could get the kids,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.890
if we could get you
interested in finding

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.410
your mother or your
grandmother's music,

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.141
find your grandmother's playlist
before she gets dementia.

00:33:34.141 --> 00:33:34.640
You know?

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.260
And let's throw that online.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.690
That's what I wanted to do.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.930
And how can we
change the culture?

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:45.360
How can we change the way
people think about our elders?

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.030
Well, we have to do
that in education.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.850
So let's create a curriculum.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.600
So we started the Alive
Inside Foundation,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.240
to develop curriculum to
help young people rethink

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.130
the way they look at aging.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.670
And we have to rethink
the way we look at aging.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.060
We have to rethink the way we
connect to the natural world,

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.350
our place in it.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.040
We have to rethink our
idea of what safety is.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.719
Maybe even rethink work.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.040
I mean, we're maybe
50 years from robots

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.440
replacing manual labor,
from AI replacing-- I mean,

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.484
I heard the other day that you
guys, with that Google-- that

00:34:23.484 --> 00:34:27.590
Go program, you did something
that no one thought would

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:31.060
happen for another 10 years.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.560
Apparently they just came
out with an AI call center

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:41.210
program that will put 250
million people out of work

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.210
worldwide.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.300
So how are we going
to deal with that?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.739
We're going to have
to shift massively.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:54.300
And I personally feel that music
is like one of those things

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.290
that we can hold onto.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.830
It's one of the things.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.330
We'll argue about God.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.780
We'll argue about philosophy.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.620
But we won't argue about
the way music affects us.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.980
It's a commonality.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.060
It's deep in our
emotional system.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.780
It tells us that we're
really all the same.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.410
It's very emotional.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.400
And so you know, I'm very
interested in those questions

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.930
you raised.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.390
And they're very
great questions.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.320
Thank you for bringing that up.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.361
TONI THOMPSON: Thank you.

00:35:22.361 --> 00:35:26.010
And thank you both, for coming
to Talks at Google today.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.820
You both are men with missions.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.350
And you're going out and
doing great work in the world.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.227
And we salute you.

00:35:31.227 --> 00:35:32.810
DAN COHEN: Well,
thanks for having us.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:33.220
It was great.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:33.990
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT:
Thank you for having us.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.359
I didn't mention
aliveinside.org.

00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:37.400
TONI THOMPSON: Oh, right.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.900
MICHAEL ROSSATO-BENNETT: That's
the name of our foundation,

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.560
if anybody wants to help.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.170
We also developed a
pair of headphones

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:49.400
for people with dementia at home
that is really, really cheap.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.559
Because there are so many
poor people out there.

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.100
So we wanted to
create something that

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.580
would be really, really cheap.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:57.930
So you could give it away.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.609
TONI THOMPSON: So kind of
the DIY maker modality there.

00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:02.900
It's, like, get the headphones.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.550
Do this.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.240
You're done.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:04.810
That's great.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.434
DAN COHEN: So when
people see the film,

00:36:06.434 --> 00:36:08.740
and they want to help, so
The Alive Inside Foundation

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.410
is the filmmaker.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.860
Michael did a fantastic
job on the film.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.507
Music and Memory, the film
was about Music and Memory,

00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:17.340
and our implementation
all over the country.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.020
And we're looking for
the public to join us

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.194
at musicandmemory.org.

00:36:21.194 --> 00:36:22.360
TONI THOMPSON: That's great.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.450
Thank you so much.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.940
And thank you all for attending.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.390
