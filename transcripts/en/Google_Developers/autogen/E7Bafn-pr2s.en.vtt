web performance movement over the past
 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.379
web performance movement over the past
year is actually bruise a lot of egos in

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389
year is actually bruise a lot of egos in

they're not good enough for the problems

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819
they're not good enough for the problems
 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.640
they're not good enough for the problems
too hard that's what actually gets them

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
too hard that's what actually gets them
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.900
too hard that's what actually gets them
to move right yeah okay maybe maybe

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910
to move right yeah okay maybe maybe
 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.699
to move right yeah okay maybe maybe
maybe you got Yankees money I guess so

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709
maybe you got Yankees money I guess so
 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.590
maybe you got Yankees money I guess so
so this is this is the loop right so

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600
so this is this is the loop right so
 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.670
so this is this is the loop right so
this is what you should all be thinking

they're mine so notice though that this

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700
they're mine so notice though that this
 

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.910
they're mine so notice though that this
this image actually has a lot more data

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920
this image actually has a lot more data
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.650
this image actually has a lot more data
to it right there's a lot more edges

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660
to it right there's a lot more edges
 

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.030
to it right there's a lot more edges
there's a lot more noise to the image

there's a lot more noise to the image
 

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.530
there's a lot more noise to the image
yet it's smaller than this one here

more detail should be less size than the
 

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.810
more detail should be less size than the
one with less detail in it right what

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820
one with less detail in it right what
 

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.310

environment now I can actually figure
 

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.680
environment now I can actually figure
out what's going on with this if I stop

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:12.690
out what's going on with this if I stop
 

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.330

my recording too much information let me

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340
my recording too much information let me
 

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.950
my recording too much information let me
just do a quick record real quick so I

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960
just do a quick record real quick so I
 

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.790
just do a quick record real quick so I
can clear all that so we can see

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:19.800
can clear all that so we can see
 

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.780
can clear all that so we can see
something on the timeline here so it

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:20.790
something on the timeline here so it
 

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.580
something on the timeline here so it
looks like first off they got like two

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:22.590
looks like first off they got like two
 

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.440
looks like first off they got like two
different timers firing right so we've

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.450
different timers firing right so we've
 

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.450
different timers firing right so we've
got widgets jsin chart beat chart BTW

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:26.460

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.910
happens basically Chrome has to create
this new block of code that's parallel

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:01.920
this new block of code that's parallel
 

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.040
this new block of code that's parallel
to the block of code you had delete your

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.050
to the block of code you had delete your
 

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.080
to the block of code you had delete your
block of code put your new block of code

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.090
block of code put your new block of code
 

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:07.310
block of code put your new block of code
in the stack and have it executes when

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320
in the stack and have it executes when
 

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.050
in the stack and have it executes when
that D optimization occurs because the

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:09.060
that D optimization occurs because the
 

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.570
that D optimization occurs because the
optimization failed it has to take your

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580
optimization failed it has to take your
 

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.790
optimization failed it has to take your
old block of code put it back in and

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:13.800
old block of code put it back in and
 

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.020
old block of code put it back in and
delete the block of code that it just

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.030
delete the block of code that it just
 

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.020
delete the block of code that it just
created so there are specific code paths

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.030
created so there are specific code paths
 

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.450
created so there are specific code paths
that generally caused this to happen

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:19.460
that generally caused this to happen
 

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.820
that generally caused this to happen
closures are one of them how many of you

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:22.830
closures are one of them how many of you
 

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.400
closures are one of them how many of you
are using closures and your timers don't

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:25.410
are using closures and your timers don't
 

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.960
are using closures and your timers don't
applaud I don't I don't want you to

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:26.970
applaud I don't I don't want you to
 

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.690
applaud I don't I don't want you to
applause that okay closures are one of

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700
applause that okay closures are one of
 

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.620
applause that okay closures are one of
these things if you actually have a

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:30.630
these things if you actually have a
 

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.780
these things if you actually have a
closure running and so it's very common

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:32.790
closure running and so it's very common
 

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.670
closure running and so it's very common
for people to do set interval closure

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:34.680
for people to do set interval closure
 

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.700
for people to do set interval closure
comma 1000 right that closure

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:37.710
comma 1000 right that closure
 

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.960
comma 1000 right that closure
in that set interval is actually causing

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:38.970
in that set interval is actually causing
 

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.220
in that set interval is actually causing
these sorts of memory leaks to occur

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:40.230
these sorts of memory leaks to occur
 

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.740
these sorts of memory leaks to occur
right it's addie optimization path that

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:42.750
right it's addie optimization path that
 

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.570
right it's addie optimization path that
v8 can't optimize around and so

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580
v8 can't optimize around and so
 

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.010
v8 can't optimize around and so
basically every single time you're doing

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020
basically every single time you're doing
 

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.039
basically every single time you're doing
this you're running into this situation

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:48.049
this you're running into this situation
 

00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:49.909
this you're running into this situation
so let's take a look at something else

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919
so let's take a look at something else
 

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:51.950

hardware accelerated we had something

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.110
hardware accelerated we had something
 

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.960
hardware accelerated we had something
called software rasterization yeah

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:20.970
called software rasterization yeah
 

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.610

use a term called software rasterization

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.330

software rasterization to paint the
 

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.870
software rasterization to paint the
pixels on the screen this means that

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880
pixels on the screen this means that
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.879
pixels on the screen this means that
this is a slow path this also means that

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:46.889
this is a slow path this also means that

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:11.730
i'm not on the wireless so that's pretty
 

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.090
i'm not on the wireless so that's pretty
good 10k transferred okay that's all

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100
good 10k transferred okay that's all
 

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.640
good 10k transferred okay that's all
right 21 requests not that bad at all so

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.650
right 21 requests not that bad at all so
 

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.050
right 21 requests not that bad at all so
let's again sort by size let's see if

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.060
let's again sort by size let's see if
 

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.510
let's again sort by size let's see if
anything's coming up here got a couple

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520
anything's coming up here got a couple
 

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.130
anything's coming up here got a couple
not found that's not necessarily a good

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140
not found that's not necessarily a good
 

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.560
not found that's not necessarily a good
idea a couple images here so this is

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:27.570
idea a couple images here so this is
 

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.930
idea a couple images here so this is
interesting again another 106 k image

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940
interesting again another 106 k image
 

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.130
interesting again another 106 k image
that's being delivered to a mobile

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140
that's being delivered to a mobile
 

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.470
that's being delivered to a mobile
screen that obviously does not need 106

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480
screen that obviously does not need 106
 

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.110
screen that obviously does not need 106
k that one's a little bit better well

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120
k that one's a little bit better well
 

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.010
k that one's a little bit better well
not better I mean that's a very

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020
not better I mean that's a very
 

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.480
not better I mean that's a very
depressing image I didn't I didn't mean

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:38.490
depressing image I didn't I didn't mean
 

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:43.280
depressing image I didn't I didn't mean
that that was again my my opinions are

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.290
that that was again my my opinions are
 

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.210
that that was again my my opinions are
my own and not that of any

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220
my own and not that of any
 

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.770

organizational or secret service that
 

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.080
organizational or secret service that
I'm influenced with so we can actually

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.090
I'm influenced with so we can actually
 

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.460
I'm influenced with so we can actually
see some of these images may be a little

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:49.470
see some of these images may be a little
 

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.380
see some of these images may be a little
bit larger than others but for the most

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:51.390
bit larger than others but for the most
 

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.270
bit larger than others but for the most
part this is actually nice deported what

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:53.280
part this is actually nice deported what
 

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.430
part this is actually nice deported what
happened here did I this technology

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440
happened here did I this technology
 

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.230
happened here did I this technology
isn't it great so we can actually see

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240
isn't it great so we can actually see
 

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.570
isn't it great so we can actually see
though that this this page is actually a

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580
though that this this page is actually a
 

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.820
though that this this page is actually a
pretty good example of what to do on a

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:04.830
pretty good example of what to do on a
 

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.440
pretty good example of what to do on a
website right if you load this on the

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:06.450
website right if you load this on the
 

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:07.790
website right if you load this on the
desktop what you'll actually see is that

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:07.800
desktop what you'll actually see is that
 

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.560
desktop what you'll actually see is that
there's larger versions of these images

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:09.570
there's larger versions of these images
 

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.640
there's larger versions of these images
they're tiled differently with a

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:10.650
they're tiled differently with a
 

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.780
they're tiled differently with a
different layout there's a different

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:11.790
different layout there's a different
 

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.060
different layout there's a different
scheme but in the mobile version they

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.070
scheme but in the mobile version they
 

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.470
scheme but in the mobile version they
really only have one or two images that

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480
really only have one or two images that
 

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.109
really only have one or two images that
are probably too large for the mobile

00:28:18.109 --> 00:28:18.119
are probably too large for the mobile
 

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:19.429
are probably too large for the mobile
ice but in the most part this actually

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:19.439
ice but in the most part this actually
 

00:28:19.439 --> 00:28:22.249
ice but in the most part this actually
Scrolls pretty quickly right if I know

00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:22.259
Scrolls pretty quickly right if I know
 

00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:24.199
Scrolls pretty quickly right if I know
you can't see it up in the top here but

00:28:24.199 --> 00:28:24.209
you can't see it up in the top here but
 

00:28:24.209 --> 00:28:26.689
you can't see it up in the top here but
this is actually about three

00:28:26.689 --> 00:28:26.699
this is actually about three
 

00:28:26.699 --> 00:28:28.819
this is actually about three
milliseconds 25 milliseconds to actually

00:28:28.819 --> 00:28:28.829
milliseconds 25 milliseconds to actually
 

00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:30.139
milliseconds 25 milliseconds to actually
draw the part of the page and you can

00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:30.149
draw the part of the page and you can
 

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:31.699
draw the part of the page and you can
actually see that as I'm scrolling

00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:31.709
actually see that as I'm scrolling
 

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:34.729
actually see that as I'm scrolling
notice that there's no red tiles right

00:28:34.729 --> 00:28:34.739
notice that there's no red tiles right
 

00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:36.559
notice that there's no red tiles right
you don't see those big red flashes what

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:36.569
you don't see those big red flashes what
 

00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:38.089
you don't see those big red flashes what
that means is this entire page has

00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:38.099
that means is this entire page has
 

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:39.889
that means is this entire page has
actually been rasterize on the cpu and

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:39.899
actually been rasterize on the cpu and
 

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:41.359
actually been rasterize on the cpu and
uploaded to the GP and it's been cashed

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:41.369
uploaded to the GP and it's been cashed
 

00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:43.879
uploaded to the GP and it's been cashed
in the GPU and so as you're scrolling up

00:28:43.879 --> 00:28:43.889
in the GPU and so as you're scrolling up
 

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:45.649
in the GPU and so as you're scrolling up
and down the CPU doesn't have to do any

00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659
and down the CPU doesn't have to do any
 

00:28:45.659 --> 00:28:47.419
and down the CPU doesn't have to do any
work right so this is what you want you

but it'll actually display the font with
 

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.330
but it'll actually display the font with
a default like it'll just see Ariel so

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340
a default like it'll just see Ariel so

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.030
if you're actually seeing this on
Firefox you'll see like three seconds of

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:17.040
Firefox you'll see like three seconds of
 

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.740
Firefox you'll see like three seconds of
nothing and then you'll see Ariel and

nothing and then you'll see Ariel and
 

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.120
nothing and then you'll see Ariel and
then when the font comes in you'll see

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.130
then when the font comes in you'll see
 

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.530

you see it a lot on mobile right because
 

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.410
you see it a lot on mobile right because
these mobile devices are actually 6x

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.420
these mobile devices are actually 6x
 

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.170
these mobile devices are actually 6x

on the desktops not only is it slower to
 

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.510
on the desktops not only is it slower to
download these things but these walks

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520
download these things but these walks
 

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.520
download these things but these walks
are actually very complex spline path

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:40.530

wonky as well so let's go ahead and do a

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880
wonky as well so let's go ahead and do a
 

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.150
wonky as well so let's go ahead and do a
timeline and hit record again let's see

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160
timeline and hit record again let's see
 

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.520
timeline and hit record again let's see
what's going on we've seen this before

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:29.530
what's going on we've seen this before
 

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.890
what's going on we've seen this before
right same same pattern we saw with the

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:31.900
right same same pattern we saw with the
 

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.140

other site we see just kind of memory

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.150
other site we see just kind of memory

so like no one's cause it calling eval

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:36.590
so like no one's cause it calling eval
 

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.680
so like no one's cause it calling eval
because otherwise we probably see the 6k

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:38.690
because otherwise we probably see the 6k
 

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.570

worth of information someone laughed

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:40.580
worth of information someone laughed

worth of information someone laughed
that's probably good eval is bad and you

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:42.380
that's probably good eval is bad and you
 

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.750
that's probably good eval is bad and you
should feel bad so if you're using

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760
should feel bad so if you're using
 

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.600
should feel bad so if you're using
closures and eval just get out just just

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:46.610
closures and eval just get out just just

gonna see a tweet Colt says you set

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040
gonna see a tweet Colt says you set
 

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.920
gonna see a tweet Colt says you set
interval with closure and eval perf

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:53.930

a woof by the way I saw some of the
 

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.470
a woof by the way I saw some of the
other day that actually had a woof

00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480
other day that actually had a woof
 

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.260
other day that actually had a woof
embedded inside of a CSS and I was like

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:02.270
embedded inside of a CSS and I was like
 

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:03.430
embedded inside of a CSS and I was like
okay that's just a bad idea from all

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440
okay that's just a bad idea from all
 

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.510
okay that's just a bad idea from all
principals right like so you have the

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520
principals right like so you have the
 

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.280
principals right like so you have the
CSS gets bloated and then the wop has to

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.290
CSS gets bloated and then the wop has to

be in anyhow we see this other part is

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:09.410
be in anyhow we see this other part is
 

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.380
be in anyhow we see this other part is
an array now this is this is interesting

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:11.390
an array now this is this is interesting
 

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.760
an array now this is this is interesting
so when you see this array object this

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:12.770
so when you see this array object this
 

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.560
so when you see this array object this
means this is an actual JavaScript array

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:14.570
means this is an actual JavaScript array
 

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:15.730
means this is an actual JavaScript array
that is allocated somewhere on the page

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:15.740
that is allocated somewhere on the page
 

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.290
that is allocated somewhere on the page
and you can see some of it is coming

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:17.300
and you can see some of it is coming
 

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.270
and you can see some of it is coming
from internal with v8 write the code

is actually what's causing the memory

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400
is actually what's causing the memory

spike here and then of course that's

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:05.420
spike here and then of course that's
 

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.570

that's causing inflation in our heap so

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:07.580
that's causing inflation in our heap so
 

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.350
that's causing inflation in our heap so
we can actually see there's a couple

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:08.360
we can actually see there's a couple
 

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.580
we can actually see there's a couple

me see if I can tap over there really

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900
me see if I can tap over there really

digitally pixelated ones anyhow there's

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:07.490
digitally pixelated ones anyhow there's
 

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.400

about jpeg information and it actually

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960
about jpeg information and it actually
 

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.050
about jpeg information and it actually
shows that here it is right here let me

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:14.060
shows that here it is right here let me

here so yeah so these images probably
 

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.920
here so yeah so these images probably
are a little too large in

00:57:59.920 --> 00:57:59.930
are a little too large in
 

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.630

back when something occurs you know that

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.090
back when something occurs you know that
 

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.520
back when something occurs you know that
that code you can actually write in

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:09.530
that code you can actually write in
 

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.020
that code you can actually write in
about a hundred lines of your own making

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:11.030
about a hundred lines of your own making
 

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.800
about a hundred lines of your own making
and actually keep it memory performance

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:12.810
and actually keep it memory performance
 

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.210
and actually keep it memory performance
but instead we kind of pull in these

it's here so we can take a look at it
 

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.140
it's here so we can take a look at it
from a performance perspective basically

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:48.150
from a performance perspective basically
 

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:51.530
from a performance perspective basically
what happens is someone will record and

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540

square up here just the play button just

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:13.750
square up here just the play button just

needs jquery and bootstrap to jquery's
 

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.400
needs jquery and bootstrap to jquery's
in bootstrap and is allocating like a

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:23.410
in bootstrap and is allocating like a
 

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:27.810
in bootstrap and is allocating like a
meg of memory over like seven seconds so

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:27.820
meg of memory over like seven seconds so
 

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.210
meg of memory over like seven seconds so
that's a thing lots of rasterize is

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:30.220
that's a thing lots of rasterize is
 

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.310
that's a thing lots of rasterize is
occurring in here lots of recalculates

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:32.320
occurring in here lots of recalculates
 

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.350
occurring in here lots of recalculates
so not only is it repainting it's

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:34.360
so not only is it repainting it's
 

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.850
so not only is it repainting it's
actually retrain it's like updating the

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:35.860
actually retrain it's like updating the
 

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.250
actually retrain it's like updating the
Dom to repaint let's look at this again

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:38.260
Dom to repaint let's look at this again
 

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.850
Dom to repaint let's look at this again
that's updating the Dom don't know why

01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:41.860
that's updating the Dom don't know why
 

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.620
that's updating the Dom don't know why
maybe there's a cool jitter effect there

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:43.630
maybe there's a cool jitter effect there
 

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.760
maybe there's a cool jitter effect there
like maybe you know maybe I got this

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:44.770
like maybe you know maybe I got this
 

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:45.810
like maybe you know maybe I got this
wrong maybe this is like a I'm actually

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:45.820
wrong maybe this is like a I'm actually
 

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.220
wrong maybe this is like a I'm actually
looking at the matrix am I looking at

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:47.230
looking at the matrix am I looking at
 

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:48.990
looking at the matrix am I looking at
the matrix that would be kind of cool if

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000
the matrix that would be kind of cool if
 

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.090
the matrix that would be kind of cool if
I'm like analyte in this sorry I'm

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:51.100

trend like you're actually allocating

01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:58.180
trend like you're actually allocating
 

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.700
trend like you're actually allocating
more memory faster than the other

01:04:59.700 --> 01:04:59.710
more memory faster than the other
 

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:01.080

in so let's go to profiles again follow

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:04.840
in so let's go to profiles again follow
 

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.300
in so let's go to profiles again follow
the memory find the performance problems

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:06.310
the memory find the performance problems
 

01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:07.770
the memory find the performance problems
right so we followed the asset memory to

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:07.780
right so we followed the asset memory to
 

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.270
right so we followed the asset memory to
