KENT WALKER: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.050
I'm Kent Walker.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.720
I just wanted to
briefly introduce

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.710
Phil Howard, who's here with
us to talk about his new book,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.010
"The Rule of Nobody."

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.375
This is a topic that's of lots
of concern to people at Google.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.980
Trying to take a look at
government regulations, how

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.660
they've evolved over the years.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.480
Even as we try and
move forward with a lot

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.840
of cutting-edge technology,
ranging from the internet kinds

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.410
of tools to driverless cars and
genetics and everything else,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.480
we're keenly aware
of the challenges

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.920
in dealing with
existing laws and trying

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.270
to move those laws
forward in a positive way.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.620
Just yesterday, we got a
ruling from the European Court

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.800
of Justice, interpreting a
large body of European law

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.410
in ways that are
somewhat challenging

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.540
for the good function
of the internet.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.630
So Phil has been working
on this topic for years.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.830
He's written multiple
books in the area.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.487
It's an interesting area.

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:53.570
There's a confluence of
people on the left, people

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.605
on the right, who are
concerned about the state

00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:59.310
that we found ourselves
in almost inadvertently

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.100
as a result of the growth
of regulations, many of them

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.140
well intended, but not
working out the way

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.519
that we would all like to.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.690
So with that, let me
turn it over to Phil.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.475
He's going to be
here for the hour,

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:11.430
and I think has a couple
books here as well.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.320
So if people are
interested, I would

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.990
encourage you to have an
active Q and A back and forth,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.750
even though I won't be able
to stay for the whole session.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.249
Phil?

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.900
PHILIP HOWARD: Great.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.633
Thank you, Kent.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.450
And thanks for coming.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
I had this insight, really
a brilliant insight,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.080
shared by 98% of Americans,
that the government

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.810
wasn't working very well.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
And so I set out in this
book, "The Rule of Nobody,"

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.480
to try to understand what
structure would enable

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.840
government to work better again.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.830
And what I concluded
is that we are actually

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.490
at a troubling place in the
history of our aging democracy.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.600
And what's happened
is that we're

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.830
unable to make choices, even
the most obvious choices.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.000
Democracy's has
lost the capacity

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.310
to choose, make choices, move
forward, adapt, and keep going.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.270
And I also concluded that the
problem is not bad leadership,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.680
although leadership
has not been great.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.580
Nor is the problem mainly
polarized politics.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180
I actually think the
polarization of politics, which

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.830
is horrible, in
Washington is mainly

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.750
a symptom of
powerlessness rather than

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.520
the cause of this
paralysis that we see.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.560
That when people feel that
they don't have the power

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.130
to make choices, what's left is
to point fingers at each other.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.016
And they become
ever more strident

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.890
because they know nothing
is going to happen.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.550
They can propose the
most idiotic ideas

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.220
with full confidence.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.480
But again, nothing will
happen in our democracy.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.400
What's happened is we have
a structural problem, which

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.940
is that the law has piled
up decade after decade,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.560
usually for very good
reasons, but nobody ever

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.760
goes back to clean it out
or make sure it's working.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.610
And so like sediment
in the harbor,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.650
it's gotten to the point
where people in government

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.340
can't actually do even what
they think they should do.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.025
So just a few stories.

00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:23.340
A couple of years ago,
a tree fell in the creek

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.540
in Franklin
Township, New Jersey.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.460
It caused flooding.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.930
The town fathers sent in
a backhoe to pull it out.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.414
Then the lawyer
for the town said

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:33.830
no, you can't do
that because it's

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.350
a class C1 creek,
whatever that is.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.610
And you're going to
have to get approval

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.740
to remove any natural obstacle
from a class C1 creek.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.490
So they had to go start
filling out forms.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.448
SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.950
PHILIP HOWARD: OK.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.810
So I just keep going?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.390
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, keep going.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.940
PHILIP HOWARD: Yeah, OK.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.439
Great.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:58.079
So 12 days and over $12,000
in legal fees later,

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.370
they were able to get permission
to do what was obvious

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.010
and pull the tree
out of the creek.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.750
Now, that's just an incident.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.420
An anecdote.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.120
Anecdotes don't prove anything.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.280
In February, the White House
issued a five year report

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.720
on the 2009 stimulus plan
which, as you will recall,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.890
involved $800 billion--
that's almost $3,000

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.089
for every man, woman, and
child in America-- to stimulate

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.110
the economy.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.340
And the bell cow
of this program was

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.939
to rebuild America's decrepit
infrastructure, which

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:28.980
really needs rebuildling.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.100
We have 100-year-old
sewage lines.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.830
Bridges-- one out
of nine bridges

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.880
in danger of falling down.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.840
So we had bipartisan support.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.150
We spent $800 billion.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.620
Five years later, the report.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.300
I was curious to
see how much of it

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.820
was spent to rebuild
infrastructure.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.610
And then buried in
the back of the chart

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.620
was this number-- barely
3% of the $800 billion

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.880
was spent to rebuild
transportation infrastructure.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.930
You say, well,
how could that be?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.701
Why so little?

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:01.200
Well, it turned out that the
president of the United States,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.090
duly elected by the
majority of Americans,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.060
with bipartisan support
for this program,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.230
did not have the
authority to approve even

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.340
the most obvious
rebuilding project.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.600
We're not talking about
roads through virgin forest.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.540
We're talking about
just fixing up

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.010
old roads and highways and such.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.210
The density of regulation
today cannot be overestimated.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.740
I tell the story
at the beginning

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.010
of the book of
the Bayonne Bridge

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.820
was needed to be
either torn down

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.880
or something happened
to let [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.102
ships come into Newark Harbor.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:38.210
The roadway was 70 feet too low.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.550
A lifetime government employee
had the idea, a brilliant idea,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.090
of actually just
raising the roadway

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.590
of this existing
80-year-old bridge.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.750
It turned out structurally,
you could do that.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.754
Save $3 billion.

00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:53.780
Use the same foundation,
same right of way.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.150
No environmental impact.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.750
Four years later, they
got their approval.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.670
And then the litigation started
over whether there was adequate

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.060
review in the 5,000-page
environmental review statement

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.700
for a project with no
environmental impact.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.250
And you say, what could
they have studied?

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.080
Well, the law requires
them to send notices

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.050
to all the Native American
tribes that might have once

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.087
had contact with this
area of New Jersey.

00:06:23.087 --> 00:06:25.170
So they're sending letters
to the Shawnee Indians,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.200
and Nebraska, and
such, and ask if they

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.100
want to participate
in the process.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.780
Another requirement
was they had to do

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.360
a study of all
historic buildings

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.420
within a 2 mile radius of
either side of the bridge,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.250
even though in this case,
the project would not

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.594
touch any buildings.

00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:42.760
Using the same right of way.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.540
Same [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.140
And so on and on and on.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.096
And that's the way
law works today.

00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:50.696
These requirements just
piled up decade after decade.

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:52.320
It's not just getting
approvals either.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.800
The most fundamental
choices of democracy,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.730
like how we spend our money, is
all preset in legal concrete.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.025
60% of federal revenue goes
to three very important

00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:07.420
entitlement programs
that we can't

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.326
afford in their current form.

00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:11.450
They don't even come to
Congress for authorization.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.220
Andrew Cuomo, when he
became governor-- New York,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.040
like most states, had
budgetary problems--

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.550
discovered that there was a
juvenile detention facility

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.450
upstate with no juveniles in it.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.830
It cost $50 million
a year to operate.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.640
He had a public
announcement, we're

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.170
going to save the taxpayers
of New York $50 million

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.940
by closing down this facility.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.160
Not so fast.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.530
There's a law in New York
that says you can't close down

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.990
a public facility with any
union employees without at least

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.190
one year's notice.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.260
So we had to spend
another $15 million--

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.495
that's 10,000 taxpayers
each paying $5,000 a year

00:07:49.495 --> 00:07:53.430
in taxes-- to pay
for a facility that

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.000
had served the public
good not at all.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.630
And it's not just government
that's paralyzed by this.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.630
Society is.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.290
Technology companies have not
suffered as much from this

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.630
because you're in
a new industry.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.040
You're beginning
to see it happen

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.640
in privacy and lots
of other areas,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.370
like the ruling
yesterday from the EU.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.980
But other.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.712
The most rudimentary,
starting a restaurant.

00:08:22.712 --> 00:08:24.795
Opening a restaurant in
New York requires approval

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.100
from 11 different agencies.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.910
In the US today, and in recent
rankings by the International

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.182
Monetary Fund, US
ranks 20th in the world

00:08:34.182 --> 00:08:37.360
in ease of starting a business.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.230
This is United
States of America.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.600
20th in the world.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.309
And it's just because
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.540
licensing laws, regulations.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.010
The Bayonne Bridge
project I mentioned

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:52.770
required 47 permits from
19 different agencies

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.200
to get permission to raise
a roadway of a project that

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.360
had enormous environmental
benefit and economic benefit

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.140
to the region.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.640
And finally, this rule-based,
the [INAUDIBLE] of law,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.100
is changing the culture.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.320
Couple of months ago,
after I was in galleys,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.030
a long time District of
Columbia parks employee

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.280
was walking with his daughter.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.030
He had a heart attack in
front of a fire station in DC.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.290
The firemen where watching.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.390
They're standing there.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.866
They're first responders.

00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:26.490
The daughter ran over and said,
my father's gasping for breath.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.540
I think he had a heart attack.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.380
Can you come help?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.370
And they said, no.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.820
The proper rule is to call 911.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.454
And she said, but he's
gasping for breath.

00:09:36.454 --> 00:09:37.620
No, the rule is to call 911.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.660
They called 911.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.370
They watched.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.320
By the time the ambulance
arrived, he was dead.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.460
This is not an unusual story.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.450
A couple of years ago
in Alameda County here,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.710
a mother called
the fire department

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.390
and said her son was off his
meds, was very depressed,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.022
was going to commit suicide.

00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:02.480
Said he was going
to commit suicide

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.190
by going to a certain
beach and just

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.240
swimming out until he drowned.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.550
So sure enough, the firemen
show up on the beach.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.620
And here's this guy treading
water 100 yards offshore.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.120
And they stand there and watch.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.320
And the crowd
gathers on the beach.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.770
Said, why don't you go help him?

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.540
And they say, well,
because of budget cuts,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.580
we haven't been recertified
for land-based rescue.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.600
Finally one bystander dives
in the water, cold water.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.960
Goes in, tries to save him.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.880
Gets here too late.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.680
Brings in the body.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.965
This hit the newspapers.

00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:44.240
The next day, the fire chief
was asked, what would you

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.800
have done if that
was a child drowning?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.030
And he said, well, I know what
I would do if I was off duty.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:57.330
But if I was on duty, I'd
have to follow the rules.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.360
So think about this
society we built,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.730
where the president
of the United States

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.890
can't approve the most
obvious and needed projects

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.365
for our society.

00:11:09.365 --> 00:11:13.060
And so they end up wasting most
of the $800 billion to shore up

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.705
insolvent state debt
budgets, basically.

00:11:16.705 --> 00:11:18.080
Not rebuilding
the infrastructure

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.580
that desperately
needs to get rebuilt.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.920
And you have firemen
not saving lives

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.260
because the rules
don't let them do it.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.550
So is this how democracy's
supposed to work.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.520
And I said to him, no.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.540
Is that how the rule of
law's supposed to work?

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.720
I don't think so.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.070
Rule of law's supposed to
support a free society,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.610
not remove our freedom
to make sense of things.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.285
In the 1930s, Harry
Hopkins-- there

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.860
was a law past to
stimulate the economy.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.170
There was the Civilian
Works Administration.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.250
It was passed in November.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.640
By the end of December,
Harry Hopkins who ran it,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.370
had hired 2.6 million people
in less than seven weeks.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.250
It's not like this
is rocket science.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.080
People have to be able
to make choices and take

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.230
responsibility.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.972
But what we've
created, this world,

00:12:10.972 --> 00:12:13.305
where in essence at this
point, because of the decretion

00:12:13.305 --> 00:12:17.390
of law, democracy's
basically run by dead people.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.432
It's run by whoever
wrote all these laws

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:21.390
and wrote all these
regulations over the years.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.140
And it piled up.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.010
And now people go to work and
they say, what do I have to do?

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.390
And they go and noses
in the rule books.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.141
And these people
who are long gone.

00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.140
We wouldn't know who they
were even if you tried

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.910
to find them are
telling us what to do.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.230
And who is responsible?

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.160
Who is responsible for the
fact that we couldn't spend

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.232
the $800 billion to
rebuild the infrastructure?

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:46.690
Nobody.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.340
Who is responsible for
the budget deficit?

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.770
Nobody.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.214
Who was responsible for
any of these idiocies?

00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:54.870
Nobody.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.310
Nobody's in charge.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.040
So we have two structural flaws.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.860
One of them relates to
our aging democracy,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.940
which is we don't
have the capacity,

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.000
or even the idea--
or the capacity--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.070
to go back and adjust old laws.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.070
It's nowhere part of
our public debate.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.900
The laws get passed.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.800
The people,
legislatures, let them

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.627
set sail towards
immortality, treating them

00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:25.585
like they're the '10
commandments or something,

00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:29.000
except it's the 10 million
commandments at this point.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.420
Not understanding that
there's a big difference

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.370
between basic principles of
law, like the reasonable person

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.260
standard, or don't commit
fraud, or things like that,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.450
and these social programs,
the regulatory programs,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.750
were highly complex, that
affect human behavior, that

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.550
reflect priorities at the
time they were enacted.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.096
And all those things change.

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:51.970
And all of them have
unintended consequences.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.740
There's not one
law that's passed

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.780
that doesn't have
unintended consequences.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.490
One example.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.780
Special ed laws were
enacted in 1975.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.460
Very important.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.280
Before we had them, we
locked disabled kids up

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.000
and horrible places
like Millbrook.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.740
So we passed this
law in a certain way.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.610
It evolves, however,
over the decades,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:19.990
until now special ed consumes
over 25% of the total K to 12

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.440
budget in America.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.330
There's virtually no
money for gifted children.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.550
There's virtually no
money for early education.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.980
Is that the right balance?

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.940
No one's even
asking the question.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.610
So we have no mechanism
for going back and adapting

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.860
old law.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.040
It's a formula for failure,
just that by itself.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.700
Compounding the problem
and causing the paralysis

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.630
is that we have a deliberate
philosophy that humans

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.895
shouldn't be allowed
to make public choices.

00:14:49.895 --> 00:14:51.645
Believe it or not,
that is our philosophy.

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:54.910
And it's shared by both
the right and the left,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.830
the concept of
rationalized completeness.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.120
That whatever government
gets its hands on,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.960
it should tell people
exactly how to do things.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.400
Not just what too do.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.855
Not just have a reasonably
safe facility, or that

00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:12.940
and inspectors come by and
have discussions and arguments

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.440
or whatever.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.750
But actually telling people
exactly what kind of equipment

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.250
to use.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.420
Exactly how to do it.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.080
Nursing homes.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.800
I talk a lot about
nursing homes.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.220
Nursing homes in
most states have

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.010
typically about 1,000 rules.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.170
Food should be stored no
less that 50 centimeters

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.890
above the floor.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.010
Hot food should be served
not less than 150 degrees.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.140
Residences should be an
average of 80 square feet.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.850
There's to be 0.09
recreational workers.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.850
[INAUDIBLE] trash cans
shall be in the bathroom.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.870
Eggs shall be cooked.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.885
The level of the granular
detail of these rules is absurd.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.500
And they don't help.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.840
They hurt because
people go to work

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.020
trying to comply
with the rules, not

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.570
trying to make the
residents' lives better.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.490
People say, well, what
else could you do?

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.497
Well in fact, Australia
a couple of decades

00:15:57.497 --> 00:15:59.330
ago had the same problem
with nursing homes.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.670
They had 1,000 rules.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.600
They got rid of all the rules.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.720
They replaced them
with 31 principles.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.010
Have a home-like setting.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.370
Respect the dignity
of the residents.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.370
All the experts scoffed.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.934
And they said, these
nursing home operators

00:16:11.934 --> 00:16:13.350
are going to get
away with murder.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.170
It's horrible.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.680
Within the year, the nursing
homes were all twice as good.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.430
So the experts went and
studied why is that.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.390
Because people actually went
to work asking the question,

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.610
what's the right thing to do?

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.370
Regulators didn't give
up their authority.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.755
They could still close down a
place if it was abusive or not.

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:36.630
And you could still have
arguments and courts

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.040
could resolve them if
you had an argument.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.760
But now the argument was over
what's right and what's wrong.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.470
Not the parsing of legal
language and a 1,000 rules.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.080
So one of the horrors of
modern detailed regulation

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.790
is it divorces regulation
from right and wrong.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.960
The Constitution
was 10 pages long.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.120
The Volcker Rule
implementing one little part

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.890
of the Dodd-Frank
financial regulation law

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.030
to regulate proprietary
trading by banks--

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.665
the Volcker Rule
is 980 pages long.

00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:12.290
Do you think they're going to be
talking about right and wrong?

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.650
No.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.099
Hundreds of lawyers
in the banks.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.630
Hundreds of lawyers at the
Department of the Treasury.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.200
And they're going to be arguing
over legal parsing of language.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.310
But doesn't it mean this?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.400
Wouldn't in this situation
it really be a hedge?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.859
What does the word hedge mean.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:35.515
It's just there is no set of
words that avoids ambiguity.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.940
And by trying to create
a legal system that

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.200
avoids ambiguity because
we don't want anybody

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200
to make a mistake,
what we've done

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.780
is instead driven people into
this world in which everyone

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.870
acts like idiot savants.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.786
Nobody's talking about
what's right and wrong.

00:17:53.786 --> 00:17:56.260
No one's taking
responsibility to do

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.150
rather on the public
side or the other side.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.100
So we have this
structural problem.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.130
And I don't think
we can repair it.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.600
You can't send
some brilliant guy

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.960
like [INAUDIBLE] in the
White House and say,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.550
let's have different motivations
in this area of the law.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.669
It's like going into the
Amazon jungle with some shears.

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:19.960
The law at this point, there
are over 100 million words

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.615
of binding federal
law and regulation,

00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:23.700
and growing every year.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.720
Over 2 billion words if
you combine all the state

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.630
regulation with it.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.140
No one knows it all.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.960
No one in a school knows all
the rules that apply to schools.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.367
So you can't actually
go in and edit it.

00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:40.450
You need a new philosophy.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.330
And I think the
philosophy should

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.530
be one based on
human responsibility

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.890
and accountability.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.410
Should be generally
principles-based

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.587
for human behavior.

00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:50.105
You still have
speed limit that can

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:53.510
be detailed or effluent
limits for a solution.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:19:01.416
But in many areas of
government oversight,

00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:03.230
they should always
leave from judgement.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.897
Always room for the question.

00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:05.980
So what are the solutions?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.210
One solution is to
do a spring cleaning.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.190
It's happened periodically
through history.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.840
It's called a recodification.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.360
We did it in the 1950s
with commercial law.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.830
Something called the
Uniform Commercial Code

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.730
was put together by
a group of experts

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:28.010
to replace this madcap will to
inconsistent, complicated state

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.060
contract laws in the
48 states at the time.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.990
And it was the foundation for
the postwar economic boom.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.300
Everybody knew where they
stood with contract law.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.700
The set of principles
that people could study.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.670
It could be
interpreted by courts.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.631
It was like replacing a muddy
road with a paved highway.

00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:55.660
If you go in and recodify law
that's built up over the ages,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.930
it always has that effect.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.100
It had that affect in Germany
at the end of the 19th century.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.400
It had that effect when
Napoleon recodified the law

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.100
and created the Napoleonic
Code, which is now

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.830
the basis for half the
civilized world's law.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.490
Fantastic achievement in
the early 19th century.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.250
It happened in ancient
times with Justinian.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:21.190
We can't fix this problem
without doing that.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.530
And the second
thing we have to do

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.370
is we have to radically simplify
doing [INAUDIBLE] the law

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.580
and turn it.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.800
And understand that law's
supposed to be a corral.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.620
It sets goals, principles.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.330
Sometimes it has rules.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.670
But within the corral,
humans, both the regulator

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.330
and the regulated,
always need to have

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.670
room to ask the question,
how do we make sense of this?

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.120
How do we make something work?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.704
It shouldn't be an
instruction manual.

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:49.744
It should be the opposite
of instruction manuals.

00:20:49.744 --> 00:20:52.090
It should be something where
people take responsibility

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.548
and are accountable
when they fail.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.870
We need, going
forward, sunset laws

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.832
because the founders
made a mistake.

00:20:59.832 --> 00:21:02.290
They didn't realize it would
be 100 times harder to get rid

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.660
of a law than to pass it.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.619
As soon as a law's
enacted, it's surrounded

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:06.910
by an army of special interest.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.965
All of Washington is dedicated,
all of that machinery

00:21:09.965 --> 00:21:12.900
is dedicated to the status quo.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.180
That's their job.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.270
Just have nothing change.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.730
So is any of this feasible?

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.640
Why are we even
talking about this?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.240
Congress can barely
raise the debt ceiling

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.820
to avoid a default
on the national debt.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.710
Why are we talking
about these big ideas?

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.180
Well, the answer is
nothing's feasible.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.280
But what the political
scientists say,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.410
it's precisely in these periods
that pretty soon, everything

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.770
is going to be possible.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.560
Pressures build up over decades.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.840
This is the path of history.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.720
Change never happens
with small ball.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.200
It always happens in big gulps.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.070
The change, the
pressures build up.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.970
And then like the stick-slip
phenomenon of earthquakes,

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.340
something happens.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.890
Some street vendor
self-immolates in Tunisa

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.692
and it sets off some revolution.

00:21:59.692 --> 00:22:02.440
The Arab Spring, in that case.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.500
So we're going to have--
and in fact, we're overdue.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.500
This has happened in American
history usually every 30 years.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.612
It happened in the 1960s.

00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:12.770
We changed our values.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.130
Completely changed
our legal structure

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.620
to address problems that
we'd been ignoring for years.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.850
It happened in the 1930s
with social safety nets.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.370
It happened in the
progressive era,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.440
when we got rid of laissez-faire
and finally started

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.720
regulating rapacious companies
that were destroying children

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.850
in their factories.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.280
It happened in the Civil War
in getting rid of slavery,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.230
but that followed decades
of work by the abolitionists

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.935
before Lincoln led the change.

00:22:40.935 --> 00:22:43.780
It happened with
Jacksonian democracy.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.420
So we're going to have change.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.912
But change is not always good.

00:22:47.912 --> 00:22:50.370
It can happen like the Arab
Spring or the French Revolution

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.890
or something.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.920
So what I'm trying
to do with this book

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.730
is argue that we have a problem.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.702
We have problems not
just with policy,

00:23:01.702 --> 00:23:03.910
when are we going to deal
with climate change, things

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.067
like that.

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:06.900
We have a problem with
institutional design.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.412
We have a democracy
that can't make choices,

00:23:12.412 --> 00:23:14.370
either at the smallest
level, removing the tree

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.090
from the creek, or
at the biggest level,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.340
to balancing the budget
and changing priorities.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.280
And we're not even
having a debate

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.220
about how to create the
institutional design.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.210
Instead, reform
groups, I believe,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.930
are canceling each other out.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.580
Climate change, budget hawks.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.500
All these people, they're
just competing for airtime.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.870
And I have a piece coming
out in the "Washington Post"

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.380
this week [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.970
What's needed is
a master coalition

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.490
of people concerned about the
paralysis of our government

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.330
coming together, talking
about this meta-problem, which

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.250
is how do we make choices again.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:57.310
And it's going to require a kind
of decade-long spring cleaning

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.020
to do this.

00:24:02.352 --> 00:24:03.810
Nothing in the
history of the world

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.162
has ever happened because
somebody followed a rule.

00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:09.663
It's just nothing
gets accomplished.

00:24:09.663 --> 00:24:12.120
[INAUDIBLE] get accomplished
because people followed rules.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.670
Nothing does.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.045
Nothing happens
in your household

00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:15.860
because you follow a rule.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.860
Things happen because
people take responsibility

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.350
to make them happen.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.420
Rules are really important
in a free society

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.130
to make people feel comfortable.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:28.210
Provide a framework for
common choices and such.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.050
But we can't create
a legal system

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.790
that's devoid of
human hands, that

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.630
avoids the possibility,
indeed, the inevitability,

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.710
of human error.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.770
And we have to mechanisms
to deal with that.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:48.250
But we can never move forward
until we can make new choices.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.990
Our government is
not going anywhere.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.580
Washington's not
going to fix it.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.030
It's broken.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.354
Every American knows it.

00:24:56.354 --> 00:24:58.520
And the only way it's going
to get fixed, I believe,

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.170
is if Americans get together,
leaders of business, leaders

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.600
of not-for-profits, citizens
get together and force

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.200
the change on them.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.810
Because it's become
anti-human and it's

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.930
become disconnected
from everyone.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.000
And whose fault is it?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.420
Nobody's.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.390
Thanks very much.

00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:27.690
SPEAKER 3: There's some
time for some questions

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.097
if you all may have any.

00:25:30.097 --> 00:25:32.271
Yeah?

00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:32.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:37.356 --> 00:25:38.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.620
Thanks a lot for your talk.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.917
I think you're really making
some excellent points.

00:25:44.917 --> 00:25:47.000
But it seems like you're
fighting a lot of things.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.470
Every time there's a
hurricane, the first thing

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.005
the CNN cameras are asking
is, well, why wasn't there

00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:55.930
a government law to prevent
X, Y, and Z. We recently

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.670
lost the Malaysian airplane,
and we're asking, well,

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.860
why didn't we have X,
Y, and Z communications?

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.570
So it seems that our reaction in
24 hour news and a whole bunch

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.490
of other things are
fighting against this.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.880
That's one question I have.

00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:13.900
So if we want to get moving
on this, how do we get moving?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.691
What are the steps?

00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:17.435
What's happened
previously in history?

00:26:17.435 --> 00:26:18.560
How do we crack through it?

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.090
Because I think you're right on.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.430
This is causing all
kinds of problems,

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.680
from people in their house being
able to make reasonable choices

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.489
with their family to all the
way companies, government,

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:31.530
lots of different things.

00:26:37.402 --> 00:26:39.360
PHILIP HOWARD: We have
to change the narrative.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.550
There needs to be a new way.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:44.160
So one of the things I'm
trying to talk to people about

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.286
is a marketing plan.

00:26:45.286 --> 00:26:46.410
Literally a marketing plan.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.120
Just like marketing
anything else.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.270
You have a plan that you have
people who carry the message.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.460
They can be-- Jeb
Bush endorsed my book.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.837
rousing endorsement last week.

00:26:57.837 --> 00:26:59.670
Bill Bradley I think
is going to endorse it.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.050
People from both
parties begin to do it.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.370
You use that as a leader.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.490
Maybe we can get
some movie stars.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.510
And then you start sending
out direct mail or Google

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.950
equivalent of direct
mail, and start

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:17.500
selling the idea that we
need fundamental change.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.030
That we need to get together
to force Washington to act.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.850
The hardest thing
in history is when

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.930
a society gets to be too rich.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.770
And people think that
Washington, the government's

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.870
over there.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.410
I have a nice life.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.520
Somebody else will
solve the problem.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.980
That isn't happening.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.665
And the Tea Party, in a sense,
is kind of constructive.

00:27:50.665 --> 00:27:51.915
They have the wrong solutions.

00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:55.260
They're right the
government's broken.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.420
But there is that sense, that
kind of popular sense, that we

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.610
need to come together to make
it work again-- is essential.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.220
We just need to have a
better idea about how

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.961
to fix it and restore
responsibility

00:28:10.961 --> 00:28:13.210
rather than in their case,
just blow it up and do away

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.510
with government.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.890
AUDIENCE: And I
guess the examples

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.252
that you gave in the beginning
are illustrative of that.

00:28:20.252 --> 00:28:21.710
And it's a way that
we can actually

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.470
use media and other things
to turn this problem around.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.220
Whenever there's a case of
someone drowning because

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.180
of some regulation, this
should be what's on the news

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.857
rather than making more
laws about other things.

00:28:33.857 --> 00:28:34.690
PHILIP HOWARD: Yeah.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.905
So just on that point,
every time there's a crisis,

00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:40.650
there will be a natural instinct
to say, why isn't there a law?

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.070
And they'll pass a law.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.490
And often that's very
hard to overcome.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.970
It's just overwhelming.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.720
That's just going to
be the first reaction

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.440
of any legislator.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.150
So what's needed
more than getting

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.160
rid of that, which is probably
hard to do in all cases,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.330
is a year later, the
process by which you then

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.620
take away the law.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.760
And you say it's not working
or it's counterproductive.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.404
Again, we don't have
that discussion.

00:29:09.404 --> 00:29:11.310
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.330
So you mentioned earlier
that tech is just

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.660
now starting to feel the pain.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.430
So one example was as you
know, Google sent five people

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.390
to go help fix the
healthcare.gov website.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.120
And I feel like anyone who's
ever worked with government

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.830
contracts know there's this
huge pile of paperwork that

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.960
let's the government decide
how to pick contracts.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.180
And it's very bloated.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.320
And I think healthcare.gov
had 20 different vendors that

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.760
were hired just to
build one website.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.560
Have you done any
work with that space

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.430
as far as reform or less rules
on who the government can

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.690
hire to build something
like a website?

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.330
That's been done multiple
times in the Bay Area.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.290
PHILIP HOWARD: They're
called procurement laws.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.655
And I was an adviser to
Al Gore and Bill Clinton

00:30:00.655 --> 00:30:04.880
in redoing the procurement laws
and the reinventing government

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.560
campaign of 20 years ago.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.760
So I worked very closely.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.436
I gave speeches, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.960
And they made a
few improvements,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.820
including, for
example, not having

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.790
to go through those
idiotic processes

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.070
when you want to go
buy a pad of paper.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.810
So they gave public employees
credit cards [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.170
go buy office supplies.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.550
A minor reform.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.650
But believe it or not,
that was a reform.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.477
But they haven't fixed
it for big procurement.

00:30:37.477 --> 00:30:40.070
Things like healthcare.gov
and so forth.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.840
The government spends--
I forget the numbers--

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.780
it's over $500 billion a year
in outside government contracts.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.370
Best estimates are they waste
between 30% and 40% of it

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.780
through these procedures
that basically

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.910
try to prescribed in advance how
the-- so they literally specify

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.420
in advance how you're going
to create the website instead

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.680
of letting smart engineers get
in a room, and work through

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.190
and adapt to all the problems.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.020
It's a form of mental illness
to think that you can actually

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.310
accomplish anything
by writing in advance

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.457
and then saying just go do it.

00:31:22.457 --> 00:31:24.540
I happened to be on the
plane last night out there

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.690
with the head of a
division of Boeing.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:33.370
And we were discussing the
problems of procurement

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.075
and why it's so hard to get
good products at a good price

00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:38.950
through this process.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.770
I have another friend,
a high school classmate,

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.269
who's the deputy
head of procurement

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:44.040
at the Department of Defense.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.190
He gives speeches to hundreds
of procurement officials,

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.350
saying, please
use your judgment.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.220
Please be flexible.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.540
But you have this whole culture
of nobody using their judgment.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.860
That area truly needs
to get replaced.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.270
It needs to get replaced by
a system where you identify

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.270
an official, that works
underneath him, that

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.480
is in charge of letting the
contract because no one's going

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.030
to trust him.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.865
You maybe have an industry
committee of people [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:19.420
industries who have the
authority to review and reverse

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.180
contracts, something like that.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.130
And it would happen in
the third of the time

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.890
and save all that money.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.594
It's broken.

00:32:28.594 --> 00:32:30.802
There's not one government
program that isn't broken.

00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:33.030
Let's go there.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:37.675
The question's whether
it's broken 25% or 95%.

00:32:37.675 --> 00:32:42.115
That one's broken about 65%.

00:32:42.115 --> 00:32:43.597
Yes?

00:32:43.597 --> 00:32:45.680
AUDIENCE: For every rule
I think that's out there,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.100
if there isn't sort of a
vested minority interest

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.516
that's keeping it alive, even
though it should be extinct,

00:32:50.516 --> 00:32:53.060
there might have been a
transgression at some point.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.323
So for example, where
in the nursing homes,

00:32:55.323 --> 00:32:58.684
you have to cook the eggs or the
food has to be above 35 inches,

00:32:58.684 --> 00:33:00.850
I imagine at some point,
someone did something wrong

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.580
and it turned into a lawsuit.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.330
So I'm wondering to what extent
there has to be tort reform

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.060
or the law needs to
change so that it's not

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.760
such a lawyer, sue-happy
culture and so [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.160
PHILIP HOWARD: That's really,
really important point.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.660
There's a general
instinct by people

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.823
to avoid responsibility
in general.

00:33:18.823 --> 00:33:20.906
So if they have an excuse
to avoid responsibility,

00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:22.370
they will.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.843
It's like people
in Plato's cave.

00:33:24.843 --> 00:33:27.301
As long as you feed us, we're
happy to be down in the cave.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.560
The fear of litigation.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.910
What the fire chief in
Alameda County said,

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.380
[INAUDIBLE], I can't
go in the ocean.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.640
There might be liability.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.570
Liability to who?

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.709
For saving a life?

00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:46.250
You think about it
for one nanosecond

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.560
and you think, well, that's
the dumbest thing you've ever.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.010
But he said it.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.880
So there is this kind
of abstract fear,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.410
which I have
written a lot about.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.470
The problem with the system of
civil justice in this country

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.580
isn't that juries are
so stupid or whatever.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.070
It's that now waves
of defensiveness

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.949
have overcome all of society.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.110
Teachers will no longer put
an arm around a crying child.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.300
My law firm has a
rule, as every business

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.520
does-- I think Google
does too-- that you're not

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.874
allowed to give a job reference.

00:34:20.874 --> 00:34:22.364
It's so stupid.

00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:24.030
This is the land of
the First Amendment.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.120
You're not allowed to
give a job reference?

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.530
You get scared
you might get sued

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.520
if you say some
qualifying fact that's

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.120
honest about an employee?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.130
So yes, we do.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.794
And I talk about
this in the book.

00:34:38.794 --> 00:34:40.530
At the end of the
book, I have a bill

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.384
of responsibilities
that basically clarifies

00:34:44.384 --> 00:34:48.790
the responsibilities
of different branches

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:49.840
of government.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.929
And with courts, I say
that basically no lawsuit

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.110
should be allowed to
go forward until judge

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:00.550
has made a legal ruling about
whether the claims should be

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.470
allowed to go forward
and won't undermine

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.079
the freedoms of other
people in the society.

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:07.370
Because now we have this kind
of laissez-faire attitude

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.470
of justice.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.110
Well, you've got a right to sue.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.470
People say that.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.360
Suing is not an act of freedom.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.995
Suing is an act of state power.

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:19.080
Sue somebody, you win,
you take away their home.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.937
The sheriff comes and
takes away their home.

00:35:20.937 --> 00:35:23.145
We have, again, it's like
another one of these things

00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:27.220
where we've inverted
the role of law.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.600
So the whole point of lawsuits
is that they're lawsuits.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.200
Not like sue for
anything, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.854
So yeah, it's a really important
reform to go on [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:51.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.497
Thanks a lot for your talk. .

00:35:52.497 --> 00:35:54.080
I'm wondering how
much of this problem

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.730
is the result of the
violation of the principle

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.400
of subsidiarity, where
decisions and things ought

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.160
to be made at the
lowest possible level.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.289
And the higher levels, like
the federal government,

00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:06.080
is getting involved in
things at the states

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.760
ought to be handling.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.050
And the states are
getting involved in things

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.362
that the local government
ought to be handling.

00:36:10.362 --> 00:36:12.070
PHILIP HOWARD: Really
important question.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.280
So there's a doctrine
that originated

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.129
I think in the Catholic church
that responsibility should

00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:19.920
be pushed down to the
lowest possible level

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.720
so that people on the
ground owned their choices.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.350
And since they own
their community,

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.080
they own their schools
and such, rather

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.935
than having top-down
bureaucracies rule

00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:34.320
to the ultimate centralization,
where in this case,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.520
dead people tell you what
to do because they wrote

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.745
a rule 30 years ago [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:40.745 --> 00:36:43.240
And I talk about
subsidiarity in the book.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.960
So one of the solutions
here while you're

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.960
doing the spring cleaning is to
the greatest extent possible,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.554
push down decisions
to a local level.

00:36:54.554 --> 00:36:56.220
That doesn't mean you
give up oversight.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.636
It doesn't mean people can do
whatever they want and teach

00:36:58.636 --> 00:37:03.960
creationism or whatever people
fear they're going to do.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.740
But the regulations
should be much lighter.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.050
Right now, you have
regulation, a rule of law.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.909
This big iron claw comes
down into everybody's lives,

00:37:13.909 --> 00:37:15.700
in their schools, and
in their communities.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.500
You need to lift up
that big iron claw.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.060
Let people do their own ways.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.230
And only get involved if people
really leave the reservation.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.000
They really leave the corral.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.520
Again a really important
point because Americans

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.726
no longer feel they
own their communities.

00:37:35.726 --> 00:37:37.890
And there are a lot
of studies of this.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.090
And the truth is they don't.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.130
If you're a retired physicist
or a retired software engineer

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:50.380
and you want to go work
in the schools, you can't.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.312
You're much better qualified
than anybody in the school,

00:37:53.312 --> 00:37:55.020
but you're not certified
to be a teacher.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.590
Sorry.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:00.070
If you want to go help
in a hospice, you can't.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.744
Are you certified?

00:38:02.744 --> 00:38:04.160
All these bureaucratic
constraints

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.730
prevent real people
who are qualified

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.056
for getting involved
in their communities.

00:38:13.412 --> 00:38:14.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.360
PHILIP HOWARD:
[INAUDIBLE] question here?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.500
PHILIP HOWARD: We have one
more for the cameraman.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.970
[INAUDIBLE] this question.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.380
AUDIENCE: Well, I
actually was an educator.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.080
And you talked about education--
I was a special education

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.020
teacher.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.364
And we got a significant
part of the budget.

00:38:30.364 --> 00:38:31.780
But the other thing
I seem to find

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.790
is, is that more and more
students were then identified

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.947
as being special needs students.

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:39.030
And it seemed like there
was a significant portion

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.380
of the community that felt
served by what some of us

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.799
thought was a broken system.

00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:45.340
So how do you address
the people that

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.402
feel served, even
though it's broken?

00:38:47.402 --> 00:38:49.360
PHILIP HOWARD: You have
to make common choices.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.540
Special ed, according to
some studies I've seen,

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.027
has twice the number of people
than it ought to have in it.

00:38:55.027 --> 00:38:57.110
It becomes a place where
you get special training.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.360
You get more time
to take your test.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.940
There are all
kinds of advantages

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:06.977
to being designated
into special ed.

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:09.435
You can't run a democracy by
the lowest common denominator.

00:39:13.405 --> 00:39:18.600
You can't have environmental
reviews that last ten years.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.880
Germany, a much greener
country, [INAUDIBLE] last one,

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.160
two years at the
most because they

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.765
have a decision-maker
who says, OK.

00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:27.390
We [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.723
Now we're going to have to this.

00:39:28.723 --> 00:39:30.734
This official has
a responsibility

00:39:30.734 --> 00:39:31.525
to make a decision.

00:39:31.525 --> 00:39:33.910
And that can be appealed to
that official and that's it.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:44.040
And the budget in schools is
a limited amount of dollars.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.915
I think we need
in inner cities--

00:39:46.915 --> 00:39:50.760
the experts I've talked to think
we need a dramatic redirection.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.670
Not to pre-K education,
but to prenatal education.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.060
Really getting these
kids and their mothers

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.130
before they're born so they can
develop language skills and all

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.754
the things that happen in
the first couple of years.

00:40:03.754 --> 00:40:05.191
That's expensive.

00:40:05.191 --> 00:40:07.890
Where does the money come from?

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.850
So we have to make these
choices in our society.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.670
And if it's all preset in legal
concrete, we can't [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.810
One more question.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.540
AUDIENCE: So I think served
is one aspect to people

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.810
who feel served by the laws.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.520
But I think also
there's an aspect

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.700
of people being
scared by change.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.574
So the more we talk
about this, like

00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:27.990
you just mentioned
the physicists.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.310
So you excited all the
physicists in the room.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.200
But you just scared
millions of teachers

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.400
because they are comfortable
with the current law.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.710
When you talk about
balancing the budget

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.860
and you talk about the three
big programs, well, OK.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.260
So Social Security and Medicare.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.890
You just scared a whole
'nother group of people.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:48.950
And we can go on and on.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.370
The more we talk about this,
basically everyone in this room

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.264
is going to be scared--
well, maybe not.

00:40:56.264 --> 00:40:58.430
The percentage of people
that are going to be scared

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:03.580
is already about 50% just based
on the current conversation.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.360
PHILIP HOWARD:
And probably more.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.710
It's an excellent question.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.250
First of all, change is scary.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.804
Again, we go back
to Plato's cave.

00:41:09.804 --> 00:41:11.470
They didn't want to
go out in the light.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.770
They wanted to stay shackled
as much as they could.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.290
Just be where they are.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.190
So it's an evolutionary
imperative.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.750
We have food in our stomachs.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:23.110
People will never go
out to risk the world

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.790
of saber-toothed tigers
and converging technology

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.670
companies.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.503
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.980
So change is scary.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.500
But the status
quo is also scary.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.770
And so one of the
many things that's

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:44.100
missing in our current
dialogue about our society

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.000
are people who have
moral authority.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.130
So what's really important is
for people stand up and say not

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.680
I'm going to get rid of
special ed the way it is,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.055
but to say we're going to
remake a whole bunch of things.

00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:58.950
And you're going to be
better off [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.720
But everybody's going
to have to sacrifice.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.990
Because this huge
bureaucratic law,

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.530
we're all feeding off of it.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.222
So we're scared to
lose the feeding off

00:42:08.222 --> 00:42:09.430
of this big bureaucratic law.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.970
But it's also suffocating us.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.799
And it's not sustainable
because we can't afford it.

00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:17.090
We're running half trillion
to trillion dollar deficits

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.120
every year.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.010
We can't address climate change.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.130
We can't address immigration,
bad immigration law.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.315
We can't address anything.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.530
So how do you do that?

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:32.278
Well, you need a group that
isn't vindictive and says,

00:42:32.278 --> 00:42:33.736
I'm going to get
you, which is sort

00:42:33.736 --> 00:42:36.130
of what both groups are about.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.820
You need people
with moral authority

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.890
the people trust to be saying
what they really believe.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.350
You don't have to agree with it.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:53.400
And I challenge you to find
any public leader or even any

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.500
public citizen-- maybe you can
find a couple [INAUDIBLE]--

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.160
who have moral authority.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.280
Because the way we've organized
our dealings with government,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.650
even environmental groups
look like special interest.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.370
They just want to do that.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.582
They don't want to fix all
the other things to do.

00:43:12.582 --> 00:43:14.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.150
So we need to pull back.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.010
This is a daunting problem.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.680
And there's a
wonderful anarchist

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.195
called Peter Kropotkin.

00:43:23.195 --> 00:43:25.845
He wrote 100 years ago.

00:43:25.845 --> 00:43:26.865
He was a White Russian.

00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:29.347
Fled the revolution.

00:43:29.347 --> 00:43:31.430
Got a job writing for the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.490
If it were now, he would be
working for Google for sure.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.270
Was a brilliant guy.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.990
Wrote these hysterical tracts.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:45.000
And he said, the more
miserable a man is,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.255
the more he fears change lest it
make him more miserable still.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.790
And so we do have to fight
human nature in doing it.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.680
Everything I'm saying requires
fighting with human nature.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.280
That doesn't mean
that' it's right.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.080
It just means we
got to deal with it.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.360
Thank you.
