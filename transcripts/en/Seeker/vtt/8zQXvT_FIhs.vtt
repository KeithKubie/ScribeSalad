00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.080
I have been to the Atacama Desert six times
already.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.629
We are far from anywhere.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.060
There's no bathroom, there is nothing.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.310
You don't wash for five days.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:22.080
Comparing what we do to a human mission on
Mars, what we do is very easy.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.730
The Atacama Desert in Chile is one of the
driest and most surreal places on Earth, and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.230
it is so unique that it may even hold answers
to questions about where we might find life

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.640
elsewhere in the universe.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.940
The Atacama Desert is very similar to some
of the conditions we can find on Mars in terms

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.040
of salt chemistry, in particular.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.240
Exposure to UV is much, much higher on Mars
than the Atacama Desert.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.660
But this is as close as we can get.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.329
It’s here that Dr. Jocelyne DiRuggiero studies
extremophiles, which are microorganisms that

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.380
live in extreme environments.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.870
In this instance, she’s studying photosynthesizing
extremophiles that live inside of rocks, a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.810
place that you wouldn’t expect light to
be able to penetrate.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.600
We are interested in cyanobacteria, and they
are found everywhere on Earth.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.319
They are primary producers, very much like
plants, so they use energy from the sun, carbon

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:21.540
dioxide, and water, and then they make organic
carbon, which is then used by other microorganisms.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.509
They live inside rocks because they're protected
from high solar radiation, desiccation, but

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.350
it's also a place where water is retained
better than in the soil.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.349
We're trying to find out how do they not only
survive, but thrive how do they grow, and

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:44.020
how do they evolve in those crazy conditions?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.439
Jocelyne and her team used geological hammers
while collecting and opening rocks in the

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.290
desert, as well as several other tools to
measure weather, temperature, and humidity.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.179
They also used a drill, spectrophotometer,
and fiber-optic sensor that measures the intensity

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.810
and color of any light penetrating the rock.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.009
We pretended we were those little microorganisms
inside the rocks and what do we see?

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.880
What do we feel when we're out there in this
rock?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.410
We had done experiments in the lab on other
types of rocks and we could see that the deeper

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.560
in the rock, the less light we had.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.700
It looks like the light they see is a little
redder than the light that is outside the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.940
rock, and so this brings the questions, "What
are the adaptations to the photo systems that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.920
allow them to capitalize on this red light?"

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.110
It was from the bed of a pickup truck in the
howling winds that the scientists had to pull

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.680
off these complicated experiments.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.420
But it paid off with some striking results.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.950
The light experiments were quite surprising.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.710
With the halite, which are sodium chloride
rocks basically, there is a lot of light,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.370
even underneath the rock.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.210
This has to do with the composition of the
salt rock and also the fact that the light

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.770
is reflected on the ground and bouncing back.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.680
So those microbial communities that are at
different spots inside the rocks will see

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.870
different type of lights, and we didn't know
that before.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.570
The quality of the light that reaches the
cyanobacteria could indicate how these organisms

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.030
are photosynthesizing from the inside of a
rock, compared to other primary producers,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.290
like plants.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.780
In order to figure out this process, Jocelyne
and the team want to take a closer look at

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.600
the organism's genome, to see if there are
any genetic mutations that allow them to live

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.820
in these extreme environments.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.400
Back to the lab, where we'll do the molecular analysis to figure out who is there, what the community is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.350
and also count the number of cells and trying to correlate the light

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.010
inside the rocks with the microbial community at the molecular level.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.820
But sequencing the genome of these microorganisms
is going to take a while.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.810
Once these experiments are complete, Jocelyne
and her team hope their data will be useful

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.930
to other research missions, like studying
how life can adapt to climate change, or thrive

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.060
on another planet.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.150
Mars is very dry, so I'm not saying there is life

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.020
at the surface of Mars right now.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.640
But you can imagine that Mars became more and more drier over its history.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.810
It's very similar to what's happening in the Atacama Desert right now. It's getting drier and drier.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.430
And so where are the last places where  we could find life on Mars, and can we find biosignatures of this life?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300
 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.599
Sometimes it's challenging.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.189
But at the same time, it’s very rewarding.

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:40.819
After you work really hard and you're really
tired, you sit around the campfire, we drink

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.330
a little scotch, brainstorm with ideas.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.310
The skies at night in the Atacama are amazing.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.249
You can see the whole Milky Way.

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.719
It's just totally mind-blowing.

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:59.039
This is really the time where you can get
new insight about what we do, and we also

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:07.529
talk about why we're doing this, why are we
scientists, what is our passion and this is

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.349
it.
