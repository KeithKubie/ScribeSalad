One thing I really like
about Google Web Toolkit

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:04.133
is hosted mode.

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.734
Hosted mode
lets you execute

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.567
your application's
Java code

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.634
while it controls
an embedded browser.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.133
You can make changes
to your Java on the fly,

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.501
hit "refresh"
in the browser

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.267
and see those changes
instantly.

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.501
It really speeds up
our development cycle.

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:19.567
One thing I'm really
looking forward to

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:21.334
is out-of-process
hosted mode.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:23.868
This is going to let us
use a wider range of browsers

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:26.200
for embedded testing.
