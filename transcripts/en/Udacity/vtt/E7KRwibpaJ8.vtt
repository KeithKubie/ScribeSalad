00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And this is how I solved the problem.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I assigned ta_300 to name + is the TA for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
+ course for name, country, course in ta_data.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And, notice I had to use this country

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
even though it didn't show up here

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that's because each of these lists contain 3 elements

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and I need to reference all three of those elements.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I only did this if course.find for this string CS3--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
because you'll notice all of the 300 level classes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
have CS3 in them--was not equal to negative one.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Because, remember, find returns negative one

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
when it doesn't find what you're asking for.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And when I run this, I get exactly what I want.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Good work.
