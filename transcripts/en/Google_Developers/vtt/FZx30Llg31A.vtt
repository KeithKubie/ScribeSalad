PAUL SAXMAN: Hello.

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.950
My name is Paul Saxman.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.230
I work at Developer Relations
in Google.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.020
And I'm here to talk about
Google TV, specifically why

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.730
should developers build
apps for Google TV?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.010
To answer this, here are a few
points to get you thinking.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.800
TVs are by far the largest
displays in most households,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.040
which means they're great
for consuming

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.090
content, especially video.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.400
If you've ever watched YouTube
on a television, it's a great

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.250
experience.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.150
TVs are connected to the best
sound systems in most

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.960
households, so audio apps work
great too on Google TV.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.440
Pandora is one of the top
apps in Google TV.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.360
TVs are near very comfortable
furniture in most households,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.700
so developers should think about
the lean-back experience

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.010
or about what apps make sense
in the living room.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.760
TVs are great for multi-user
viewing/interaction, so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.900
developers should
think social.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.780
TVs are used by over 5 billion
people worldwide.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.520
On average, Americans watch
about five hours of TV daily,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.530
which is increasing.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.780
TV viewing is actually the top
leisure activity besides

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.210
sleeping in the United States.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.230
In 2009, the average US home had
2.5 people versus 2.86 TV

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.340
sets, which means there are more
TVs than people in the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.110
average US home.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.290
And one more point to consider,
TVs aren't only

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.540
found in people's living rooms.
They're also commonly

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.190
found in bedrooms, hotel rooms,
classrooms, airplanes,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.510
hospitals, lobbies, bars, and
quite a few other places.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.420
Basically, TVs are everywhere.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.590
A lot of people watch
them a lot.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.960
And they're getting
smarter every day.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.040
Would you like to learn more
about why to build

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.570
apps for Google TV?
