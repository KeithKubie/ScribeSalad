00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:06.879
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Hello everyone.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.590
Welcome and thank you for joining us today.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.059
We're very excited to have Gene Baur of the
Farm Sanctuary here today at Google New York.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.810
Gene currently serves as president and co-founder
of Farm Sanctuary.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.920
From humble beginnings selling veggie dogs
at Grateful Dead concerts to fun animal rescues,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.779
Farm Sanctuary has become the nation's leading
farm animal protection group.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.469
Over the past 25 years, Gene has visited hundreds
of farms and has really become a pioneer in

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.019
the field of undercover investigations.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.290
He's also educated millions in the process.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.530
Gene's achievements include winning the first
ever cruelty conviction at a US stockyard,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.130
as well as introducing the first US laws to
prohibit cruel farming confinement methods.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.470
Gene holds a Bachelor's degree in sociology
from California State University, and also

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.030
a master's degree in agricultural economics
from Cornell.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.730
In 2008, Gene released a national bestseller,
Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.730
About Food and Animals.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.360
We still have a few in the back that are free
you if you'd like to have one.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.740
And he can also stick around to sign autographs.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.020
And on a personal note, I had a chance to
visit the New York Farm Sanctuary last summer,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.429
and was just so impressed to see the work
with the abused and abandoned animals, and

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:18.899
left feeling very inspired.

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.340
So please help me in joining-- and welcoming
Gene Baur to the stage.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.340
[applause]

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.470
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Thank you very much.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.359
[pause] Wow, well, thank you so much, and
thank you for being here and for your interest

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.990
in these issues.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.049
Most of us don't think very much about what
happens to animals that are being raised on

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.049
farms.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.689
And most of us would be shocked to learn.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.859
So I'll be talking about some of that.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.090
I will also be talking about some of the positive
stories, some of the experiences we've had

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.409
over the years.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.659
I'll start with some pictures of the animals
at the Sanctuary.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.709
At Farm Sanctuary, the animals are our friends,
not our food.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.959
We treat them like most people treat their
cats and dogs.

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.009
Cows get to be who they are.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.069
They get to go outside.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.069
They get to exercise.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.380
They get to graze.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.250
Pigs get to go out and root in the soil.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.230
Pigs are very earthy animals.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.620
They have very sensitive noses, so they can
smell things under the earth.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.660
But they also have very powerful noses.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.570
Farmers used to put corn around tree stumps,
and the pigs would go there and [chuckles]

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.490
root up these old tree stumps.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.159
So their noses are very powerful, but they're
very sensitive.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.510
And when you think about these animals living
in these factory farms where, for 24 hours

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.730
a day, all they're doing is breathing in the
noxious fumes of their own waste, it makes

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.030
that kind of confinement even that much more
upsetting.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.880
When the animals first come to Farm Sanctuary,
oftentimes they're very frightened.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.670
They've only known cruelty at human hands.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.680
But as time goes, they learn to trust us.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.120
They learn to enjoy life.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.060
They learn to play and experience pleasure
and joy for the first time.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.480
It's a beautiful thing to see.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.790
And they also show companionship and friendship.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.981
That's a picture of Lydia, who we used to
call the Hugging Turkey because you'd go out

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:13.980
into the barnyard and kneel down, and she
would walk over to you and crane her neck

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.300
around your neck, like she was giving you
a hug.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.720
So I've spent a lot of time at the farm over
the past 25 years, enjoying the company of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.370
these animals and watching people being touched
and inspired by these animals.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.519
It's a beautiful thing.

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.829
But I didn't grow up on a farm.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.980
I actually grew up in Hollywood, California.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.040
I had a cat named Tiger who I totally loved.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.170
And although I loved Tiger and I loved the
other animals I knew, dogs and cats, I was

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.840
still eating other animals!

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.030
And I didn't really put them together.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.629
But as time went, I started recognizing that
I didn't have to eat animals.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.489
And I realized, as I grew up, I never really
made a conscious choice to eat animals.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.650
It was something everybody around me was doing,
so I just started doing it.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.090
And I think most of us live our lives in a
way where we just do things that other people

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.270
around us are doing.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.299
It's just what we do.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.529
We're very social animals.

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.819
We learn from those around us.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.470
And so my parents were eating animals, my
brothers and sisters.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.820
Everybody I knew was.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.990
So I did it without really thinking about
it.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.970
But as time went and I started recognizing
that I didn't have to eat animals, and that

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.389
these animals had feelings much like cats
and dogs, and that it was healthier, I went

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.759
vegan in 1985.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.450
I got a couple slides here talking about the
health impacts.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.420
There's a book called The China Study that
I would recommend for anybody interested in

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.680
the science behind the benefits of plant-based
eating.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.100
But this just shows the health care expenditures
per person in the US versus other countries.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.780
They're very high in this country, partly
because of the system, but also largely because

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.780
of the way we eat.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.560
Because we're not as healthy as we could be.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.370
And sadly, our health care expenditures continue
increasing.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.620
There's a movie out right now called Forks
Over Knives that I would recommend if you

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.900
haven't seen it.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.229
The experts in that movie estimate that we
could save 70-80% on our health care costs

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.620
in this country by shifting to a whole foods,
plant-based diet, shifting away from processed

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.500
food, shifting away from animal food.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.710
The way we eat has profound impacts, not only
on other animals, but on our own health.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.460
When we eat in a way that we do in this country,
we're seeing huge problems.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520
Heart disease and cancer are the top two killers.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.410
The risks of both could be seriously lessened
by shifting towards a plant-based diet.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.990
Another impact animal agriculture has is on
the environment.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.199
These are some quotes from a United Nations
study called Livestock's Long Shadow.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.360
And as you see here, it talks about how the
livestock industry is a major contributor

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.479
to the most significant environmental problems
we're facing.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:02.069
It's a major player responsible for contributing
more to greenhouse gas emissions than the

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.250
entire transportation industry.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.729
So if you take all of the cars and trains
and boats and planes and combine the emissions,

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.379
it would be less than what comes from animal
agriculture.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.270
This is according to the United Nations.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.980
[pause] According to the UN, the livestock
sector should be a major policy focus when

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.590
dealing with problems of land degradation,
climate change and air pollution, water shortage

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.460
and water pollution, loss of biodiversity.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.150
The contribution is on a massive scale.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.530
The contribution to the solution could be
huge.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.890
Now, unfortunately, agribusiness is very entrenched
in politics.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.220
They've invested for years in the legislative
process.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.159
They have a lot of control.

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:51.370
Back in the 1970s, there was a report that
went out that encouraged Americans to eat

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.370
less meat.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.150
Now, that report was in print for about a
day, and then it was changed and reworded

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:05.889
to say, "We should eat more meat that is lower
in saturated fat" which mixes up the message

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.490
and has the ultimate result of people eating
more meat.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.960
We've continued doing that, and our health
has suffered as a result.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.380
Another cost of animal agriculture has to
do with energy use.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.110
This is a slide from a New York Times article
that was entitled "Rethinking the Meat Guzzler",

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.410
and it compares the amount of fossil fuels
needed for a vegetarian meal versus a meat

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.410
meal.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.460
It took 16 times more fossil fuels for the
meat meal.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.370
All these problems have been exacerbated over
the years by this move away from small farms

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.030
towards larger industrialized operations.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.440
The number of farms in our country has been
decreasing.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.050
The size of each farm has been increasing.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.610
So we don't have the typical family farm that
many of us envision anymore.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.800
We have these industrialized operations.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.400
[pause]
Now, when Farm Sanctuary started in 1986,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.550
I spent a lot of time going to stockyards
and farms and slaughterhouses to document

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.759
what was happening.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.490
This is a picture taken of Lancaster Stockyard,
which was, at the time, the largest stockyard

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.879
east of Chicago.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.680
Cows, pigs, sheep, goats would be transported
here to be sold.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.789
There were seen as the pillar of the-- Oops.
[pause]

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:23.569
The animals, when they were being handled
at these stockyards, were often seen just

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.970
as commodities.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.250
What became apparent was the way I looked
at these animals, and the way that these livestock

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.120
people looked at the animals, was very different.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.729
I would look into the animals' faces.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.740
I would see their expressions.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.230
I would recognize that they were afraid.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.210
The handlers were not looking into the animals'
faces.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.380
They're literally looking at cuts of meat.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.570
They're looking at body conformation.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.840
They're looking at meat on the hoof.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.210
And they sell them by the pound.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.410
So it's a very different perspective.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.390
And when these animals are seen just as commodities,
they're oftentimes whipped, they're beaten,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.540
they're shocked.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.450
Living animals are thrown away.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.130
Animals die routinely in the process.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.980
That's a picture of the dead pile behind the
stockyard.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.880
The day I took this picture, there were dead
pigs, dead cows, dead sheep.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.080
As I approached, the maggots were so thick
you could hear them buzzing.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.380
It was a hot August day.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.430
And the stink was horrible, as you can imagine.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.640
The sheep at the far right was actually alive.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.390
She lifted her head.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.520
And as you can imagine, we were stunned to
find a living animal thrown in this dead pile.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.020
I took her off the dead pile, brought her
to a nearby veterinary, thinking she would

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.400
have to be euthanized.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.510
But she stood up.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.030
And she lived with us for more than ten years.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.620
So that's Hilda, our first rescued animal.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.570
Since her, we've rescued thousands.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.200
Each of these animals becomes an ambassador.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.691
When people learn where Hilda came from and
where these animals-- the way these animals

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:55.140
suffer in this industry, it can be a very
transformative experience, especially when

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.040
you get to know these animals at Farm Sanctuary
like many people know their cats and dogs,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.960
and hearing about their stories.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.320
So it began a campaign at Lancaster Stockyards
after there was no movement on prosecuting

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.970
the stockyard for leaving this downed animal
on the dead pile.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.680
And our position was that if an animal's too
sick to walk, that animal should be humanely

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.460
euthanized or should be given proper veterinary
care.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.160
They should not just be left to suffer on
the dead pile.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.160
They shouldn't be left to suffer and die in
the alleyways, which was also commonly happening.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.440
But at the time, Lancaster Stockyards was
seen as a pillar of the community.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.340
It was getting ready to celebrate its 100
year anniversary.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.560
And it was being criticized, now, by this
group of vegans who lived in a school bus

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.970
on the tofu farm that funded the organization
by selling vegetarian hot dogs at Grateful

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.790
Dead concerts.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.590
So we had a lot of convincing to do in the
community.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.450
But as time went, and as people started seeing
these images of animals left for dead, and

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.470
they started hearing about what was happening,
things ultimately shifted.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.300
We were able to get Lancaster Stockyards convicted
of cruelty to animals after seven years of

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.300
campaigning.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.890
I went back to the stockyard a few years ago,
took that picture.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.160
It was overgrown, it's now been bulldozed,
it's gone.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160
We actually had an event there last year at
the Stockyard Inn, which is right next to

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.420
the Stockyard.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:20.440
It was a vegan event to celebrate Hilda's
25th-- the 25th anniversary of Hilda's rescue.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.270
The Stockyard owner said that--.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.460
And he was a little bit worried at first,
having all these vegans come to the Stockyard

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.700
Inn.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.620
But he agreed that he would host this event.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.710
And he said that it was a very positive experience,
that he learned a lot about it, that this

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:40.150
is the wave of the future, and from now on,
he's going to have a vegan item on his menu.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.960
And while the stockyard is now gone, Farm
Sanctuary has grown.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.980
That's our farm in Watkins Glen, New York.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.881
You're all invited, in fact, encouraged to
come visit, get to know the animals, experience

00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:53.950
that the-- what happens to them when they're
transformed.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.900
And this is our farm in Orland, California.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.150
It's north of Sacramento.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.810
We recently also acquired a farm near Los
Angeles.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.220
All of these are open to visitors, and we
encourage people to come get to know the animals

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.150
and look into their eyes and recognize that
they're really not that different than the

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.980
cats and dogs who many of us live with.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.750
But far away from Farm Sanctuary, on farms
all over this country, bad has become normal.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.870
Farm animals are genetically manipulated,
artificially bred, mutilated, confined, cruelly

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.640
beaten, been killed for food.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.810
Those might sound like harsh words, but it's
very accurate and descriptive.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.480
Farm animals are specifically excluded from
the Federal Animal Welfare Act.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.820
Most people believe and want to believe that
these animals are protected, right?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.270
Well, no, they're not.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.140
They're excluded from the Federal Animal Welfare
Act.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:49.330
When it comes to state laws, agricultural
practices considered to be common are excluded.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.000
A common practice is one that the industry
has adopted year after year.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.750
So if everybody's starting to put animals
in small cages where they can't turn around,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.880
if everybody is cutting off the tails of animals
without any anesthesia, if everybody is leaving

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.180
live animals on piles of dead animals, it's
a common practice, and it's legal in most

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.380
states.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.220
And to give you a sense, also, of how powerful
agribusiness is: it's exempt from many labor

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.320
and environmental laws.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.310
So this is an industry that treats animals
badly, that harms the environment, that's

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.870
producing food that is killing us.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.300
And they're not responsible or not liable
for many of these harms.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:32.680
I recently heard about how some of the attorneys
that went after the tobacco industry are now

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.320
starting to look at the food industry, and
look in a these kinds of issues.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:43.240
There's a lot of evidence and a lot of information
that needs to be gathered and the case made,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.130
but I think that's a very positive sign.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.190
This is an industry that does a lot of harm.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.560
Most people are unwittingly supporting it
and unwittingly harming themselves.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.830
A big part of our message at Farm Sanctuary
is we encourage people to make choices in

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:03.060
their own lives that are aligned with our
own values and aligned with our own interests.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.180
So instead of--.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.850
When the factory farming issue comes up, instead
of saying, "Don't tell me.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:13.440
I don't want to know", which a lot of people
do, I think it's sensible to be more responsible

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.580
and say, "Look, I want to know, and I want
to feel good about what I'm doing.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.430
I want to live in a way that I can feel good
about, instead of living in this dissonance

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.160
and denial."

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.350
The other thing is we encourage people to
make food choices that are aligned with our

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.510
interests: to eat food that is healthy.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:34.770
Not to eat food that gives us heart disease
and can ultimately kill us over time and cause

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:40.140
enormous suffering to ourselves and our loved
ones.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.390
That means eating more plant foods in our
country.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.170
More whole foods, less processed foods.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.560
If we make choices that are aligned with our
values and aligned with our interests, we

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.000
will see a revolution in this food business.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.500
Most citizens don't think enough about these
issues and are unwittingly supporting this

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.470
bad system.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:05.070
After Lancaster Stockyards was convicted of
cruelty, I traveled around the country documenting

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.520
more downed animals.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.120
That's a picture I took in Southern California.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.220
These are downed cows that were being used
for human food, being slaughtered for food.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.980
That's a picture I took in Texas.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.480
This cow was sent to the stockyard with her
calf.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:29.490
And because cows and calves sell to different
buyers, they were separated.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:35.240
The mother fought to be with her calf, and
as she did, her neck was broken.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.910
She was left there for hours, possibly for
days.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.740
They refused to euthanize her because as long
as she was still alive, she could be sold

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.670
for food.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.910
[pause]
That's a picture I took at a stockyard in

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.910
upstate New York.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.920
It was a freezing day.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.500
This calf was sent to the stockyard on the
day he was born.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.490
He was still wet from afterbirth.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.610
And he was dying of hypothermia.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.520
I went up to the stockyard worker and I asked,
"What's going on with this calf?"

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.500
And he said, "I have to bury him tomorrow."

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.280
So I said, "Well, what if I take him off your
hands?"

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.630
He said, "Sure, go ahead, take him."

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.560
So I took the calf to a nearby veterinarian.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.790
She tried to take his temperature.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.880
It was so low it wouldn't even read on the
thermometer.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.620
And she said, "What are you wasting your time
for?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.310
This calf has very low chance of survival.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.330
Makes no economic sense.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.360
It's going to cost a lot more than he's worth
to do this."

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.280
And I said, "You know, to me, this calf is
not an 'economic unit'.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280
He's an individual.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.300
I want to do what I can to help him."

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.680
And she finally gave him intravenous fluids,
and I took him back to the sanctuary.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.670
I'm happy to say he recovered.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.720
That's a picture of Opie in his prime.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.180
He ended up weighing close to 3000 pounds.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.730
He lived a long life at the farm, lived to
be 18 years old.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.560
And it was a beautiful thing to see his transformation.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.700
You know, as he started healing physically,
that was a good thing.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.610
But he still wasn't really thriving.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.069
When I took him out to the barn to be with
the other cows, and they welcomed him in,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.990
that's when he started thriving.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.540
It really speaks to the fact that these animals,
in addition to having physical needs, have

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.829
emotional needs.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.500
And they need to be with their own people.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.169
They need to be in a positive environment.

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:20.039
So just like humans are affected by our social
environment, animals are affected by their

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.539
social environment.

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:26.350
In the slaughterhouse or in a factory farm,
where it's about brutality and exploitation

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:31.240
and cruelty, that affects the animals and
it affects the people.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:37.539
And at the sanctuary, where it's about caring
and nurturing and kindness, that affects the

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:40.799
animals, and it also affects people.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.280
But Opie was born on a dairy farm.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.610
In order for a cow to have milk, she has to
have a calf, just like other mammals.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.950
We don't lactate unless there's a baby to
feed.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.220
That's usually how it works.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.019
Dairy cows today have a calf every year.

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:57.390
The calf is taken away immediately after birth.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:03.320
The cow is put in these milking parlors where
they're hooked up to machines two to three

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.159
times a day, and they're milked intensely.

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:11.220
They'll produce about ten times more milk
than they would in a natural environment.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.260
Their bodies are under intense stress.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.750
I remember reading in an agribusiness journal
a few years back how for a dairy cow--.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.919
With the amount of production they do, and
in addition to giving ten times more milk

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:24.700
than normal, they're pregnant during most
of their lactation period.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.750
So there's this enormous drain on their bodies.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.570
They're in what's called a "state of negative
energy balance."

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.350
They cannot eat enough to keep the weight
on their bones, so they're losing weight during

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.490
this process.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.700
But I read in an industry journal that for
a dairy cow, it's like running a marathon

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.160
every day.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.720
They're pushed very hard.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.980
In a healthy environment, they could live
20 years.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.330
On modern dairy farms, they're sent to slaughter
after just three or four years in production.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.860
[pause] And in many cases, those cows are
so weak, they can't even stand.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.350
They become these downed animals, like that
first picture I showed of the slaughterhouse

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.809
in southern California.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:03.950
Those were all dairy cows who were too sick
even to walk.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.960
They were dragged onto trucks, taken to slaughter
to be used for food.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.971
This picture was actually taken by a dairy
industry veterinarian in California, who was

00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:18.400
upset by what he was seeing, took that picture,
sent it to me, and said, "This is wrong.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.120
We've got to do something about it."

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.710
We were able to pass legislation in California.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:28.669
I'm happy to say it is now illegal, federally,
for downed cows to be slaughtered and used

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:30.200
for human food.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.549
Part of that is for humane reasons, but part
of that also is for concerns about mad cow

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.450
disease.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:42.230
The first animal discovered to have mad cow
disease in the US was a downed cow.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:47.179
The health concerns and the animal welfare
concerns led, ultimately, to a ban on the

00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:49.129
slaughter of downed cattle for human food.

00:19:49.129 --> 00:19:50.549
That's positive.

00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:55.190
But other downed animals, including pigs and
sheep and goats that are too sick to walk,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.990
are still dragged onto trucks and taken to
slaughter and used for food.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.840
It's also interesting to note that the US
Department of Agriculture explicitly allows

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.059
animals who are diseased to be used for human
food.

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:10.490
During the process of trying to ban downed
cows in the food supply, we sued the USDA

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.860
and we argued that diseased animals should
not be used for food.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.700
Their response to us was that we were incorrect,
that it was legal and common and appropriate

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.409
for diseased animals to be used for food.

00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:25.649
So whether they're downed or not, diseased
animals are still used for food.

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:30.100
Now, as I mentioned, for a dairy cow to have
milk, she has to have a calf.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.539
The calf is taken away immediately after birth.

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:35.659
The female calves are raised to become milking
cows.

00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:40.940
The male calves are useless to the dairy industry,
so the veal industry was actually created

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:46.610
to take advantage of this plentiful supply
of unwanted male calves born on dairy farms.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.320
These calves are chained by the neck in these
crates for their whole lives.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.409
As people have learned what happens to cows
in veal production, veal consumption in the

00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:55.899
US has started going down.

00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:59.419
It's a very positive step, and it shows that
most people are humane.

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:01.250
Most people don't like to support cruelty.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:07.090
When people learn about this stuff, they can
take steps to stop supporting it and to eat

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.690
in a way that's more aligned with our own
values.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.760
But veal cows are not the only animals that
are confined in these kinds of crates.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.029
That's a picture I took in Missouri.

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:20.650
These are sows that are kept in what are called
"gestation crates."

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.970
These are two foot wide metal enclosures where
they live most of their lives.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.940
They're called gestation crates 'cause it's
where they're kept during their gestation

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.899
period, or their pregnancy, which lasts four
months.

00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:36.470
[pause] They suffer both physically and psychologically.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.010
This one, you can see, has some bruising on
her front leg.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.110
This one is engaging in what's called "bar
biting", it's a stereotypical neurotic coping

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:54.450
behavior that these animals engage in in an
attempt to survive their confinement.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.879
They're basically driven mad.

00:21:56.879 --> 00:22:00.059
[pause]
And the third confinement system I'll mention

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:02.860
has to do with chickens that are used in egg
production.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.480
This is a picture of a battery cage operation.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.190
These egg laying hens are lined up in rows,
stacked in tiers, in huge factory warehouses,

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.759
that'll hold 100,000 birds.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:18.669
They're packed so tightly they can't even
stretch their wings.

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:23.679
[pause] They constantly scrape against the
wire bars of their cages.

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:24.860
Their feathers wear off.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.600
They end up with bruises and abrasions on
their bodies.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.580
And they'll live this way for about a year.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.289
After that time, they're sent to slaughter.

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:39.480
But because they're so skinny, and because
they're so beat up, a lot of times the slaughterhouses

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.600
don't want them.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.340
So sometimes, they're just killed on the farm.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.580
Sometimes, they're literally ground up alive.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.539
There was a case in California where an egg
factory had 30,000 "spent hens."

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:56.259
That's what they call them after their egg
production cycle when they're no longer profitable.

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.000
They're called spent hens.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.480
So he had 30,000 spent hens he had to get
rid of.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.289
He couldn't find a slaughterhouse to take
them.

00:23:02.289 --> 00:23:05.080
He got a wood chipper.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.549
He was throwing these live birds into the
wood chipper A neighbor saw this, was upset

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.759
about it, called us, called the other authorities.

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:17.039
We tried to get something done about it, and
it was considered to be an acceptable, common

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.200
agricultural practice.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.210
So he was not found guilty of cruelty to animals.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.000
And one of the people that came forward to
defend this and say it was okay was a veterinarian

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.539
with the American Veterinary Medical Association.

00:23:28.539 --> 00:23:33.889
You have these institutions that are looked
upon as experts who have bought into a situation

00:23:33.889 --> 00:23:35.450
where bad has become normal.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.289
They start defending practices that most people,
when they think about them, don't feel very

00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:41.419
good about.

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:45.929
[pause]
Now, I mentioned that these spent hens are

00:23:45.929 --> 00:23:50.190
useless to the meat industry, or are of very
low value to the meat industry.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.309
That's because today, we are raising chickens
in huge numbers for meat.

00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:56.049
They are very distinct breed.

00:23:56.049 --> 00:24:00.740
They've been genetically bred to grow twice
as big and twice as fast as normal.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.620
The egg laying hens do not grow very big or
very fast.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.970
So when you're at the hatchery --and this
is a picture of a hatchery-- and they're hatching

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.330
the egg laying hens, you have both males and
females that hatch.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.450
The females are used for egg production.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.840
The males are useless.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.940
So what happens?

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.110
[pause]
That's a picture I took behind a hatchery

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.899
in Pennsylvania.

00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:27.309
These are the unwanted male chicks that were
thrown away the day they hatched.

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.650
What an irony, you know?

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.999
The egg, a symbol of spring and birth.

00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:38.889
They fight their way out into this world to
be thrown in a trashcan.

00:24:38.889 --> 00:24:42.299
[pause]
That is at another hatchery.

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:45.830
These are live chicks thrown in a manure spreader.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.549
Spread on the field, literally like manure.

00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:54.890
[pause]
That's a picture I took at an egg factory

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:55.890
in New Jersey.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.220
I was there to document the battery cages.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.559
As I was getting ready to leave, I came across
this trash can full of these birds.

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:06.110
I thought they were all dead.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.889
But as I got closer, a couple of them started
moving.

00:25:10.889 --> 00:25:15.900
I took them out of the trashcan and brought
them to Farm Sanctuary.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.539
We tried to prosecute that egg factory for
cruelty to animals.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.640
For leaving live birds in the trashcan.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:27.299
Their lawyer argued, in court, that they could
legally treat the birds like manure.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:31.049
And the judge said, "Isn't there a difference
between live birds and manure?"

00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:33.260
Their lawyer said, "No, there's not a difference."

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.409
They were found not guilty of cruelty to animals.

00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:41.179
It just gives you a sense of how bad has become
normal, how weak the law is, and how this

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:44.650
industry gets away with such blatant mistreatment.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:54.650
It reminds me of a quote from Ruth Harrison,
who wrote Animal Machines.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:26:06.940
[pause] So I think that's the situation today,
where we have this system that has become

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.809
normalized, institutionalized.

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:14.039
And not only is this the case in the field
and in communities where animals are being

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.350
raised for food, but in our society, generally.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.350
We eat in a way that supports this system.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.940
And then we have health problems.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.549
A lot of us know people that are on heart
medication when they get to a certain weight,

00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:27.549
age.

00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:28.600
That becomes normal.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.350
If they're on heart medication and they're
on heart medication, we all must be faced

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.999
for that future.

00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:36.639
This is what everybody deals with, right?

00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:41.419
Well, my dad had a heart attack about 15 years
ago now.

00:26:41.419 --> 00:26:44.960
He went to the hospital, and they were feeding
him bacon and eggs.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.990
[light laughter] It killed me, you know?

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.450
[chuckles] My dad then started reading about
this.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.149
He's not a vegan, but he's eating a lot less
animal foods, and that's a-- and his health

00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:55.369
has improved significantly.

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:59.789
Then, I'm 50 now, so a few years back, I figured,
"I'm kinda getting old.

00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:03.549
I should go to the hospital and see how my
health is."

00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:06.230
I went and the doctor was taking all these
notes.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.220
"Any record of heart disease in the family?"

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.139
I said, "Yeah, my dad had a heart attack."

00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:13.379
And one of the first things he said to me
after that, without taking any tests or anything,

00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:16.749
was, "Well, I might want to put you on heart
medication."

00:27:16.749 --> 00:27:18.210
Whoa.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.210
And then--.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.210
I didn't go back to that doctor.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.789
I went to somebody else, and I said, "Take
my blood."

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:24.489
They did, and they analyzed it.

00:27:24.489 --> 00:27:32.000
And everything was in the normal ranges, except
for one statistic that was outside the normal.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.419
That was my bad cholesterol.

00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:34.850
It was below the normal.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.630
So I thought that that was a good thing.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.580
Even in the medical profession, you have doctors
and experts who mean well, but who have, I

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.340
think, been acculturated to accept certain
things.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.419
That, "Well, a certain age, most people need
heart medication" is one of these beliefs

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:53.549
and assumptions that we operate by.

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:57.500
I think it's something that needs to be challenged.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.789
[pause]
I had mentioned how we have two distinct breeds

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:02.850
of chickens in this country.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.299
I showed you how the egg laying hens are kept.

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:08.559
This is how the chickens who are raised for
meat are kept.

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.369
Just in these massive warehouses.

00:28:10.369 --> 00:28:13.950
They grow twice as big, twice as fast as normal.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.970
They grow so fast, their hearts and lungs
have a hard time supporting their bodies.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:26.500
Every year, millions die of heart attacks
before they go to slaughter at six weeks old.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.160
But it's still profitable because we raise
about nine billion of these chickens every

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160
year.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.470
So the industry can afford to lose hundreds
of millions because they're growing twice

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.610
as fast as normal, and it's still profitable.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.659
These birds' overweight condition, where their
hearts and lungs cannot support that sort

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:49.929
of growth, somewhat perversely parallels our
own problems in this country, now, with obesity.

00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:55.090
I've got a series of slides here, now, from
the Centers for Disease Control, showing the

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.309
rates of obesity in the US.

00:28:58.309 --> 00:29:05.179
Starting in 1985 with the darker blue states
there indicating 10-14% of the adult population

00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:06.179
obese.

00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:08.700
By 1990, we see it spreading.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:15.860
By '95, we have a new darker blue color indicating
15-19% of the adult population obese.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:23.269
By 2000, we now have a new color indicating
more-- a higher percentage with obesity.

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:29.090
2006, the last one I have available here,
indicating even more so.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.909
This is a problem that has spread.

00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:34.090
It's been recognized, now, as an epidemic
in our country.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.529
It's, I think, the beginning of a process
of change.

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:41.980
I am very happy with what Michelle Obama is
doing.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.679
Talking about eating more fruits and vegetables,
having a White House Organic Garden.

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:49.230
And amazingly, she's been criticized for that.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.659
It's crazy.

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:55.539
Also down in Washington, DC, at the USDA building,
there's actually something called the People's

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:56.539
Garden.

00:29:56.539 --> 00:29:58.989
It's a garden.

00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:04.340
It's a very important, I think, symbolic gesture
that we need to take control more of our food

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:11.169
choices and eat in a way that we feel good
about, instead of doing what we have done

00:30:11.169 --> 00:30:14.169
before, just because we have done it before.

00:30:14.169 --> 00:30:18.049
This is really what this boils down to: thinking
about how we're eating, thinking about how

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:21.869
we're living, and asking ourselves how we
feel about it.

00:30:21.869 --> 00:30:25.580
Then making choices that we can really feel
good about.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.990
Then eating food that is good for us.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:32.880
And that does not support an agricultural
system that is destroying the planet like

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.590
animal agriculture is today.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:40.110
[pause]
Now, when we first got the farm in Watkins

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.840
Glen, New York, one of our first visitors
was a pig farmer.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.880
He came over to the farm.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.950
I was talking with him in the pig barn.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:53.039
He looked down and saw these young volunteers,
maybe weighed a hundred pounds each, taking

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:56.789
care of these five hundred pound sows, cleaning
up after them.

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:58.650
This pig farmer was stunned.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.179
He said, "Those animals are dangerous.

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:02.179
They're aggressive.

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:05.270
You'd better get out of that barn or they're
going to attack you."

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.230
I told him that we had never had these pigs
attacking us the way he was describing.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.700
He said, "Look, I'm a pig farmer.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.750
I know these animals.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.750
I've raised them for years.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.759
I understand them.

00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.809
You can't trust them."

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:20.980
To make his point, he talked about how he
had a sow who had piglets.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.119
He took her piglets away, and she came after
him.

00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:30.159
He didn't recognize that his action caused
that response.

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:36.380
Sometimes, we become so narrow-minded, and
we start acting in a way and thinking in a

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:44.149
way that is so limited that we don't recognize
how our own behaviors cause certain impacts.

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:46.429
That was the case with this pig farmer.

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:51.580
When the animals do come to Farm Sanctuary,
as I mentioned, oftentimes, they are very

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.090
frightened because they've only known cruelty
at human hands.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.799
And so when we go into the barn, they will
be defensive, and they will step back.

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:00.410
But as time goes, they learn to trust us.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:04.940
They know they're in a safe place.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.259
It becomes a positive experience for them,
and also for us.

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:15.480
When animals are treated badly, we don't want
to see ourselves as mean.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.529
So we then start coming up with rationalizations
and justifications for why we have to do this.

00:32:20.529 --> 00:32:23.289
This pig farmer, for instance, said, "Those
are aggressive animals.

00:32:23.289 --> 00:32:27.830
You have to put them in the crates, otherwise
they'll attack you, or they'll attack other

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:28.830
animals."

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:34.999
That's a justification based on this assumption,
that these animals are mean.

00:32:34.999 --> 00:32:41.450
Another justification that is made is that
these sows are not able to raise their young.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:45.830
So we have to put them in these crates in
order to protect the babies from the mothers.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.049
They actually believe that they needed to
put them in a-- This is a farrowing crate,

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:51.830
which is where the sows give birth.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:55.380
They have space to stand up and lay down,
and the piglets can nurse through the bars

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.649
when the mother lays down.

00:32:57.649 --> 00:33:02.340
The pig industry says they have to do this
to protect the babies, which is so completely

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:07.840
counterintuitive, that a mother pig or a mother
animal of any species can't raise their young?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.769
But this is something they actually believe.

00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:13.970
It's kinda ludicrous when you think about
it, but this is what they really believe.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.350
Now, a couple years ago, there were floods
in Iowa.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.850
We sent a team out there to rescue some animals.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.100
Many, sadly, died in their crates and never
got out of these factory farms.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.980
But some did.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.820
One of them was a sow named Nikki, who was
pregnant.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.309
She'd been in the gestation crate.

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:32.929
She got out of the farm.

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:38.159
She got onto a levy to give birth, amidst
all this flooding.

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:43.100
Our people were able to find her and her babies
and bring them to Farm Sanctuary.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.139
When we go into the barn with her, do you
think she attacks us like this pig farmer

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:48.009
was describing?

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:51.759
[pause]
That's her with her babies.

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:55.289
That's her with Susie, our shelter director.

00:33:55.289 --> 00:33:56.850
She's not attacking us!

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.399
She knows she's in a safe place!

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:01.840
These animals are not that different than
us.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.580
If you've had a positive experience with somebody,
you're going to welcome that.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:11.750
If you've had a negative experience with somebody,
you're going to be concerned about that.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:16.050
Walking around Farm Sanctuary, it's a beautiful
thing to see these animals literally smile.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.230
They enjoy life.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.900
[pause]
The people that raise these animals on factory

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:30.640
farms become jaded, become used to certain
things.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.720
These are good people, in many cases, just
doing bad things.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.340
Could you imagine what it would be like working
in a slaughterhouse, where for eight hours

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.550
a day, all you're doing is cutting the throats
of animals?

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.990
That does something to you.

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:47.919
That's a brutal, bloody existence of violence,
a violent job.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:52.570
And it's something that I wish nobody had
to do.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.680
Our first campaign to challenge the confinement
of animals in these factory farms was in the

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.110
state of Florida back in 2000-2002.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:06.680
I went to the director of the swine unit at
the University of Florida, where they had

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.620
sows kept in crates.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.510
I talked to him about our desire to protect
these animals.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.040
The first thing he said to me is, "What, you
want to put us out of business?"

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.050
Again, this is the assumption and the fear
that he had.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.620
I said, "Our goal is to prevent suffering."

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.880
And then he started talking to me about all
the reasons why they had to put these sows

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880
in the crates.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.580
The same reasons that this other guy, who
visited our farm, said: "Well, these are aggressive

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.580
animals.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.140
You've got to put them in crates to protect
other animals and people.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.880
The sows crush their babies.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.480
You've got to put them in these crates to
protect the babies."

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:47.120
He also said that today, it's impossible to
be a farmer and to do it the old-fashioned

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120
way.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.800
You had to raise animals in these industrialized
operations in order to be profitable.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.670
So these were all the assumptions he described.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.490
And I countered each one, saying that these
animals don't have to be kept that way.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.500
"We have a farm.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.150
The animals don't need those crates."

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:05.831
In terms of the idea that factory farming
is the only way to make a living, now, there's

00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:10.120
a burgeoning movement towards small farms,
towards farmers' markets.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.450
The number of farms in the US has just started
going back up.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.400
It's because you have these small farms that
are starting to come into existence.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.950
It's a very positive trend.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:25.080
I was talking to him about these things, and
his demeanor changed.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:32.560
He had been combative, but then he became
a little bit more reflective.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.150
He said, "You know what's missing on farms
today?

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.810
Pigmanship.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.060
This real understanding of animals.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:45.410
I've talked to Temple Grandin about this,
too, who is a livestock handling expert, designed

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.990
many systems currently in the use in the US.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:54.620
She says that farmers today, and workers today
on farms, don't understand animals.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.650
That's what this guy keyed in to.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.970
What's missing today is pigmanship.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.530
Then I was getting ready to leave, and the
last thing he said to me was, "You know what

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.530
everybody should see?

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.140
Is a sow build a nest."

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.280
That's one of our guys at our farm with straw
in her mouth, building a nest.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280
They do this.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.710
These animals build nests.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:17.860
Sows, in their natural environment, will raise
their young cooperatively.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.760
They will babysit for each other.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.790
They will gather together to fight off predators.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:28.040
I remember seeing something on the Discovery
Channel a few years ago, where you had these

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.350
wild pigs, mothers and their babies, and this
big cat.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.830
It might have been a leopard or some kind
of big cat.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.610
It came in to try to get one of those babies.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.930
And those mothers fought off that cat.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.420
That cat was lucky to get out alive.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.070
At one point, he's on his back.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.490
So these are fierce protectors of their babies.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.370
Which is a natural, motherly thing to do.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:54.820
But on these factory farms, that is not seen
at all.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:59.140
It's actually seen as an obstacle, because
these industries want to take these babies

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.920
away and fatten them for slaughter.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:08.821
When we confine animals in this way, and treat
animals and exploit them in these ways, there's

00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:12.720
a tendency for us to start rationalizing.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.530
[pause] We put the animals behind bars, and
in some sense, we put ourselves behind bars.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.420
We start thinking things are a certain way.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.150
They don't have to be that way.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:34.720
[pause] What I think is important, now, is
for us not to just be mindless consumers,

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:41.400
but for us to be citizens and to make mindful
choices that are aligned with our own values

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.710
and our own interests.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.890
I think if everybody does that, we're going
to see a huge shift.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:49.520
There are a few quotes here that I like a
lot.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.960
"Each snowflake in an avalanche pleads 'not
guilty.'"

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.360
"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but
no one thinks of changing himself."

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.160
And "How wonderful it is that nobody need
wait a single moment before starting to improve

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.490
the world."

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.040
There's a lot of things in this world that
are outside of our control, that we can't

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.860
do very much about.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.120
But when it comes to what we eat, we all have
a lot of control over that.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.900
We can make choices that can make a world
of difference for other animals and for ourselves

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.830
and for our planet.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:34.370
I love this quote from Margaret Mead. [pause
] You know, the number of vegans in the world

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.490
is pretty small today.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.490
But it's growing.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:39.260
And it's actually not a new idea.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.980
Pythagoras was a vegan thousands of years
ago.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:48.550
Recently, people like Bill Clinton have decided
that eating plants instead of animals makes

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.550
sense.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.190
He's concerned about his health problems,
so he became a vegan.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.630
After reading the books by the experts and
the movie I mentioned before called Forks

00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:02.120
Over Knives, and his health has improved as
a result, Mike Tyson went vegan recently.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.200
He's no longer eating ears, thankfully.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.910
[laughter] I think, with Mike Tyson, what's
really interesting is that, as a kid, he was

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.930
bullied.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.610
Most people don't think about this, but he
was bullied as a kid.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.110
He was younger, and older kids bullied him.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.900
He raised pigeons, and he loved his pigeons.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.050
And then one day, one of these bullies came
in and killed his pigeons.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.540
That's when Mike Tyson became a fighter.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.660
Then he was mentored.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.730
He had good role models.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:31.800
He worked hard.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.360
He achieved.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.380
And then, something happened.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.460
He started probably hanging out with the wrong
people, started--.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.790
The ego, the money, the power, the greed,
all that kind of stuff started.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.680
Hedonism, of all these kinds of things started
playing in.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.120
Kinda lost his way.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.860
And I think, now, he's trying to regain his
way.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:57.240
I don't know him, but just hearing his story,
it could be a story of redemption.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.240
You know?

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.420
Being in one place and then coming out of
it.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.420
He became vegan.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.550
I think that was part of it for him.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:08.340
And then there's people like Ellen DeGeneres,
and more and more folks recognizing the benefits

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:12.840
of eating plants instead of animals.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.870
And each person has to make their own choices.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.800
As I say, I've been a vegan since 1985.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.090
But each of us has to decide, for ourselves,
what feels right.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:29.310
But it's important to actually think about
it, and to be mindful about it, and not to

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.600
mindlessly go along, because that's what everybody
else is doing.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.380
Because that approach has led to enormous
problems over human history.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.560
And I don't need to go into all the types
of bad things us humans have done over the

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.410
years, but in most cases, there's usually
a rationalization of why we had to do it.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.610
People are very good at coming up with good
reasons to do really bad things.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:42:00.750
So it's important to really think about how
we feel when we think about our actions and

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.760
the impacts they have on others.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:09.230
And the thing that makes me so hopeful is
that most people are humane.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.240
Most people are compassionate.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.620
We have empathy.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.620
That's--.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.620
We're hardwired to have empathy.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.300
When you see somebody else hurt, I mean, there's
been science showing this-- it affects us.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.140
And other animals, by the way, have similar
capacities.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.490
When they see others hurt, they feel it.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:29.060
So that empathy suggests our connection with
others.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:34.890
When we act in alignment with that, it's good
for the others, for the other animals, and

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.970
it's good for us.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:41.100
To that idea, all the animals at Farm Sanctuary
say, "Thank you for being here."

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.430
And I'm happy to take any questions anybody
has now.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.580
So thank you all very much.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.580
[applause]

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.400
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Thanks for coming here today.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.630
I thought your talk was super interesting.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:02.940
Sometimes, I hear from the other side that
it's these industrial practices that make

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:08.480
food affordable, and that our population,
much of the population can't really afford

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.060
it unless we grow animals these ways, plants
in weird ways.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.680
What do you think about that?

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.450
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: I think it's an important question.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:21.410
The goal of farming is to feed our world.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.460
The key question is: what is the best way
to feed our world?

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.830
I've spoken at agribusiness conferences about
this specific topic.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.750
My point of view is that, by growing plant
foods instead of animals foods, it's a heck

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.750
of a lot more efficient.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:38.650
To grow animal foods, you need to grow lots
of corn and soybeans.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:44.340
70-80% of the corn and soybeans, or even more,
grown in this country is fed to farm animals.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.940
If we really want to feed people, we should
be growing food for people, not for animals.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.370
It takes a lot more water, a lot more fossil
fuels, a lot more resources to grow animal

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.370
foods.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.060
I was making this case at a group of dairy
farmers once.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.750
They kept coming back to me and saying, "No,
the best way to feed the world is through

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.970
industrial animal production."

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:08.400
And I kept saying, "Well, all the evidence
suggests that it's inefficient.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.640
If we really want to feed the world, we should
be eating more plants.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.730
I asked them, "Where were they getting their
information that animal farming was efficient?"

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.610
They told me the name of the book.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.400
It was called Saving the Planet with Pesticides
and Plastics.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.540
[laughter] That was really the name of the
book.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.670
So it just speaks to our ability to rationalize
and come up with reasons for practically anything.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:32.820
But the idea that healthy food needs to be
expensive is another challenge.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:37.960
I believe that right now, healthy food in
this country is too expensive.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.330
I think one of the reasons for that is because
the demand is so strong, and there's not as

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.770
much of a supply as there needs to be.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.730
But there's simple things we can do.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.910
For instance, instead of grabbing a bag of
potato chips, we can eat a sack of potatoes.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.910
You know?

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.270
[laughs] But then it's a matter of new habits.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:45:00.740
Instead of just getting something, opening,
and eating, there might be some food preparation.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.960
So it's new habits that maybe need to develop.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:09.250
There's another assumption that is: as people
become wealthier, they want to eat more animal

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.870
foods.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.540
That has happened historically.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.230
Is that a good trend?

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.230
I don't think so.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:24.340
[laughs] I think what it speaks to is: with
wealth, tends to come greed, tends to be the

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.370
desire to use more stuff.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.580
And I don't think that that's healthy.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:36.030
I think you have people, now, who have done
very well financially, who are actually deciding

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.220
not to eat animal foods.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.050
John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods, for example,
is a vegan.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:45.330
So you have a very strong market for vegan
foods.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:51.800
There are companies that are selling vegan
foods at a high price because there's a strong

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800
demand.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.100
And I would say the same thing goes for animal
foods that are raised in ways that are not

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.470
as bad as the factory farms.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.580
Cage free, free range eggs, things like this.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.400
Those tend to sound a lot better than they
are.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.810
"Free range" only requires animals have access
to the outdoors.

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:11.290
But "access" isn't defined.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:15.510
So you can literally have animals in a warehouse,
with a small door that goes to a crummy little

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.290
paddock.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:18.980
And that's "access to the outdoors."

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.650
That's "free range."

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:24.230
And again, you have such a strong demand,
such strong opposition to factory farming

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:31.210
now, that people are selling products like
that and making them-- making a lot of money

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:38.390
by [pause] exploiting that market, really.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.070
So the food business is evolving.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.270
I think the best way to get food is at farmers'
markets.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.810
The closer we can get to the source of our
food, the better.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:52.520
The further removed we are, the more chances
there are for us to not really know what we're

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520
getting.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520
[pause] Yeah.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:00.550
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I'm just curious: do the animals
ever fight?

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.690
I could imagine if you have bulls or something
on-- even in the sanctuary, is that a problem

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.690
that you have?

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.390
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: You know, the animals at Farm
Sanctuary do sometimes have issues about who's

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.910
supposed to sleep where.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.440
So they will sometimes push against each other.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.260
But they set up their own social system.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.060
They create their own mores and their own
rules.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.080
So they do-- They have very rich emotional
lives and social lives.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.270
So yes, they will sometimes skirmish.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.040
But they usually work out their difficulties
and differences.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.050
[pause] Yeah.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.320
&gt;&gt;Male #2: A question, you were sorta talking
about this a little bit.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.630
What about-- What do you see in the political
side and the subsidies, because I know they

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.120
have a lot to do with what you were mentioning.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.710
A lot of the corn and beans being fed to animals.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:46.450
We know there's a lot of subsidies going to
corn farmers.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:51.370
So, I mean, are there a couple of things that
you see, from the political standpoint, from

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.240
the lobby standpoint, that are big issues?

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.240
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Yeah.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.610
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And related to that, I guess we're
in election time, so to put you on the spot:

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:03.510
do you see the way the different candidates
or different parties are addressing any of

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:04.510
those?

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.960
And if you were voting strictly on that, how
would you go?

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.700
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.840
[laughs] [laughter] Oh man.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.840
Agribusiness is so entrenched.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.990
Federal monies and supports favor the existing
system, the status quo.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.640
I've worked on legislation for a long time,
will continue doing so.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.050
But we usually can only make modest reforms.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:32.730
And we will continue working on legislation,
but I'm increasingly coming to believe that

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:35.700
the marketplace is where a lot of the change
is going to happen.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:41.080
We see more vegan restaurants, more farmers'
markets, community-supported agriculture programs,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.740
community gardens.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:48.560
The political process is so disheartening,
I'm sorry to say.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.820
It's important to be involved.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820
It's important to vote.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.580
It's important to let our concerns be known.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.930
But we're up against an industry, when it
comes to animal agriculture, that is so entrenched.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.800
I mean, they don't pay property taxes in certain
areas.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.320
They have preferential access to water.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.760
They can pollute it without having to clean
it up.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.370
Taxpayers clean it up.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:12.840
And there's not a lot of transparency.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:19.640
So I wish I could give you a great news that
we've got somebody and they're fighting, but

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:29.030
both parties are pretty well entrenched in
the whole industry thing.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:32.150
I would just say it's important to let our
concerns be known.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:39.940
Usually, the lawmakers who tend to support
animal welfare legislation and legislation

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.080
that promotes a healthier food system tend
to come from urban areas.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.480
There's some really good things happening
in New York right now, dealing with the soda

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.190
pop and, you know.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.620
So there's some positives.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.640
A lot of that, though, may happen at the local
level, which could then eventually filter

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.270
up to the national level.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:01.950
But nationally, you have agriculture committees
that are controlled by lawmakers who represent

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.830
agricultural districts.

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:09.310
There was one, in fact, that recently introduced
legislation who tried to nullify state laws

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.280
protecting farm animals, because we've been
able to pass some of those over the past ten

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.280
years.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.260
So you have these federal legislators that
are so entrenched.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:22.630
They tend to have a lot of control over the
committees that address these type of policies.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.100
I think a lot's going to happen more locally.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.640
And I can't really comment on who I would
vote for.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.640
[laughs] But you know.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.640
Yeah.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.410
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I have a question for you about
vegetarianism and veganism.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:42.540
You described a lot of how animals are treated
cruelly and how they are killed.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.080
Now, I'm vegetarian, and I'm trying to understand:
if I'm a vegetarian and don't become a vegan,

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.870
is there a way for me to avoid animal cruelty,
or is it just a given that any milk product

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.180
that's created is a product of cruelty?

00:50:54.180 --> 00:51:01.300
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Well, in commercial production,
the animals are seen more as commodities,

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.780
production units, than as living creatures.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:09.040
So on modern dairies, the cows have a calf
every year, the calf is taken away.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.170
In commercial production, I would say that
cruelty is inherent.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:18.161
Now, it's conceivable that if somebody had
a pet cow, and the cow had a calf, and you

00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:21.230
shared the milk, theoretically, that could
work.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:25.140
But, in a commercial operation, you can't
have that calf there because they're taking

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.280
some of the milk.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:32.380
And also, when a calf nurses, he nurses regu--,
like 12 times a day or so.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.140
So that makes it so the cow actually produces
less milk.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.170
What they do on modern dairies is they suck
'em dry, and then they fill up with milk again,

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.640
and they suck 'em dry.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.310
That's the way to maximize production.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:47.610
Having a calf suckling is going to lessen
the production of the cow.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:52.370
But theoretically, a person could have cow's
milk, sharing it with the calf.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.170
But a bigger question, too, is: do we need
cow's milk?

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.370
[laughs] You know?

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:58.050
We can live without it.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.730
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Does organic farming play a role
at all in this?

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:04.160
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Organic falls into that same
category of "sounds better than it is."

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.040
A lot of these organic labels sound better
than they are.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.780
And again, you have the calf taken away.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.280
It's an inherent problem.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.200
[pause] That's what I'd say about that.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.390
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.040
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Thanks.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040
Yeah.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.230
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.880
First, I just wanted to tell you what an inspiration
you are, because I've followed a lot of organizations,

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.230
animal rights organizations over the years,
and yours is, by far, I think one of the few

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.390
that actually treats animals as individuals,
which is great.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.390
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Ah, thanks.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:34.390
&gt;&gt;[Female #3]: My question's around messaging
some of this stuff, because being a vegetarian

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:42.290
or a vegan, you tend to get a lot of questions.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:47.060
And one that I haven't been able to come up
with a good answer to, it's sorta bizarre

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:52.440
if you are thinking of animals as individuals,
but the question is: if everybody goes vegetarian,

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.690
where do all the factory farm animals go?

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:55.690
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: [laughs] Right.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.840
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Do you have any suggestions about
responding?

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.970
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: In our country, we raise nine
billion.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:01.970
So it's a huge number.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.310
That's more than there are people on the planet.

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.090
There's a lot of animals.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:08.370
But the majority of those are the chickens
that are raised for meat.

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.990
They only live about six weeks.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.990
So they're--.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.030
And they're being mass produced.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.780
The reason we have so many is they're being
mass produced.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:21.030
It's not likely we're going to have a vegan
world overnight.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:25.010
So the chance of having nine billion animals,
at any one time, is very unlikely.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:29.080
Plus, we don't have that many alive at any
one time, because they're killed at every

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.080
six weeks.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.450
So just do the math on that, there's only
maybe a billion or so, whatever it is, alive

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:35.450
at any one time.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.060
We don't have the nine billion alive at any
one time.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.810
But change happens incrementally.

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.170
It's likely that--.

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:46.050
And we are starting to see, in fact, that
as people eat fewer animals--.

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.620
And the number of animals being killed for
consumption in the US has stared going down

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.060
a couple years ago.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.970
Very positive trend.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:55.670
The market will respond.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:58.620
Producers will stop breeding them.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.830
These animals have been mass produced, genetically
bred, artificially inseminated.

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:07.790
So as the people start eating fewer, they're
going to stop producing so many.

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:13.240
A concern, though, I have is that there's
also, potentially, a push for export.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.780
Like with the tobacco industry.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.650
When there was more awareness and people were
saying, "I don't want to smoke cigarettes

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:20.290
in this country," there was a push to export
it.

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.920
And that's a concern right now.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.400
There's this push to export these habits.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:31.230
But I think that, in response, basically,
the industry will respond to the market.

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:34.220
And it is doing so already, in terms of killing
fewer animals.

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:41.751
Now, the export issue is an aside, but the
market is going to, I think, ultimately, push

00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:44.250
the industry in a better direction.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.050
And it's starting to happen.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.050
Yeah.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.680
&gt;&gt;Male #3: First, thanks for coming.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.180
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Oh, yeah.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:56.060
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I went to the sanctuary, and I
really enjoyed it.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.060
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Oh, great.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.330
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I took my daughter.

00:54:58.330 --> 00:54:59.330
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: Great.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:02.850
&gt;&gt;Male #3: A question that I have is: there
are many organizations that take care of animals,

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:09.720
but I never saw on TV a good commercial that
actually explained what we have to say.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.880
Is there a reason for this?

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.890
&gt;&gt;Gene Baur: [sighs] Well, one of the reasons
that we don't have television commercials

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:20.790
with our message out far and wide is it costs
so much.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.920
We've worked on campaigns to ban certain cruel
practices.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.680
We've done this to the initiative process,
where we get commercials on television for

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.050
about a three week period of time.

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.850
And it will cost millions of dollars.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.570
But it's a very focused effort.

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:42.090
[pause] Meanwhile, McDonalds and the dairy
industry and all fast food businesses are

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.870
pushing their message over and over again.

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:47.640
We're just not able to compete financially.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:55.940
So we need to figure out how to get our message
out far and wide, inexpensively and efficiently.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:02.270
I think that's where a place like Google [laughs]
or the internet is an enormous new tool.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:07.210
And that's another thing that gives me great
hope for change, because with education and

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.760
awareness comes change.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.540
But we're just not able to afford it, is the
simple answer to that question why we don't

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.530
have these commercials all over the place.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.530
Sure.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:17.820
All right.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.890
Well, any other questions?

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:22.620
[pause] Cool.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.410
Well, thank you all so much.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:28.220
I'm happy to answer any more questions if
you have them, and sign books.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.010
Thank you all very much for coming today.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.830
[applause]
