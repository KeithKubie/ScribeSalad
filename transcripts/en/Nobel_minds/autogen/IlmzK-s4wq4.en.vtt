I think I can tell you something about

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
I think I can tell you something about
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.230
I think I can tell you something about

was kind of a general theory we were not
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.050
was kind of a general theory we were not
sure to what it would apply actually we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
sure to what it would apply actually we
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.609
sure to what it would apply actually we
thought first he would apply to the

thought first he would apply to the
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.670
thought first he would apply to the
strong forces which was a mistake but we

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
strong forces which was a mistake but we
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730

then realized that is by 2 electron with
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.080
then realized that is by 2 electron with
horses but we didn't make the theory

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
horses but we didn't make the theory

important in which we were completely
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.740
important in which we were completely
aware of from the beginning which is the

was also a Nobel Prize all of these were

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
was also a Nobel Prize all of these were
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.920

do what we constructed as a theory but

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
do what we constructed as a theory but
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969
do what we constructed as a theory but
of course there's a lot of things to be

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
of course there's a lot of things to be
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980
of course there's a lot of things to be
added to get all of that and it took

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
added to get all of that and it took
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.280
added to get all of that and it took
time and well and the point is that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
time and well and the point is that
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.889
time and well and the point is that
after let's say 83 1983 when will

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
after let's say 83 1983 when will
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.639
after let's say 83 1983 when will
discover the W and the Z we were totally

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
discover the W and the Z we were totally
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.510
discover the W and the Z we were totally
convinced that the theory was true but

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
convinced that the theory was true but
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.230
convinced that the theory was true but
there was still an alternative either it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
there was still an alternative either it
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.410
there was still an alternative either it
was mediated by a condensate of objects

put both hypotheses and didn't know

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
put both hypotheses and didn't know
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.560
put both hypotheses and didn't know
which one is the right one and at that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
which one is the right one and at that
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.070

moment in 83 it was Dylan to which was

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
moment in 83 it was Dylan to which was
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.550
moment in 83 it was Dylan to which was
the right one and it is the discovery

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
the right one and it is the discovery

turn that would select the right one

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
turn that would select the right one
 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.200
turn that would select the right one
which is one of the two hypotheses we

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210
which is one of the two hypotheses we
 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.230
which is one of the two hypotheses we
put in 1864 so I have a bit deviated

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240
put in 1864 so I have a bit deviated
 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.020
put in 1864 so I have a bit deviated
from your question which is when do we

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
from your question which is when do we
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.210
from your question which is when do we
realize of course we didn't realize all

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
realize of course we didn't realize all
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.060
realize of course we didn't realize all
of that that's obvious but we realize

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070
of that that's obvious but we realize
 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.020
of that that's obvious but we realize
that I think it was a break too because

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
that I think it was a break too because
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.120
that I think it was a break too because
we thought that for the first time

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
we thought that for the first time
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.410
we thought that for the first time
there's a way to understand how

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
there's a way to understand how

that we went to a cafe that I still see

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790
that we went to a cafe that I still see
 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.810
that we went to a cafe that I still see
very well and we ordered the bottle of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820
very well and we ordered the bottle of
 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.590
very well and we ordered the bottle of
champagne and we said and that was I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600
champagne and we said and that was I

think we had died we were convinced by

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660
think we had died we were convinced by
 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.800
think we had died we were convinced by
the way we did it we didn't have a proof

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
the way we did it we didn't have a proof
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.470
the way we did it we didn't have a proof
at that time that it was consistent

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
at that time that it was consistent
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.240
at that time that it was consistent
quantum mechanically but the way we

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
quantum mechanically but the way we
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.070
quantum mechanically but the way we
constructed it which is very beautiful

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080
constructed it which is very beautiful
 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.600
constructed it which is very beautiful
at that time based on Oscar field theory

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610
at that time based on Oscar field theory
 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.810
at that time based on Oscar field theory
and we had the impression that that at

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
and we had the impression that that at
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.950
and we had the impression that that at
the end would work and so we we

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960
the end would work and so we we
 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.500
the end would work and so we we
celebrated we might have celebrated

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510
celebrated we might have celebrated
 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.750
celebrated we might have celebrated
wrongly but at least

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760
wrongly but at least
 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.250
wrongly but at least
we brought the champagne and it was fine
