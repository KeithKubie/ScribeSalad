00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.343
we already talked about the feudal system,

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:07.021
how you can have a king

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.986
and then you might have
some vassals of the king

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:14.050
who give an oath of fealty to the king

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.455
in the homage or homage ceremony,

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.159
might be a duke.

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.032
And you could keep going down this.

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:23.267
Maybe you have a count,

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.533
maybe you have a baron,

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.585
and could keep going down
this chain of nobility

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:31.672
where one noble is pledging fealty

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:33.504
to the king as a king's vassal,

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:36.044
but then they are a
lord of another vassal.

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:38.048
And you keep going all the way down

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:41.203
until you get to a plot of land

00:00:41.203 --> 00:00:43.762
where the actual work might occur.

00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.540
And that term is often
referred to as a manor.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.760
A manor just doesn't happen

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.302
at the bottom of this pyramid.

00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:52.051
A duke can have a manor

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.525
and they can split up
the rest of their duchy

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.080
and give sections of it to form counties

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.151
that could be led by counts.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.937
But what we're going
to focus in this video

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:02.722
is the manor itself,

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:06.057
because that's where life
in a medieval community

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:08.575
actually takes place.

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:11.943
And the work on a manor
is done essentially

00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:14.094
by the lowest rung of the ladder

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.594
and that is both free peasants

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.433
and also by serfs.

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.342
To get a sense of what a medieval manor

00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:24.803
could have looked like,

00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:26.041
here's a picture and this would've been

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.183
a particularly fancy
manor right over here.

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:31.215
This is a ducal manor,

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:34.338
so this would have been
the manor of a duke,

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:36.820
so it could be something
like that right over there.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.211
And in this picture,
you see the manor house

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.487
which in this case is the duke's castle,

00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:44.288
in many medieval communities
were the highest ranking

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.653
of the nobility right beneath the king.

00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:49.375
And so we see these people
actually working the field.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.918
We don't know from looking up at them,

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:53.234
some of them might be free peasants,

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:56.971
maybe this gentleman right
over here is a free peasant.

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.666
And this person right over here is a serf.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:04.833
The word of serf comes
from the Latin for service,

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:11.089
the same word that eventually
gives us words like servant

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.375
and they're someplace in between
a free peasant and a slave.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.723
They are bonded to the lord of the manor.

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:20.356
In this case it would be a duke,

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:21.742
but you can go down this hierarchy,

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.886
you could have a manor
where the lord is a baron

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:26.493
or the lord is a knight,

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:29.056
or the lord is just
someone who is very wealthy

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:32.563
and somehow got access to a fiefdom.

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:34.813
So the serfs are bonded to the land.

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:36.854
They can't leave without their permission.

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:38.811
They are allowed to cultivate

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:41.343
certain tracts of land themselves,

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:44.442
but they also have to work for their lord.

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:47.422
So they might help plant
crops and harvest crops

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:49.340
in the lord's land as well

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.750
and they also give a
percentage of everything

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.000
that they grow or everything that they do

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.288
to the actual lord.

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:58.245
And if the lord needs to go into war,

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.554
they might have to be
soldiers in that war.

00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:03.513
You might be wondering,
well that sounds pretty bad,

00:03:03.513 --> 00:03:06.697
it sounds similar to being a slave.

00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:08.944
One of the key differences is that a serf

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:11.764
actually can accumulate
things on their own.

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:14.985
They can actually own property.

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:16.859
Now another term or sometimes

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.457
a subcategorization of
serf in the Middle Ages

00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:22.419
is the term villain.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.847
I know what you're thinking,

00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:26.133
you have heard that term before.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:29.276
The villain today means a bad guy.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:32.465
But the term originally
comes from the Roman Empire

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.508
when Diocletian, the famous emperor

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:37.737
who persecuted Christians, he also,

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:38.799
because they were having trouble

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.299
getting labor in rural villas,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.802
he began to decree that certain people

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:46.969
had to work in the villas.

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:52.107
And so someone who was
compelled to work at a villa

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.907
was called a villain,

00:03:53.907 --> 00:03:55.620
and so they were bonded to the land.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.399
They were a type of serf.

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.647
Now the fact that villain in English,

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:02.980
it means someone who is bad,

00:04:03.832 --> 00:04:06.365
it gives you an idea how
in a lot of languages

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:07.631
in a lot of cultures,

00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:11.469
the notion of being
captive or bonded and poor

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.956
gets associated with being bad

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:18.609
which seems very contrary to
our modern view of the world.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.572
Get a top-level view of what
a manor might look like.

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:26.412
We don't know what type of
manor this is in particular,

00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:29.513
but the manor house here
seems a little bit more humble

00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:31.350
than this ducal manor right over here.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.578
This could be a,

00:04:32.578 --> 00:04:34.868
maybe a baron's manor house.

00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:37.646
Now the manner often had a village.

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:40.531
This is where the serfs
or the free peasants

00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:43.242
might live, keep their homes.

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:44.910
And then you see the land that is

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.745
cultivated collectively by this community,

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.398
not just the actors that
we've just talked about,

00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:52.016
you might also have a church or monastery

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.516
on that manor right over here.

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.361
And these strips of land,

00:04:57.361 --> 00:04:59.282
they might have different crops.

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:02.225
And the output of those
crops go to different people.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:06.063
The one common factor
is the lord of the manor

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:08.957
might get all of the crops
from some of these strips,

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:10.385
while on the other strips,

00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:11.544
they get the taxation.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.309
So they'll get a certain
percentage from the crops there.

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.256
But all of the work is done by the serfs

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:19.705
and the free peasants and
possibly if there some,

00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:20.938
if this is a monastery,

00:05:20.938 --> 00:05:23.880
and there's some monks at the monastery.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.496
Now one interesting thing is why

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:28.897
you often see in these manor maps,

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:31.259
these long strips of land,

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.009
and our resident agricultural expert

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.830
at Khan Academy, David Rheinstrom,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.813
says it's because the medieval
plows once you got going,

00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:40.148
you didn't want to turn them around,

00:05:40.148 --> 00:05:41.528
you got some momentum.

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:44.818
And so people liked the plant
crops in these long strips

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:48.757
so the plows could just
keep going in one direction

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:49.698
and only at the end,

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:50.747
they just have to turn it around.

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:52.659
So you're minimizing the number of times

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.704
that you actually have
to turn around to plow.
