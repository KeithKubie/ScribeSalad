00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.500
Now that the module has been created, we
can use it to bootstrap the application.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.810
To bootstrap our app,
we need the attribute ng-app and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.800
set it equal to the name of the module,
which is udsc MealsApp.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.405
Using Yeomen to scaffold our
project has helped us out again,

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:20.230
because it automatically added
the code to bootstrap the app for us.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.680
The code right here is
called the directive.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.510
This is a mini preview on directives,
but they're awesome and very powerful.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.550
When Angular loads, it scans your
HTML for this specific directive.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.680
You can only use ng-app once and
it tells Angular two things.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.270
First, this element
contains your application.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.830
You can put this anywhere, but if we put
it on a div somewhere down in the page

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.050
then Angular will only be
loaded inside that div.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.679
Second, it tells Angular to load
the Udsc MealsApp module and

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.683
all the components that it contains.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.958
There are some other things to
be aware of when using ng-app.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.750
Look in the instructor notes for
details.
