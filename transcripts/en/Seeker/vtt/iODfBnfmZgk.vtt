00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.540
Put down that sparkling water, those bubbles
might ruin your smile.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.540
Hi guys, Crystal here for DNews

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.820
Not all bubbly water is created equal: sparkling
is pure carbonated water, club soda has added

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.750
salts, tonic water can contain sugar, and
many flavored mineral waters contain additional

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.810
acids, salt, and sugar.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.450
So are they all bad for you?

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.869
How unhealthy can water be?

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.390
In the past few years sales of carbonated
water products has doubled in the US and for

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
those of us that are drinking at least a bottle
of fizzy water a day, the internet has concerns

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.469
that those delightful bubbles are leaching
calcium out of our bones, contributing to

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.950
tooth decay, and even make us gain weight
. Now, I’m sure that anyone who has the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.190
self awareness to acknowledge a habit that
isn’t exactly performed in moderation has

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.899
probably at some point asked themselves the
question: “how bad is this?”

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.300
Well, as usual science says…

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.600
“It depends”

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.290
When a liquid beverage contains bubbles it’s
usually the result of carbonation.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.899
In alcoholic beverages that carbonation is
a natural byproduct of fermentation, but in

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.990
water, it’s usually just carbon dioxide
gas some chemist forced to dissolve in water

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.179
using low temperature and high pressure.

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.549
When this happens, it makes my favorite molecule:
carbonic acid, H2CO3!

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.929
That hissing sound you hear when you open
a new bottle of sparkling water is the release

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.380
of pressure that keeps the gas dissolved and
the delightful effervescence you drink is

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.740
the result of carbonic acid rushing to a new
equilibrium by decomposing into carbon dioxide

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.740
(g) and water (l).

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.599
Now, we know acidic foods erode tooth enamel,
so if carbonation comes from acid, how bad

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.049
is that for our teeth?

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.621
Well, flavored carbonated waters have the
mild acidity of a fruit juice and they are

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.579
not nearly as corrosive as acidic soft drinks
(you may call them pop or colas).

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.239
A study in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation
goes as far to suggest that sparkling water

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.429
can be considered a “safe alternative”
to sugared soft drinks, which have pH values

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.359
that come close to the digestive levels of
stomach acid!

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.429
It has also been thought that carbonic acid
in fizzy drinks was contributing to loss of

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.379
bone calcium and increased risk for osteoporosis
but recently it was shown that the caffeine

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.360
and phosphoric acids found in colas could
be the real culprit.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.069
In fact, some mineral waters that contain
calcium salts could be considered good for

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.549
your bones!

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.060
Carbonation has been blamed for causing a
variety of complaints including irritable

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.950
bowel syndrome (IBS) and weight gain.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.120
In most cases it is the additives like mineral
salts, flavorings, and sugars that are to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180
blame for the reported adverse effects.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.879
But IBS is one of the few cases where the
bubbles truly are the culprit.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.110
Even so, carbonation can exacerbate IBS, it
doesn’t cause the disease.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.470
So, sugared drinks like sodas are still bad
for you, carbonated water is a healthier alternative

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.390
to soft drinks but flat water is still better,
and you should read the label of your bubbly

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.150
beverage before you check out at the grocery
store.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.200
Also, remember: carbonic acid is kind of like
that one friend in your social group, unstable

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.269
but innocuous.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.010
And only unhealthy when other elements are
added to the mix.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.920
Now that you know how to be an informed seltzer
drinker, watch this video by Trace about why

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.189
we like those bubbles so very much.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.100
It isn’t what you’d think.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:25.640
Guys, do you 
have any science questions?

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.980
What should we look into next?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.859
