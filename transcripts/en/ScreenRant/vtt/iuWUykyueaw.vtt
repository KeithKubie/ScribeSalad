00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.300
With its flare for nudity, murder, incest
and so much more; Game of Thrones is not a

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.160
TV show that is known for its lightheartedness.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.769
Still the show runners do like to toss in
a few Easter Eggs throughout the show for

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.250
their viewers to enjoy.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.930
With the shows passionate fan base, even a
subtle reference has been discovered and talked

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.930
about.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.789
Make sure to give us a like as we reveal an
Easter Egg you didn’t know about in your

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.640
favorite show with Dragons.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.500
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Incredible
Easter Eggs Hidden In Game of Thrones

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.280
“Dragonslayer” Dragon

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.420
Disney’s 1981 film, Dragonslayer is about
a young “wizarding” apprentice that’s

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.670
sent to kill a dragon who has a taste for
eating young girls.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.360
That plot line could even work in Game of
Thrones, and maybe that’s why the writer

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.340
George R.R. Martin mentioned his favorite
fantasy film character in season one.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.730
When Daenerys’ annoying brother Viserys
tried to impress Doreah, he told her the names

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.050
all of the dragon skulls that were once kept
in the Red Keep.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:08.440
One is named Vermithrax, the dragon from Dragonslayer.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.710
President George W. Bush’s Head

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.060
Game of Thrones is one of the most expensive
shows on television, each episode in season

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
six cost upwards of 10 million dollars; so
finding ways to save costs are essential to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.229
the show runners.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.150
In season one when Joffrey Baratheon forces
Sansa Stark to look at her father’s head

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.690
on a spike you can see president George W.
Bush’s head.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.680
The show runners insisted that it was not
a political statement but just a way to reuse

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680
props.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.940
Still HBO released an apology and vowed to
remove the head from future releases.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.119
Tyrion’s Nose

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.770
At the end of Season two, Tyrion Lannister
is attacked by Ser Mandon and slashed across

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.560
his face leaving a scare.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.990
Before Tyrion can be killed, his squire, Podrick
Payne kills Ser Mandon saving the fan favorite

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.990
character.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.909
After he heals Tyrion’s sister, Cersei tells
him that she wanted to see his face because

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.200
she was told he had lost his nose.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.310
This is a reference to the books where Tyrion
had lost his nose but in the show it was more

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.670
cost effective for them just to give him a
scar.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.970
It works for us!

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.239
Gandalf's Blade

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.800
The War of the Five Kings is the civil war
that exploded after King Robert died and everyone

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
wanted a seat on the Iron Throne.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.480
With all of these kings fighting we wonder
if any of them notice the swords on the chair.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.950
One bears a striking resemblance to Gandalf's
blade, Glamdring from Lord of the Rings while

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.890
another one looks like Orlando Bloom’s sword
from the film Kingdom of Heaven.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.880
Was this done as homage or just another way
to save production costs by reusing props?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.730
Peter Dinklage's Ghost

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.750
We don’t mean his spiritual ghost but the
Ghost that Peter Dinklage voiced for the video

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.150
game Destiny.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.200
Dinklage was fired as the voice of the Ghost
due to his “boring narration” and replaced

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.570
by Nolan North.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.190
In a scene from Game of Thrones there is a
window behind Dinklage that holds a strong

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.340
resemblance to the ghost shape.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.489
No one involved in the show has verified this
but it sure does look very familiar.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.040
Was this a Destiny Easter Egg?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.840
Or just a fancy window design?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.360
Let us know what you think in the comments.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360
The Title Sequence

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.040
It is easy to ignore or fast forward through
the opening credits because it appears to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.510
be the same each time.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.540
If you actually watch it, you can see it is
not the same.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.099
That’s because the show is displaying the
different lands that we are going to visit

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.370
in that episode.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.540
If Tyrion is in Kings Landing at the last
5 seconds of the episode we will see Kings

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.680
Landing in the opening title sequence.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.090
Put down the remote and take a look next time.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.640
R+L=J

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.769
One of the most popular fan theories for Game
of Thrones has to do with the parents of Jon

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:45.769
Snow.

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.590
This theory believes that Jon Snow is not
Ned Stark's son, but is the son of Rhaegar

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.730
Targaryen and Ned's sister Lyanna.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.930
The show runners knew how popular this theory
was and decided to add an Easter Egg in the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.670
first season referencing it.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.950
You can see a “RL” carved out on a wall
right next to Jon Snow.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.450
Maybe they are telling us something.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.819
Jon Snow’s Hobbit Friends

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.450
Speaking of Jon Snow did you know his friends
were named after another famous book series?

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.340
George R.R. Martin is a fan of The Lord of
the Rings books and has read them through

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.720
and through numerous times.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.280
He has also admitted to pulling inspiration
from the books as he wrote his stories.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.130
Jon Snow’s best friends at The Wall are
named Sam and Pyp (pronounced Pip).

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:39.310
Do these names sound familiar to your little
hobbit ears?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.410
Littlefinger Predicts Death

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.479
Petyr Baelish, aka Littlefinger keeps surprising
us in every season, whether he is betraying

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.940
Ned Stark or getting closer to the throne.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.380
In season four he predicts the death of three
characters and on top of that in the order

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.380
he states them.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.480
He says to young Robin Arryn that, “people
die at their dinner tables, they die in their

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.530
beds, they die squatting over their chamber
pots.”

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.500
These words clearly foreshadow the deaths
of Joffrey, Shae, and Tywin, who died at a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:19.470
dinner table, in a bed, and on the toilet,
respectively.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.360
Daenerys’ Champion Insulted with Monty Python
Joke

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.530
In the scene where the Meereenese rider challenged
Daenerys’ champion he shouts at them.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.550
Nathalie Emmanuel translates the insults that
the rider barks and he even pees in Daenerys’

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.759
general direction.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.320
According to the shows linguist David J. Peterson,
he is actually shouting insults from Monty

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.990
Python and the Holy Grail including, “Your
mother was a hamster.”

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.419
If you caught that one, you better be looking
for a job as a linguist because only the producer

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.520
and Peterson knew what they were doing since
the language is made up for the show.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.820
What do you think of our video?

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.560

eggs from Game of Thrones?
