00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.400
In order to find out how much
Melissa's carpet would cost,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.590
you calculated the area of
the room she needed to carpet.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.460
You probably didn't even think about
the formula for calculating area.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.820
You might not have even realized
you were calculating area at all,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.540
you might have just followed your
intuition about how to find the cost of

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.810
carpeting the room.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.850
But you did, in fact,
find the area of a square.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.030
So, what do you think the formula is for
the area of a square?

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.010
L equals the length of
one side of the square.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.310
Is it L plus L plus L plus L,
4L, LxL, or L squared?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.270
Select all that apply.
