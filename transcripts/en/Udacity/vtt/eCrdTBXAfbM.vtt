00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.733
So, here's a summary of what we learned over the last two quizzes. We found a

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:09.521
general expression for the sum of two cubes and a general expression for the

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:14.447
difference of two cubes. We can see here that each of these factorized forms has

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:19.199
a binomial, a polynomial with 2 terms, multiplied by a trinomial, a polynomial

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.993
with 3 terms. The binomial that's involved in the factorization of each

00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:29.353
expression, has the same sign between its two terms, as the original expression

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:34.355
did between its two terms. So, y cubed plus z cubed has a factor of y plus z and

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:38.566
y cubed minus z cubed as a factor of y minus z. The middle term of each

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:43.384
trinomial, each quadratic expression, has a sign opposite that original sign

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:48.297
between the terms. See we have a minus yc in the adding up the cubes and plus yc

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:53.215
in the subtracting. Other than that, these factorizations are the same. So, now

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:57.679
that we have this wonderful general framework for dealing with the sum and

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.407
differences of cubes, let's put it into action. Let's look at the expression x

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:07.168
cubed minus 8. Now, compared with the general equations that we were looking at

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:11.776
before, what in this case is playing the role of y, and what is playing the role

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:12.080
of z?
