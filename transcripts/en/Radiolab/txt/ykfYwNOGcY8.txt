Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Listening to radio lab radio from W. N. Y. S. T. Yup. N. N. P. R. Okay. Hello. Hello? Hello. Hello. How are you? We are super, super excited to talk with you. Oh, same. And me, I'm sorry about the delay and so, oh, it's fine. No, it wasn't busy days. Life is crazy. Life is crazy. I know. But uh, you were so enthusiastic, so I just, I need to talk to these guys. They really mean it. This is Alex Alexandre. Gemar Gundam. Are you Norwegian all the way back? Yeah. Typical Norwegian, you know, if typical includes things like biking in Sahara and climbing Everest and things like that. He's kind of a, a professional adventurer. And we got him into the studio because he made a video last year on one of his trips. I tell you this video, it's maybe the most amazing Internet video I have ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       I think so too.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       So let me just set the scene for you. Okay. What you see in the video is this Guy Alex kind of moving along this, he's on skis, this snowy snow scape. Hmm. He's filming himself. He's got the camera in his right hand. Where is he exactly? Antarctica. Oh, he's on a three month track to the South Pole and back by himself. And what he'd been doing is every couple of days on his trip, you know, every 200 kilometers. And so he would bury stuff in the snow, some, some fuel and uh, and sometimes a little bit of gear that I didn't use. Was that just to lighten your load? Yeah. You know, cause every ounce of unneeded weight has to go. So in this video, it's date 86, almost three months since I left. That's three months of walking 10 hours a day and I lost almost 25 kilos. 55 pounds. He's exhausted.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       he's come upon his last cash. So on the last cash where this video is captured, what you see is Alex Neil in the snow start to dig about lockdown. I'm telling you that I'm quite hungry. Whatever's in this last cash and the snow, it's been three months since he buried it. So I didn't really recall what was there. [inaudible] he helps it sound good. So he digs up this bag of stuff, starts rifling through it. There's a it and [inaudible]. It's gasoline, some zinc ointment. It's just a mess.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       Nothing. It's pretty much all press.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       Excuse me. [inaudible] okay, but then, Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:02:54       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:02:55       yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       he holds up. She struggles devil back of cheese doodles. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:03:10       Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       then he throws it up in the air. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:03:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       and then this is, this is my favorite part. He just freezes and he's staring off into the distance. Almost like, did that happen on red color? Is it real? So he starts to dig some more and then

Speaker 4:          00:03:38       bye bye. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       look, look. This time huge chocolate bar. It's milk chocolate and then it's just like he finds the mentos. I find [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:03:53       more and more and more.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Have you ever been that happy in your life? Well, I've been thinking about that. How? When did you shout last time you were so happy. I think that's why we've been watching this video over and over again because none of us can remember. It's like what stands between you and that feeling is a really interesting question. Yeah. It's a free mounts with hunger. Actually, I think the reason I liked this video so much is not just because he's happy. He said he somehow stumbled into this moment of perfection. It's just like a perfect situation by being so tired and so hungry and finding such a stash of candy that he had forgotten that he left. He created a moment of just absolute complete bliss.

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       in this hour on Radiolab, we're going to be searching for moments like Alex had up in Antarctica. We're going to be searching for bliss, bliss of all different sorts,

Speaker 6:          00:05:05       perfect moments, perfect worlds kind of blistered slips right through your fingers and the kind of bliss that just might last and last.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       All right, we're going to begin with a story that, uh, kind of inspired this show. We would have never done a show about the word bliss, where it not for the following story, which is about a bliss. A, what do you mean a battle? That'll make sense in just a second. A story comes from our producer Tim Howard, and it begins with a box of tapes. Uh, alright, so check it out. This is in my office. And you've got a rectangular package here. What is, what is a very old looking box? Doesn't look like much. It's just about like 15 cassettes. Tip Number six, singing and playing to friends in America. No, Yo.

Speaker 7:          00:06:00       Uh, okay. So this is Charles Charles Casey yield bliss, an amazing character. And that's Richard Richard Juror. He's a fellow who gave me the cassettes. You as a friend of Charles. Yeah. So these were just like sitting in his attic or something, garage. He looked like, I suppose a little gnome, a little leprechaun almost to live. He was short, bald and laughter the whole time. He was a lovable character. Simple as that. This is my favorite one. [inaudible] Nicholas. Yet we just like, just explain why we're talking about this guy. Sure. Because these tapes tell an amazing story about a guy who really embodied his name

Speaker 8:          00:06:42       and he tried to save the world, but ultimately just tried too hard

Speaker 9:          00:06:49       the donor would follow to avoid to my life. Kay. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:06:53       Hey, we can start the story here. This is from a lecture that he gave decades later. So the story goes, it's 1908 and he's a little kid living in what's now the Ukraine. Okay. And His name is Carl blitz, not terrace buss, not Charles Bliss, Carl Blitz, B. L. I. T. Z. That's his original name. And a little Carl was fascinated by a tales of discovering adventure. My name is Erica Okrent. Erica wrote about Charles Bliss in this great book called in the land of invented languages. Getting back to the story one day, she says, when Carl was 11, a lecture came through town about some polar expedition Kohler expedition to explorers talking about their track across the North Pole. And he was so inspired by what he saw and heard at that lecture that even decades later he couldn't talk about it.

Speaker 9:          00:07:45       Um, my father took me through this. I, she was me without getting choked up. [inaudible] my father took me to this lecture and then I show ne who like warm rose [inaudible] and when all the people got a kick into the ice and snow in on almost [inaudible] this full walk for a walk, for in search of knowledge. [inaudible] idea

Speaker 7:          00:08:16       as he tells it on those tapes. That was the beginning of his big idea. That was gonna change the world. Fast forward a few years,

Speaker 10:         00:08:24       they came to Ghana after the first girl. Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:08:27       Did end up going to the Technical University of Vienna.

Speaker 10:         00:08:30       I was suddenly discovered to be the best mandolin player in Australia and one time I played with a full opera orchestra, [inaudible] composer Francesca. So those were the days

Speaker 7:          00:08:43       and then everything changed. In 1938 [inaudible] artist came to town, Nazis came to town, he was sent to Depauw and then Buchenwald you know the concentration camps,

Speaker 9:          00:09:03       one of those feelings will be showing desire.

Speaker 7:          00:09:07       No, I mean go on. All around him. People were being worked to death or outright exterminated, but his wife Claire was a German Catholic with connections

Speaker 10:         00:09:16       and clear my goodbye, sluggish, my mandolin and my guitar and into the concentration came [inaudible]. I became so famous among the notches. That's, for instance, I block fear would come into our, but I can say rich [inaudible] and you could say that it was [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:09:33       here in Buchenwald that Carl started to develop his ideas about language, about the ways that you can manipulate words. For instance, there was this one song that all the prisoners saying, Yep,

Speaker 10:         00:09:44       Oh, who buys leads? One of the status songs I can ever mean pad

Speaker 7:          00:09:48       the saddest lyrics in the world. At a certain point, Carl started to play around with this song. You know, he'd swap out some of the sad lyrics for some jokes, sing it for his fellow prisoners

Speaker 10:         00:09:57       and then laughed and laughed and laughed and forgot for a few minutes that the orange, the darkest and the most terrible homes on air.

Speaker 7:          00:10:06       And on the flip side, every evening the guards would march all the prisoners outside, force them to stand there in the cold, in front of these loudspeakers, make them listen to these speeches,

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       no

Speaker 7:          00:10:18       speeches of Hitler and Gerbils screaming Nazi slogan.

Speaker 9:          00:10:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:10:25       which means Germany above all.

Speaker 9:          00:10:28       No, no, no. Starting the race back last year we weren't, which [inaudible] which judge you mean?

Speaker 7:          00:10:36       But after about a year, his wife somehow wrangled a British visa for him and he gets out

Speaker 10:         00:10:44       and Kevin's shows dreadful times are gone and now I can play here for you and improvisation as it comes into my mind. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:10:52       in 1939 he went to Britain

Speaker 10:         00:10:55       and then got a job as a manager of a factory,

Speaker 7:          00:10:57       but he arrived in England just as

Speaker 11:         00:11:03       [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          00:11:03       The blitz begins, the Germans start to bomb every major city in England.

Speaker 11:         00:11:07       The noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid siren.

Speaker 7:          00:11:11       And every time he'd introduce himself to somebody new they they'd shutter. That can't be your name. Yeah, because of like blitzkrieg add that associate. Yes.

Speaker 10:         00:11:21       Yeah, go ahead. I'll get a good bid. There's name like blitz and so I changed from the war, like [inaudible] to the piece [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:11:32       that was how he became Charles Bliss. Bliss has all the right associations, so he went forward with the feeling of that he was now bliss and would bring happiness to the world. And a year later he and his wife ended up in China in Shanghai where there was a big population of Xcel, Jews. Shanghai was the only place that would take them at that

Speaker 12:         00:11:54       time

Speaker 10:         00:11:54       and they're in China and that in China, I got the opportunity of my lifetime and now we come to his big idea. I realized what I did not know that the Chinese have a different way of writing.

Speaker 12:         00:12:10       He became enraptured by the Chinese writing that he saw

Speaker 7:          00:12:14       the Chinese use symbols and each symbol is a word and he writes about having this epiphany when he saw the Chinese symbol for man,

Speaker 12:         00:12:22       he saw that the Chinese written form of man sort of looks like a man.

Speaker 7:          00:12:27       It looks like a sick freaking man and it means man, he doesn't even know what the Chinese word for man is. He doesn't know how to say man, but that doesn't matter. He is skipping the word and going directly into the meaning.

Speaker 12:         00:12:39       So here was a way of getting beyond language. You could think of the word in any language if you see it in the symbol.

Speaker 7:          00:12:45       And that was a revelation. Why? Well, I mean, think back to the concentration camps when they were outside in front of those loudspeakers listening to Hitler's saying stuff like

Speaker 10:         00:13:00       Deutschland,

Speaker 7:          00:13:00       Uber, Alice, you know, Germany above all that phrase [inaudible] Charles knew that it actually predated the Nazi.

Speaker 10:         00:13:09       That was cool a hundred years earlier in 1848

Speaker 7:          00:13:14       and originally it was meant as a rallying cry to bring together all of these separate principalities.

Speaker 10:         00:13:19       You see the robot barrier, the Kingdom of structure

Speaker 7:          00:13:22       that spoke German, but these were not one country. So when they said Deutschland numerology, it meant university

Speaker 10:         00:13:28       unified Germany,

Speaker 7:          00:13:30       the nation above the states. Oh, suit wasn't necessarily an aggressive thing. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:13:34       no, but that's good to turn this around.

Speaker 7:          00:13:38       Hitler changed the meaning instead of the nation above all states. He changed it to the nation.

Speaker 10:         00:13:43       Never seen conventional. The word bubble,

Speaker 7:          00:13:46       all other nations. So you see what happened, this phrase that started meaning one thing. Unification. Yeah. Became the opposite. Yeah. This is what the Nazis did.

Speaker 10:         00:13:57       Tools works nice.

Speaker 7:          00:14:00       It would bend words to obscure the truth of what they were doing. Extermination. They'd call it solution. By doing that. As he saw it, they were able to convince good, same people, his neighbors to go along with the genocide. [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:14:16       then I realized that trenching must be done to make language more to it, to nature.

Speaker 12:         00:14:22       Words were the problem. Words made people do cruel things to each other. Okay.

Speaker 10:         00:14:26       Then I society apart, words were dangerous instruments. They caused violence. They cause wars.

Speaker 7:          00:14:33       So when he saw the Chinese symbol for man, he thought this might be the answer,

Speaker 10:         00:14:37       and the idea came up to me that I would should invent symbols like the Chinese symbols, but even clearer [inaudible] simple and pictorial that even children can read them.

Speaker 12:         00:14:48       If he could sit down and work it out. You look at the symbol and know what it meant instantly, regardless of what language you spoke, you wouldn't even need words which he felt could be manipulated. You could just have the symbol and get straight to the truth of the manner and the way he saw it. Right off the bat, you'd have all of these benefits. Wrench, Mindan, Finnish, English. When an Estonian language barriers would be out the window. Everything from traffic accidents to health problems could be avoided. He thought if his symbol system would just be adopted. He had this vision that high level political and commercial negotiations would be done in symbols. Did he say anything as grand as like or wouldn't happen constantly and even of course he reckon Hitler wouldn't have happened basically that if the German people had understood the symbols, they wouldn't have copped gerbils propaganda. Yeah. That's a pretty tall order, but it did seem to be what he thought. Everything could be cured by this system.

Speaker 7:          00:15:46       He's the biggest dreamer ever. Yeah. How did he go about doing this?

Speaker 12:         00:15:50       He started working out with the basic lines and shapes would be, he also wanted to make sure you could produce it with a typewriter, so it had to be a limited set of shapes out of which everything could be created.

Speaker 7:          00:16:03       Okay. So he works on it for seven years, seven years, and he comes up with that. Wow. That is a big way. This massive book called list symbolics, semantic Ology, illogical writing for an illogical world that says it all, where he explains the logic of his system. For example here, here's a symbol for sword, which looks exactly like a sword. And then the sword plus a forward Arrow means attack. I buy it. And then if you see a symbol for sword and another symbol for sword and they're cross, that means war. So that's the idea that you take these basic elemental symbols and combine them. Exactly. All right. Here's another one. This symbol here is like the top half of a circle, like a little rainbow, but just one line that means mind, mind, it looks like the top of his skull. Ah. Now if I were to take that symbol from mind and I were to go like this or to put inside it, the question mark, that means, um, I don't know or I have no doubt.

Speaker 7:          00:17:05       And, and there are also, you know, ways to indicate verbs and adjectives and first person, second person, the past, the future. But kind of the one thing that it did that no other language or symbol system or anything has attempted to do, at least as far as I know, is that it would make clear when something was, um, well, he called the human evaluation, you know, basically an opinion. And what you would do is you put this little, this Little v symbol and you put it above this symbol and y, y v. Well, because you know, a v is balanced on a point and it's unstable at wobbles to him. That represents opinion's human evaluations. Anything that comes out in the mind or take metaphors [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:17:50       four as he says, you must put up [inaudible] to alert the reader. Do not take this. Literally stop at that for a head. Not exactly bulletproof, but I can, I can see the, the thinking there. I actually think it's pretty impressive and okay, so what happens next? Well after he finishes this and he and his wife are living in Australia at the time, they spent all their savings on producing this book and sent it out to professors, government officials, heads of state, something like 6,000 people. And they waited for the orders to start rolling in and um, no response from anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       And then they had nothing. [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:18:37       I can't say. I didn't see that coming. Yeah. And with great disappointment, Charles went to work as a welder and yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       factory, the General Motors. Holden's he was working on the production line almost as a robot.

Speaker 13:         00:18:53       And a year later his wife died. You know, he had fought in world war one. He had been in a concentration camp. He had lived in exile, but he says this was the lowest point of his life until one day, 1971 this, as he said, this letter floated onto his desk.

Speaker 14:         00:19:15       Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:19:15       With this picture of this beautiful dimpled child, proudly using his symbols. Yeah. It was a poster, a poster, a poster. This is Shirley, Shirley McNaughton and at the time she was a nurse at a place called D o c c c the Ontario crippled children's center and named that we were very happy to leave behind us and they've since changed in the name. I started there in 1968 and surely was part of this group of teachers and nurses who worked with these kids who suffered from cerebral palsy. If you have cerebral palsy, it's the motor control from the brain that's been affected, which meant that they had trouble moving their arms or legs and even in some cases they couldn't speak. They couldn't form words and then a film that was made of this class.

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       Ah, you see these young kids, children from five to seven all sitting in wheelchairs and they're watching the teacher. Oh, she talks to them and you hear them try to talk to her, but they can't. These kids had no way to communicate

Speaker 13:         00:20:32       and they learn how to read. They could if you knew what they were understanding and they have no way to communicate that to you. The only thing all these kids had were pictures that they could point at. They had a picture of a toilet picture of food, a picture of a drink, a of a bad, they were limited to that kind of communication. But I knew they were bright. But if they couldn't move and they couldn't speak, how would you know? My uh, insight on that was the twinkle in their eyes. But she says a lot of doctors and nurses at the time thought I was crazy that there really wasn't much going on inside these kids' heads. You know, they thought I was projecting into the children what she needed. She said was a way to get through to them. And so one day she was at the library with a colleague and they come across this dusty old volume that had never been checked out.

Speaker 13:         00:21:22       Called, you guessed it with symbol likes. And what did you first think when you saw it? Oh boy, can I get back to the group? How fast can I get back to the group with this exactly what we need. So do you remember what the first symbols were? I think it was, I you, I looked kind of like a standing person. Upright line, small horizontal line at the base. Yeah, next to it, the number one, which means first person you is the same symbol but with a number two for second person. And then they had to have a verb and it was lung heart with an air threat. So now they've got a sentence. I love you.

Speaker 14:         00:22:01       Uh,

Speaker 13:         00:22:01       one of our mothers as the happiest moment she's ever had with her child was when her child came home and said, I love you. You know, so

Speaker 13:         00:22:12       surely. And her staff started to add more symbol. They caught on and pretty soon they'd created this giant laminated chart. It had I and you and he, she, we and they, then it had mother, father, grandma, grandpa, doctor, nurse, teacher, therapist, postman, environment, library, dentist. Eventually they added adjectives, happy, sad and frustrated. All the verbs who had loved and like, and hey, launch ne understand. Pretty soon the kids started to do amazing things with simple combinations. They started to improvise. Surely remembers asking one kid, Terry Martin, what did you want to be refer Halloween? Terry pointed first at the symbol for creature, a creature, not a person. Then he pointed it assemble for drinks than blood ned night creature who drinks blood at night. Right. You want it to be of empire. Ah, he spelled a new word.

Speaker 13:         00:23:10       It sounds like an explosion with these kids. It was. It was for the first time. She says she could actually talk to them like know who they were. Yeah. You've got to know who the leaders were in the classroom. Those who wanted to help others, those who copied others. And it was around then that she and the other teachers decided to send Charles Bliss. That letter. We were sharing our excitement for this gift he'd given to the children. You know, he was in Australia, he was an elderly man. We had no thought that he would come and visit us, you know, didn't enter our mind. But Charles Bliss, he was delighted.

Speaker 15:         00:23:49       Very, very good.

Speaker 13:         00:23:52       He had battled for so long for recognition and now he had it.

Speaker 15:         00:23:57       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:23:57       mortgages his house and flies over, paid my mandoline and told him jokes and only dances around and kisses everybody a few passively than laughter. I love that. Hello?

Speaker 13:         00:24:10       You had long conversations with the kids in symbols,

Speaker 15:         00:24:13       right? He was very happy about the children. Joy, joy,

Speaker 13:         00:24:21       okay. But somewhere along the way, he notices something surely, surely, and the teachers had begun to

Speaker 16:         00:24:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:24:32       augment the system. They'd be going to add their own symbols such as the opposite, meaning symbol. This allowed the kids to take one of blitzes, standard symbols, and just invert the meaning, opposite of happy, sad, opposite of up, down, opposite of [inaudible] to her. This would effectively double the number of adjectives which would be great for the kids and we developed rules for how to combine symbols for how to be more precise with the symbols. She threw in some new pronouns that were missing. The difference between he and him and his. In short, I would make the adaptations I needed to make from the very beginning. We were using it to meet the children's needs, their specific needs. And of course that is not what he had in his mind. He wanted a system that was universal. Every change that she made created like a separate dialect, he would get very emotional about it. So when he got back to Australia, he started writing all these letters basically taking issue with her changes and her failure to understand how his system works. Meanwhile, thanks to surely worried about blesses symbols had spread way beyond Canada too.

Speaker 7:          00:25:45       France, Sweden, Israel, Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe. Yeah. And then Argentina, Brazil, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Bermuda, Guam, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, Venezuela, Madagascar, Yugoslavia. It's spread to all these places. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         00:26:05       And in each place, the symbols when inevitably get tweaked to suit that country, for example, in Israel because the writing goes from right to left. Yeah. The bliss symbols went from right to left. Uh, but what really pained him the most, what really got him was that these teachers were using his symbols as a step toward English or French or German or Hebrew or whatever. It was just a way to get the kids to their native languages. The teachers always saw it the way they saw it. You start the kids on bliss and then you introduce reading and letters and eventually they're fully literate. At which point you don't need the bliss symbols. This was the ultimate insult him. They were using his system to bring these kids back to the very thing that he was trying to get everyone away from evil words. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       why not? Why not?

Speaker 9:          00:26:58       If I tried to explain it to them, they don't want donation to me, then look, show me. What should I do? I do that. I don't know. I don't know

Speaker 13:         00:27:07       and it's right about this point in the story that you start to hear a different Charles Place.

Speaker 9:          00:27:13       Shannon, if Norton has [inaudible] has been better than [inaudible].

Speaker 13:         00:27:19       Is he saying perverted? Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:27:22       she smiles. She be guys. She she lies.

Speaker 13:         00:27:25       He kept sending Shirley and the other teachers letters and the letters got angrier and angrier. This was not what the language was for. This was a universal language that had nothing to do with spoken language. You are ruining my system, you are abusing it. And eventually he decided to take matters into his own hands and he traveled back to Canada and he started going to the various centers where the kids were using his symbols and saying horrible things about me. Uh, and getting them very upset. That's when I got upset. I got upset when he got them upset. Not long after Shirley receives a summer

Speaker 9:          00:28:00       I have taken to court. Oh she, she in the beach?

Speaker 13:         00:28:04       He sued them. Yup.

Speaker 9:          00:28:05       I added two war dependents. Mrs Chilling, ignored

Speaker 13:         00:28:09       on the tapes. Even suggest that he's going to have Shirley put away, put a whole life for life. Wow. Why was he so upset with her in particular? Well, because by this time she'd started the international organization, B C Bliss Symbol, communications international and she felt like this was a total unique and powerful tool which could, could and should transform lives around the world and more teachers needed to adopt it. Definitely. What was he asking for? Did he wanted us to use the symbols in his way? So in 1975 the BCI won a license agreement to use the symbols in the workbooks for the kids. But Charles Bliss,

Speaker 9:          00:28:50       they should all be part, didn't give up, they should all be powered. He published endless tirades and sent them out to anybody who is listening and hopefully to educate or oppose you to patients. Or is the British chambers just all in all

Speaker 13:         00:29:07       this went on for over a decade and the administration of the program or surely was working was desperate to make him go away. He had basically destroyed the program. And so in 1982 he and the BCI finally come to an agreement.

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       Okay.

Speaker 13:         00:29:24       It was a financial settlement that satisfied him. What was the financial settlement? $160,000.

Speaker 2:          00:29:33       Wow.

Speaker 13:         00:29:35       You know, we were a little program in the basement of the Ontario cripple children's center. We were, you know, just a classroom. Wow. That, so a guy who wanted to save the world ends up robbing a bunch of disabled kids. I mean, that's kind of putting it crudely, but that's how this how it feels basically. That's the, yeah,

Speaker 14:         00:30:02       no.

Speaker 12:         00:30:02       Did the symbols ever go anywhere? Well, there was a lot of excitement about it in the beginning, but it never spread very far. It's used now at a few schools in Canada and Sweden, a couple other places. Uh, but it never went very far because he was constantly taking it down at every turn.

Speaker 14:         00:30:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         00:30:23       but here's what I find most surprising. When I, when I talked to Shirley, she didn't have any bitterness toward him. Not even in the worst moments when we were having the final legal, um, action. We'd go through that in the morning and as the layers were packing up their papers, Charles Bliss would reach across the table and he'd say, surely will you help me? And so she'd go to lunch with him, sit with him, and then he asked me if I would come to his hotel that night and put the eardrops in his ears. And I did that every night. He was involved with this thing. That's just the way it was. And it wasn't just that she takes care of people for a living, you know, she, she felt and still feels that Charles Bliss had created something really new in the world. She even told me that when she uses blessed symbols, she actually thinks differently. Yes, definitely. Really, definitely. What's different? Oh, I just think so much more about what a word means. And it, it's, it's like poetry in its purest form. Um, I'm playing with stained glass down here in my retirement and you can, you know, you can just take the symbols and put them into one composite and they say things that only art can say. It's beautiful. They transmit a meaning that is beyond any words.

Wherever you get your pod and bond. I'll call me.

Speaker 21:         00:35:15       Wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot. Let me just hit record.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Okay. And now, what were you saying spontaneously a moment ago? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, and today bliss. And in our last segment, we met a guy who dreamt of a perfect world where words can never muck things up. It got a little carried away. Yeah. So let's forget about dreams.

Speaker 23:         00:35:38       Now we're going to look for perfection right here in the physical world. Okay. So, so, so this story, and we're going to do it with a perfect person. Latif Nasser, it begins with a, with a birthday present. It's February 9th, 1886 miles outside the tiny town of Jericho, Vermont. And we're on a farm, a family farm, uh, the Bentley family farm and the scrawny 15 year old kid named Wilson gets a microscope from his mother. So it's February and it's Vermont. And so naturally, the first thing this kid does is he grabs a handful of snow, picks out a single flake, and he puts it under the microscope. And

Speaker 24:         00:36:18       what he sees is, is the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. It's is ethereal and, and perfect. He calls them masterpieces as as if they're these, you know, great works of art. He calls him that in his 15 year old diary. Looking back, he talked about that moment and what he was thinking when he, when he sort of first saw it, but obviously, you know, within minutes or maybe even seconds, these masterpieces just disappeared

Speaker 23:         00:36:47       without leaving any evidence that they, that they ever existed. They just sort of evaporate. Huh. And as he remembers it, he, he sort of decides then in there that he's going to dedicate his whole life to, to documenting these masterpieces. Otherwise no one will ever know they even existed. He's gonna spend his whole life documenting snowflakes. Yeah. It's a good life, Jed. And it pays well. Right. That's exactly what his father said. His father thought he was, you know, he was just was lazy and didn't want to do the farming chores as far as his milk, the goats. And he goes, now the beauty, the beauty. Right, right. And apparently he was a real, he was really good at digging potatoes, but he just sort of was so busy futzing around with his microscope that he, you know, I don't like this kid, I don't like him.

Speaker 23:         00:37:33       The friends, your work ethic so fed up it's neck. So, so he takes his microscope and he, he moves it to this unheated woodshed behind the house. Um, and, and he starts sketching these snowflakes, right? And while he's sketching, you can't even breathe because he was worried that his breath would melt his specimen. So he's sort of holding his breath and, and, and, and drawing these, you know, these extremely complex crystals that can take you maybe, you know, maybe an hour to draw, but, but depending on the temperature, the humidity, the size of the crystal he had at most, he had five minutes, right at the end of that, he, he looks at the mall and he's not satisfied. He just felt like he wasn't doing it justice. You know what he calls these like miracles of beauty. So Bentley persuades his mother who persuades his father to buy him a camera. Whey is I go, wait, wait, wait, wait. 1880, we're in February, 1880 have we entered into, in the era of picture taking just just and for a farming family, this was like a lot of money, but they buy it for him and he gets it. Any sort of Jerry rigs it to the microscope. And at age 19, Wilson Bentley is the first person ever in history to photograph a snowflake. Okay. I'm going to cue the snowflake celebration in secure, right

Speaker 16:         00:38:58       [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         00:38:59       from then on, basically for the next 46 winters until he died. Every, every snowfall, every blizzard is a Bentley would stand in the doorway of his little shack, uh, holding out a wooden tray, uh, with, with thick mittens cause you would wear these, they're almost like oven mitts to, to, to make sure that his, none of his body heat would kind of leak out and, and inadvertently melt any of the snow. So He'd sort of stand there and sort of give it a once over with his eye. If nothing was promising. He, he basically had a, a Turkey feather and he would sort of just wipe it clean with this Turkey feather until he did find something you liked. And then he would, he would take this tiny little wooden rod and he would just certain really delicately tap the center of the crystal and like really, really, really gently lifted off and then transfer it onto the, onto a glass slide so that he could put it under the microscope and he could photograph it. Over the course of his life. He'd basically photographed about 5,000 snow crystals for his whole life. He was just a farmer doing this kind of as a hobby. Uh, but he sold copies of these photos for 5 cents a pop to places like Harvard and the British Museum and the u s weather bureau, research journals, magazines like nature and national geographic. And I mean, you've already seen the photos, like you've gotten them on a Christmas card, they're on your like ugly Christmas sweater in your closet somewhere. Um, we're throwing a shirt with them on right now. Yeah.

Speaker 24:         00:40:27       Um, they're, they're, they're, they're everywhere. They're beautiful, symmetrical, really clean. And Complex. A lot of the greatest scientists who ever lived like Descartes and Kepler and Hook, they all tried to sketch and draw and kind of capture the essence of snowflakes. But none of them could do it as well as this one obsessive loaner from Jericho, Vermont, whose photos were perceived to be kind of more faithful to nature than, than, than anybody else. But that was until, um, this,

Speaker 23:         00:40:58       the guy came on the scene, this German guy who the other Guy Germanic theme music. Yes. Yes. [inaudible] he was a German meteorologist named Gustaf helmet stuff. Hell man. Not of the mayonnaise fame, I don't believe. Um, I haven't even thought of that actually. It's a helmet. Is this a, is he a contemporary of Bentley? Yeah, he is. And he's working on his own book about weather and so he hires a, a kind of a micro photographer who's another German guy named Newhouse. Mike Grace is a very teeny photographer who he kept on his desk. He's a microscopic himself and he just takes normal size photographs. Anyhow, he hires this guy in and they take a bunch of photos using basically similar technology camera and I'm like, are scope essentially. But what they find is totally different. They do not find the, the, the elegance and metrical ideal snow crystals that Bentley found that the crystals they found were like flawed, lopsided, usually like broken.

Speaker 23:         00:42:11       And the way I think of it, it was like a Martian who had only ever seen like glossy fashion magazines had just been given some like random family photo album and it was like, Oh wow, this is, they're not so pretty. Like these are kind of ugly, you know, humans, humans, they're not all symmetrical. These Germans, they, they basically called them out. They, they basically thought Bentley was a fraud. There was a particular way that Bentley prepared his photographs. What he would do is he would use a pen knife to scrape the negative around the snow crystal, which is what gave it that kind of Nice black background because he thought it would kind of put it in maybe starker relief. Um, and, and, and the German guys said that's it's, it's misleading that it kind of mutilates the snowflakes, um, away. So he's photographing these snowflakes and then significantly messing with the photograph. Exactly right. Exactly right. So here's a quote from the photographer who said, quote a, in many images, Bentley did not limit himself to improving the outlines. He let his knife play deep inside the heart of the crystals so that fully arbitrary figures emerged. So he said, oh, I don't know. That doesn't seem so no longer a candidate, is it? Well, that's, that's the question. So then, but then, so they basically lobbed this and that this is kind of going into these journals, but Bentley basically launches a counter attack.

Speaker 23:         00:43:36       And what he says is that in fact those guys are wrong, that not correcting your photographs was an, he used this word like perverse to him. Why wouldn't you remove specks of dust or other imperfections? Why photograph of a broken snowflake when you could photograph a complete one? So this is a quote from Bentley. He said a true scientist, which is above all, to have his photographs as true to nature as possible. And if retouching will help in this respect than it is fully justified. So he thought his retouched snowflakes were truer than the normal ones. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That the scientist is supposed to be kind of this very experienced, almost like a sage who is seen every different variation on a snowflake, but can sort of bring that all together in one drawing, one sketch, one photograph, and that's the true snowflake. So if I brought him a slightly gloppy snowflake and said, look, this is what fell on my nose and this is a true snowflake because it actually fell from the sky and it's, you know, it was an [inaudible] enhanced you.

Speaker 23:         00:44:46       He would say that Robert, you're, you're an amateur. Like this is, this is not good work. You know, this is an aberration. This is an abnormality. Why would you choose to kind of highlight an abnormality as opposed to kind of this, this true ideal snowflake, you know, and does that one exist? I mean, that's the key question for me. Like does the ideal snowflake exist in nature? You think there are such things I exquisitely beautiful. I would like to think that there are no, so I think if my facts are right, the world's snowflake expert is actually in, in Pasadena. Califia

Speaker 25:         00:45:23       all right. Check, check, check, check, check in. Can Sunny Southern California. Yeah, I'm wearing a tee shirt. I have sunscreen lathered and I am going to talk to the world authority on snow. How are you? His name is Ken Lee Brecht. He's up a professor of physics at cal tech. He is in a way, he's like the modern day Wilson Bentley because he takes a ton of of snowflake pictures taken about 10,000 now. And uh, and he actually makes snowflakes. Oh yeah. Artificially. Okay. Wow. So this is a giant tank. This is a nitrogen here. Nevermind that. And to get to your question about the ideal snowflake, a few things. So number one, they're a bajillion different kinds, dendritic crystal, stellar dendrites, needles and columns and hollow columns and a sector of plates. That's one thing. The second thing is that snowflakes are never static. They're never one thing.

Speaker 25:         00:46:28       So what every single moment as it falls to the earth, it's either growing or shrinking depending on the kind of trajectory through the different pockets of weather as it's moving down. So there is no real platonic ideal form of a snowflake because it's, it's, it's so influx. I mean there's no such thing as a perfect snowflake, but that doesn't stop only brag from, from looking, you know, I tried up in Tahoe and Japan, Vermont, Michigan travels all over the world looking for Bentley's perfect flakes. I'll ask, I've been to Alaska, Sweden, but my favorite spot is northern Ontario little town called Cochran population 5,487. So where do you go in Cochran? Do you just, just anywhere. They're just falling all over the place. Mostly it's the, it's the uh, parking lot of my, my hotel besides, there's a lot of waiting involved. It only really snows well about once a week.

Speaker 25:         00:47:20       Even then things have to be goldilocks perfect. If the clouds are too high, then they evaporate a little on the way down. They look pretty or if the clouds too light or too heavy, that's about two. And a lot of times the temperature is wrong. If you want those Christmas cards, supermodel snowflakes, uh, you need to have exactly minus 15 that's five degrees Fahrenheit. You need to have high humidity, not so much wind so that they'll putter down slowly and have more time to grow. But every once in awhile, I mean, when the conditions are right, you'd go outside all hopeful and dissipating and it's like, oh crap, there's nothing garbage at here. So you back go back inside and read some more email and you come back a half an hour later, nope, still lousy and half hour later, nope, still allows it. And you know, you do this for hours and then all of a sudden they'll get really good [inaudible] just start there and frantically trying to collect as many as I can.

Speaker 25:         00:48:15       Well, one of the things I like to think about this is, you know, here I am with my little piece of cardboard in the middle of a continent is snowing on time. And so I am catching some incredibly small number of these things for a brief period and, and getting some really cool pictures. And so you kind of wonder what the, what else is out there and what are you missing? I mean imagine just all the beautiful little works of art that are just falling down totally unnoticed and then they just disappear. I mean stuff that is far prettier than, you know, the pictures I have cause they're out there, you know, they're out there statistically they are out there and so you know, there's just an awful lot of really gorgeous things. It's just are like you say, they're just totally a femoral and you'll never see them and they're falling constantly. So you sort of want to just stop the world and you know, go look at them.

I called him up because of something that happened to him a little over 50 years ago. Let's see, this was 1962 is something that he still thinks about all these years later. I was in my early twenties 22 something like that. 21 he was an undergraduate at a theological school in Boston and one day he received a very different kind of religious education, a very different kind of [inaudible] though he event occurred on Good Friday

Speaker 8:          00:52:49       and it happened at the Boston University Marsh Chapel. He was sitting, not up in the main chapel, but down in the little basement chapel, and he was sitting with about 19 of his fellow classmates. The Meditation Service was being piped down to us from the chapel above. They have speakers in the front of this little chapel in the basement with organ music and an excellent choir and the voice of the preacher

Speaker 27:         00:53:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 28:         00:53:25       is this kind of famous guy named Howard Thurman and we relaxed.

Speaker 14:         00:53:29       We're all good

Speaker 28:         00:53:31       and interesting ideas began going off in my head. Wow. Sometimes it was hard to pay attention to what was going on in the room.

Speaker 14:         00:53:43       The things that resist than defy

Speaker 28:         00:53:48       and to, we slid jet a right into the silicide been experienced

Speaker 22:         00:53:54       what we did, he said silicide yes. Was in magic mushrooms, SRE, shrooms. You're gonna have to explain that one. This was actually something called the Marsh Chapel experiment, the Marsh Chapel experiment. And it was run by this guy and let me, his name was Walter Panky. Very briefly summarize the man, he was a graduate student at Harvard at this time and he was studying religious experience.

Speaker 29:         00:54:22       No, this has also been called the cosmic experience. The transcendental experience or the mystical. Which brands,

Speaker 22:         00:54:27       what exactly was he looking at? You know, like, um, Christians, Muslims, Jews, mystics. Like what kind of things do they all have in common? So he did a bunch of research and interviews and he came up with a basic catalog of the ingredients in a religious experience. And one day he's at Harvard and he bumps into

Speaker 11:         00:54:45       turn on [inaudible] and drop out

Speaker 22:         00:54:49       that guy, Timothy Leary, he was actually a teacher at Harvard at the time. And he was famously giving psychedelic drugs to undergrads.

Speaker 11:         00:54:59       They're teaching people how to use very head. Yeah. Point is, and in order to use your head, you have to go out of your mind.

Speaker 22:         00:55:06       And when Panky got a chance to talk to these students who had tripped, he noticed pretty quick that they used really similar language to the people that he'd been studying. And he started to wonder, if you put people into the right situation and you give them this drug, could you induce actually induce a religious experience? So on that day in 1962 pinky put 20 theological school students into this church basement. You know, during this Good Friday service, 10 of them got a placebo and then 10 of them got a hefty dose of Psilocybin, things in the room morphing, which brings us back to Mike Young.

Speaker 28:         00:55:49       You would move your head and there'd be an after image from the lights. One point the visual effect was especially powerful

Speaker 22:         00:55:59       and he had this one moment that has just stuck with him ever since.

Speaker 28:         00:56:03       He's in the middle of a technicolor. See there were bars of color and I was floating through them and they were floating through me, uh, and it was just glorious. And the bars of color then resolved I into a wheel. I was at the center and there was a different color going out from me in every possible direction. At first, this was quite nice. Uh, and then I realized that I had to swim out one of those color bars I had to. And each of those different color bars would be a whole different life experience. And I could choose anyone of those, a la life experience color bars that I wanted, but I had to choose one and I couldn't choose one. It was very painful. It felt like my insides were being ripped out of me and I died.

Speaker 22:         00:57:13       And at that moment that I died, uh, I heard Howard Thurman say,

Speaker 11:         00:57:23       I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for death. And I stopped dying.

Speaker 22:         00:57:36       Wow. Wow. What are we supposed to make of that? It is, it is strange. Yeah. And in fact, this is actually right around the time that there's this huge cultural backlash against this drug. By the end of 1962 you've got Harvard making the decision that these experiments are not going to be done at their university anymore. 63 evil man, they fire Timothy Leary, empathy, leery. He's out of there. 1970 congress outlaws, psychedelics, 1971

Speaker 30:         00:58:09       nearly every country in the world, including the United States, bans them from research is their signatory to an international law. Banning the use sail cultivation and possession of dangerous drugs that have no useful place in medicine.

Speaker 22:         00:58:25       I mean, on some level, like I get that because like what could you learn from a bunch of people tripping like scientific. I mean, I think that there actually is something that we can learn from this. What? Well, if you look at Mike Young on the day that he walked into that chapel, I was still a theological school student. He was, you know, he's experiencing doubts without any real confidence. That ministry was something I was going to stay in. But after this experiment at the chapel, he went home to his wife and uh, when I walked in, my wife was very much aware that something rather unusual had occurred to this guy she was married to. Did she just, you carry yourself differently? You should never been that explicit about it. She just said she knew that, that I had had some kind of a major experience at first.

Speaker 22:         00:59:18       He just kind of wrote the whole thing off, but time passed. He couldn't stop thinking about the death and the rebirth experience. And to make a long story short, if you fast forward, I'm a unitarian universalist minister, um, as a result of partly a result of that drug experience. I want to share with you this morning, a little exit. Jesus of the New Testament. That's him. Yeah. Story of the Good Samaritan. He has been preaching for 45 years here. Here's the thing that I think it is really strange. All of the people who took the drug that day, those 10 who got the silicide but, and not the placebo, all but one that came. Ministers really. So nine out of 10 went into the mystery. Nine out of 10 what about the others? The Placebo Group? Yeah. None. None according to Mike. Absolutely none. Wow. That is interesting. That was the first thing I was like, wow, that's, that's crazy.

Speaker 22:         01:00:20       But at the same time, you know it's really small sample set. Who knows why anyone becomes a minister. I'm sure it wasn't just the drugs. You know, maybe they didn't even play that big of a role for everyone else, but this did make me, you know, like more curious what exactly is happening to people when they take this drug and I was surprised to find out that like right now there are actually a few laboratories who are starting to experiment with these drugs. Again, we thought, well why not? This is Roland, Roland Griffis psychopharmacologist. I studied the effects of drugs on behavior. He's at Johns Hopkins and Hopkins for 40 years now. He's really well known for studying nicotine and Ritalin, but he tells me that back in 2000 he was reading about the old psilocybin studies from the 60s and this is right around the time when the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FDA were starting to loosen their rules on experimenting with psychedelics so he applies and he gets approval study of that Short had not been approved for 30 years and I can tell you that I've never had a protocol that was as rigorously and carefully reviewed and scrutinized from every angle since no one had studied this drug for like three decades.

Speaker 22:         01:01:35       He started with some really basic questions. How does this affect behavior after people have taken this drug? Like did they feel confused or afraid? Is it habit forming? And how we did this test was he has this lab room at Johns Hopkins that he's, he's made like really nice and cozy. It's a, it's an aesthetic living room like environment. There's a couch and the stereo system. Then one at a time, volunteers brought in and given a hefty dose of psilocybin blindfolded, and then they're asked to lay down and direct their attention inward. We were bringing people in two months after sessions and asking them so, well, you know, what was the session like? And they filled out some questionnaires. And the thing

Speaker 31:         01:02:19       that I really wasn't prepared for was how salient and important these experiences were said to be on follow up. You know, they were saying, well, it was really important, you know, and I would say, well, how important? And they would say, oh, well, it was the most important experience in my life. And I'd go, what? And they would say, yeah, you know, it's like, um, you know, like when my daughter was born, that changed my world forever. I recently lost my father and, um, and I'll never forget that. And they'll say, you know, it's Kinda like that. And that's a totally improbable. So we didn't, we didn't have any metric that could even assess that. So,

Speaker 22:         01:03:05       and what made things even weirder for Rollin is that when he gave these volunteers a questionnaire, about 75% of people are saying it's in the top five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences that there lie a vast majority. We're talking about like it's a spiritual experience, huh? So rollin, he went back to look at Pankey's studies from the 1960s about the basic ingredients that make up a religious experience.

Speaker 29:         01:03:32       Let me look at the characteristic, a very summary list first, the characteristics of awe and wonder.

Speaker 22:         01:03:38       Everyone would report that they felt like they were in the presence of something great and enormous. Yeah.

Speaker 29:         01:03:42       The second characteristic is transcendence of time and space.

Speaker 22:         01:03:45       People describe time slowing down or space getting weird.

Speaker 29:         01:03:49       The third characteristic have to do with mood very deeply felt positive. Mood.

Speaker 22:         01:03:54       Fourth, and I'm skipping over a few here.

Speaker 29:         01:03:57       Unity. This is a sense of cosmic oneness,

Speaker 22:         01:04:00       this feeling which basically intense connection to everything around you.

Speaker 29:         01:04:04       The part of everything that is the whole universe and even every blade of grass and grain of sand and so forth. These are words that people use in describing in any way.

Speaker 22:         01:04:11       So based on this one guys, research and keep in mind, you know, a lot of people have different opinions about this. Roland believes that you can actually take this little drug and for a majority of people you can induce a religious experience.

Speaker 13:         01:04:26       But I you don't, you, I don't know, soon as you call it that then I'm starting to think, hmm, don't know [inaudible] this is a real, a real, I mean I don't know you guys, but for someone who has to take this very seriously, because to say that you can pop a pill and then in some shortcut fashion suddenly get this experience that hitherto had been very rare and had been assigned the values of grace to say that is to say any enormous thing. Well it sounds like, it sounds like you're not, I, I'm guessing how you're taking it, Robert, is to say that a d values the thing. Yeah, I do value that. It kind of does the opposite for me. Well, really, I mean [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         01:05:08       when I hear these stories from, from like all the people in these studies, it reminds me like I've, I've had these like very meaningful experiences that I didn't think would last on a pill. Did you have little or no, not, not a pill. No drugs. So what, so what happened? What, what are you talking about? Well, it goes back to like when I was a Christian, I used to be an evangelical Christian and when I was about 15 I was at a church camp and me and some of my best friends were all gathered around a campfire. He was hot and the stars were all bright and shiny. I remember they were playing the song that I really liked. And you know that feeling that you get when when you in a crowd of people are all singing like really loud some song that you all really love.

Speaker 22:         01:06:01       Yeah, sure. And as we're all singing the song, I remember my friend who wasn't raised in the faith like me leaning over to me and saying that like, he wanted to accept Jesus and be a Christian. And he asked, what am I supposed to do? And I remember that being like, great, great. It's not even the word for it. Like in this one moment I got caught up in something that just felt so enormous. It's hard for me to explain how it's felt like. It's hard to describe how I felt like we were all one. Like there was something powerful that was, that was like both over us but also inside of us. And so much has changed since then that sometimes I look back and I think, did that happen? Like did I hallucinate like some dude on drugs because that friend who, uh, reached over to me, he's dead now. That faith that I was a part of, I left it like all I have is this weird feeling

Speaker 22:         01:07:14       that I can remember. That's good. And even though you're not a Christian anymore, you, you still have that feeling. Oh yeah. But what is it about the idea that, that feeling, that campfire feeling could be triggered by a pill and that maybe that's what was happening to those folks in Rollins study? What is it about that idea that helps you? For me, like I see something concrete, you know, like I see, I see. I see something that's harder to write off. How so? Well, if I can go back into reporter mode, I will introduce you to one more guy who I think is going to help you understand what I'm talking about. Hello, this is Charlie. Charlie Busan. He's a longtime smoker. No, let's start at 17 smoked for 40 years. Pack a day. Breakfast, coffee, talking on the phone. Wait. Why are we talking about smoking?

Speaker 22:         01:08:05       How Roland's new study's doing right now? His pilot program that he's just started a few years ago. [inaudible] is trying to see if there's something in the transformation that you have in, in the siliciden experience that can help smokers quit smoking. Really stick with me. They gave me a pill, blue capsule, and he closed his eyes and like Mike, he says he had a hallucination that changed him. The thing that I found so amazing, the one thing that was more amazing than anything else was when I was on those saw mountain. This is a mountain in his head. Yes. When I had traveled to the very top, uh, I was, uh, looking out over this greatness, this vista of everything he says he was just this microscopic thing he was, he was so small and it was so big. But my experience at this one place was so exalted because he was struck by this feeling, this deep feeling that we were the same thing. We were the same. This right here is another hallmark of these experiences. You're somehow confronted with this radical shift in scale and things that formerly felt like too big for you to deal with. They suddenly, they suddenly look different.

Speaker 31:         01:09:40       We had one person involved in her cigarette smoking study who had had a dose of Psilocybin and in the course of that session, the idea of smoking came up to him and he said, you know, it was like a fly that had landed on his arm and he just took his finger and he flicked it off and he said he was done with it. Done, done. [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         01:10:06       and that's exactly how it was for Charlie. No morning afterwards. He says he just didn't want cigarettes anymore. They just weren't an issue anymore. Huh. And how long has he been off of it? Three years. Wow. Now this is just a tiny pilot program. I don't think that we should make too much out of it yet, but the insight I feel like is like, because, because like Charlie has this real experience, like it's not, it's not a question of like something invisible like faith, but it's like a tangible reality for me. It's like the closest thing I can come to having some kind of real evidence that what happened to me was real with the campfire. Right. To me, the mystery is you've done this occasional thing with an artificial stimulus, had a extraordinary with temporary feeling and then mysteriously it isn't temporary. He just goes on and on.

Speaker 22:         01:11:01       Yeah. Do we have any idea why it persists? Well, Roland has a very educated hunch. I asked him about this and he's looking right now at getting in there and doing research with some new SMRI machines. But his hunch is that the siliciden drug experience, it somehow rewires the brain. We're talking about rewiring a personality and a fundamental machine programming level. Like he calls this experience a rearranging experience. Huh? You know, maybe, maybe one day science, we'll figure out what's happening in the brain of a person that's experiencing something like this. But one of the things about this that troubles me like as a reporter and then even like personally is that going back to Walter Panky, like remember his list of ingredients from earlier, his final characteristic. Yeah.

Speaker 29:         01:11:52       The final characteristic that I'd like to mention here,

Speaker 22:         01:11:54       final ingredient was

Speaker 29:         01:11:55       the characteristic of alleged enough ability, which means that the people who have such an experience claim that it can't be described in words, that it's nonverbal, basically indescribable.

Speaker 22:         01:12:04       And that's one of the main things that I'm going to take away from all this. I mean, talking to Roland and Mike and Charlie is just how hard it is to talk about the thing that I've just spent the last 20 minutes trying

Speaker 19:         01:12:17       to talk about. I understood something, some, um, life, uh, suddenly eternal truth. These words really don't match the thing. I was at the top, I was feeling divine source of, um, of, um, self awareness that I'm sorry, said trick of words. I guess it's a

Speaker 22:         01:13:00       got larger thanks to producer Andy Mills. Thanks to you guys for listening.
