00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.173
- [Voiceover] What you see here in blue

00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:03.549
this is the graph of

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.299
Y is equal to F of X.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.577
Where F of X is equal to

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:11.434
X to the third

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:12.790
minus six X squared

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.819
plus X minus five.

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.721
What I want to do in this video

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:19.455
is think about what is the equation

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.304
of the tangent line

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.495
when X is equal to one?

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:25.339
So we can visualize that.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.896
So, this is X equaling
one right over here.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.073
This is the value of the function.

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.321
When X is equal to one.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:34.275
Right over there.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.758
And then the tangent line

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:37.870
looks something like

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.772
will look something like.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.635
I know I can do a better job than that.

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:44.802
It's going to look something like that.

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:48.076
And what we want to do
is find the equation

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:50.825
the equation of that line.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.345
And if you are inspired
I encourage you to be,

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.379
pause the video and try to work it out.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.039
Well the way that we can do this is

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.793
if we find the derivative at X equals one

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.882
the derivative is the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:05.860
And so we'll know the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.329
And we know that it contains that point

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.290
and then we can use that
to find the equation

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.640
of the tangent line.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.093
So let's actually just, let's just.

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:14.539
So we want the equation
of the tangent line

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.172
when X is equal to one.

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:19.054
So let's just first of
all evaluate F of one.

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:19.971
So F of one

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.527
is equal to one to the third power

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:24.805
which is one.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:26.358
Minus six times ones squared,

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:28.500
so it's just minus six.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.514
And then

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:30.858
plus one

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.186
plus one

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:33.103
minus five.

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:36.604
So, this is equal to what?

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:37.687
Two minus 11?

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.017
Which is equal to

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.506
negative nine.

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:43.737
And that looks about right.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:45.675
That looks like about negative
nine right over there.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:48.783
The scales are different
on the Y and the X axis.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:49.969
So that is F of one.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.866
It is negative nine.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.699
Did I do that right?

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:54.045
This is negative five.

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.324
Yep, negative nine.

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:57.923
And now let's evaluate
what the derivative is

00:01:57.923 --> 00:01:59.139
at one.

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.018
So,

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.768
what is F prime of X?

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:04.378
F prime of X.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.862
Well here it's just a polynomial.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.798
You take the derivative of X to the third

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:13.547
while we apply the power rule.

00:02:13.547 --> 00:02:16.027
We bring the three out front.

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:18.063
So you get three X

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:18.896
to the.

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:21.208
And then we go one less than three

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.272
to get the second power.

00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:24.355
Then you have

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.503
minus six X squared.

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.784
So you bring the two times the six

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.160
to get 12.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.243
So minus 12 X

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:35.887
to the

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:37.920
well two minus one is one power

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.141
so that's the same thing as 12 X.

00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:43.293
And then plus the derivative of X

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.116
is just one.

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.596
That's just going to be one.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:48.734
And if you view this
as X to the first power

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.662
we're just bringing the one out front

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:52.664
and decrementing the one.

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:55.028
So it's one times X to the zero power

00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:56.428
which is just one.

00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:58.881
And then the derivative of a constant here

00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:00.780
is just going to be zero.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.468
So this is our derivative of F

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:04.364
and if we want to evaluate it at one

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:05.531
F prime of one

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.684
is going to be three times one squared

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:09.965
which is just three

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:11.397
minus 12 times one

00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:13.187
which is just minus 12.

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:15.807
And then we have plus one.

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:17.050
So this is

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.633
three minus 12 is negative nine

00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:23.802
plus one is equal to negative eight.

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.646
So we know the slope right over here

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.084
is the slope of negative eight.

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:28.745
We know a point on that line

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:30.829
it contains the point one negative nine

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.109
so we can use that information to find the

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.162
equation of the line.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:35.746
The line, just to remind ourselves,

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:36.949
has the four.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.032
Y is equal to M X plus B.

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:42.195
Where M is the slope.

00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:44.032
So we know that Y is going to be

00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:46.165
equal to negative eight X

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:46.998
plus B.

00:03:48.543 --> 00:03:49.714
And now we can substitute

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:51.253
the X and Y value that we know

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:53.206
sits on that line to solve for B.

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.238
So we know that Y is
equal to negative nine.

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:57.564
Let me just write this here.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:03:59.431
Y is equal to negative nine

00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:00.931
when X is equal to

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:03.895
when X is equal to one.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:04.978
And so we get

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:07.503
we get

00:04:07.503 --> 00:04:08.578
negative nine

00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:10.828
is equal to negative eight times one.

00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:12.325
So negative eight

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:13.158
plus B.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:15.543
Well, let's see.

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:16.543
We could add

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.381
we could eight to both sides

00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.151
and we get negative one

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:22.982
is equal to B.

00:04:22.982 --> 00:04:23.815
So we're done.

00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:25.408
The equation of the line

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:26.612
the equation of this line

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:28.831
that we have in magenta right over there

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:29.664
that is

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:32.000
that is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.917
Y is equal to the slope

00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:37.330
is negative eight X.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.931
And then the Y-intercept

00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:39.764
minus one.
