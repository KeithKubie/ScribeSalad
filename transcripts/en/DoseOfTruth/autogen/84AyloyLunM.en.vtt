I was speaking with Jonathan paggio this

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
I was speaking with Jonathan paggio this
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.309
I was speaking with Jonathan paggio this
morning because he's staying in the same

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319
morning because he's staying in the same
 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.700
morning because he's staying in the same
same era B&amp;B as my wife and I and he

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
same era B&amp;B as my wife and I and he
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.910
same era B&amp;B as my wife and I and he
suggested that I talk to you about my

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920
suggested that I talk to you about my
 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.770
suggested that I talk to you about my
experiences with media over the last

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
experiences with media over the last
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.799
experiences with media over the last
year and I thought well that's a that's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
year and I thought well that's a that's
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.840
year and I thought well that's a that's
something I know about so it's always

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
something I know about so it's always
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460
something I know about so it's always
good when you're talking to people to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
good when you're talking to people to
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230
good when you're talking to people to
talk to some talk about something that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
talk to some talk about something that
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.910
talk to some talk about something that
you know about that's actually a really

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
you know about that's actually a really
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.340
you know about that's actually a really
good tip for public speaking right if

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
good tip for public speaking right if
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650
good tip for public speaking right if
well it's really true you have to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
well it's really true you have to
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.670
well it's really true you have to
remember that you should know about

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
remember that you should know about
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130
remember that you should know about
three times as much about the topic as

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
three times as much about the topic as
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.459
three times as much about the topic as
as you need to talk about the topic and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
as you need to talk about the topic and
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110
as you need to talk about the topic and
then you have places you can go and you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
then you have places you can go and you
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.580
then you have places you can go and you
know you can wander around a little bit

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
know you can wander around a little bit
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709
know you can wander around a little bit
and be a little spontaneous so that's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
and be a little spontaneous so that's
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.440
and be a little spontaneous so that's
really useful and but then I also

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
really useful and but then I also
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840
really useful and but then I also
thought that makes sense because nobody

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
thought that makes sense because nobody
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150
thought that makes sense because nobody
knows anything about the situation with

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
knows anything about the situation with
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279
knows anything about the situation with
regards to the media now and so we're

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
regards to the media now and so we're
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.040
regards to the media now and so we're
all feeling our way and so because the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
all feeling our way and so because the
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720
all feeling our way and so because the
technological transformations are so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
technological transformations are so
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400
technological transformations are so
rapid and you know they're going to come

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
rapid and you know they're going to come
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439
rapid and you know they're going to come
one after the other in the next 10 years

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
one after the other in the next 10 years
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330
one after the other in the next 10 years
I don't think we can even imagine what's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
I don't think we can even imagine what's
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549
I don't think we can even imagine what's
coming down the pipes and we're all

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
coming down the pipes and we're all
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650
coming down the pipes and we're all
struggling to keep up and you know we

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
struggling to keep up and you know we
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.210
struggling to keep up and you know we
don't even know how much of the current

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
don't even know how much of the current
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.130
don't even know how much of the current
state of more radical political

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
state of more radical political
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170
state of more radical political
polarization is actually a secondary

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
polarization is actually a secondary
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789
polarization is actually a secondary
consequence of technological

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
consequence of technological
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560
consequence of technological
transformations that we don't understand

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
transformations that we don't understand
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170
transformations that we don't understand
because I was thinking today about you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
because I was thinking today about you
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.789
because I was thinking today about you
know about Facebook and about Twitter

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
know about Facebook and about Twitter
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950
know about Facebook and about Twitter
and about YouTube and about the idea

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
and about YouTube and about the idea
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749
and about YouTube and about the idea
that people are in an echo chamber and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
that people are in an echo chamber and
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310
that people are in an echo chamber and
I'm not really sure that's the right

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
I'm not really sure that's the right
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.810
I'm not really sure that's the right
metaphor I think we might be in an

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
metaphor I think we might be in an
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.420
metaphor I think we might be in an
amplifier rather than an echo chamber

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430
amplifier rather than an echo chamber
 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.890
amplifier rather than an echo chamber
you know and I've thought for a long

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
you know and I've thought for a long
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.740
you know and I've thought for a long
time that when I'm when I'm thinking

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
time that when I'm when I'm thinking
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.510
time that when I'm when I'm thinking
about the effect of the individual I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
about the effect of the individual I
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760
about the effect of the individual I
read something that Solzhenitsyn said at

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
read something that Solzhenitsyn said at
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950
read something that Solzhenitsyn said at
one point and I think he was citing a an

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
one point and I think he was citing a an
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469
one point and I think he was citing a an
ancient Christian theologian who defined

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
ancient Christian theologian who defined
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240
ancient Christian theologian who defined
the universe as a place that's whose

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
the universe as a place that's whose
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.210
the universe as a place that's whose
circumference was nowhere and whose

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
circumference was nowhere and whose
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670
circumference was nowhere and whose
center was everywhere and I really like

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
center was everywhere and I really like
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260
center was everywhere and I really like
that idea it's I think it's actually

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
that idea it's I think it's actually
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940
that idea it's I think it's actually
relatively true from a technical

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
relatively true from a technical
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740
relatively true from a technical
perspective like from a physical

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
perspective like from a physical
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389
perspective like from a physical
perspective but some motion it's

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
perspective but some motion it's
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.270
perspective but some motion it's
imported out that each of us was to be

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
imported out that each of us was to be
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490
imported out that each of us was to be
regarded as the center of the cosmos and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
regarded as the center of the cosmos and
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.020
regarded as the center of the cosmos and
and that we have the power that's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
and that we have the power that's
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910
and that we have the power that's
associated with that and I've thought

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
associated with that and I've thought
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.080
associated with that and I've thought
about that a lot because there's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
about that a lot because there's
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510
about that a lot because there's
something about it that's oh that's it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
something about it that's oh that's it's
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.639
something about it that's oh that's it's
either obviously true or it's true

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
either obviously true or it's true
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740
either obviously true or it's true
enough so that we all acted out when we

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
enough so that we all acted out when we
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.270
enough so that we all acted out when we
interact with each other because we

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
interact with each other because we
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920
interact with each other because we
treat each other like conscious beings

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
treat each other like conscious beings
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640
treat each other like conscious beings
who have

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
who have
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920
who have
destiny and who have choices and who

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
destiny and who have choices and who
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.569
destiny and who have choices and who
make choices that are important and who

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579
make choices that are important and who
 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.729
make choices that are important and who
make choices that can be good or bad or

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
make choices that can be good or bad or
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.100
make choices that can be good or bad or
even good and evil we all act like that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
even good and evil we all act like that
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.850
even good and evil we all act like that
so we act that out and I was thinking

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
so we act that out and I was thinking
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.009
so we act that out and I was thinking
that you can think of network models in

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019
that you can think of network models in
 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.559
that you can think of network models in
that way you know you can think of human

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
that way you know you can think of human
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.140
that way you know you can think of human
beings as like nine billion dots in a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
beings as like nine billion dots in a
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550
beings as like nine billion dots in a
row and there's no connections between

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
row and there's no connections between
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.229
row and there's no connections between
the dots and then you sort of like a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
the dots and then you sort of like a
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.179
the dots and then you sort of like a
dust mote in the wind and who the hell

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189
dust mote in the wind and who the hell
 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.039
dust mote in the wind and who the hell
cares what you think anyways and you

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049
cares what you think anyways and you
 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.690
cares what you think anyways and you
don't have any impact on things or you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
don't have any impact on things or you
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.190
don't have any impact on things or you
can recognize that you're at the center

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
can recognize that you're at the center
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.160
can recognize that you're at the center
of a networked system and that you know

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
of a networked system and that you know
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.020
of a networked system and that you know
you know a thousand people or you will

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
you know a thousand people or you will
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.789
you know a thousand people or you will
in your lifetime or perhaps more than a

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
in your lifetime or perhaps more than a
 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.440
in your lifetime or perhaps more than a
thousand people and then they know a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
thousand people and then they know a
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.479
thousand people and then they know a
thousand people so you're separated by

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
thousand people so you're separated by
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.339
thousand people so you're separated by
one person from a million and two people

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
one person from a million and two people
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.470
one person from a million and two people
from a billion and that's a much better

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
from a billion and that's a much better
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360
from a billion and that's a much better
way to think and we are seriously

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
way to think and we are seriously
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.240
way to think and we are seriously
networked together and we're networked

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
networked together and we're networked
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.280
networked together and we're networked
together more now than we ever have been

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
together more now than we ever have been
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.929
together more now than we ever have been
and so one of the things that that might

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939
and so one of the things that that might
 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.440

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519
faster than they ever have been but with
 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.450
