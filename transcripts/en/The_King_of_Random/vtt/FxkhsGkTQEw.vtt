00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.330
What's up guys? I'm hanging out in Texas today with this guy. You know him hey guys

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.790
It's me Brian Brushwood from the modern rogue today. We're hanging out. We're working on making black-Powder fuses. What do you suppose?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.620
We're making fuses. It's almost as though

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.769
We're going to detonate

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.889
Something neither of us have made this black-Powder fuse before so the purpose of today's experiment is to see if we can get a safety

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140
Fuse that'll work at a consistent rate because we like our fingers, and we'd like to keep them for tomorrow's experiment as well

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.480
We're a magician. They're kind of important as we got muzzleloading propellant. You can pick this up at any kind of outdoor store

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.500
You can buy it online

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.099
I had to pay an extra like

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.099
$30 for extra safety handling because it's so flammable and the other thing to note about this is it as

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.000
FfG, I specifically asked for triple fG brian. [oh], I typed in what you did, [I'd] I thought it was the right stuff

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.229
How many apps do you want? How will he need three [apps]? I don't give enough apparently you don't

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.360
Now in addition to the black powder we also went down to the super center and picked up some of this stuff

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.129
This is just wrapping paper. It's for a party

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.948
[we're] gonna have a party [it] already is a party now that you're here

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.349
So we [were] thinking let's cut the tissue paper into strips

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.959
Let's pour some black Powder down in the middle of it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.890
And then wrap it over itself twist it up and see if that'll work for a fuse now

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.869
Do we have to get it wet or we could do this totally dry?

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.699
I have seen some instructions online on how to do this and actually wet down the paper and then pour the powder on I always

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.170
Thought that wetting down black powder wasn't necessarily a good thing [however] apparently if you let it dry overnight

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.330
It works even better, so let's just go ahead and try both methods and see which one works the best [works] for me now

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.769
The powder that we got is actually a lot coarser than we want it to be we need this to be finer powder and this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.140
Is pretty Grainy so we're just going to dump this into a little pyrex container and use the butt end of a hammer?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.509
Kind like a mortar and pestle to crush this up a bit

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.689
It's not going to blow up when I do this is it well you're dealing with black powder

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.439
So you always want to be prepared [for] the worst [oh] geez but this thing does go up?

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.359
We just we're doing it outdoors in a safe area and using a wooden handle so we don't conduct static electricity

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.909
But my guess is we're gonna be just we will have remove this to a safer location

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.029
Part the finer the powder is the more surface area which means the faster will react and the better it will fit into our

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.259
Makeshift views here as well, remember guys black Powders the stuff they used to mine

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.929
Or with it blows up rocks. It blows up mountains, and it can blow up you that's encouraging

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690
There we go, so it's not perfect

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.839
But you can see we've now reduced our double fG down to about a triple FG equivalent, and that should be enough for our purposes

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.789
Well, I tell you what this first one. We made is just dynamite [yeah], that looks beautiful

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.129
Let's do that again. So update guys. We have just rolled our first fuse, and I think it's looking pretty good

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.090
Yeah, I I'm not entirely sure I think we'll have a surprise ahead of us

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.969
But I think wetting it definitely helped it to get nice and snug [and] tight

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.550
so it seems like using water on the tissue paper acts as a glue or a binder to keep the paper itself together if you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.999
Were just to put the powder on and try and roll it up all the powder would spill out and you might have

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.899
inconsistencies in your fuse and also by rolling it at a 45 degree angle keeps everything twisted nice and tightly together I imagine if we

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.170
Try to light this thing off right now actually that's a good except [it]

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.500
What would happen if we slid it off right now only one way to find out?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Why don't we break off part of it? I think that's a great idea

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.629
Okay, so this is actually still pretty damp to the touch I can feel [it] [sweat]

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.910
No way no way

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.589
Even while it's wet, and it's actually working like it's not I thought it was gonna. Shoot up and and insipid

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.000
That's a pretty slover and infused that's perfect dude will it light up the Powder whoa?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.940
That was amazing

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.150
Dude Okay

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.830
So that was still wet guys and it still worked. I think we've got a viable idea

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.149
I think we can blow everything up right now so update. I cannot believe that [works]

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.700
I can't either and it seemed like the water actually

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.909
The dampness in no way inhibited the miniature explosions that went all the way down the chain reaction igniting the powder

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.160
Yeah, if anything the the fuse burned at like the perfect rate. It wasn't too fast. It wasn't too slow it was very consistent

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.029
Yeah, it's the consistency that blew me away [so] cool. So we're gonna do that again

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.980
We're gonna make a whole bunch more fuses and after seeing this works. Oh, well. I'm not [gonna] try one without water

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.940
I think it works really well

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.139
Keeping it Damp. Just helps hold everything down and we just got a really good run with one of those fuses

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.360
[so] now we're gonna make them and again [again]. Let's do hold on does go [arts] and [crafts]

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.420
So this is the stuff that we ground up, and this is the stuff [that] came out of the container

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.979
You can definitely see the difference between the two if that is fine brother. I see what you did there, [ha] ha ha

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.480
Wow much faster, but you know what it's not uncontrollably fast. Oh

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.099
Why did that go out? Oh there we go?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.840
Whoa nice?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.760
Nicely [done], I'm proud

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.730
[I] love how that it's all smoking behind you yeah, give me a glory shot. That's all it was great, okay

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.080
So why do you think the few stops?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.889
I think it was loosely packed and not very tight and as a result at some point

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.870
There was just enough of a gap that it all fizzled out

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.870
[I] agree, so it's very important to make sure our line is consistent

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.859
do you think it works like in the cartoons like we could just light that there and it would go all the way across that's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.970
A good question I think it would burn almost the exact same rate as it twisted up, I bet it works

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.809
Just like in the cartoons. Just like wiley coyote [gonna] give it a try all right [say] it starts here, and it ends here sure

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.560
Dude, just like in the cartoons check it out

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.850
Will it jump the gap?

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.689
Now it fizzles out that is so cool. [yo], just tells me we just need to roll it tight and yes consistency matters

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.499
But as long as you have enough that chain reaction. Just goes just at the perfect few speed

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.839
Here's an important part of science that we've just seen in action when black powder is confined. It will explode

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.780
But if you put it out in open air it burns at a very consistent rate

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.750
It's more like a fast fire than an explosion. That's right

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.779
So if we roll that up as long as there are no breaks theoretically

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.360
We should have ourselves a pretty good cannon fuse right on all right

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.119
So on a scale of one to ten what kind of success. Do you give us well?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.859
I think we're kind of like at a four, but I see potential here, please don't move it did well

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.429
[I] think we're [onto] something [I] think this is a viable idea

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.440
We made actual black powder fuses

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.209
And they worked mostly they seem to be pretty legit these things are still damp as we hold them and yet

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.769
They still work so I'm excited to see how they perform tomorrow will they be enough to set off our pyrotechnic device

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.490
You're gonna have to fight on the next video because we're gonna be putting these things to the test with coconuts

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.350
[just] promise me. I'll still have my fingers

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.519
There's no promises with the experiments with your everybody is signing a waiver and you guys while you're at

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.710
It click the link in the description go check out the Modern rogue

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.350
He does some pretty cool stuff on his channel with his buddy. What'd you guys get up to?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.989
I'm a me and Jason Murphy are on a quest to become the ultimate warrior

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.009
Gentlemen and scoundrel making nunchucks out of magazine blowing stuff up

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.010
We're trying to be like you kind of to click the link [in] description

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.040
Go show them some subscription love and we'll see you tomorrow where we put these things to the test

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.609
Thanks for joining us for this experiment. We'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.700
He gets Dubious to me
