characters or anything and I mean he
just asked that with everything and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
just asked that with everything and
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.350
just asked that with everything and
probably rightfully so but but now it's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
probably rightfully so but but now it's
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.090
probably rightfully so but but now it's
just ruined to be because I can see

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100
just ruined to be because I can see
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.620

question why um it's all I'm really torn
on it I guess maybe if they write it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
on it I guess maybe if they write it
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.699
on it I guess maybe if they write it
back in or they're they work it all

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
back in or they're they work it all
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.900
back in or they're they work it all
together maybe up but I don't see how I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910
together maybe up but I don't see how I
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.990
together maybe up but I don't see how I
could it doesn't seem like anyone

flow of the Chi and pressure points and
 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.930
flow of the Chi and pressure points and
stuff like that like that stuff so cool

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
