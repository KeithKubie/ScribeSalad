00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.780
&gt;&gt; So, these are the four steps that will help us

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.120
complete the task of Dorm Room Debbie going from being hungry,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.790
to being satisfied with pizza. It's important that we start with

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.550
these high level steps, before we start thinking about any of

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.140
the details. As part of the wire framing process, we need

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.650
to remind ourself of our persona and their Use Cases. So

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.340
her Use Cases are, she's up late, and she wants pizza

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.700
right away. Or, it's been a long week, and she wants

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.750
to try something new and fun.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.200
&gt;&gt; Now this is a mobile app so, regardless

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.850
of who the user is, we cannot the violate

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.610
the following mobile user constraints, such as limited data

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.910
and battery life, handedness, divided attention, and so on.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.820
&gt;&gt; And the next step is our Feature List. The feature list

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.710
is driven by Dorm-Room Debbie's attributes and her use cases. Let's not

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.170
focus too much on how we're going to put these features in our

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.670
application just yet. But let's just look at them in a list.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.890
&gt;&gt; Look

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.370
below in the instructor notes and you'll find a link to this prezi. Open

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.360
it up in the web browser and follow along for the rest of lesson.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.610
&gt;&gt; And now we're going to dig a little bit deeper into the flow

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.230
of our app. So, we showed you the four high level steps, that we

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.880
need to go through to complete the task of Debbie going from hungry,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.430
to being satisfied. Now let's jump into the flow for each of these steps.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160
&gt;&gt; So, here's step one. This is the screen that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.920
a user sees when they first enter the application. And honestly,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.370
there's only one of three things they could do. They can

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.430
build a brand new pizza, if they've never used the application before.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
Or they can re-order a previous pizza, if they've used this app

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.750
before. And if they have a pizza that's already in order, they

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.890
can check its order status. So in order to begin we will

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.390
pick the first option, which is they're going to build a new pizza.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.220
Step two is where the user is going to configure their pizza, and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.100
make sure that it's exactly what they want by choosing the size,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.190
the crust, the toppings side orders and so on. Now, if they don't want to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.630
actually build the pizza, they can view

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.760
the daily specials and pick one of those.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.260
&gt;&gt; And the third step is where they checkout and pay. If the user hasn't

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.920
already signed in, they'll do so here.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.280
If they've already saved their payment and delivery

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.290
information, they can easily just skip through

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.520
those steps or they can enter it in.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.830
Then they place their order. So if you've

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.200
used this application before, step three will be

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.060
really fast. All you have to do is click,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.210
Place your Order. Once Debbie's placed her order, she'll

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.690
see the order status. And if she has a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.230
question about her order, she can contact her driver.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.690
&gt;&gt; So let's say that Debbie has placed an order for a pizza already,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.950
that was a couple of days ago. She like the pizza. She likes the app.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.769
She came back in. And now she wants to re-order the same thing again. This

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.441
is where she would select option two,

00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:31.290
which is re-order a previous pizza. This flow

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.570
was actually really, really simple. She's probably signed in already.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.970
If she hasn't, then she will be asked to sign

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.840
in. This might seem a little bit strange, but consider

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.910
the possibility that Debbie has more than one phone, or more

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.810
than Android device. She can have a tablet, multiple phones

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.550
and so on. Anyway, so if she signed in, then she'll

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.830
be able to see all the order history for previous

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.360
orders. And then select one, and place an order for you.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.460
&gt;&gt; Now we're back to step three, which is check out pay. Because she's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.420
already signed in, all she'll have to press is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.690
Place order. And step four will be the same.
