00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What did we use to believe on how you physically build a startup?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What was the process we used?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We used to build startups by managing processes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We said, "Well hey, we understand how to build products."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We built them exactly like we built them in large companies.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We hire product managers, and we do something called waterfall engineering,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which I'll explain in a second which basically are step by step by step.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact, what we used to do is we used to draw this diagram on napkins.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We used to say, "Well you come up on a concept then you raise some seed funding and then you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
go into product development, and then you have alpha test, beta test, and first customership.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
What could be wrong with that?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In fact for 30-40 years this was the canonical model for how to build startups

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we'd say marketing, well, we understand.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
While engineering is developing the product, marketing is creating all the marketing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
communications material, hiring a PR agency, and creating early buzz and then from marketing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the world's most fun job was have the party.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You get to create demand by having a launch event and you think about branding

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and your job really was to create end-user demand and derive it into the potential sales channel.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
For sales, what that meant is unless the VP of Sales was the founder you tended to hire them

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
around the time engineering were saying, "We're in alpha and beta test."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And they we're going out and starting to hire their first sale staff

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and they were looking at your 5-year revenue plan

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and since it obviously came from a burning bush and it was the word of God

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
they were just going to execute that plan.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Why? Because it's said so and you said so and if you had investors they said so.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There might not be any facts behind it but there it was. It was the spreadsheet.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And so they were building the sales organization so again and at first customership,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
if marketing was going to drive demand they were jut going to have a sales curve that took off

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because the revenue plan said so.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The next piece was the Bus Dev.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In business development used to mean the group that put together

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
all the deals to create the whole product.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The whole product meant startups just because of their size are incapable of creating

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
all the features and services, etc., that a mainstream customer might need.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So why don't we hire business development people to do partnerships.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So at first customership we could look like a large company for mainstream customers.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The only fallacy in this is that you assume that your first customers are going to be in the mainstream.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It turns up for most startups your first customers are actually crazy people like you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and so therefore creating this entire cloud of deals are actually useful a year after first customership

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but in fact just get in your way on day one.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The other piece is engineering, and engineering--how simple could that be? It was understood.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We did exactly what we did in the large corporations.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You wrote a market requirements document then engineering shut their doors,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
rolled up their sleeves, and went into waterfall engineering, which we'll describe a little later.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You hired a QA department then at the end finally when it was all done you hired a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
tech pubs department and all the products were ready to go in version 1.0.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
All the features at one time at first customership.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And this for 30 or 40 years was the way we thought about startups.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
There can be no other way. This is how we manage the process.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We now know these are just simply wrong and I'll explain to you what we're going to do instead.
