00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.596
- [Voiceover] Four unit
squares each have 4/5

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:06.146
of their area shaded,
and we see that here.

00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:08.772
If we had this whole thing
shaded in, that would be

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:12.169
a whole, but we only
have 4/5 of it shaded in.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.464
It's split up into five equal sections,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:17.242
and 4/5 are shaded in.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:19.090
So this is a fifth, that's another fifth,

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.191
that's another fifth,
and that's another fifth,

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.163
so we have 4/5 shaded in.

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:27.416
And we have these 4/5 four times,

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:29.578
so you could view this entire shaded area

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:32.431
as four times 4/5.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.207
So all of this we could view

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:39.494
as four times 4/5.

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:40.564
Well, what is this going to be?

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.175
What is the total area that is shaded?

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.765
And I encourage you to
pause the video and try to

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:46.315
think about it.

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.251
Well, each of these bars,
this right over there,

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.697
that is a fifth.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:52.585
We've already seen that.

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.954
If you took a whole and you split it into

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.419
five equal sections,

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.499
one of those sections
is going to be a fifth.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.904
That's a fifth right over there.

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:02.374
So how many fifths are shaded in?

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:05.112
Well, that's, let me do
this in a color you can see.

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:06.754
This is one.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.247
I didn't switch the colors.

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:12.919
This is one, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5,

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.948
5/5, 6/5, 7/5, 8/5,

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:21.674
9/5, 10/5, 11/5, 12/5,

00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:24.150
13/5, 14/5,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.236
15/5,16/5.

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:30.559
We have 16/5 shaded in.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:32.554
So what is the total area that is shaded?

00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:37.174
We can say 16/5

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:41.205
are shaded in or 16/5 square units,

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.534
where whole would be one square unit,

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:46.802
but we have 16/5 of the square units

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:48.698
actually shaded in.

00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:50.869
Let's do another example.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.522
What is 2/3 of six?

00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:56.335
Well, we have six triangles here,

00:01:56.335 --> 00:01:58.531
and you can see that they're
giving us a little hint,

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.877
and they've divided it into thirds.

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:02.772
They've divided it into
three equal groups.

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:06.978
Notice that's one equal group,
that is two equal groups,

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:09.200
and that is three equal groups.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.011
So each third, so each of these thirds,

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:14.350
this is 1/3 of six.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.898
We see that 1/3 of six is two,

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:20.547
but we want 2/3 of six,
so that's going to be

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:23.583
two of these groups of 1/3.

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:26.150
So that's one group of 1/3 of six,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.556
and that's another 1/3 of six.

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:31.016
1/3 of six.

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.537
So if you took both of these together,

00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:35.807
you're going to have 2/3 of six,

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:39.834
and we see that that is one,
two, three, four triangles.

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.310
So that is four triangles.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.558
Let's do another one,

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:46.323
and this one's a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.016
What is 5/8 of four?

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:51.462
And we have drawn here four holes.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.323
This is a hole, this is
a hole, this is a hole,

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:55.766
and that's a hole, and we
see that they're split.

00:02:55.766 --> 00:03:00.520
Each of the holes is split
in two, so this is 1/2.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.025
This is another 1/2.

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:03.212
This is 1/2.

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:04.857
That's another 1/2.

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:06.134
That's 1/2.

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:07.666
That's another 1/2.

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:08.850
That's 1/2.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.221
That's another 1/2.

00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:13.307
Now, why do they do this?
Why did they give us a hint?

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.099
Well, we see that each half is actually

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.139
1/8 of the entire four holes.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.613
What am I talking about?

00:03:21.613 --> 00:03:23.697
Well, if I were to take
all of these four holes,

00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:27.760
and if I were to divide them
into eight equal sections,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.062
this is one of the eight equal
sections right over here.

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:33.825
It just happens to be half of a whole.

00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:37.607
So if I'm talking about, so
one way to think about it is

00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:41.542
if I say 1/8 of four,

00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:43.809
that's going to be equal to 1/2.

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:44.552
You see it here.

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:47.139
We have four holes, and if
I were to divide that into

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.528
eight equal sections, that
would mean taking each hole

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:54.773
and dividing it into two,
so half is 1/8 of four,

00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:55.909
but that's not what they're asking us.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.301
They're asking, "What's 5/8 of four?"

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.065
So this is 1/8.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.532
This is 2/8.

00:04:02.532 --> 00:04:03.675
This is 3/8.

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:04.665
This is 4/8.

00:04:04.665 --> 00:04:06.325
This is 5/8.

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:08.745
So what is that going to be all together?

00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:10.707
So I just wanna remind you 'cause

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:11.775
it could be a little confusing.

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:13.809
I'm saying eighths and
halfs and all of that.

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.800
Remember, 1/8 of four is 1/2, so two.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.636
Let me shade this in, and we'll do this

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:22.679
with a different color.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.623
So 1/8 of four,

00:04:24.623 --> 00:04:26.778
I wanna do a lighter color.

00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:30.193
So 1/8 of four is 1/2,

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.778
2/8 is two halfs,

00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:35.699
3/8 is three halfs.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.790
4/8 is four halfs,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.179
and 5/8 is five halfs.

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:45.458
So I've just shaded. Notice
I took the whole four.

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:47.458
I divided it into eight equal sections,

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.393
and I've shaded in five of them.

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:53.022
One, two, three, four, five.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:55.309
Now, how many is that total?

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.643
Well, each of those are a half.

00:04:57.643 --> 00:04:59.944
This is (mumbles).

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:02.099
This is 1/2,

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.723
this is another half, that's another half,

00:05:04.723 --> 00:05:06.995
that's another half,
and that's another half,

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.950
so altogether I have five
halfs that I have shaded in.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.546
So that is five halfs.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.646
Let's do one more.

00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:18.722
What is 4/5 of ten?

00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:20.180
And, once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.814
and try to think about it.

00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:23.857
Well, we see here on the number line,

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:27.316
they've taken from zero to ten,
and they have split it into

00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:30.784
five equal sections, so each of this,

00:05:30.784 --> 00:05:33.664
so this right over here,

00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:36.462
this is 1/5 of 10.

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:37.944
If you go from zero to 10,

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:39.415
you'd write into five equal sections.

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:41.285
This is one 1/5 of ten.

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:42.802
Let me write that down.

00:05:42.802 --> 00:05:46.165
This is 1/5

00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:48.259
of 10 right over here.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.174
Now, what number is that?

00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:52.048
Well, we see that that number is two.

00:05:52.048 --> 00:05:54.002
Two is 1/5 of 10.

00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:57.836
1/5 of 10 is equal to two.

00:05:57.836 --> 00:05:59.561
Well, they're not just
asking us 1/5 of 10.

00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:01.867
They're asking us 4/5 of 10.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:03.736
So this is 1/5 of 10,

00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:05.551
2/5 if we go,

00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:07.064
actually, let me go this way.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:10.969
So let me do it with another color.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.623
So this is 1/5 of 10.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.806
Now we're gonna go 2/5 of 10,

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:20.197
3/5 of 10, and we go all
the way to 4/5 of 10,

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:22.695
which get us to this
number right over there.

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:24.556
Now, what number is that?

00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:27.143
Well, we see this is zero,
one, two, three, four,

00:06:27.143 --> 00:06:30.923
five, six, seven, eight,
so it's the number eight.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.788
So what is 4/5 of 10?

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:34.937
It is the number eight.
