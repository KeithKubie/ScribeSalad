IT'S EVEN SECRET TO BLACK MEN.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
IT.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.984 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: TRUE.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY JUST KNOW NOT TO TOUCH
IT.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:54.754 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S TRUE.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:55.221 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S TRUE.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.722 align:start position:0% line:85%
I LEAVE IT ALONE.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.624 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:08.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF BEING THE

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:10.363 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S BE THE MAJORITY.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT WELCOMING A DAMN
THING, LARRY!

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS A CONSPIRACY.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:20.600 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
