Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, January 18th, 2016. How's it going out? Uh, I am recording this Sunday afternoon and uh, in Vancouver, uh, Canada doing two shows here tonight. It's halftime. Actually third quarter just started off the Bronco Steelers. I missed a Seattle and a Carolina. I know that must've been a great fucking game. It kills me. You know, you never know when you book the fucking gigs that have game like that is going to be on. But uh, I imagined that that was, uh, as good as the score looked. And of course I'm up here in Canada and uh, I don't know. They don't have, they just went to boomer and all those guys at halftime time and all they did was interview Cam Newton. They asked him one question, you know how he didn't answer, you know, he just talked, didn't give an answer about anything.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       They like, what do they get? Did the a, the second half to a, you know, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he just goes, yeah, well, you know, our offense and our defense and of course the special teams, you know, everybody's got a job to do and a, they get out there and they, uh, try to get done enough. Fortunately today we were able to get out there and execute some of the things we'll be working with all this weekend. Uh, you know, next week we got another person that we're going to be playing. I should set a team, not a person to be on the team. We're going to play. I know. We just hope that a, you know, we're just gonna try to keep it going because uh, you know, we're all trying to win a championship here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:24       And by the end you're just like, I did, what the fuck did I even ask you? Um, I wonder if, you know, cause athletes, anything they fucking say they going to take it out of context. So they just, they get trained to just answer and not say anything. Just like a politician. I want. If you could fucking turn that off. You know, if you stay in the league long enough, if you drive your wife nuts, you know, Holly, do you know where my shows are? Well, you know, you're to, you own a lot of stuff and sometimes that stuff gets misplaced at a, you can do is just try to fire on all cylinders and try to find the things that you can have and a, if you can find them, you can find them. And if you can't a, then you've got to move onto the next thing.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       But, uh, you know, it was always, I'm always looking towards the next weekend. Another thing that's going to be lost and lost. So I, we're definitely going to do everything we can to find it. Uh, the offense, defense and special teams, no, not healthy. Um, anyways. Uh, yeah. So I'm up here in Vancouver. God Damn it. It's fucking beautiful up here. Fucking gorgeous man. Especially when you live in, you know where the hell I live, which was not designed to have really anybody living there other than I guess maybe some indigenous people sending smoke signals, you know, probably sending smoke signals that, you know, can you find any food cause we can't. I'm sick of eating snake and do you want to get the fuck Outta here? How would the fuck you do that with smoke signals? It must, must've been pretty God damn simple. Right? The smoke signals if they even did it or is that just another Hollywood thing that they threw a blunt? I mean, how do you even fucking do that? I guess she had to go, obviously you got to put the fire out, right? Oh, what do I, how the fuck would you do that? You know? All right, one big puff of fuck. It's, you gotta know what kind of wood to burn. What a pain in the ass. Jesus Christ. I'm going to get lost in. Remember getting lost at the mall before a fucking cell phone. That was unbelievable. Forget about back then. If you get lost, you are fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       Hey, anybody see a, what the fuck was that guy's name?

Speaker 3:          00:03:26       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       Oh, fucking red face. Where did he go? Done. I mean, how long do you look? You can't really yell. You're going to attract wild animals.

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       Cool.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       Just walking around the woods. Hey Eddy, eddy the fuck are you. This isn't funny man. Um, anyways, but you come up here after leaving the desert. Um, what am I see at the say the desert? I always think of a that awesome. Great Greg Giraldo. Rest his soul joke where he did that whole thing about, uh, how eloquent the words, that words the notes were that, uh, soldiers wrote during the civil war, you know, versus some of the letters from people coming back from re Iraq. Uh, what am I, I came about with fucking wet. It's really hard to be out here with the ball sticking g like out here in the, in the desert. You, I remember the difference between desert and desert to us is for dessert. More calories. Right? There you go. That's how I do it. And don't even ask me to spell restaurant cause I won't even fucking remember. So anyways, I'm up here in Vancouver, so we go to fucking land, um, and just, Oh my God, all the lush greenery, all the lakes, although water, everything we don't have down in La, beautiful houses, I guess it's expensive as shit up here. And they was saying how, um, a lot of Asian people,

Speaker 3:          00:04:54       um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       you know, not indigenous foreigners, you know, they got to get rid of their fucking money. They get to wash their money or I don't what the fuck it is that government's going to take it all. So they, uh, use this place up here like a Swiss bank and they buy like super expensive places for cash,

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       which drives the housing market up. It's fucking nuts, man. Anytime you go to another country, you just hear the shit that they fucking dealing with. I just, you know, you always think like you'd come up here, Canada is going to have no fucking problems. You know, you watch one Michael Moore documentary that just gives you a complete, like misinterpretation of what the fuck is going on up here. So they, I guess they had to make some sort of law.

Speaker 3:          00:05:36       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       that you couldn't do something like that. I can't make him what the fucking person told him when all the weed, while the way to the fucking supreme court, there was like a group of people from Asia that was so rich that they actually sued an entire country for not letting them either come into the country or,

Speaker 3:          00:05:53       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:53       by a bunch of shit over here that drove the housing market stuff up or something that, or by their citizenship. I can't even fucking remember. But that's the charm of this podcast. You know, I get a little information, I barely remember half of it and I just fucking run with it. That's all. Um, so anyways, um, so it went all the way to the Supreme Court and then they were just finally like, ah, yeah, you kind of have to be from this country for us to give a fuck about you, you know, to like win a lawsuit. So, uh, see you later. And that's, it ended, I guess the lawyer for them knew the whole way, going all the way up that it wasn't going to happen. You know, they weren't going to win it and he just took their money. He probably had to sit there and work on his, uh, I'm disappointed we lost two phase, you know, as he took all their fucking money.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       But anyways, so let's talk about NFL football. What [inaudible] um, the fucking patriots. They one, God dammit. Thank Christ they won. They Christ, they one in Seattle, Los Thank Christ. You know, if we're going to keep advancing, I just didn't want Seattle to get the revenge. You can't remember forever if I've already said this, I just didn't want to see Seattle get the revenge on a banged up Patriot team. If we come in healthy and they kick our ass good on them. But uh, you know, congratulations to the Carolina Panthers. Uh, they gotta be the favorites at this point. Come on. They 16 and fucking one. Right. Got that young defense than at scared of Shit. They just beat Seattle. Right. Who knows? But, um, I don't know shit about football. I've, I've just been so fucking busy, so I'm still going to talk about it. You guys can keep trashing me that I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       Shit, I don't give a fuck. Um, and by the way, this is why I never record on a day that I flew cause my brain is even more all over the place than it usually is, especially when I got a fucking TV going on in the background. But uh, you know, I got, I got a busy fucking datum. I fly back tomorrow, get a busy fucking day. So I apologize if this is all over the place, even more than usual. I as a first down for this damn fucking 25. Oh, somebody else up here. It gives a shit about NFL football. I know they have CFL ends in like, is it the end of November? They have the Grey Cup, which is their super bowl or is it a December? I don't know. The people even give a shit. You ever see the fucking stadiums for their football teams up here?

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       It's like you sit in the stands, you can see your car, you know one of those deals where there's like a fucking, you watch them kick a field goal and you're looking at traffic driving by on the street. Like those old school football stadiums from like the 60s and seventies you know, where they would have like the horseshoe shaped stadium, which was I think what happened with what with football stadiums was when there wasn't that many people in the or, and also the leaks were small. They just had people sitting on both sides, right? You had the home side and the visitors side and that was it. And then as there's more and more people population got bigger, the leagues got bigger than they built end zone seats that connected both sides. I think they just did it on one side first. Then you had the horseshoe, right? Like the fucking a Broncos plated, the Buckeyes, a Buckeye still call it the horse. They still call it a horseshoe even though they fucking closed in it. And then eventually there was people, people did so much fucking that they had the clothes, you know. And there's so much ESPN that got everybody fucking interested in it that isn't even interested in it. Then all of a sudden Beyonce singing at fucking halftime, you know? And there's a bunch of people in the crowd that are excited by it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:40       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:43       a fucking old ass Rod Stewart. Who the fuck they dragon out? They always usually go with somebody young or they just fucking drag somebody who out, who's on their last fucking legs, like their last big payday, you know, they just fucking wheel them out there. They going to do this year? Huh? Night Ranger. Do you think going to be like night ranger? A Drake? That's what I'm guessing. I'll wait. I think it is Beyonce. You know? I know because Nia wanted to go to the Superbowl because Beyonce was there. I'm like, why don't you go see her in concert? You're going to make us go to the fucking super bowl and then we get to watch your lip sync. One fucking song. How the fuck did Sean Penn interview that drug, Lord, how do you do something like that? And the government isn't like, Hey, you know, we're trying to find that guy. You know when you're just sitting there palling around with them. Probably bought them like fast times at Ridgemont high DVDs. Right. For his underground layer.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       Dude, I love shod pen as an actor. But how out of your fucking tree are you that you're going to go and interview that fucking guy?

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       You know I did that. I'm trying to think how many fucking standup specials I would have to put out before I could go. I would go fucking interview somebody and like I the, well I guess Isis is actually fight, but we're fucking with them too. You know? I would just think I'm going to walk in there with my microphone. They're all going to laugh at me. Then they're going to saw my fucking head off. Or were you gonna Worse? Tie me to a chair. Fucking torture me to death. That's insane. Hey, good on him also. I don't understand. Is it El Chapo? That's his name. He sounds like such a gentleman. Huh? El Is a good chap. El Chapo.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:11:37       I don't fucking get it, man.

Speaker 3:          00:11:41       What are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Why, why did he go down there and interview that guy?

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       And like how, how,

Speaker 3:          00:11:51       wow.

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       How well does Sean movies do that? Drug dealers on the run. He's on the run from our government, right? Isn't this the guy who escaped? I don't fucking know. You know what's going on is my fucking Internet won't let me sign on so I can't fucking see anything. I can't see the fucking highlights.

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       Nothing. You know, while I'm up here is I fucking got one God damn channel and a bunch of Tim Horton fucking commercials, which is at Dunkin donuts. See if I can sign on here is an El Chapo. The guy that liked that we would, that keeps escaping from jail. Set the Guy El Chapo. Come on man. Come on. Ah, this connection is untrusted. Yeah. Jesus Christ. It's probably some psycho from Alberta trying to hack in here. That seems like their Texas to me, when you're up here, it's all fucking oil man and ranchers and shit. Um, and then you've got Edmonton, Edmonton. Seems like it's nice. You know what I mean? Like that's their like business hub. You know, I'm just totally judging these just by doing, like driving through and doing a little bit of standup out here. Like when I did stand up in Calgary, great people, but fucking animals, Jesus fucking Christ. They weren't animals. I don't know if it's cause the place that we performed at there was like no carpeting or nothing. They were fucking, I think it was Casa cause it was bring your own beer. Fucking animals. I would never fuck with anybody from Calgary.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       I saw the way they behave when they were in a good mood. Ex excited for a show. Don't have a fuck with anybody from Calgary. What's Edmonton? It was civilized. Calgary. Jesus Christ. They had everything but a hookers swinging from a swing. You know, back in the old days with the salons where they had the horse, you know, way over dressed. Once again, it might just be a fucking movie thing. So much. So much of my history is based on it. By the way, I can't get on the fucking Internet, but for some reason I could fucking, uh, I could do it over the, uh, I could do it on my phone. Let me look up El Chapo here. I said he sounds like such a chap. I just think like that English think, Eh. Well, Chapo, he's a Mexican chap. How Mexico secretly launched a crackdown after Penn met El Chapo. How El Chapo was finally captured again. That was one day ago. We'll el Chapo rat out rival cartels. Corrupt officials. It's gotta be a lot of stress. Be In this El Chapo guy. Huh? Joaquin Guzman.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:30       You know, I got to say, he looks like a Mexican Robert Blake like during the Beretta years that when he says a, yeah, that's me who's also on the phone and then starts laughing. How else this is when, you know, you lived a fucking crazy life. This is just the front page of this guys for a, if you search this guy's name, how El Chapo was finally captured again, will el Chapo rally red? Those, uh, El Chapo Guzman. Sean Penn talks about them. El Chapo had erectile dysfunction surgery while on the run. That's nice to know. We took a pit stop. You know, guy takes care of himself. How nervous was that doctor working on that maniacs? Dick? Uh, El Chapo speaks rolling stone. Sean Penn has terrible regret about meeting El Chapo. Well, what did he think he was going to meet?

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       he's going to get some fucking Sherry's berries. The hunt for El Chapo, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. The truth about the jailbreak, there's nothing here about a, an older, wiser El Chapo puts out a little singer Songwriter Jesus fucking Christ. Dude, you don't realize how fucking finished we are. Just as, as, as, as, uh, just as a race, as a race, as humanity. So I'm trying to say, just as people were fucking done, you know, rolling stone. Rolling stone this month has Sean Penn talking to El Chapo, the Leonardo DiCaprio's on the con cover, and they're billing Billingham where he has a plan to save the planet.

Speaker 3:          00:16:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       Why are we doing, what the fuck is that government not doing that a list fucking a actress have to talk to drug lords and try to save the planet. I mean, there's gotta be how many leaks are in the fucking dam at this point? I don't know about you guys. That does not make me feel comfortable. You don't have any boomer Esiason to figure out how to Co fucking colonize Mars. That's the next thing that they're gonna have in the rolling. Rolling Stone. You don't have a why? What the fuck do I want to hear that?

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       Can I hear a scientist?

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       how about I have a navy seal interview. El Chapo.

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       I don't know bill, how would you shut the fuck up? All right, I will. I don't know. I get unsettled. I get unsettled him. I did. I have problems with digestion. Um, I can't even remember what the fuck I was going to look up. What was I initially looking at before I got to El Chapo? Jesus Christ. Some of the stories on that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       You know, it's right up there with that fucking Raj Stewart rumor for way back in the day. If I that one, I think it was, I can't remember. I've still, whatever they're, yeah, they found like a gallon of [inaudible] in his stomach. His stomach had to be pumped, you know, a gallon. You went to trader Joe's and butts them up. Fucking all natural organic. Fuck, I'm sorry. Um, you got a gallon of it, you know? No, you went to a, was those foods, that place where you buy everything in Bulk? Let's fuck it. Whales. It, push it around those pallet jacks by and cheerios.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       You got to get a membership to it because with a C it's not [inaudible]. What's the, what's the name of that? I never go to the fucking place. Once I had to go in there and get a membership, they wanted all this fucking information.

Speaker 3:          00:18:03       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       oh Christ, what the fuck is it called? That coat check. I'm never going to remember it. You know what I'm saying? That just kills the jokes. But when you can't remember the fucking references, it just, it absolutely kills it. Costco. Hey went to Costco. He bought one of those big fucking a gallons a fucking ges it on a dairy, chugged it. Anyway, so there's, he has something on El Chapo, El Chapo. They said a,

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       I can't remember like just fucking killed this person's whole family took their kids and something. I just, I don't believe it. They took his kids and then flew him to uh, to Columbia and then threw him off a bridge. It's like, really? There's not any bridges in Mexico. You never know what to believe. But I gotta tell you when you go south or the US, you do not want to piss anybody off as far as I can tell. That's some next level shit. And I could say that because I just read papers from the United States. They uh, that's just, that's just next level. Like you know, you mad at somebody and then you know how you get your revenge is just some next, I read that a killing Pablo. One time I had to put the book down like three times. Some of the shit they just said that the guy did not, I don't know if the fucking guy did this shit, but I'm a one time hearing that the guy had a party night and everybody's out there by the pool standing around, you know, and a, what's his face there? Pablo Escobar standing there. You know, everybody's ignoring the weight that he's putting on as he sits there and his fucking Hager action slacks, you know, seemed to like those is stretched and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:19:44       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       you know, still tucked them in right at the waist, you know what I mean? Talk to him right in the waist. Didn't push the pants down, didn't do the fucking share it on, tucked. He tucked it right in. And uh, they said that he, he allegedly filed one of his, uh, one of the people didn't want to, it's not as by one of the maids. I don't know what allegedly was stealing. So they tied this guy's legs together and his arms behind the his back and they threw him in the house pool and just watched him drown as everyone was standing there at the party. You know, I'd say they must've been a lot of ice shaken and drinks after that one. Like so is this a Victorian house? Pablo? Mr Escobar. Oh, I want to go the pool. Um, yeah. People get their faces ripped off. Is it torturing to death? They're like peeling their fucking faces back. This is not funny. This is not what this podcast is about. Um, why is this fucking Steeler Denver Games so fucking boring?

Speaker 2:          00:20:44       Is it because I have the sound down? I just don't give a fuck. The AFC is just the walking wounded, right? This burger is a fucking man. Look at a guy just getting bumped by Lyme and he stays in there. That guy, he has like fucking, he stays in the pocket like Steve Grogan. Stuff used to stay in the pocket. Did anybody remember that? Any old pats fans out there? You'd fucking sit there. And this is back when you could literally, you could hammer a fucking quarterback, drive your helmet right under his chin and then lift him off the ground and pile, drive them into the fucking astroturf, which is like getting tackled in a parking lot. That's been, uh, painted green and Steve Drogan, whenever he would go back for a pass, it's back when he had that fucking neck brace and he had such a long neck, he could still see like six inches in neck.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       Right. Even with the neck brace. And there'd be some defensive lineman just run in full speed right at him. And he, he would just hang onto it, hang onto and hang on to it, and then he would throw the ball and the camera would follow the football. And right as he let it go, you'd see just the beginning of that fucking Lyman drilling them and he'd go flying right out the right side of your screen or left side, depending on which way he was going down the field to Stanley Morgan, you know, Russ Francis, one of those fucking guys, right? Harold Jackson. Who else did we have back then? I can't even fucking remember. Hasselbeck they had Hasselbeck whose son was the one who said, uh, we want the ball and we're going to score

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       don Hasselbeck I think was, is dead. All right. Anyways, where the, where the fuck am I? Um, yeah. Rothberg is like that, that guy stands in the pocket and takes a fuck at it and speak in which to, uh, I know there's a lot of Kansas City fans would probably pissed off at the calls Tom Brady got and the lack of calls that Alex Smith got. Ed. Uh, I'm a patriots fan. Uh, you're absolutely right, but that is not Tom Brady's fault. Okay. And I'm hoping most of you guys have kids. The city can hear what I'm saying because you're not as upset because you got to see your baseball team when the world series. Right? So you got that going for you. Half of you professional teams won championships this year. That's pretty fucking good. Right? Um, Tom Brady earned those costs. Okay. This is the, if you want Alex Smith to get those calls in the future, in the future, he has to make the NFL owners a lot more money than he is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       And that's just a simple fact. And people call it the Tom Brady rules. It isn't, it's the superstar rules. You know, Jordan gets away with the push. Right? What was the last time we, Colby Bryant. What does Colby Bryan have to do to get, you know, well, he's not healthy anymore, but back in the day you could be standing in the lane before the fucking game starts and if he runs it to you that they're going to call it on you, he'd literally have to, to eat after fucking tie an ax to the front of knee and fucking jump into your, cut your head off before, you know, if there was a way to call offsetting, they would have, it's just, it's just how it works. But, um, I have to say as much as he earned the calls, that one where he was getting sacked and he switched it to his left hand and throw it and they still gave him the call was fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       I even as a pager, it's fair. I was at home going, oh, what the fuck? Give me a break. But you know, I'll take it. Of course they'll take it the same way you would have. Um, but, uh, I don't care to see. It's a great team and they have, you know, Alex Smith, I think he's going to be a really fucking great quarterback. Um, but you gotta have it all man. He gotta have the coach and the ownership and all that bullshit and lucky enough that we have that in, uh, in New England. So there you go. That's me trying to not be a cunt.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       All right. And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       Oh God, I can't wait to go home and watch that fucking Carolina Panther game, man. I think you're going to see like all these people that they were saying or the heir apparent to fucking Tom Brady and Peyton manning. I think it's a,

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:04       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       here's a stat I had to look up because Don Myra sent me a, uh, a text. I tried to drop names here. By the way, I'm on his podcast this past week. Uh, Don [inaudible] sent me a text this morning. He goes, how many quarterbacks have you ever seen in the NFL?

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       Have a hail Mary pass, throw a successful, hey ma, hail Mary. Pass once in their career. Forget about twice in the same season. And uh, I had to go look it up. I was like, I gotta I gotta find this out, man. I gotta find out a, you know, if anybody's ever done it, cause I was like, there's no way anybody's done it. In my lifetime of watching the last 30 something years of watching football, holy fuck. I've been watching football for 38 years. Oh my God. I'm old. I started watching it religiously in about 1978. Um, yeah, about that 78, 79. Jesus fucking Christ. Um, put it this way. The first Superbowl I watched was super bowl 12, and they're at 50, so there you go. Wow, this is going to be my, uh, well would that be my 50, not 51st fucking idiot. My 39th Superbowl 50 minus 12. Plus I watched 12, right? Yeah. So that day. There you go. Yeah, there's a lot of people right now actually think I'm wrong, but it's true. It's my 39th I'm going to be watching anyways. Let's plow ahead here. Um, so I looked it up. Successful Hail Mary's. Okay. Um, there's only one guy that I saw since they started keeping the stat in 1975, at least on Wikipedia. I didn't go to the football reference.com which I love.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       the one guy who's ever done done it twice since they kept the stats in 1975, Steve Bart Koski,

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       Steve Bar Koski and there's no way to picture Steve Art Koski and not have the song, this song go through your head walking on air. I never thought I could be so free. He throwing the ball to Bailey. Watch you Johnson and to another guy. Yeah. He looked like the greatest American hero. He did it in 1978 against the saints. And then he did it again in 1983 against the 40 niners in the, uh, NFC west, which back then was only four teams. It was the Los Angeles Rams, the New Orleans saints, the Atlanta Falcons, and the San Francisco 49ers. The quarterbacks are Steve Bart Koski, a 78 seat bar. Koski Archie Manning, and I think they had a quarterback controversy. Pat Hayden, Vince Ferragamo back and forth, uh, four Vince cover gum. I tried to take the money and went to the fucking CFL. Oh, Jewish. Never saw him again. And uh, it would be Steve de or Jim Plunkett at 78. I did this with fucking Joe Bart. Nick, one time. We tried to name all the starting quarterbacks in the NFL in 1978 we went around the league. So I think it was a FCEs was Burt Jones, Bob Greasy, Steve Grogan, Richard Todd and Joe Ferguson for the bills. That was Terry Bradshaw. Dan, pastor Rainey,

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       who the fuck was quarterback for the browns? It was either Mike Phipps or, uh, Brian's site. And then the Bengals was Kenny Anderson. Kenny The candle as Colin's were sent. They Call Him Kenny the candle Coz one blow and he was out. You ever see that one on NFL films? And they cut the kitty and I said, he's like, I'll fuck Colin's worth. Um, and let's see, was Craig Morton? I'll just do the AFC cause I know this is fucking driving everybody nuts but, or this is my f I have to do it now. Cause now it's in my head. Craig Morton was at the orange crush Broncos. Ken Stabler, Kenny Snake Stabler for the, uh, the Raiders. Dan Fouts, the Great Dan Fouts air Corey l with the address. Jim Zorn was Seattle and then a fuck. There's always one that gets me. Who the fuck was with the chiefs? It was before black ledge was after Len Dawson. Who the fuck was the quarterback? There's a good one for you. There's some poor bastard in Kansas City right now screaming at who the fuck was it? I even know, I think like the Buccaneers had Gary hough.

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       Lynn Dickey was out in Greenbay. Jim Hart was, how the fuck do I remember those? I remember Kansas City, Kansas City. I gotta look this up. Kansas City chief quarterback. Hey, it's going to get better guys. I played drums this week out and I played with the Colin Hay for men at work. All right, I'm going to tell her story in a second here. Just fucking deal with this here. Kansas City chiefs, QB 1970 why do I care? Why do I fucking care? Lists of Kansas City chief quarterbacks. This is fucking made for me. Who's the last person who fucking went to this starting quarterback season to season.

Speaker 1:          00:38:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       Jesus. They've had some guys. Yeah. Joe Montana. Warren Moon, rich Gannon. All right, here we go. Here we go. Back at it, out back in it up 1970 I'd never get this. Mike Livingston and Tony Adams, this is the one that always fucking gets me. Leonie Dawson left in 1975 and then Mike Livingston took over.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       You know there was a guy who played for the Bengals that Bill Walsh was talking about. He only played for one season. He got fucking injured. And Bill Walsh to this day still said he's the greatest quarterback that he ever coached, but he's probably still trying to motivate or he was, anyways, she passed away, probably still trying to motivate fucking Montana or a young, even after they retired, get them to rake the leaves better that day or some shit. Um, I can't remember the guy's fucking name, but that's one to look up. Uh, anyways, so yeah, this, this week I did a Greg Baron show at Largo and uh, I was one of those things too. It's not quite like the goddamn comedy jam. This was one where they actually have people, uh, for the most part it's musicians coming out and telling funny stories. And this is something that Greg did a number of years ago and uh, he's brought the show back. And, um, so anyways, let me, let me get the line up here so I don't fuck this up. I did take a picture of it. I'm so fucking disorganized. I apologize. Um, all right. So it was calling, hey, Tom Morello, myself and Chris Fairbank's and other comedians, those two comedians. And then, uh, two musicians. And I got to a,

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:40:38       I got to play a with the band, told some stories, and I got to play with the band. And then afterwards I got to play with Collin a and we played, uh, who can it be now, which was, uh, just beyond a fucking thrill. And he was the nicest fucking guy, so generous to let me play. Um, and he had this really cool way that he wanted to bring me out. He goes, uh, he just went out there. He was telling stories, he was fucking hilarious. And then he just randomly goes, you know, and I had the weirdest dream last night. I was dreaming. I was, you know, playing a show. And, uh, I was playing, you know, who could it be now? And the crowd collapsed because it's such a huge hit. And he goes, the weirdest thing, you know, it built burrow was on drums, like, you know, and I just waited a second.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       Then I just walked out and sat down. Everybody started laughing and then he told this great story. I'm not going to repeat the story. Just I, it's his story. So I'm sure if he wants to tell it on a podcast, he can, but he tells his fucking hilarious story that ends with the word cunt. And he told me after I say cunt, basically you do the drum fill intro and then we'll go into the song and uh, let me play it anyway, you know, went off, went off pretty good man. And actually, uh, I don't know. It's fucking unreal, man. I played like 20 years by myself in a rehearsal space until it finally dawned on me that I'm supposed to be out interacting with other fucking people. So now that I've kind of opened Pandora's box, I just, I told you, I made this rule that I'm not gonna ask to sit in, but if somebody asked me to play, I'm gonna fucking play. All right. That includes if I can be a town and if I'm drinking in a bar, if I go out to a bar and your local band is played, if you come up to me and asked me to sit in with your band, I'm going to fucking do it. All right. I know. And this is a warning.

Speaker 2:          00:42:36       It's a warning. I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna fuck up. So, you know, if you want a story, I'll fucking do it. Cause it's fun as hell to me. And it's weird. I don't feel any pressure whatsoever because I'm a comedian. Well, what's the pressure? He's going to sit down and play drums. He's going to stick. Of course he is. Everybody already knows it, so it's fine. Um, plus everybody has looks at the singer anyways, but it's a, it's a lot of fun. And I've been, uh, getting psycho back into lessons and, um, I told you I've been taking, um, I've been taking some lessons. Um, you remember a long time ago when I watched that Mars Volta Video and uh, I was talking about their drummer, who's Dave [inaudible] at the time I was going, Holy Fuck, look at this guy's fucking unbelievable, blah, blah blah. Well, from doing that, he must've heard the clip.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       He reached out to me on Twitter and Lo and behold, he lives in La. And every once in a while I go by and I take a lesson with the guy and uh, he's a fucking unbelievable teacher and he's been teaching me techniques. So my, you know, I'm one of those guys, I grabbed the drumsticks the same way. Like a toddler would, would just my fit meaty fucking fist, just right over both of them and it was causing my arms to be doing all the work and my forum, if ain't drummers are listening to this, if you have like that fucking, you know, that pain in your forums and all that, you know, that's, I was kind of going through that shit and he is teaching me this technique where you let the stick do the work and it's holding it in this particular way that does not seem fucking natural at all.

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       And uh, it has been a motherfucker but you know, incrementally I've been, it's gradually working its way into my playing and uh, it's been, it's totally been worth it. And we've been going this jazz book and I'm like most students, like I work on something for three seconds and then want to go onto the next thing so I can have that sense of accomplishment and just get through a whole fucking page and a, and I was moving ahead and every time I'd go to the lesson, I would still not have the first thing down. And I've been taking lessons, you know, on and off since the summer. I mean, I get busy and I can't go for like a month or something, but, um, I'm still on that first page and it finally dawned on me in the past week to, to be like, dude, just work on this one fucking thing and fuck everything else. And I just sorta sat down 15 minutes a day just working on this thing. Um, you know, make it a little bit of an improvement and then being fuck having to start over and blah, blah, blah, blah and all that shit. And um, I actually had a great lesson this week where I think he actually was saying that I was just, I was finally starting to improve, which made my fucking weak. So anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       I don't know what the fuck I'm going with this. I'm rambling all over the place. What are we up to here? 45 minutes. Jesus Christ. Bill, can we fucking get on with this here? Um, oh, by the way, somebody told me to watch a show, top boy, TLP, boy on Netflix and a, I want a Netflix for the life of, I can, I can figure out how to search when I'm on the Internet. I can't fucking do it when I'm on the TV. I don't, how do you search when you're on the TV, if anybody knows, I would really appreciate it. But anyways, I'm going to be, um, I'm going to be, uh, playing out again this week. Uh, I'm doing that Bonzo bash thing. I'm hosting the Bonzo bash co-hosting and I don't even know who I'm hosting with. It's going to be an Anaheim this Friday night and I'm a Brian tissues wonderful event or all these drummers that I grew up watching sit down and play led Zeppelin songs, which is going to be the shit I'm going to get to host it and uh, with somebody else, it's going to be fucking awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       So, and I will be sitting in for one song, once again, risking total humiliation, which, you know, I'll probably make an ass of myself who gives a fuck. Right. Um, but anyways, uh, oh, I know what I wanted to talk about. Fuck. In the Arizona cardinals packers game, I started to talk about it and uh, you know, you would think last week after watching that dude on the Bengals, intercept the ball and then fucking walk into the locker room like, well, I guess that's that, right? You'd think that these, these damn kids today they'd learned something. Patrick Peterson, who I fucking love LSU Kid, right? Incomplete fourth down. That ought to fucking do it. Two and a half minutes left. This guy's walking down the sideline waving to the crowd, doing editing. Damn near blowing kisses to the crowd. Like it's over. What he's playing pack is in Aaron fucking Roger's fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       Two and a half minutes of football left and he's walking around doing that and what happened? Two minutes and 25 football seconds later he gets beat on a jump ball in the fucking end zone on a hail Mary to send it into overtime. Um, fucking unbelievable. How many times does somebody gonna fucking do that? How many times are you going to run down the field? You got the football, you're not past the goal line. You already start holding it out. And Don baby slaps it out of your hand. Are you fucking, you know, you have, you spike it over the, you know, over your back. You know that one we had throw it down over your shoulder and you, you get big toes across the end zone, but the ball is, and how many fucking times you're going to see people do that. I just don't understand why.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       I know. Get it. So anyways, let's plow ahead here. Uh, all right, here's some of the questions. Are the letters for this week. All right. Pasta Bill. If you want to get good at making pasta, of course I do begin with a Janero cantala those videos on food tube. All right. I don't know if I said, I'm probably just say right. It's g e n a R R o.

Uh, also pay attention to sorts of flour you're using cheers to you and your Mondays. Yeah. What's going on? Some people use flowers, some people use that semolina some people use a mixture of both. I tell you, I like doing it. I think it goes back to when I was a kid, I was one of those kids like playing in mud puddles, you know what I mean? So it was a, there's just something about that. I think that's why like, I like making like, like pie crust and shit like that. It's just a big gooey fucking mess. It's fun. Um, but I'll definitely, uh, I'll check that out if I can get online here. All right. Cooking Asian food.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       Okay.

Uh, dude, I'm definitely gonna go there. I'm definitely going to go there without a fucking doubt. I'm a, and we're waiting to hear about the second season for F is for family. The pitch went fucking great. Uh, when out of there we were all excited. I got a great feeling about it and I'm gonna let you guys know as soon as I find out. Um, okay. But I got a good feeling about it. So, uh, and I'm definitely gonna do a European tour. I did Australia and Asia last year, so this time it's time. We had the other way. I'm going to do a Europe this time and I want to hit all the countries I've been to.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       I'd like to add a few more. And I also want to do a little bit of eastern Europe, but, uh, if we do get a second season, I don't know how many episodes that would be, I'd think it'd be at least 10. And then, you know, we gotta sit down and write them and, uh, we want to make it as good as the first season, you know, and even better, which of course we do, it's going to take a lot of time. So I gotta kind of figure out, you know, uh, once they gave us the Yay or nay on that. But like I said, I got a really, really, really positive vibes, a lot of laughs in the room and um, which is always good. So anyways, he said the guy says, anyway, I've heard you talking about cooking more Asian food. Oh wait, this is a different one. Um, oh, it's the same guy. Sorry. And He, this is the same guy from Belgium because anyways, I've heard you talking about wanting to cook more Asian food on your podcast since I love cooking as well. Please allow me to recommend you. Some Korean cuisine has a lot of spicy food. Oh yeah. Kimchi and all that stuff. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:06       Yeah, I've, I've been to those Korean barbecue and all that stuff. I love all of that stuff, but it's just so different from the stuff here. I'm really intimidated about cooking it, uh, which is so stupid, you know, if I'm, I'm afraid of it, I should just just sit down and be like, okay, let's start with something easy. How do you make the sticky rice? You know, if you could just make sticky rice alone, that's the shit, right? That's the best fucking rice there is. I don't want to hear everybody tell me it's not fucking healthy. I don't give a fuck. You know, it's fucking delicious. Um, Korean cuisine has a lot of spicy food, which is great for losing weight since you tend to be full more quickly and drink more water, plus a lot of other health benefits. If you are interested, please check out.

Speaker 2:          00:53:59       Uh, I can't, it's m a n, G, C, h, I on Youtube. Oh, I've got to do this. Uh, I guess I go, I guess this is a lady, a, she's a Korean housewife who is funny as hell and learns, uh, teaches you, you said learns you how to cook. It's teaches, teaches you how to cook great traditional and overall easy recipes. Now you've got to teach me some Belgian words. I gave you one there. Huh? A recommendations are a Belgium words. Belgium. A Rep recommendations are spicy pork stir fry. Jane Sing Chicken. I didn't want to say it's j. A J a m e o n. G. Judge. Ami Young. That sounds like an annoying character in fucking star wars, which is black bean sauce noodles. Some other shit that I can't say Korean barbecue, which I bet you've had before. Yeah, I have. What is that? The hacky American thing? Well, I've had Korean food. I went to Korea Barbecue. I literally just said that Japanese cuisine is mostly salty, sweet and Umami. What does Umami mean? Is that Oh, Mommy Burger. Better that flavors. Lots of vegetables. No butter. Soy Sauce, which is amazing for you and rich and enrich taste. Yeah. I got to tell you mad people, when I went over to Asia, man, they will fucking in shape. People are just in shape over there,

Speaker 3:          00:55:24       you know?

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       I bet if you fat in Asia, they've just been looking at rich motherfucker. He must be traveling. He's got enough money to get to an apple piece. I'm fucking, I uh, I'm too tired. I didn't want to say Applebee's. Applebee's is not a fattening places. It, what's a good fat cheese? They'll just wrap up the podcast. Okay. If I'm going to be this off right now, what the fuck's going to happen when I go to do my shows tonight? All right. Now, Chinese food, I don't know a lot about, uh, cool to know is that Chinese food in the states and Europe is not actual Chinese food. No, it isn't. That's their surreptitious way of trying to fucking kill us. That's what they're trying to do. They know we have the bomb, right? They think that China is attacking us on two levels right now, giving us food that's going to give us a heart attack and they're going to fuck with our economy somehow. Somehow. We're tied in with them and they're going to pull the fucking rug up anyways. He said modified for our taste buds, but I'm guessing they have amazing stuff too. Yeah, I would think so. I would think so.

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       no. Fuck. Am I getting the hiccups here? Uh, Thai in Vietnamese food is mostly spring rolls. Jesus Christ, you go, oh, we'll do the whole continent here.

Speaker 3:          00:56:39       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:56:40       let me get some water. Oh, fuck. Completely. Mr. Glass. Okay. Fucking bad angle here. Um, lastly, okay. Know Thai, Vietnamese, mostly spring rolls. Spicy Curry. I love our guy from fucking Belgium is telling me about Asian food or you at least Asian, lots of coriander, which I personally detest because it tasted of dishwasher product, dishwasher, product. Lastly, if you really want to go hardcore, try out North Korean food, it's basically starving yourself. You'll be able to see your ginger pube ding down without a mirror again and no time. Pretty Edgy, Huh? Yes. You're making fun of the fact that they're under a dictator that doesn't feed a very edgy, very edgy. Uh, hope this helped go fuck yourself. Lots of love for Nia. You know, Cleo, um, oh shit. I guess I'll give that, you know, I love how Asia stops with people that we can, you know, it doesn't go into India.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       That's also Asia, right? Isn't the Middle East, isn't that also Asia? Russia, you know. Anyway, so like that can fucking Forrest Gump. Alright. Hey Billy Beane, uh, Ben, a fan of the podcast for a while now. Yada Yada. I need some advice or just a fresh perspective on what to do. I'm 23. Uh, yeah, the primary life dropped out of high school. Like a dip shit at 17. Got My GED when I was 19. I, you're back in the game. You're back in the game and it decided to start becoming a productive member of society. Everything was going good. Paycheck meant a, the dating pool opened up, tried a few jobs, et cetera. But now I'm 23. I quit my job to go to, to go to school for advertising. Slash art at an artsy college. Should probably mention the only thing I'm truly good at is art. Mainly pen and ink stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       Well, dude, that's a great thing and he can make a ton of fucking money doing that. It's just that schools generally speaking are not geared towards that. Um, so yeah, you will fucking bored and then you took shit that you weren't good at, made you feel like an asshole. You fucking dropout your party for a few years. Right. Bagged a couple of who is and now you're coming back, dude. You fine. You're 23, dude, you're fine. Uh, that was eight months ago. I missed the sign. I missed the sign up date. It just lacked the general knowledge slash support on going about it. I spent six months grinding the living shit out of drawing, trying to achieve something I might be able to take some pride in. Didn't work. I was just going to say, you're being too hard on yourself. Your next line is, I'm hard on myself to the point where I'm thinking I'll never be handed a metal is the greatest that ever fucking lives. So why bother?

Speaker 1:          00:59:29       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       Ah, Jesus Dude. Well listen, Richard Pryor's the greatest of all time and I'll never come close to that guy. That does not going to stop me. You just try to see how close you can come. Some people you can't pass and that's all right. You know, you just try to come as close to him. Try to just like try to go as high up the all time ladder as you possibly can and who knows? If you keep pushing yourself,

Speaker 1:          00:59:57       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       listen, you

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       okay?

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       You don't know what your limits are until you keep fucking throwing yourself out there. Especially if you're hard on yourself. You probably be in way. You're way better than you think you are. You're going to be fine. All right, you're depressing me here anyways. I've since quit drawing and now do nothing but troll around dating sites all day and hooking up with semi-decent looking women, women as a way to stay positive and cure boredom. I'm not lazy. I've done primarily a manual labor jobs and no, I have the back for it, but Jesus Christ, I can't force myself to pull the trigger on anything because I can't be the top of the crop or the very God damn best. I want people fulfilled. I've been standing at a crossroad, my Dick and my head for nearly a year and he sort of vice be fucking amazing. Don't hold back. If you think I need to be ripped a new one, I can handle it. Thanks. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah Dude, you've got yourself into a completely paralyzed state here because it's like you gotta you just bought a guitar and because you're not Jimi Hendrix, within the first two weeks you're going to fucking quit. All right. If Jimmy Hendricks did that, he wouldn't be Jimmy Hendrix. All right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       All right. Either look just if you, whatever you like to do in life, just go out and do it all right. And enjoy it. And don't put that level of pressure on yourself. Like what was your dad like? The Great Santini is something, I'm trying to figure out why you like this, but like, um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       the reason why he can't pull the trigger on anything else in life is because you actually have a strong cause. I think you have a strong sense on what makes you happy and what you want to do. Alright. And you know that despite the fact that you're being totally negative about your drawing, you know that that's what you want to do and you have such a passion for it, that you're that hard on yourself. And then also it's preventing you from getting a job at the fucking Costco or wherever the goddamn place you're going to end up fucking working at. Um, I would, I don't know if I was you, I would continue drawing. I get into computers and all that. There's all kinds of stuff I've seen people do drugs on computers and they turned that into building websites, which helps to pay for their, their studio and the shit that they really want to do this, there's tons of money to make in the arts. Don't, don't let anybody ever fucking tell you that there isn't just you just helping people make it in show business.

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:24       Alright. This p people who get head shots give acting classes and all that, just doing that shit. People make a small fucking fortune. So if you're actually a talented artists, you can actually, you're going to be fine. Um, you just have to stop beating the shit out of yourself. All right? So, uh, just pay attention to that voice in your head and when it tells you you can't do something, just tell it to shut the fuck up basically. Even if you have to say it out loud, you know, just make sure you're not looking at somebody you care about as they're telling you a story. When you think of those thoughts, just, you know, maybe, maybe say it in your brain first. All right? Okay. Advice. No one to relate to cheeses. He's a fucking gloomy this week. All right. Advice. No one to relate to causing loading loneliness.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       All right. Hey, Billy, bets. Love the podcasts. You stand up after a family. They all put a smile on my face. Well, that's great. Okay. Um, I'm sensing that all of a sudden now the smile is going to go away. I hope you read this because he had it. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. My problem is I have no one to relate to and I fear I might as well read this here. I hope you read this because I've been doing everything positive, but I just can't seem to get my life where I want it to be. It's a bit of a long road, so please bear with me. Oh fuck this. It's a long email. Did you know I can't read out loud.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       All right. My problem is I have no one to relate to and I fear I might be caught. This might be causing me to be lonely in life. I fear that if I continue the way I'm going, I may never get over it. I'm in my last semester of college in an engineering program and I've made almost no friends throughout my entire stay at college. I am at the top of my classes and I'm lining up jobs at big tech companies. Now you're probably managing some point Dexter with the pocket or pocket protector and all that. Actually I was, that's exactly, that was the picture you were painting, sir. Uh, quite the opposite actually. I've been working out for a few years now and I have one and I am one of the jacked people in my classes. All right, so now I'm picture is that dude in American psycho, highly achieving, totally shredded, cannot relate to human beings. Um, I dress well, eat healthy. Please tell me you don't listen to Huey. Uh, Huey Lewis and the news. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       and always make sure to keep myself clean. I feel like I might alienate my classmates from interacting with me. They probably think I'm just a jock in their class where it's quite the opposite. I'm into gaming, chess and all of that. Dude, you're like a fucking a renaissance man here. So I figure I might try to interact with the opposite crowd, the Non Geeky people. I know a way to meet people is to get out there and do something. I, I like doing, playing some sport or joining a club or volunteering. The problem is with my program and my work, I have little time to be doing much else. The free time I have is Friday or Saturday nights that I spend by myself playing video games or playing guitar because I have nothing else to do. While you could go out those nights, all right. It wasn't always this way.

Speaker 2:          01:05:29       This is like a movie. When I was in high school, my life was completely the opposite. I didn't work out, eat healthy, work hard or nothing. But I always find ways to make new friends, make people laugh and start conversations. Now that I'm doing everything right, it seems my only problem is social out. Jesus Christ. Dude. So you know what you're doing. You just too busy. I figured once I Graduate College, things will only get worse. I lost all of my faith, my family, apart from my older brother who was in another country. So once I graduate college, I'll truly be alone. No one to grab a beer with no one to help me move or anything to help me move or anything. Despite all this, I try to be positive and thankful what I have and what I have accomplished. Sorry for the long email and go fuck yourself. Yeah, Dude. You just look. You already know how to make friends. I would. You need to make time to do it. I'm playing video games by yourself is very antisocial. Uh, playing guitars. Always. Cool. That's fun. Why don't you play guitar with somebody else? Find somebody who plays drums and play bass. Get together, do some covers.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:25       You know, jam, fuck around, you know, drink some beers, invite some ladies over. And he did every week he just adds some more shit. Right. You know, start taking bets, open your own fucking a draft kinks, you know, maybe start selling coke. Just keep expanding your ring of a social interaction. I'm obviously fucking with you, but no, I would, uh, there's a bunch of people that are into video games. Why don't you find somebody that you can play against? Can you do that anymore to kids do that? Or do you have to go online to do it? You know, is that like Courtney now does two people not sit next to each other with an Atari with the joystick and the one red button is, are we past that? I don't fucking know, but it seems like you know how to do that stuff. He just got busy and uh, with all your achievements, you, you know, sometimes, you know, when you go after a goal, some things suffer.

Speaker 2:          01:07:21       Alright. I've talked about this numerous times when I was on, um, you know, when I was 36 years old, I was, I was fucking living alone in a studio apartment that they call the one bedroom, sleeping on a futon. I remember days just going by going, what the fuck have I done? The only thing I've worked on is trying to become a comedian. Everything else is at the starting line. And uh, over the next 10 years I just worked on some shit like that. So that's all you need to do. All right. Jesus Christ. I'm starting to feel like doctor Phil here. Um, all right, what do we got here? Third and goal? Broncos have the ball with three minutes left and I'm doing a fucking podcast. Touchdown Broncos. All right. All right. Broncos ne go celebrate and act like a bunch of fucking idiots when Ben Roethlisberger has three minutes left. This one is not over. All right, so what does this do? This puts them up by five. Hey people in the crowd holding up two fingers, like the crowd is going to look at them. Oh yeah. Yeah. We should go for too. Should we, we shouldn't just be up by six. Thank you. Thank you. You in the fucking a mezzanine level. Ah, fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       But we're going to have to go to Denver. Is this going to be one more? One more Bray that, either way. This is going to be great. Either this, you get to see Brady versus a Peyton manning. One more time. I'm assuming he's retiring, which is stupid. Or you get to see another patriots, a Steelers match up with fucking Big Ben. Big Bad. Not Afraid of anything. Big Bed. Both great teams. All right. That's the podcast for this week. I apologize that my head was kind of all over the place. I don't know what flying and going to the fucking airport does to me.

Speaker 3:          01:09:09       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       but uh, it makes me even more fucking scatterbrain. So anyways, go fuck yourselves and I will talk to you on Thursday. Okay. All right.
