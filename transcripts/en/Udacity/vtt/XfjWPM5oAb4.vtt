00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.447
A root of a polynomial is the x coordinate of one of its x-intercepts. We've

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:09.133
been looking at equations for parabolas that can be written in the form y equals

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.743
ax squared plus bx plus c. And then we want to find the x intercepts, we replace

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:17.973
y with 0. And come up with a quadratic equation. Any numbers that satisfy this

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:21.914
equation, are roots. Well we've been solving for x using factoring, or the

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:26.284
quadratic formula, or finding the roots of these quadratics. It's convenient to

00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:30.444
have the word root, because I've been asking you for x intercept over, and over

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:34.772
again. But for every x intercept, the y value is 0. So just keep in mind that a

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:39.276
Y value that goes along with the root to create the coordinates of a point is 0.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:40.957
Just like we plugged in here.
