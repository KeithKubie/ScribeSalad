00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.737
Male: In the last video,
we began our exploration

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:04.736
of what a consumption function is.

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:06.331
It's a fairly straightforward idea.

00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.234
It's a function that describes how

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:12.138
aggregate income can drive
aggregate consumption.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.479
We started with a fairly
simple model of this,

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.233
a fairly simple consumption function.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:17.536
It was a linear one.

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:19.313
You had some base level of consumption,

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:21.007
regardless of aggregate income,

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:22.977
and then you had some level of consumption

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:25.143
that was essentially induced by having

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:27.276
some disposable income.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.149
When we plotted this linear
model, we got a line.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.005
We got a line right over here.

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:33.400
I pointed out in the last video

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.312
this does not have to be the only way

00:00:35.312 --> 00:00:37.413
that a consumption
function can be described.

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:39.867
You might use some fancier
mathematical tools.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.137
Maybe you can construct
a consumption function.

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:43.360
You have an argument.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.002
You would argue that
the marginal propensity

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.532
to consume is higher at lower levels

00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:50.401
of disposable income and
that it kind of tapers out

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.199
as disposable income, as aggregate

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.004
disposable income goes up.

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:55.822
You might think that maybe you should have

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.741
a fancier consumption function

00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.902
that when you graph it
would look like this

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:01.407
and then you would have to use things

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:03.872
fancier than just what
we used right over here.

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:05.400
What I want to do in this video

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.153
is focus more on a linear model.

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.074
The reason why I'm going to focus on

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.817
a linear model is because,
one, it's simpler.

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:14.486
It'll be easier to manipulate.

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.933
It's also the model that tends to be used

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.736
right when people are starting to digest

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:20.668
things like consumption functions

00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:24.133
and building on them to learn about things

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.600
like, and we'll do this in a few videos,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.129
the Keynesian Cross.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.160
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to do two things.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.069
I'm going to generalize this linear

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.935
consumption function,
and I'm going to make it

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:35.334
a function not just of disposal income,

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:38.067
not just of aggregate disposable income,

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:39.493
which is what we did in the last video,

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:43.131
but as a function of
income, of aggregate income.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.566
Then we will plot that generalized one

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.820
based on the variables.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.075
It's really going to be the same thing.

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.402
We're just not going to use these numbers.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.071
We're going to use
variables in their place.

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.408
Let's give ourselves a
linear consumption function.

00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:58.707
We can say that aggregate consumption

00:01:58.707 --> 00:02:00.266
where we're going to have some base level

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.390
of consumption no matter
what, even if people

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.810
have no aggregate income,
they need to survive.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.063
They need food on the table.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:08.476
Maybe they'll have to dig
in savings somehow to do it.

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:10.663
So, some base level of consumption.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.892
I'll call that lower case c sub zero.

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:17.394
Or lowercase c with a subscript
of zero right over there.

00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:20.328
That's the base level
of aggregate consumption

00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:23.991
or it's sometimes referred
to as autonomous consumption.

00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:30.922
This is autonomous
consumption because people

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:32.662
will do it on their own, or in aggregate

00:02:32.662 --> 00:02:34.265
they will do it on their
own, even if they have

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.451
no aggregate income.

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:39.591
Then we will have the part that is due,

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:42.396
directly due, to having
some aggregate income.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:44.884
We call that the induced consumption,

00:02:44.884 --> 00:02:46.379
because you can view it as being induced

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.258
by having some aggregate income.

00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:51.194
Above and beyond what the
base level of consumption,

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:54.382
people are going to consume some fraction

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.219
of their disposable income.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:04.217
So we'll say disposable income.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.733
They're not going to consume all

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:06.639
of their disposable income.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.736
They might save some of it.

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.468
So they're going to consume the fraction

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:12.664
that's essentially their
marginal propensity to consume.

00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:17.051
This right over here, I'll
do that in this orange color.

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.367
Marginal propensity to consume.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:23.753
Hopefully this makes intuitive sense.

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:25.317
This says, look, if this was 100,

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:27.646
people are going to
consume 100 no matter what,

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:30.389
100 billion whatever
your unit of currency is.

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.725
Now, if their marginal propensity

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.651
to consume is, let's say, it is 1/3.

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.313
You have now above and beyond this

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:40.581
people have disposable
income of let's say 900,

00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:43.644
this is saying that
they want to consume 1/3

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:46.481
of that disposable income they're getting.

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.186
That is, if you give them 900 of extra

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.050
disposable income, they're propensity

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.730
to consume that incremental income,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.146
they're going to consume 1/3 of it.

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.318
So this would be 1/3, so it would be 900.

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:57.782
Let me give an example.

00:03:57.782 --> 00:04:00.587
If you had a situation,
you could have a situation,

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:05.447
where c-nought is equal to 100.

00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:15.156
If you have disposable
income is equal to 900,

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.315
and c1 is equal to 1/3, or we could say

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:21.886
0.333 repeating forever, c1 is 1/3.

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.584
Then this makes sense.

00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:25.721
On their own people
would consume this much,

00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.319
but now they have this disposable income.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.227
Their marginal propensity to consume

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.914
if you give them 900 extra of income,

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:33.178
they're going to consume 1/3 of that.

00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:35.473
So then you're going to
have, your consumption

00:04:35.473 --> 00:04:38.185
is going to be equal to, for
this case right over here,

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:47.794
your consumption is going to
be 100 plus 1/3 times 900.

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:49.766
So your consumption in this situation,

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.542
your induced consumption, 1/3 times 900,

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:56.931
would be 300, maybe it's
in billions of dollars,

00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:58.458
300 billion dollars.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.669
Then your autonomous
consumption would be 100.

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.927
They would add up to 400.

00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:07.869
Once again, this is autonomous
and this is induced.

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:16.091
Autonomous, this right over
here is induced consumption.

00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:17.915
Now, I did write it in general terms.

00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:21.208
I'm using variables here
instead of, or constants, really

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:25.621
instead of using the numbers
we saw in the last example.

00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:27.578
But I also said that I would express

00:05:27.578 --> 00:05:30.950
aggregate consumption
as a function not just

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.714
of disposable income
but of aggregate income;

00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:35.702
not just of aggregate disposable income

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.214
but aggregate income.

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:39.383
The relationship is fairly simple between

00:05:39.383 --> 00:05:42.131
disposable income and overall income.

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:46.194
We saw over here, in
aggregate, you have income,

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:47.979
but the government in
most modern economies

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.382
takes some fraction of that out for taxes.

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:53.195
What's left over is disposable income.

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:57.004
Just a reminder, income in aggregate,

00:05:57.004 --> 00:05:58.540
aggregate income is the same thing as

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.625
aggregate expenditures,

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.052
which is the same thing
as aggregate output.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:04.382
This right over here is GDP.

00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:06.541
So this right over here is, let me do this

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.867
in a color, I've used
almost all my colors.

00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:11.248
This is equal to GDP.

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:14.649
Disposable income is essentially GDP,

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:20.890
or you could say aggregate
income, minus taxes.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.947
I'm going to do the taxes
in a different color.

00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:26.594
Minus taxes.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:27.987
So we can express disposable income

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:32.120
as aggregate income, this right over here

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.873
is the same thing as
aggregate income minus taxes.

00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:38.992
We could rewrite our
whole thing over again.

00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:43.801
Aggregate consumption is equal
to autonomous consumption

00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:46.323
plus the marginal propensity to consume

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:51.739
times aggregate income,
which is the same thing

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:58.507
as GDP, times aggregate
income minus taxes.

00:06:58.507 --> 00:07:01.179
We fully generalized
our consumption function

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:04.328
and now we've written it as a
function of aggregate income,

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:06.999
not just aggregate disposable income.

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.268
To make you comfortable
that this is still a line

00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:11.945
if we were to plot it as a function

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:14.213
of aggregate income instead
of disposable income,

00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:16.419
let me manipulate this thing a little bit.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.342
We could distribute c1, which is our

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:21.595
marginal propensity to consume, and we get

00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:27.198
aggregate consumption is equal
to autonomous consumption

00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:28.681
and then we're going to distribute this,

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.196
plus c, so we're going to multiply it

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:32.431
times both of these terms,

00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:34.599
plus our marginal propensity to consume

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.640
times aggregate income,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.883
and then minus our marginal
propensity to consume

00:07:41.883 --> 00:07:46.799
times our taxes.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:50.142
Since we want it as a
function of aggregate income,

00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:52.059
everything else here is really a constant.

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.059
We're assuming that those
aren't going to change.

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.421
Those are constant variables.

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.392
What we could do is we could rewrite this

00:07:57.392 --> 00:07:59.330
in a form that you're
probably familiar with.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.266
Back in algebra class
you probably remember

00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:07.403
you can write it in the form y=mx+b where

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.594
x is the independent variable,

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:11.191
y is the dependent variable.

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:12.256
If you were to plot this,

00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:17.899
on the horizontal axis is your x axis,

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:20.350
your vertical axis is your y axis.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.272
This right over here
would have a y intercept,

00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:26.664
or your vertical axis intercept
of b, right over there.

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:29.009
Then it would be a line with slope m.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.730
If you were to take your
rise divided by your run,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.409
or how much you move up
when you move to the right

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.330
a certain amount, that gives you your m.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.138
Slope is equal to m.

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:41.662
The same analogy is here.

00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:43.880
We can rewrite this in that form,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.828
where our dependent
variable is no longer y.

00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:48.956
Our dependent variable
is aggregate consumption.

00:08:48.956 --> 00:08:53.161
Our independent variable is
not x, it is aggregate income.

00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:54.602
So let's write it in that form.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:57.868
We can write it as dependent variable, c,

00:08:57.868 --> 00:08:59.471
which we'll plot on the vertical axis,

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:03.367
is equal to the marginal
propensity to consume

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:07.354
times aggregate income,

00:09:07.354 --> 00:09:08.832
I'll do that purple color,

00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:09.933
times aggregate income,

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:15.031
plus autonomous consumption,

00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:22.280
minus marginal propensity
to consume times taxes.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.838
It looks all complicated, but you just

00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:27.082
have to realize that this
part right over here,

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:29.612
this is all a constant.

00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:34.937
It is analogous to the
b if you were to write

00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:37.457
things in kind of
traditional slope intercept

00:09:37.457 --> 00:09:38.934
form right over here.

00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:40.790
When we plot the line, if you have no

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.437
aggregate income, this is what your

00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:45.870
consumption is going to be.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.037
Let me draw that.

00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:54.847
Once again, our dependent
variable is aggregate consumption.

00:09:54.847 --> 00:09:57.190
Our independent variable
in this is no longer

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.255
disposable income like
we did in the last video.

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:04.933
It is now aggregate income.

00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:06.734
If there's no aggregate income,

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:08.455
this is the independent
variable right over here,

00:10:08.455 --> 00:10:09.750
if there's no aggregate income,

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.188
then your consumption is just going to be

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:12.926
this value right over here.

00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:14.394
So your consumption is just going to be

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:17.147
that value right over
there, which is c-nought

00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:20.579
minus c1 times t.

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:25.719
Then as you have larger values of

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:28.678
aggregate income, c1, that fraction of it,

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:32.130
is what's going to contribute
to the induced consumption.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.517
What you essentially
have is this is the slope

00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:36.667
of our line, this right
over here is our slope.

00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:38.503
Just to kind of draw the analogy,

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:42.085
if you were to say y
is equal to mx plus b.

00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:43.872
Actually, maybe I'll write it like this.

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:49.658
If you were to write c is equal to m ...

00:10:49.658 --> 00:10:51.888
and I don't want to
confuse you if this m and b

00:10:51.888 --> 00:10:53.183
seem completely foreign.

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:55.625
It comes from kind of
a traditional algebra

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.109
grounding in slope and y intercept.

00:10:58.109 --> 00:11:04.919
If I were to say c is equal to my plus b,

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:05.975
this is the slope.

00:11:05.975 --> 00:11:10.300
This is our vertical or our
dependent variable intercept

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.607
right over here.

00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:13.568
That's where we intercept the dependent

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:14.805
variable axis.

00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:16.084
And this is our slope.

00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:18.195
It's our marginal propensity to consume.

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:21.473
Our line will look something like this,

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:25.436
where the slope is equal to the marginal

00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:28.672
propensity to consume,
which is equal to c1.

00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:30.233
If people all of a sudden are more likely

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:32.733
to spend a larger
fraction of their income,

00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:36.777
then the marginal propensity to consume

00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:38.941
would be higher and our
slope would be higher.

00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:40.363
We would have a line that looks like that.

00:11:40.363 --> 00:11:41.934
We always assume that the marginal

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.319
propensity to consume will be less than 1.

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.942
So we'll never have a slope of 1.

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.637
We'll also never have a negative slope

00:11:47.637 --> 00:11:49.410
because we assume that this is positive.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.780
If people are more likely
to save than consume

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.612
when they have extra
income, then this line

00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:56.101
might look something like that.

00:11:56.101 --> 00:11:57.840
It might have a lower slope.
