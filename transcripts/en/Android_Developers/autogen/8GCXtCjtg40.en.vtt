that some of our thunder might have been

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
that some of our thunder might have been
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.689
that some of our thunder might have been
stolen by the three or four

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699
stolen by the three or four
 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.160

the navigation editor luckily we have

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
the navigation editor luckily we have
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080
the navigation editor luckily we have
time to go into a little bit more detail

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
time to go into a little bit more detail
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.990
time to go into a little bit more detail
than any of the previous presentations

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
than any of the previous presentations
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.490
than any of the previous presentations
so there's a lot of good material here

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
so there's a lot of good material here
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.910

you think about it is a problem that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
you think about it is a problem that
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670
you think about it is a problem that
pretty much every app on Android has to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
pretty much every app on Android has to
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.880
pretty much every app on Android has to
solve but until now we haven't really

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
solve but until now we haven't really
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709
solve but until now we haven't really
given you anything to do that with other

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
given you anything to do that with other
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840
given you anything to do that with other
than start activity which for various

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
than start activity which for various
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420
than start activity which for various
reasons is not the best way to go about

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
reasons is not the best way to go about
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.220
reasons is not the best way to go about
that so if you think about yeah our job

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
that so if you think about yeah our job
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.680
that so if you think about yeah our job

navigation was a common problem with no
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.109
navigation was a common problem with no
real solution and that means that there

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
real solution and that means that there
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.070
real solution and that means that there
are a lot of things that you have to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
are a lot of things that you have to
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.719
are a lot of things that you have to
solve on your own and those range from

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729
solve on your own and those range from
 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.160

and so what this means is by the time

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
and so what this means is by the time
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.340
and so what this means is by the time
you've finished solving these problems

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
you've finished solving these problems
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380
you've finished solving these problems
you typically gone one of two directions

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
you typically gone one of two directions
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.080
you typically gone one of two directions
you've either written 60% of a

or you've got a lot of error-prone

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
or you've got a lot of error-prone
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.229
or you've got a lot of error-prone
boilerplate everywhere navigation needs

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239
boilerplate everywhere navigation needs
 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.179
boilerplate everywhere navigation needs
to happen in your app so you've got a

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189
to happen in your app so you've got a
 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.309
to happen in your app so you've got a
bunch of parallel lines of code solving

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
bunch of parallel lines of code solving
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.929
bunch of parallel lines of code solving
these various problems and the whole

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939
these various problems and the whole
 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.129
these various problems and the whole
structure is fairly brittle and that's

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139
structure is fairly brittle and that's
 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.330
structure is fairly brittle and that's
why we're oh sorry and individually

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
why we're oh sorry and individually
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.539
why we're oh sorry and individually
these problems are pretty tractable but

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549
these problems are pretty tractable but
 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.220
these problems are pretty tractable but
if you look at kind of a real-world

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
if you look at kind of a real-world
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.709
if you look at kind of a real-world
example you can see that they can get

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719
example you can see that they can get
 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.780
example you can see that they can get
pretty hairy so say that I have an item

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
pretty hairy so say that I have an item
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.899
pretty hairy so say that I have an item
screen in my app and it's accessible via

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909
screen in my app and it's accessible via
 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.819
screen in my app and it's accessible via
deep link so far so good but if someone

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829
deep link so far so good but if someone
 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.300
deep link so far so good but if someone
had navigated to this screen via opening

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
had navigated to this screen via opening
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640
had navigated to this screen via opening
the app from the home screen they would

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
the app from the home screen they would
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.649
the app from the home screen they would
have a couple other screens on the back

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659
have a couple other screens on the back
 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.039
have a couple other screens on the back
stack and so hitting it up we want them

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
stack and so hitting it up we want them
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.770
stack and so hitting it up we want them
to take that not out of the app from the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
to take that not out of the app from the
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.170
to take that not out of the app from the
item screen we want them to go to the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
item screen we want them to go to the
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.970
item screen we want them to go to the
category screen and then the home screen

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
category screen and then the home screen
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.369
category screen and then the home screen
and that means that if someone deep

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379
and that means that if someone deep
 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.959
and that means that if someone deep
links into the app we need to synthesize

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969
links into the app we need to synthesize
 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.569
links into the app we need to synthesize
these screens and add them to the up

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579
these screens and add them to the up
 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.219
these screens and add them to the up
stack before showing the item screen and

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:18.229
stack before showing the item screen and
 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.659
stack before showing the item screen and
talking to a third-party developer he

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669
talking to a third-party developer he
 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.369
talking to a third-party developer he
told me it's when you're in the middle

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379
told me it's when you're in the middle
 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.830
told me it's when you're in the middle
of writing the code to do this to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
of writing the code to do this to
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.659
of writing the code to do this to
synthesize these screens and add them to

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669
synthesize these screens and add them to
 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.140
synthesize these screens and add them to
the up and back stack but only on a deep

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
the up and back stack but only on a deep
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.050
the up and back stack but only on a deep
link that's when you start to feel like

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
link that's when you start to feel like
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.909
link that's when you start to feel like
maybe you're solving a failure of the

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919
maybe you're solving a failure of the
 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.949
maybe you're solving a failure of the
framework so it's just help solve

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959
framework so it's just help solve
 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.270
framework so it's just help solve
problems like that that we're launching

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
problems like that that we're launching
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.059
problems like that that we're launching
navigation and what we're giving you is

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
navigation and what we're giving you is
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.929
navigation and what we're giving you is
a visual tool that lets you edit the

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939
a visual tool that lets you edit the
 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.670
a visual tool that lets you edit the
navigation graph of your app which is

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
navigation graph of your app which is
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.110
navigation graph of your app which is
represented in XML and that lets you

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
represented in XML and that lets you
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.429
represented in XML and that lets you
define a set of available navigation

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439
define a set of available navigation
 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.740
define a set of available navigation
actions arguments you can pass from

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
actions arguments you can pass from
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.509
actions arguments you can pass from
place to place things like visual

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
place to place things like visual
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.509
place to place things like visual
transitions and then a single navigate

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519
transitions and then a single navigate
 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.849
transitions and then a single navigate
call activates all that at runtime and

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859
call activates all that at runtime and
 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.740
call activates all that at runtime and
so last but not least that means one

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
so last but not least that means one
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.699
so last but not least that means one
thing you never have to worry about

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
thing you never have to worry about
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.039
thing you never have to worry about
again is touching a fragment transaction

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049
again is touching a fragment transaction
 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.060
again is touching a fragment transaction
with your bare hands

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
 
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.120
 
[Applause]

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130
[Applause]
 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.320
[Applause]
so what the navigation graph is

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330
so what the navigation graph is
 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.540
so what the navigation graph is
essentially just a set of what are the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
essentially just a set of what are the
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.879
essentially just a set of what are the
possible destinations people can reach

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889
possible destinations people can reach
 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.730
possible destinations people can reach
in my app and those usually correspond

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740
in my app and those usually correspond
 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.939
in my app and those usually correspond
to screens but not always so you can

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949
to screens but not always so you can
 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.080
to screens but not always so you can
have the navigation control or just

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090
have the navigation control or just
 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.450
have the navigation control or just
changing the contents of a smaller part

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460
changing the contents of a smaller part
 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.909
changing the contents of a smaller part
of the screen but it's a set of

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919
of the screen but it's a set of
 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.010
of the screen but it's a set of
navigation destinations and the actions

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020
navigation destinations and the actions
 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.050
navigation destinations and the actions
that link them and the actions really

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060
that link them and the actions really
 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.060
that link them and the actions really
represent how you can get from place to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070
represent how you can get from place to
 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.420
represent how you can get from place to
place so to actually navigate from point

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430
place so to actually navigate from point
 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.629
place so to actually navigate from point
A to point B in an app you're just gonna

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639
A to point B in an app you're just gonna
 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.969
A to point B in an app you're just gonna
call the correct navigation action at

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979
call the correct navigation action at
 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.540
call the correct navigation action at
runtime so let's take a look at what

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550
runtime so let's take a look at what
 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.060
runtime so let's take a look at what
this looks like and let's switch over to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070
this looks like and let's switch over to
 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.180
this looks like and let's switch over to
the demo okay so what we see here is a

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190
the demo okay so what we see here is a
 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.120
the demo okay so what we see here is a
set of navigation destinations and these

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130
set of navigation destinations and these
 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.750
set of navigation destinations and these
are fragment destinations although other

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760
are fragment destinations although other
 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.670
are fragment destinations although other
options are possible and the lines

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680
options are possible and the lines
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.219
options are possible and the lines
connecting them with the arrowheads are

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229
connecting them with the arrowheads are
 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.029
connecting them with the arrowheads are
our actions and those actions actually

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039
our actions and those actions actually
 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.920
our actions and those actions actually
generate methods that you can call at

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930
generate methods that you can call at
 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.379
generate methods that you can call at
runtime

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389
runtime
 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.839
runtime
this whole thing is backed by XML as you

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849
this whole thing is backed by XML as you
 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.810
this whole thing is backed by XML as you
all know and love and the XML and the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820
all know and love and the XML and the
 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.520
all know and love and the XML and the
navigation editor have the same set of

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530
navigation editor have the same set of
 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.659
navigation editor have the same set of
capabilities so you can use either one

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669
capabilities so you can use either one
 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.750
capabilities so you can use either one
we're gonna add a screen here and what

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760
we're gonna add a screen here and what
 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.129
we're gonna add a screen here and what
you're seeing is a set of available

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139
you're seeing is a set of available
 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.800
you're seeing is a set of available
activities and fragments in my app ok so

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810
activities and fragments in my app ok so
 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.089
activities and fragments in my app ok so
we just added an option for them to

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099
we just added an option for them to
 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.710
we just added an option for them to
actually answer this question

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720
actually answer this question
 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.230
actually answer this question
successfully and win the game so now

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240
successfully and win the game so now
 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.260
successfully and win the game so now
we're gonna add an action to navigate to

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270
we're gonna add an action to navigate to
 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.790
we're gonna add an action to navigate to
that screen

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800
 
 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.360
 
great and so that navigation action has

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
great and so that navigation action has
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.219
great and so that navigation action has
a bunch of options that you can set

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229
a bunch of options that you can set
 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.110
a bunch of options that you can set
obviously we're going to talk about

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120
obviously we're going to talk about
 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.390
obviously we're going to talk about
those a little bit more for now we're

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400
those a little bit more for now we're
 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.520
those a little bit more for now we're
gonna do one thing so we're gonna say if

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530
gonna do one thing so we're gonna say if
 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.309
gonna do one thing so we're gonna say if
they've gotten to this congratulations

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319
they've gotten to this congratulations
 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.100
they've gotten to this congratulations
screen that means the game is over so

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110
screen that means the game is over so
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.960
screen that means the game is over so
hitting back shouldn't take them back

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970
hitting back shouldn't take them back
 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.600
hitting back shouldn't take them back
into a game that no longer exists so

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
into a game that no longer exists so
 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.469
into a game that no longer exists so
what that means is we want to on that

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479
what that means is we want to on that
 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.420
what that means is we want to on that
action say let's pop to the match screen

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430
action say let's pop to the match screen
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.149
action say let's pop to the match screen
and that means I'm going to pop off

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159
and that means I'm going to pop off
 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.309
and that means I'm going to pop off
everything on the back stack in between

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319
everything on the back stack in between
 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.610
everything on the back stack in between
this destination and the match screen so

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
this destination and the match screen so
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.260
this destination and the match screen so
when the user gets to the

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270
when the user gets to the
 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.600
when the user gets to the
congratulations screen when they hit

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610
congratulations screen when they hit
 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.339
congratulations screen when they hit
back they're just going to go straight

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349
back they're just going to go straight
 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.089
back they're just going to go straight
to the match screen so a lot of other

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:01.099
to the match screen so a lot of other
 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:03.399
to the match screen so a lot of other
options I can set but let's talk about

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:03.409
options I can set but let's talk about
 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.790
options I can set but let's talk about
that for now let's go back and look at

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800
that for now let's go back and look at
 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.820
that for now let's go back and look at
the congratulations screen again

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830
the congratulations screen again
 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.770
the congratulations screen again
one other thing to mention that the the

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780
one other thing to mention that the the
 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.589
one other thing to mention that the the
key thing that is set here is the

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599
key thing that is set here is the
 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.959
key thing that is set here is the
fragment class and that's what's

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:16.969
fragment class and that's what's
 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.070
fragment class and that's what's
actually instantiated at runtime and we

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080
actually instantiated at runtime and we
 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.740
actually instantiated at runtime and we
see layout previews here because the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750
see layout previews here because the
 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.050
see layout previews here because the
layout the Navigation editor knows what

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060
layout the Navigation editor knows what
 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.370
layout the Navigation editor knows what
layout is associated with that

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380
layout is associated with that
 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.620
layout is associated with that
navigation graph and because it knows

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630
navigation graph and because it knows
 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.149
navigation graph and because it knows
what layout is associated with that

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:31.159
what layout is associated with that
 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.580
what layout is associated with that
navigation graph I can double click on

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590
navigation graph I can double click on
 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.769
navigation graph I can double click on
that fragment destination to get here

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:35.779
that fragment destination to get here
 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:42.219
that fragment destination to get here
into the layout editor great and

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:42.229
into the layout editor great and
 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.980
into the layout editor great and
everything that I've just done here

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990
everything that I've just done here
 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.450
everything that I've just done here
adding this new destination to the

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
adding this new destination to the
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.689
adding this new destination to the
navigation graph an action changing what

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:49.699
navigation graph an action changing what
 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:51.909
navigation graph an action changing what
that pop behavior of that action is all

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919
that pop behavior of that action is all
 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.200
that pop behavior of that action is all
this stuff I can also do

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.210
this stuff I can also do
 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.529
this stuff I can also do
programmatically at runtime so

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539
programmatically at runtime so
 

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.800
programmatically at runtime so
navigation editor XML or programmatic

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810
navigation editor XML or programmatic
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:05.429
navigation editor XML or programmatic
all work just fine great

00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:05.439
all work just fine great
 

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:07.229
all work just fine great
and now I'm gonna hand this off to get

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:07.239
and now I'm gonna hand this off to get
 

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:10.399
and now I'm gonna hand this off to get
to walk you through this in more detail

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:10.409
to walk you through this in more detail
 

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:13.290
to walk you through this in more detail
so the first question that might come to

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:13.300
so the first question that might come to
 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.929
so the first question that might come to
mind is wow this is a totally new way of

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:15.939
mind is wow this is a totally new way of
 

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:18.769
mind is wow this is a totally new way of
kind of structuring the UI every rap and

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:18.779
kind of structuring the UI every rap and
 

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:20.669
kind of structuring the UI every rap and
kind of brings up this question

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:20.679
kind of brings up this question
 

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.070
kind of brings up this question
immediately like okay so what what is my

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080
immediately like okay so what what is my
 

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.979
immediately like okay so what what is my
activity actually meant to do right so

how you've kind of structured the UI of

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839
how you've kind of structured the UI of
 

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:40.319
how you've kind of structured the UI of
your app some may be very activity heavy

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:40.329
your app some may be very activity heavy
 

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:42.600
your app some may be very activity heavy
very fragment heavy very much in a

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.610
very fragment heavy very much in a
 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.790
very fragment heavy very much in a
different system all those are certainly

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800
different system all those are certainly
 

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.340
different system all those are certainly
very valid places to be but we're moving

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:47.350
very valid places to be but we're moving
 

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.400
very valid places to be but we're moving
towards a model where the activity is

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.410
towards a model where the activity is
 

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.610
towards a model where the activity is
more just an entry point into your app

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620
more just an entry point into your app
 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.069
more just an entry point into your app
rather than the activity being the owner

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:56.079
rather than the activity being the owner
 

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:59.610
rather than the activity being the owner
of the content of your app it's actually

00:08:59.610 --> 00:08:59.620
of the content of your app it's actually
 

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.860
of the content of your app it's actually
just what's going to store kind of that

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:01.870
just what's going to store kind of that
 

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.400
just what's going to store kind of that
global state so the global navigation so

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.410
global state so the global navigation so
 

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.160
global state so the global navigation so
if you have bottom navigation drawers

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.170
if you have bottom navigation drawers
 

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.650
if you have bottom navigation drawers
you're still using an action bar those

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:10.660
you're still using an action bar those
 

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.509
you're still using an action bar those
are the kind of things that activities

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519
are the kind of things that activities
 

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.360
are the kind of things that activities
manage but it delegates to what we call

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.370
manage but it delegates to what we call
 

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:20.550
manage but it delegates to what we call
a nav host for content so our nice super

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560
a nav host for content so our nice super
 

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.439
a nav host for content so our nice super
simple activity here we have an action

00:09:22.439 --> 00:09:22.449
simple activity here we have an action
 

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:24.090
simple activity here we have an action
bar on the top the bottom nav on the

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:24.100
bar on the top the bottom nav on the
 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.670
bar on the top the bottom nav on the
bottom and this big white box in the

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680
bottom and this big white box in the
 

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.179
bottom and this big white box in the
middle that's our nav host so in the

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:30.189
middle that's our nav host so in the
 

00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:32.610
middle that's our nav host so in the
world of navigation when you navigate

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.620
world of navigation when you navigate
 

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.829
world of navigation when you navigate
between different destinations in your

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839
between different destinations in your
 

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.420
between different destinations in your
app we're actually doing is just

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:36.430
app we're actually doing is just
 

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.429
app we're actually doing is just
replacing everything inside that box

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:38.439
replacing everything inside that box
 

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:41.040
replacing everything inside that box
right so you have kind of that global

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.050
right so you have kind of that global
 

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.740
right so you have kind of that global
navigation outside of that and we have

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:43.750
navigation outside of that and we have
 

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.990
navigation outside of that and we have
hooks that you can hook that up to stay

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000
hooks that you can hook that up to stay
 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.519
hooks that you can hook that up to stay
in sync with the actual nav host so what

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:50.529
in sync with the actual nav host so what
 

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:52.650
in sync with the actual nav host so what
does a super simple version of this look

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:52.660
does a super simple version of this look
 

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.069
does a super simple version of this look
like well if you're using fragments for

00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079
like well if you're using fragments for
 

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:59.189
like well if you're using fragments for
destinations you want to use our nav

00:09:59.189 --> 00:09:59.199
destinations you want to use our nav
 

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:02.100
destinations you want to use our nav
host fragment so here we just have a

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:02.110
host fragment so here we just have a
 

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.019
host fragment so here we just have a
activity layout that is literally just

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:04.029
activity layout that is literally just
 

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:07.920
activity layout that is literally just
our one fragment so you do this by

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:07.930
our one fragment so you do this by
 

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.990
our one fragment so you do this by
including the navigation fragment

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000
including the navigation fragment
 

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.900
including the navigation fragment
dependency as you might expect if you're

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:12.910
dependency as you might expect if you're
 

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.579
dependency as you might expect if you're
using a totally different kind of

00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:14.589
using a totally different kind of
 

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:16.530
using a totally different kind of
destination it would probably also have

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:16.540
destination it would probably also have
 

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.780
destination it would probably also have
a different kind of nav host that you

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:18.790
a different kind of nav host that you
 

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.120
a different kind of nav host that you
add here whether it's a custom view or

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.130
add here whether it's a custom view or
 

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.939
add here whether it's a custom view or
whatever other item that they need but

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:23.949
whatever other item that they need but
 

00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:25.559
whatever other item that they need but
for a nav host fragment we've kind of

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:25.569
for a nav host fragment we've kind of
 

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:27.929
for a nav host fragment we've kind of
set up a few convenience methods the

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:27.939
set up a few convenience methods the
 

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:30.480
set up a few convenience methods the
ability to set what navigation graph

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:30.490
ability to set what navigation graph
 

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.360
ability to set what navigation graph
you're using in XML so you don't need to

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.370
you're using in XML so you don't need to
 

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.220
you're using in XML so you don't need to
do anything programmatically to set it

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.230
do anything programmatically to set it
 

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.230
do anything programmatically to set it
up it'll just go to the start

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240
up it'll just go to the start
 

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.860
up it'll just go to the start
destination of your graph by default and

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:40.870
destination of your graph by default and
 

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.110
destination of your graph by default and
then for fragments we can actually hook

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120
then for fragments we can actually hook
 

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.929
then for fragments we can actually hook
this up to the system back button so we

00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:45.939
this up to the system back button so we
 

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:48.230
this up to the system back button so we
offer a method to do exactly that

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240
offer a method to do exactly that
 

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.549
offer a method to do exactly that
so you don't have to override on back

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:50.559
so you don't have to override on back
 

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.549
so you don't have to override on back
pressed specifically for navigation will

00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:53.559
pressed specifically for navigation will
 

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:56.280
pressed specifically for navigation will
kind of hook up all that stuff using the

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.290
kind of hook up all that stuff using the
 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.309
kind of hook up all that stuff using the
magic of fragments through this default

00:10:59.309 --> 00:10:59.319
magic of fragments through this default
 

00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:03.049
magic of fragments through this default
nav host option so that means that our

00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:03.059
nav host option so that means that our
 

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:06.299
nav host option so that means that our
activity actually gets to be two lines

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:06.309
activity actually gets to be two lines
 

00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:09.780
activity actually gets to be two lines
of code it would be two lines but it

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:09.790
of code it would be two lines but it
 

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.350
of code it would be two lines but it
doesn't fit horizontally on a slide but

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360
doesn't fit horizontally on a slide but
 

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.749
doesn't fit horizontally on a slide but
all we need to do is just inflate our

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:15.759
all we need to do is just inflate our
 

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.150
all we need to do is just inflate our
layouts that content view and then hook

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160
layouts that content view and then hook
 

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.660
layouts that content view and then hook
up the UP button now normally this is a

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:21.670
up the UP button now normally this is a
 

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.389
up the UP button now normally this is a
large operation but because you've told

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399
large operation but because you've told
 

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.759
large operation but because you've told
us about the structure of your graph

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:26.769
us about the structure of your graph
 

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.309
us about the structure of your graph
what we can do is in this case we're

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:29.319
what we can do is in this case we're
 

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:31.259
what we can do is in this case we're
using a Kotlin extension method on

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:31.269
using a Kotlin extension method on
 

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:34.110
using a Kotlin extension method on
activity it'll just be a static method

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120
activity it'll just be a static method
 

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.579
activity it'll just be a static method
for Java users that allows us to find

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:38.589
for Java users that allows us to find
 

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:40.769
for Java users that allows us to find
the navigation controller by passing in

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:40.779
the navigation controller by passing in
 

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:43.049
the navigation controller by passing in
the ID in this case the ID of our nav

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:43.059
the ID in this case the ID of our nav
 

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:45.419
the ID in this case the ID of our nav
host fragment and that just gives us

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:45.429
host fragment and that just gives us
 

00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:48.240
host fragment and that just gives us
access to navigate up and navigate up is

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.250
access to navigate up and navigate up is
 

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.980
access to navigate up and navigate up is
going to do the right thing

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:49.990
going to do the right thing
 

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.590
going to do the right thing
based on your navigation graph you don't

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600
based on your navigation graph you don't
 

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.749
based on your navigation graph you don't
need to actually do a lot of extra work

00:11:54.749 --> 00:11:54.759
need to actually do a lot of extra work
 

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:58.319
need to actually do a lot of extra work
here by giving us your graph we are able

00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:58.329
here by giving us your graph we are able
 

00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:02.040
here by giving us your graph we are able
to do this for you but for most EPS

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.050
to do this for you but for most EPS
 

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.669
to do this for you but for most EPS
just having a single thing is not

00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:05.679
just having a single thing is not
 

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.740
just having a single thing is not
actually what you have maybe you have

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:07.750
actually what you have maybe you have
 

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.499
actually what you have maybe you have
something a little bit more so we've

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:10.509
something a little bit more so we've
 

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:13.620
something a little bit more so we've
kind of set up a second dependency

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:13.630
kind of set up a second dependency
 

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.410
kind of set up a second dependency
navigation UI which is really just a set

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:16.420
navigation UI which is really just a set
 

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.230
navigation UI which is really just a set
of static methods that connect your

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240
of static methods that connect your
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.120
of static methods that connect your
navigation component with some of the

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.130
navigation component with some of the
 

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.759
navigation component with some of the
material design components some of the

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:23.769
material design components some of the
 

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:25.559
material design components some of the
things like bottom nav and things like

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:25.569
things like bottom nav and things like
 

00:12:25.569 --> 00:12:27.720
things like bottom nav and things like
that that are very much in that kind of

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:27.730
that that are very much in that kind of
 

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.870
that that are very much in that kind of
global navigation space but of course it

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880
global navigation space but of course it
 

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.680
global navigation space but of course it
it's 2018 so we have KTX

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:34.690
it's 2018 so we have KTX
 

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.110
it's 2018 so we have KTX
one that changes those static methods

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120
one that changes those static methods
 

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.240
one that changes those static methods
into extension methods on the classes

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.250
into extension methods on the classes
 

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.800
into extension methods on the classes
that they operate on so this is really

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:40.810
that they operate on so this is really
 

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.840
that they operate on so this is really
easy for Kotlin users to kind of

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:42.850
easy for Kotlin users to kind of
 

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.009
easy for Kotlin users to kind of
integrate it into your app and have

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:44.019
integrate it into your app and have

navigation feel like it's just something

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.050
navigation feel like it's just something
 

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.740
navigation feel like it's just something
that exists in all of the components

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:49.750
that exists in all of the components
 

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.870
that exists in all of the components
that are out there so what does this

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880
that are out there so what does this
 

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.509
that are out there so what does this
look like if we again kind of make our

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519
look like if we again kind of make our
 

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:59.579
look like if we again kind of make our
navigation or our activity a little bit

00:12:59.579 --> 00:12:59.589
navigation or our activity a little bit
 

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.139
navigation or our activity a little bit
more complicated without a toolbar on

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:01.149
more complicated without a toolbar on
 

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:02.730
more complicated without a toolbar on
the top and we'll add a bottle

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:02.740
the top and we'll add a bottle
 

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.670
the top and we'll add a bottle
navigation view and in this case we

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680
navigation view and in this case we
 

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.559
navigation view and in this case we
still have the same kind of app menu

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:07.569
still have the same kind of app menu
 

00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:09.329
still have the same kind of app menu
that you had before on a bottom

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:09.339
that you had before on a bottom
 

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.210
that you had before on a bottom
navigation view but what we do to kind

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.220
navigation view but what we do to kind
 

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.490
navigation view but what we do to kind
of hook those things up it takes two

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:14.500
of hook those things up it takes two
 

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.300
of hook those things up it takes two
parts one your menu here is actually

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:18.310
parts one your menu here is actually
 

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.120
parts one your menu here is actually
going to be using the same IDs that

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.130
going to be using the same IDs that
 

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.699
going to be using the same IDs that
you've had on each destination so each

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:23.709
you've had on each destination so each
 

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:26.040
you've had on each destination so each
destination has a unique ID and we can

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.050
destination has a unique ID and we can
 

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.199
destination has a unique ID and we can
actually use those same IDs on your menu

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:28.209
actually use those same IDs on your menu
 

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:30.420
actually use those same IDs on your menu
items so that kind of builds this

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:30.430
items so that kind of builds this
 

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.210
items so that kind of builds this

the home menu item you're going to go to
 

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.929
the home menu item you're going to go to
the home destination of your app so in

code we're just going to set up our
 

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:46.559
code we're just going to set up our
action bar using our toolbar and then we

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:46.569
action bar using our toolbar and then we
 

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:48.600
action bar using our toolbar and then we
can do the same find nav controller to

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:48.610
can do the same find nav controller to
 

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.670
can do the same find nav controller to
get our access to the nav controller

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680
get our access to the nav controller
 

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.939
get our access to the nav controller
object and then we just have a column

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:53.949
object and then we just have a column
 

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:55.920

this is perhaps a little bit too magical
so you can't unroll it just a little bit

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:42.910
so you can't unroll it just a little bit

controller you can actually get a

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:54.080
controller you can actually get a
 

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.579
controller you can actually get a
reference to your nav controller just by

00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:57.589
reference to your nav controller just by
 

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.710
reference to your nav controller just by
calling fine nav controller as you might

00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720
calling fine nav controller as you might
 

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.500
calling fine nav controller as you might
expect and use that nav controller to

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:02.510
expect and use that nav controller to
 

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.770
expect and use that nav controller to
call navigate and just navigate to an ID

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:05.780
call navigate and just navigate to an ID
 

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.670
call navigate and just navigate to an ID
of a destination or an action in your

graph nut that's it like under the
 

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.710
graph nut that's it like under the
covers this navigate is actually doing a

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720
covers this navigate is actually doing a
 

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.530
covers this navigate is actually doing a
lot of work so the nav controller is

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:17.540
lot of work so the nav controller is
 

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.320
lot of work so the nav controller is
talking to what we call a navigator and

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:20.330
talking to what we call a navigator and
 

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.030
talking to what we call a navigator and
so for fragments we were talking to a

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040
so for fragments we were talking to a
 

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.160
so for fragments we were talking to a
fragment navigator that we provide and

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.170
fragment navigator that we provide and
 

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.010
fragment navigator that we provide and
that navigator knows everything about oh

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.020
that navigator knows everything about oh
 

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.590
that navigator knows everything about oh
you called navigate I know what fragment

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600
you called navigate I know what fragment

class name and it's going to build all
 

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.990
class name and it's going to build all
of the fragment transactions for you

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000
of the fragment transactions for you
 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.730
of the fragment transactions for you
it's going to call add to back stack

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:36.740
it's going to call add to back stack

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:42.370
it's going to do all the things you told
us to do by putting that information in

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:42.380
us to do by putting that information in
 

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.710
us to do by putting that information in
your navigation graph so if you had pop

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720
your navigation graph so if you had pop
 

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.540
your navigation graph so if you had pop
up too it's going to do all that sort of

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.550
up too it's going to do all that sort of
 

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.960
up too it's going to do all that sort of
stuff

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:46.970
stuff
 

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.050
stuff
transitions all of that is in this one

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.060
transitions all of that is in this one
 

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.570
transitions all of that is in this one
line of code and all of it can be

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:52.580
line of code and all of it can be
 

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.000
line of code and all of it can be
determined either programmatically we

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.010
determined either programmatically we
 

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.770
determined either programmatically we
can add additional options to this

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:56.780
can add additional options to this
 

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.100
can add additional options to this
method or

something that you determine ahead of

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060
something that you determine ahead of
 

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.710
something that you determine ahead of
time as part of your navigation graph

time as part of your navigation graph
 

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.020
time as part of your navigation graph
but for a lot of these kind of places

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.030
but for a lot of these kind of places

but for a lot of these kind of places
it's not actually just a navigate right

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540
it's not actually just a navigate right
 

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.720
it's not actually just a navigate right
you have some information to pass to the

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.730
you have some information to pass to the
 

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.079
you have some information to pass to the
next source so for this you need to pass

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.089
next source so for this you need to pass
 

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.060
next source so for this you need to pass
a bundle of information so here we're

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.070
a bundle of information so here we're
 

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.300
a bundle of information so here we're
passing a string and an int and we're

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:20.310
passing a string and an int and we're
 

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.340
passing a string and an int and we're
using our nice helpful bundle of from

and it works it's fine this is really

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:28.650
and it works it's fine this is really
 

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.670
and it works it's fine this is really
useful for a lot of things but at the

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:31.680
useful for a lot of things but at the
 

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.510
useful for a lot of things but at the
same point it's not very safe if you do

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520
same point it's not very safe if you do
 

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.010
same point it's not very safe if you do
a Mis type here like what are you gonna

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020
a Mis type here like what are you gonna
 

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.500
a Mis type here like what are you gonna
do so we really want to make this a lot

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:39.510
do so we really want to make this a lot
 

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.750
do so we really want to make this a lot
easier Sergei is gonna talk about what

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760
easier Sergei is gonna talk about what
 

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.270
easier Sergei is gonna talk about what
we did here yeah we built something

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280
we did here yeah we built something
 

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.350
we did here yeah we built something
called save ours Gradle plugin and it

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360
called save ours Gradle plugin and it
 

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.270

all let's see what they're trying to
 

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.800
all let's see what they're trying to
resolve and let's go back to our sample

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:54.810
resolve and let's go back to our sample
 

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.030
resolve and let's go back to our sample
our fragment we helped fragment where we

00:17:59.030 --> 00:17:59.040
our fragment we helped fragment where we
 

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.850
our fragment we helped fragment where we
try to navigate actually it requires us

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860
try to navigate actually it requires us
 

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.980
try to navigate actually it requires us
to pass a screen name argument and

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:03.990
to pass a screen name argument and
 

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.580
to pass a screen name argument and
optionally you can pass category which

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:07.590
optionally you can pass category which
 

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.640
optionally you can pass category which
has integer type and let's go back to

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:10.650
has integer type and let's go back to
 

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.550
has integer type and let's go back to
the calling side well in our slice we

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:13.560
the calling side well in our slice we
 

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.650
the calling side well in our slice we
made everything correctly we passed

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660
made everything correctly we passed
 

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.960
made everything correctly we passed
screen and it has proper type we passed

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:17.970
screen and it has proper type we passed
 

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.300
screen and it has proper type we passed
category test proper type as well but

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:20.310
category test proper type as well but
 

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.450
category test proper type as well but
actually junk refactorings or some other

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460
actually junk refactorings or some other
 

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.130
actually junk refactorings or some other
medications you can forget the best

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140
medications you can forget the best
 

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.740
medications you can forget the best
screen name it's a result in run time

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:27.750
screen name it's a result in run time
 

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.900

exception and don't get me wrong it's

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:29.910
exception and don't get me wrong it's
 

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.150
exception and don't get me wrong it's
super easy to fix but it feels annoying

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160
super easy to fix but it feels annoying
 

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.830
super easy to fix but it feels annoying
it feels like what am i JavaScript

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840
it feels like what am i JavaScript
 

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.080
it feels like what am i JavaScript
developer why this is this compile time

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.090
developer why this is this compile time
 

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.510
developer why this is this compile time
check like I don't know

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520
check like I don't know
 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.600
check like I don't know
so yeah you decided okay now we have

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:41.610
so yeah you decided okay now we have
 

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.200
so yeah you decided okay now we have
this navigation graph let's put all

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.210
this navigation graph let's put all
 

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.660
this navigation graph let's put all
about navigation there including clear

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:47.670
about navigation there including clear
 

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.170
about navigation there including clear
arguments that of your destinations so

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:51.180
arguments that of your destinations so
 

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.880
arguments that of your destinations so
let's see how it looks like an XML and

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:55.890
let's see how it looks like an XML and
 

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.840
let's see how it looks like an XML and
it's super simple we just specify your

00:18:59.840 --> 00:18:59.850
it's super simple we just specify your
 

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.720
it's super simple we just specify your
argument name it's type

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:01.730
argument name it's type
 

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.920
argument name it's type
additionally can specify default value

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:03.930
additionally can specify default value
 

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.550
additionally can specify default value
it means that your argument is optional

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:06.560
it means that your argument is optional
 

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.020
it means that your argument is optional
and this allows us to build tooling that

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.030
and this allows us to build tooling that
 

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.610
and this allows us to build tooling that
once you have an action that leads to

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
once you have an action that leads to
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.450
once you have an action that leads to
this fragment or our action or activity

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:19.460
this fragment or our action or activity
 

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.570
this fragment or our action or activity
we can check and make you the best

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580
we can check and make you the best
 

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.750
we can check and make you the best
proper arguments so look let's take a

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760
proper arguments so look let's take a
 

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.310
proper arguments so look let's take a
look how it looks likely for our Gradle

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320
look how it looks likely for our Gradle
 

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.300
look how it looks likely for our Gradle
plugin now syndicate we use this special

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:32.310
plugin now syndicate we use this special
 

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:37.310
plugin now syndicate we use this special
object which instead of passing ID and a

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320
object which instead of passing ID and a
 

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.380
object which instead of passing ID and a
bundle of course internally the subject

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:39.390
bundle of course internally the subject
 

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.330
bundle of course internally the subject
incorporates the same ID and same

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340
incorporates the same ID and same
 

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.510
incorporates the same ID and same
arguments but to get that object we use

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520
 
 

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.400
 
home fragment Direction class it's

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:49.410
home fragment Direction class it's
 

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.820
home fragment Direction class it's
generated for you you know it's just a

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:52.830
generated for you you know it's just a
 

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.460
generated for you you know it's just a
fragment name plus suffix directions and

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:55.470
fragment name plus suffix directions and
 

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.790
fragment name plus suffix directions and
this has static methods for every action

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:58.800
this has static methods for every action
 

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.350
this has static methods for every action
defined for this destination and those

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360
defined for this destination and those
 

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.140
defined for this destination and those
static methods make you pass required

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.150
static methods make you pass required
 

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.560
static methods make you pass required
arguments so in our case with it makes

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:09.570
arguments so in our case with it makes
 

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.800
arguments so in our case with it makes
us the best home argument there and yeah

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:12.810
us the best home argument there and yeah
 

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.540
us the best home argument there and yeah
optionally can but later set up your

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:16.550
optionally can but later set up your
 

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.000
optionally can but later set up your
other additional arguments and

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.010
other additional arguments and
 

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.260
other additional arguments and
everything is type safe and receiving

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:24.270
everything is type safe and receiving
 

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.560
everything is type safe and receiving
side after that is super simple we have

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:27.570
side after that is super simple we have
 

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.390
side after that is super simple we have
this bodger

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400
this bodger
 

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.260
this bodger
we generate for you its arcs class so

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:33.270
we generate for you its arcs class so
 

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.810
we generate for you its arcs class so
for our case it's called fragment arcs

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820
for our case it's called fragment arcs
 

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.570
for our case it's called fragment arcs
and you just have all your arguments

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580
and you just have all your arguments
 

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.450
and you just have all your arguments
that you defined in a type safe manner

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460
that you defined in a type safe manner
 

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.140
that you defined in a type safe manner
and from this relatively small life

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.150
and from this relatively small life
 

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.360
and from this relatively small life
improvement we go to the bigger one

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.370
improvement we go to the bigger one
 

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.010
improvement we go to the bigger one
which is deep links yes so deep links

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020
which is deep links yes so deep links
 

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.770
which is deep links yes so deep links
are traditionally something that Android

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780
are traditionally something that Android
 

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.960
are traditionally something that Android
has supported for the longest time so

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:56.970
has supported for the longest time so
 

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.300
has supported for the longest time so
you can add intent filters to activities

00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.310
you can add intent filters to activities
 

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.470
you can add intent filters to activities
and you know take over a web URL as well

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480
and you know take over a web URL as well
 

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.680
and you know take over a web URL as well
as like deep linking is super useful for

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:05.690
as like deep linking is super useful for
 

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.790
as like deep linking is super useful for
notifications and things like that

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:07.800
notifications and things like that
 

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.970
notifications and things like that
to link back into your app but this gets

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980
to link back into your app but this gets
 

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.700
to link back into your app but this gets
a lot more complicated as you get a more

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:13.710
a lot more complicated as you get a more
 

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.250
a lot more complicated as you get a more
complicated app like how you structure

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260
complicated app like how you structure
 

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.020
complicated app like how you structure
these things and how you say like

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.030
these things and how you say like
 

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.650
these things and how you say like
alright I need to build a notification

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:20.660
alright I need to build a notification
 

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.820
alright I need to build a notification
what is all of the code

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:22.830
what is all of the code
 

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.950
what is all of the code
needed to actually get into the correct

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960
needed to actually get into the correct
 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.080
needed to actually get into the correct
place in my app and past the right kind

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.090
place in my app and past the right kind
 

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.360
place in my app and past the right kind
of information here so for navigation

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:29.370
of information here so for navigation
 

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.149
of information here so for navigation
who really made deep linking kind of a

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159
who really made deep linking kind of a
 

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:35.899
who really made deep linking kind of a
first-class citizen in our structure so

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:35.909
first-class citizen in our structure so
 

00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:40.519
first-class citizen in our structure so
there's really two kinds of deep links

00:21:40.519 --> 00:21:40.529
there's really two kinds of deep links
 

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:43.070
there's really two kinds of deep links
the explicit kind so these are things

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080
the explicit kind so these are things
 

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.950
the explicit kind so these are things
like for notifications app shortcuts app

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960
like for notifications app shortcuts app
 

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.560
like for notifications app shortcuts app
widgets and the new actions and slices

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:48.570
widgets and the new actions and slices
 

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.080
widgets and the new actions and slices
things that are things that you create

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.090
things that are things that you create
 

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.690
things that are things that you create
and are usually pending intent based

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700
and are usually pending intent based
 

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.669
and are usually pending intent based
these are all things that you're passing

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679
these are all things that you're passing
 

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:58.610
these are all things that you're passing
to another app or to the system to say I

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620
to another app or to the system to say I
 

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.879
to another app or to the system to say I
want to go to this specific place in my

00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:01.889
want to go to this specific place in my
 

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:05.269
want to go to this specific place in my
app the implicit side of things are more

00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279
app the implicit side of things are more
 

00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:08.389
app the implicit side of things are more
around the web URLs and custom scheme

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:08.399
around the web URLs and custom scheme
 

00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:10.299
around the web URLs and custom scheme
URLs so these would be other apps

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:10.309
URLs so these would be other apps
 

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:14.419
URLs so these would be other apps
triggering your app to launch and we

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:14.429
triggering your app to launch and we
 

00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:17.299
triggering your app to launch and we
handle both of these for navigation for

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:17.309
handle both of these for navigation for
 

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:19.700
handle both of these for navigation for
explicit deep links we have a specific

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:19.710
explicit deep links we have a specific
 

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.519
explicit deep links we have a specific
class called Navdeep link builder and

00:22:22.519 --> 00:22:22.529
class called Navdeep link builder and
 

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:26.149
class called Navdeep link builder and
its sole goal in life is to deep link to

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159
its sole goal in life is to deep link to
 

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:28.159
its sole goal in life is to deep link to
a specific destination in your

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:28.169
a specific destination in your
 

00:22:28.169 --> 00:22:31.789
a specific destination in your
navigation graph by its ID but it's

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799
navigation graph by its ID but it's
 

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:34.190
navigation graph by its ID but it's
going to do all of that work like it's

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200
going to do all of that work like it's
 

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.470
going to do all of that work like it's
easy to say but it's a little bit harder

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480
easy to say but it's a little bit harder
 

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.360
easy to say but it's a little bit harder
to actually make sure that all works in

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:38.370
to actually make sure that all works in
 

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.539
to actually make sure that all works in
the system but if we create a nav deep

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:41.549
the system but if we create a nav deep
 

00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:43.700
the system but if we create a nav deep
link builder you create a context you

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:43.710
link builder you create a context you
 

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.250
link builder you create a context you
give it your graph your destination any

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260
give it your graph your destination any
 

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.529
give it your graph your destination any
arguments you have and then you can just

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:48.539
arguments you have and then you can just
 

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:51.830
arguments you have and then you can just
call create pending intent and we're

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840
call create pending intent and we're
 

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.259
call create pending intent and we're
doing all the work here to create the

00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:54.269
doing all the work here to create the
 

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:56.810
doing all the work here to create the
right synthetic back stack both within

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820
right synthetic back stack both within
 

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.970
right synthetic back stack both within
your graph and if you're using multiple

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980
your graph and if you're using multiple
 

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.909
your graph and if you're using multiple
activities your parent activities as

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919
activities your parent activities as
 

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:04.850
activities your parent activities as
well and we're gonna pass that along and

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860
well and we're gonna pass that along and
 

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.580
well and we're gonna pass that along and
create the correct intent that gives you

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:07.590
create the correct intent that gives you
 

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.710
create the correct intent that gives you
to the right place when you trigger this

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720
to the right place when you trigger this
 

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.570
to the right place when you trigger this
intent and then you just pass it through

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580
intent and then you just pass it through
 

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.610
intent and then you just pass it through
to your notification you don't actually

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620
to your notification you don't actually
 

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.310
to your notification you don't actually
need to do more than this to get all the

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320
need to do more than this to get all the
 

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.289
need to do more than this to get all the
correct behavior for implicit deep links

00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299
correct behavior for implicit deep links
 

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:24.440
correct behavior for implicit deep links
these are again kind of links to web

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:24.450
these are again kind of links to web
 

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.310
these are again kind of links to web
URLs right so in this case instead of it

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320
URLs right so in this case instead of it
 

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.629
URLs right so in this case instead of it
being something that you create

00:23:29.629 --> 00:23:29.639
being something that you create
 

00:23:29.639 --> 00:23:31.700
being something that you create
programmatically it's information you

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:31.710
programmatically it's information you
 

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.970
programmatically it's information you
include in your navigation graph so here

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980
include in your navigation graph so here
 

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.200
include in your navigation graph so here
we're adding a deep

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.210
we're adding a deep
 

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.360
we're adding a deep
link element just like we added the app

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:38.370
link element just like we added the app
 

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.690
link element just like we added the app
arguments and actions to our graph these

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700
arguments and actions to our graph these
 

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.850
arguments and actions to our graph these
are just a deep link and of course do

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860
are just a deep link and of course do
 

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.070
are just a deep link and of course do
all of this in the visual editor as part

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080
all of this in the visual editor as part
 

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.470
all of this in the visual editor as part
of the properties for a destination and

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480
of the properties for a destination and
 

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.200
of the properties for a destination and
it's really just as simple as an app :

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.210
it's really just as simple as an app :
 

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.940
it's really just as simple as an app :
URI and you pass in a URI now this is a

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:55.950
URI and you pass in a URI now this is a
 

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.940
URI and you pass in a URI now this is a
static URI which is boring and dumb and

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:58.950
static URI which is boring and dumb and
 

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.220
static URI which is boring and dumb and
you know there's only so many apps that

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.230
you know there's only so many apps that
 

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.010
you know there's only so many apps that
have just one URI they do so we of

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020
have just one URI they do so we of
 

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.890
have just one URI they do so we of
course support some wildcards so if you

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900
course support some wildcards so if you
 

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.890
course support some wildcards so if you
want to do a dot star for a wild card

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900
want to do a dot star for a wild card
 

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.150
want to do a dot star for a wild card
totally supported if you want to fill in

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.160
totally supported if you want to fill in
 

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.540
totally supported if you want to fill in
the arguments for your destination you

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:17.550
the arguments for your destination you
 

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.910
the arguments for your destination you
can actually use curly braces and will

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:19.920
can actually use curly braces and will
 

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.360
can actually use curly braces and will
parse the URL for you and extract those

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.370
parse the URL for you and extract those
 

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.910
parse the URL for you and extract those
values and give them to you for your

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:25.920
values and give them to you for your
 

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.610
values and give them to you for your
arts so again kind of in that same type

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620
arts so again kind of in that same type
 

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.850
arts so again kind of in that same type
safe args now you can get those directly

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860
safe args now you can get those directly
 

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.900
safe args now you can get those directly
from your URL and not have to reparse

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:35.910
from your URL and not have to reparse
 

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.910
from your URL and not have to reparse
things like you already know what this

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:37.920
things like you already know what this
 

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.600
things like you already know what this
is supposed to be similarly you can kind

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:41.610
is supposed to be similarly you can kind
 

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.090
is supposed to be similarly you can kind
of combine the two if you want to make

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100
of combine the two if you want to make
 

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.300
of combine the two if you want to make
more complicated patterns totally can we

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:47.310
more complicated patterns totally can we
 

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.490
more complicated patterns totally can we
also have support for auto verify if

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500
also have support for auto verify if
 

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.740
also have support for auto verify if
you're using app links to skip that

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:51.750
you're using app links to skip that
 

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.930
you're using app links to skip that
disambiguation screen we wanted to make

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940
disambiguation screen we wanted to make
 

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.700
disambiguation screen we wanted to make
sure that you could do the same kind of

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:55.710
sure that you could do the same kind of
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.830
sure that you could do the same kind of
thing if you're using navigation as well

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840
thing if you're using navigation as well
 

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.280
thing if you're using navigation as well
and you'll note here that we left off

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:01.290
and you'll note here that we left off
 

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.090
and you'll note here that we left off
the HTTP HTTPS so what we're doing here

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100
the HTTP HTTPS so what we're doing here
 

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.900
the HTTP HTTPS so what we're doing here
is actually doing both we're saying HTTP

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:08.910
is actually doing both we're saying HTTP
 

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.630
is actually doing both we're saying HTTP
HTTPS now I assume your servers are all

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640
HTTPS now I assume your servers are all
 

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.110
HTTPS now I assume your servers are all
HTTPS but you can't really control the

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120
HTTPS but you can't really control the
 

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.900
HTTPS but you can't really control the
URLs that other apps are including to

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:17.910
URLs that other apps are including to
 

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.970
URLs that other apps are including to
your app maybe they accidentally took

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980
your app maybe they accidentally took
 

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.000
your app maybe they accidentally took
baths off of your URL we still want to

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.010
baths off of your URL we still want to
 

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.470
baths off of your URL we still want to
support both of those so we use this

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480
support both of those so we use this
 

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.240
support both of those so we use this
just as a convenience method instead of

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.250
just as a convenience method instead of
 

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.890
just as a convenience method instead of
having two lines step one and of course

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900
having two lines step one and of course
 

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.440
having two lines step one and of course
it also works with custom schemes so if

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.450
it also works with custom schemes so if
 

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.300
it also works with custom schemes so if
you have your own scheme that you set up

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.310
you have your own scheme that you set up
 

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.190
you have your own scheme that you set up
specifically for your app you can also

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200
specifically for your app you can also
 

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.490
specifically for your app you can also
attach those two deep links now the best

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500
attach those two deep links now the best
 

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.400
attach those two deep links now the best
part is we've kind of worked across the

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:46.410
part is we've kind of worked across the
 

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.470
part is we've kind of worked across the
tool space so besides just the

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480
tool space so besides just the
 

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.670
tool space so besides just the
navigation editor

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:49.680
navigation editor
 

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.140
navigation editor
we've also worked with the manifest

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.150
we've also worked with the manifest
 

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.840
we've also worked with the manifest
merger team so you can add just a single

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.850
merger team so you can add just a single
 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.960
merger team so you can add just a single
nav graph element to an activity in your

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:56.970
nav graph element to an activity in your
 

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.440
nav graph element to an activity in your
manifest pointing to your graph and all

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:00.450
manifest pointing to your graph and all
 

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.260
manifest pointing to your graph and all
of the deep links in that graph will

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:03.270
of the deep links in that graph will
 

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.110
of the deep links in that graph will
then get expanded out to be the correct

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120
then get expanded out to be the correct
 

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.600
then get expanded out to be the correct
intent filter we will build all those

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:08.610
intent filter we will build all those
 

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.850
intent filter we will build all those
for you and if you go to the manifest

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860
for you and if you go to the manifest
 

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.860
for you and if you go to the manifest
merger view in Android studio you

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:12.870
merger view in Android studio you
 

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.580
merger view in Android studio you
actually see the exact line from your

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:16.590
actually see the exact line from your
 

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.590
actually see the exact line from your
navigation file that generated not

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600
navigation file that generated not
 

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.070
navigation file that generated not
intent filter so this means that we now

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080
intent filter so this means that we now
 

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.590
intent filter so this means that we now
have a single source of truth in your

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600
have a single source of truth in your
 

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.550
have a single source of truth in your
navigation graph that you know this is

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:28.560
navigation graph that you know this is
 

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.920
navigation graph that you know this is
not gonna get out of sync with what

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:30.930
not gonna get out of sync with what
 

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.440
not gonna get out of sync with what
you've expect it's not gonna get out of

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.450
you've expect it's not gonna get out of
 

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.660
you've expect it's not gonna get out of
sync as you change argument names in

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:35.670
sync as you change argument names in
 

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.800
sync as you change argument names in
your XML file all of this is kind of one

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:38.810
your XML file all of this is kind of one
 

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.210
your XML file all of this is kind of one
central place to do things and we think

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220
central place to do things and we think
 

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.240
central place to do things and we think
this is a lot easier for basically all

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:44.250
this is a lot easier for basically all
 

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.400
this is a lot easier for basically all
of the implicit deep link kind of cases

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.410
of the implicit deep link kind of cases
 

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.640
of the implicit deep link kind of cases
of course we do do things where this is

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:49.650
of course we do do things where this is
 

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.270
of course we do do things where this is
all action view URLs as they would be

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:53.280
all action view URLs as they would be
 

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.280
all action view URLs as they would be
for web URLs so you can see it's added

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.290
for web URLs so you can see it's added
 

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.230
for web URLs so you can see it's added
directly to the line and if you have

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240
directly to the line and if you have
 

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.000
directly to the line and if you have
multiple of them it'll actually tell you

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.010
multiple of them it'll actually tell you
 

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.280
multiple of them it'll actually tell you
exactly what line if you have multiple

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.290
exactly what line if you have multiple
 

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.740
exactly what line if you have multiple
graphs associated with different

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:06.750
graphs associated with different
 

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.810
graphs associated with different
activities those will all work just fine

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.820
 
 

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.270
 
so one of the other subjects that is

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:13.280
so one of the other subjects that is
 

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.130
so one of the other subjects that is
really important to all of architecture

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140
really important to all of architecture
 

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.490
really important to all of architecture
components is testing and testing of

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500
components is testing and testing of
 

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.320
components is testing and testing of
navigation is very hard and this is

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.330
navigation is very hard and this is
 

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.910
navigation is very hard and this is
something that we're going to continue

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:25.920
something that we're going to continue
 

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.460
something that we're going to continue
to look at over the alpha period and we

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:28.470
to look at over the alpha period and we
 

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.290
to look at over the alpha period and we
really want all of your feedback as well

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:30.300
really want all of your feedback as well
 

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.050
really want all of your feedback as well
but I wanted to kind of discuss what we

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:33.060
but I wanted to kind of discuss what we
 

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.960
but I wanted to kind of discuss what we
think testing in a navigation world

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:35.970
think testing in a navigation world
 

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:40.640
think testing in a navigation world
should look like so a lot of it is if

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:40.650
should look like so a lot of it is if
 

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.210
should look like so a lot of it is if
all of the links between your

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220
all of the links between your
 

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.680
all of the links between your
destinations are through navigation then

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:48.690
destinations are through navigation then
 

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.670
destinations are through navigation then
it's a lot easier to test a destination

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:52.680
it's a lot easier to test a destination
 

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.240
it's a lot easier to test a destination
in isolation right you can test each

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.250
in isolation right you can test each
 

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.350
in isolation right you can test each
destination by itself and then test just

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360
destination by itself and then test just
 

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.150
destination by itself and then test just
the outgoing edges or just

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:02.160
the outgoing edges or just
 

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.790
the outgoing edges or just
the incoming arguments and not have to

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:04.800
the incoming arguments and not have to
 

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.430
the incoming arguments and not have to
deal with oh did it actually do the

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440
deal with oh did it actually do the
 

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.830
deal with oh did it actually do the
right fragment transaction because we

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840
right fragment transaction because we
 

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.870
right fragment transaction because we
can test that just at the navigation

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880
can test that just at the navigation
 

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.410
can test that just at the navigation
controller level so this is something

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:15.420
controller level so this is something
 

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.610
controller level so this is something
that we are going to spend a lot more

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620
that we are going to spend a lot more
 

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.890
that we are going to spend a lot more
time on and in the fragment talk

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900
time on and in the fragment talk
 

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.750
time on and in the fragment talk
yesterday we actually talked about

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760
yesterday we actually talked about
 

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.340
yesterday we actually talked about
really trying to make fragments

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:22.350
really trying to make fragments
 

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.130
really trying to make fragments
themselves much more testable in

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:24.140
themselves much more testable in
 

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.740
themselves much more testable in
isolation so it's kind of a package deal

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:27.750
isolation so it's kind of a package deal
 

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.660
isolation so it's kind of a package deal
where we are trying to build testing

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:29.670
where we are trying to build testing
 

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.000
where we are trying to build testing
into navigationcontroller but then also

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.010
into navigationcontroller but then also
 

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.430
into navigationcontroller but then also
trying to build testable destinations as

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440
trying to build testable destinations as
 

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.200
trying to build testable destinations as
well so you might be interested to do

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.210
well so you might be interested to do
 

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.240
well so you might be interested to do
something right now so figure out an

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.250
something right now so figure out an
 

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.840
something right now so figure out an
espresso test and you want to test oh

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:44.850
espresso test and you want to test oh
 

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.720
espresso test and you want to test oh
when I get to something does it go to

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:47.730
when I get to something does it go to
 

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.560
when I get to something does it go to
the right place well we actually have a

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:50.570
the right place well we actually have a
 

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.900
the right place well we actually have a
add-on navigator navigated listener so

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:53.910
add-on navigator navigated listener so
 

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.350
add-on navigator navigated listener so
you can actually hook it up to the nav

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360
you can actually hook it up to the nav
 

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.820
you can actually hook it up to the nav
controllers navigator and get a callback

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:01.830
controllers navigator and get a callback
 

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.610
controllers navigator and get a callback
of oh did you go to the right place when

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620
of oh did you go to the right place when
 

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.620
of oh did you go to the right place when
I click this button so this is one

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:06.630
I click this button so this is one
 

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.260
I click this button so this is one
method that we found pretty successful

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.270
method that we found pretty successful
 

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.360
method that we found pretty successful
in kind of testing things completely

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:11.370
in kind of testing things completely
 

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.780
in kind of testing things completely
black box outside of things obviously if

you want to inject a nav controller or

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:17.280
you want to inject a nav controller or
 

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.930
you want to inject a nav controller or
use any other method those are also

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:19.940
use any other method those are also
 

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.700
use any other method those are also
perfectly valid ways of kind of setting

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:22.710
perfectly valid ways of kind of setting
 

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:27.470
perfectly valid ways of kind of setting
things up so what can you play with

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480
things up so what can you play with
 

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.810
things up so what can you play with
today and what can you play with you had

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820
today and what can you play with you had
 

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.970
today and what can you play with you had
two days must have looked at it right so

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:33.980
two days must have looked at it right so
 

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.120
two days must have looked at it right so
it is an alpha right now one point zero

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.130
it is an alpha right now one point zero
 

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.040
it is an alpha right now one point zero
