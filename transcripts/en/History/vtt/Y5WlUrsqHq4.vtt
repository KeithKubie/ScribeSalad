00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.430
The wind's blowing
like crazy, but I'm

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.200
still going to try and work
on my net a little bit.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.230
I've lost too many
fish by trying

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.000
to just pluck them
out of the river

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.300
after I get them close to me.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.800
So I'm making my
own that so I won't

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
have that problem anymore.
Come on!

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.630
It's pretty awesome.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.030
I've been working on that
thing for quite a while.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.770
I'm just going to
flex this willow.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.430
I want to bend it
eventually into a circle.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.630
Now I'll take one of
these strands of paracord.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.330
I just got to keep going around.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600
This country is wearing on me.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.400
Tired of the wind, tired of
the storms, tired of the heat,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.370
and I'm tired of the bugs.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.930
You're wearing on me, Mongolia.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.730
I liked you at first,
bud, and I still like you.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.870
But your attitude is
starting to piss me off.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.600
Vancouver Island was hardcore.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.970
It proved to me that I'm tough.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.030
Not many people get to go as
far as their breaking point.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.470
I was lucky enough
to get there once

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.270
and it left a
serious mark on me.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.770
I'm going to take a break here.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.630
[bleep] wind!

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.500
[bleep] this place!

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.800
[bleep] damn it!

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.400
You're either screaming hot,
storming, or [bleep] windy

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.500
in a fire season, you [bleep].

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.470
[bleep]

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.870
Just calm the [bleep] down!
Calm down!

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.130
[bleep]

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.600
The wind comes from one
direction and the clouds

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.230
come from another.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.370
It's an odd place.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.400
The weather has just got
me down a little bit.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.270
Tie a little stop knot.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.900
Try to do a jam knot.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.200
Finish it off with
maybe a half hitch here.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.870
Just like that.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.000
It's done.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.370
I might as well give it a try.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.030
There is a wonderful
bend in my river

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.970
that I am calling Steady Eddy.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.970
And I am pulling quite a
few fish out of this area.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.070
It's a sure meat
supply that is making

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.030
me feel extremely capable in
my abilities to feed myself.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.130
I got a fish with my net, man!

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.530
Oh, and I had the camera
pointed the wrong way.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.370
I got a fish with my net!

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430
I landed him with my net!

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.300
Right on!

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.930
And that's a big
sucker too, man.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.230
That's a grayling,
just a fat one.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.870
Oh man, I got--
look!

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300
My mission is complete, man!

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.300
You know, sometimes
you just need

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.230
a good morale boost out here.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.130
Sometimes things just seem
a little overwhelming.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.430
What this journey
had taught me is

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.700
to refocus on the small things.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.400
It's amazing how something like
this can change your attitude.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
That's a nice
grayling right there.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.270
And I landed it with my net.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.470
I mean, not that there's
anything unusual with that--

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.570
I've done it at home with
the same sort of net.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.670
But out here, man--

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.470
out here!

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730
Out here, I made this net,
I made this fishing pole.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.530
Out here I did it.
