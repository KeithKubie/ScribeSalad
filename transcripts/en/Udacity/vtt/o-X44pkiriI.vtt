Ok, my favorite genetics fanatics. Here is your concept map for

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.430
lesson five. As usual, you can find it on this page under

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.790
the instructor's notes. Download it, print it out, take notes on

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.270
it, fill in the blanks as we go along, and then you'll

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.690
have a chance at the end of the lesson to fill

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.450
in the blanks as a little assessment exercise. Of course, if you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.190
do feel that you learn better with the complete concept map, you

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.230
can go to the end of the lesson and find it there.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.270
But please, try to use this incomplete map here. You'll get

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.350
to see a complete version at the end of the lesson.
