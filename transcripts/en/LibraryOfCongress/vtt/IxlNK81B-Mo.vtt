00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
&gt;&gt; Our closing speaker today first
came to the Library of Congress

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.970 position:56%
from a series of internships with
the Hispanic Association of Colleges

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.840
and Universities while earning
a graduate degree in history

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.100 position:56%
from San Francisco State University.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.220
His time in our Digital
Preservation Outreach Division,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.400
which eventually led
to full-time position,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.420
was one of his inspirations
for going to library school.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.710
Since then Thomas has
held digital scholarship

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.540
and digital humanities positions
at Michigan State University

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.630
and the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.030
In April he was hired

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.240
as the Inaugural Humanities Data
Curator the UC Santa Barbara.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.450
Sorry. I was that kid who always
got sick before the holiday,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.020
and this is my holiday.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.550
So when asked in a <i>Library Journal</i>
interview what a humanities data

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.740
curator does, he described one
aspect of his job as quote,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000 position:56%
"Translating a researcher's
individual disciplinary competencies

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.470
so that they have purchase
in a digital environment

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.980
with materials they may not be
accustomed to working with."

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.690 position:56%
This commitment to making data
research more accessible can be seen

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.220
in his recent launch of the
Source Caster with James Baker,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.050 position:56%
which helps you use the command line
to work through common challenges

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.740
that come up when working
with digital primary sources.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.040
You should check it out.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340
It's really cool.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.890
We've asked him to be our
closing keynote speaker today

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.560
to help make the future a
bit more accessible, too,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.860
discussing where we go from here

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.460
to support data research
at our organizations.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.580 position:56%
Member of the Global Outlook Digital
Humanities Executive Council;

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.450 position:56%
editor for <i>DHCommons Journal</i> and
dh+lib data praxis; author; speaker;

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.340
and teacher on humanities
data, data curation,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.100
and data information
literacy, it is my pleasure

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.510
to welcome Thomas Padilla.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:20.750
[ Applause ]

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.050
&gt;&gt; Thomas Padilla: Okay.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.350
HDMI cable.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.940
[Inaudible], okay.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990
Okay. So we're finally here.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.850
I would just say at the
outset that I'm really honored

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.310
to be a part of this conversation.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
It wasn't so long ago,
about seven years, actually,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.090
that I got on a plane and flew to
DC with actually no job lined up,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.800
no internship lined up --

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.780
purely based on wrangling one
of the manuscript curators

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.280
in the manuscript division to
give me a tour of the stacks.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
And it was in October.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.280
And I would like to say it
was like a beautiful fall day,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.940
but it was actually
pouring and freezing.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.730
And I soaked my shoes
all the way through.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.910
But luckily, they still let
me into the back of the stack

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.110
to see George Washington's diary,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.970
which in a way kind of
set me on this path.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.370
So it makes it extra special
that I'm actually here today.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.710
I'd like to start by
thanking Kate [inaudible]

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.540
and Jamie Mirez [assumed
spelling] and the rest of the team

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.060
of the Library of Congress
for putting on this event.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.850
I know from my own time
here how much work goes

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.000
into putting together
something like this.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.800
So thank you for doing what you do.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.060
This has been an awesome
conversation,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.570
and I think it was really
time for it to happen.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.400
And it's excellent
to see the Library

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.250
of Congress taking a
leadership role in this space.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.000
So today I'm going to speak
about three -- oh, yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
Okay.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.500
[ Applause ]

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.360
Today I'm going to speak about
three conditions of possibility

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.710
that frame the way I look at the
collections as data conversation.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.790
Those are agency, empowerment,
and ethics.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.090
But first, I want to
start with a story.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.590
Early last week I exited the
library at UC Santa Barbara,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.170
put on my sunglasses, and
made my way across campus.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.250
It was a typical day there; it's
like this basically every day.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.440
It was 72 degrees,
sunny, no humidity.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.720
I hope that doesn't
make you hate me.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.730
The quarter's just starting,
so new students are out

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.680
and about learning their way.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.960
You could say that it's a time of
uncertainty, and you could also say

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.850
that it's a time of possibility.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.990
I took a deep breath and
I tried to clear my mind.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.870
Lots of things compete for
attention, and to be honest,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.270
it's not always clear
what really matters.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.700
It can be difficult to hold
close to your heart the reason

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.380
of the things you do
and who you do them for.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.310
One foot in front of the other,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.650
I started to gain a
measure of clarity.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.900
After near misses with
bikes, long boards,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.100
bikes with people carrying
surf boards,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.650
and enterprising Pokemon Go
players, I reached my destination.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.040
It was a building distinguished
from the rest

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.860
in that it was taller,
it had a tower.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.270
It's a university; we
have a lot of those.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.140
I entered an elevator
to go into the tower.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.080
The red digits flicked past
to signal the passing floors.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.390
The doors opened and I
stepped toward a meeting

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.750
with the director of
a center on campus.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.980 position:56%
And I'm sure that there are folks in
our respective communities walking

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.060
to very similar meetings
as I'm speaking.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.080
It was one of those first
conversations where the pressure

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.970
of possibility is everywhere.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.830
Our conversation ran
a familiar course.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.130
And despite a bit of
variation here and there,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.940
the subtext buzzing below the
surface is often the same --

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.040 position:56%
who are you, what do you do, and why
does it matter to me, to my people?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.190
In these conversations I
often find myself in a sort

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.890
of intelligibility
and relevance bind.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.190
It's like, "What is a
humanities data curator?

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.570
What are librarians for?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.840
What is this digital
humanities thing?"

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.260
And as the conversation progressed,
there was a lot of academic, like,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.610
hand gesturing around the table.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.370
We're pretty good at
that in university land.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.270
And after initial introductions
I had transitioned

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.190
to open the collections
as data topic --

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.880
something I'm really
passionate about --

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.600
when the director interrupted
me, took a measured breath,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.960
looked me squarely in the eyes,
and asked pointedly, "Yes.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.260
But Thomas, what are the stakes?"

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.630
It's an important thing
to think on, right?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.830
What are the stakes?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.220 position:56%
Why are all of us here in this room?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.140
I'm sure that many of our
institutions have collections

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.810
that are not too dissimilar
from these.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.700
In this case it's a
collection of zines.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.340
We could relatively easily
make available the catalog data

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.580
describing those collections
in the way

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.980
that the British Library has here.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.330
Similarly, many of us probably have
works of art in our collections.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:59.430 position:56%
Maybe not all of us have Van Gogh's,
but surely we have works of art.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.740
We could release individual
measurements of pixel values

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.890 position:56%
in measuring things like
brightness, and hue, and saturation.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.050
We could make that available.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.190
Some of us may even have things in
our collections that could be used

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.320
to try and make some
sense of the Paris attacks

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.460
that occurred earlier this year.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.170
And some of us have released
data related to those attacks,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.470
in this case Nick [inaudible].

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.860
I think it was more than
10 million tweets captured

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.850
as the event was happening
and in the days that followed.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:40.690 position:56%
We could do all those things, right?

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.190
But it brings us back

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.950
to the original question:
What are the stakes?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.650
Why are we doing it?

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.620
So for me, I learned
to identify the stakes

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.110
in architecture, which
seems fitting.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.950
Like architects, we are builders.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.790
We build infrastructure
in collections;

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.370
we support the formation of
community through these efforts.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.970
The collections as data
conversation is an extension

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.830
of these commitments.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.280
And though it is important
to emphasize in these efforts

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.220
that the conversation is not about
data for data's sake or computation

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.030
for computation's sake,
rather the work is intended

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.290
to build upon our commitments
to support nothing less

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.690
than the ability to
experience life is worth living.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.520
This is not a new role for us.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.830
We have not been without
imperfection in this role,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.650
as has been indicated by
some of the presenters today.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.080
But collections as data
provides an opportunity

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.430
to continue to learn to do better.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:54.950
And so the conditions
of possibility for me,

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.360 position:56%
our agency, empowerment, and ethics.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.020
In my perspective, the first
condition in the collections

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.050
as data conversation
centers on agency.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.030
To see collections as data is
to step toward claiming agency,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.050
to extend individual
capacity to act.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.690
I acknowledge the chance of initial
alienation around this framing.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.600
Data, after all, are not likely
to be what the majority choose

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.710
as a first conceptual
frame for interacting

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.350
with a book, a song, or an image.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.680
In the face of the familiar, data
may seem a cold path to discovery.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.550
Yet data are vibrant
with possibility.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.300
They are the product of
human design and worldview.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.470
Reclamation of agency is learning
how to recognize, interpret,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.920
and act upon the facets of
human intention in the data.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.330
By figuring collections as data,
we seek to make these facets known

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.290
and usable to our communities.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.120
There is more than one path to
enabling the capacity to act

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.410
with data, but I'll talk about
one in the interest of the time.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.460
This is a path that is generally
functional in orientation

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.020
and depends on the
notion of affordance;

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.800
it's a pragmatic approach.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.710
Basically I approach a
seemingly familiar object

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:23.190
and ask what functions it affords
to help resolve a question.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.790
I then transition to consider what
additional functions it affords

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.040
if I engage it as data.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.540
Something comprised of vast
numerical difference often bound

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.980
in codified systems
that speak to each other

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.410
across great distances
of space and time.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.210
As this path is traversed, I
think it's really helpful to think

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.890
on Martin Mueller's reminder

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.250
that every surrogate has
its own query potential,

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.010
which for some purposes may
exceed that of the original.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.290
Now, as a physical object a
newspaper readily affords certain

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.800
types of functions -- you can
pick it up, you can fold it,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.250
you can unfold it, I mean,
you can orient yourself

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.390
to a relatively significant amount

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.360
of heterogeneous content
in a condensed space.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.420
Once you digitize it -- does
this project look familiar?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600
Once you digitize it, the
collection has become data.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.180
In the Library of Congress
Chronicling America Project,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.790
we see collections as data being
leveraged to enhance the ability

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.890
to act upon it at micro
and macroscopic levels.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.440
Shifting between these
scales, we witness a paradigm

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.800
that extends familiar
expectations for working

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.120
with the source objects --

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.730
the ability to browse,
to search, and to read.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.870
Go back. While the
platform is committed

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.850
to supporting these
familiar functions,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.750 position:56%
the designers of Chronicling America

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.150
in a nod toward the data-centric
possibilities provisioned an API

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.110
and multiple methods to get
bulk access to the data.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.100
And these preparations have since
supported a number of projects

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.890
that explore the collection
to its fullest data extent.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.190
This was covered a bit earlier.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.580
I'm going to talk about it
in a little bit more detail.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.700
Spurred by the recent
NEH-funded contest, you know,

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.320
this is one project -- I
think it won first prize --

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.620
by Lincoln Mullen.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.350
He leveraged machine learning to
identify over 866,000 quotations

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.580
and verbal allusions from the Bible

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.190
across 10.7 million pages
of historical newspaper.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.950
Amidst nearly 56 billion words
Mullen not only identify the

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.790
phenomena he was seeking but
further augmented the data

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.130
by creating new linkages between
it indicating not only when

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.270
and where Bible verses
occurred, but also discerning

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.660
and subsequently explicitly
structuring the data

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.560
so that they indicate how often
verses tended to occur together.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.800
This act sheds a more complex
view on use of the Bible

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.840
to support the formation

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.100
of our varied imagined
communities over time.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.850
Of course, our collections
are not limited

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.400
to surrogates of physical objects.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.030
Increasingly, we collect
so-called born digital data.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.150
Web archive collections are
significant efforts here

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.040
at the Library of Congress,
the Internet Archive,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.550
and throughout the world --
institutions large and small.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.390
A key component of the data
orientation with respect

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.430 position:56%
to these collections is learning how

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.090
to recognize what their
nature affords

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.630
for supporting exploration
of questions.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.890
It will continue to be the case
that we will have users that want

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.670 position:56%
to interact with these archives, as
a user may have interacted with them

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.480
at the time of their
creation in a web browser,

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.000
on a mobile device, and so forth.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.950
Yet, if we peel back the layer
to engage the underlying,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.160
less visible structures organizing
the representation we see

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.850
on the screen, it becomes
possible to ask more questions.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.710
Consider Ian Milligan's work

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.890
on Canadian political
parties and interest groups.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.210
In this network visualization,
Milligan has drawn connections

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.100
between all links that crisscross
Canadian political parties

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.090
and interest group websites.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.370
From this vantage point,
Milligan gains a sense of typology

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.750
in the data -- a multidimensional
view of connectivity

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.350
that may have not been readily
apparent and/or intelligible

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.570
without an awareness of
the possibility latent

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.760
in the data sitting below
the surface of the familiar.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.070
This push towards reaching
past our familiar orientation

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.740
to digital environments
is what the collections

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.340
as data conversation is all about.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.920
The deeper we go down this path,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.510
the better we serve
our community's ability

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.510
to peel back the layers covering
seemingly mundane interactions

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:49.440
in everyday life in order to
recover an ability to act.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.740
Empowerment.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:58.230
In order to do the
work that lies ahead,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.900
we will need to be empowered
to think differently.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.490
When I say we, I am
referring to the builders

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.100
at cultural heritage
institutions large and small.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.630
When I say that we must be
empowered, I refer to the concept

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.930
in its truest sense as a move
towards self-actualization.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.330
I'll speak now from the perspective
of libraries in particular

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.480
since that is the community I
have the most familiarity with.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.670
There is a base claim to
universality often touted

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.220
in libraries -- universal
collections with impartial aims,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.480
services with a universal scope.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.060 position:56%
In this manner libraries are figured

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.280
like transaction-driven
benevolent black boxes.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.770
But seriously, I would say
down with the black box.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.480
Libraries are people.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.560
Individual hands, hopes, and dreams
build the collections we use.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.490
Let's acknowledge that,
celebrate it,

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.110 position:56%
and give credit where credit is due.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.110
Collections as data
provide an opportunity.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.220
Who designed the schema?

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.630
Who did the transcription?

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.080
Who decided why the acquisition
should be made and for whom?

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.230
Why did a certain normalization
occur?

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.050
This is about recognizing the
labor and the intellectual value

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.920
of librarian contributions
to crafting the materials

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.220
with which a wide array

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.560
of communities gain a sense
of meaning in the world.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.690
It is also about surfacing the
design decisions underlying these

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.230
collections in order to give
them their fullest integrity,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.700
so that they can actually be used

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.170
to substantiate claims
that are based on them.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.290
There are many directions
the collections

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.240
as data project could go.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.430
In almost any direction we will
bump into preexisting norms

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.430
for going about this work.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.200
And there will undoubtedly
be expectations couched

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.500
in terms of scalability.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.600
Here are the chickens, if
anyone was following on Twitter.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.450
There's actually only two slides
with chickens, so I apologize

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.360
if the expectations were raised.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:07.750
But the scalability
question, that framing.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.840
To be honest, I'm a little
bit tired of scalability.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.110
It's like a chicken or the egg
debate where someone keep insisting

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.680
that chickens sprang from an
[inaudible] chicken forehead

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.730
and won't consider the
possibility of the egg,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.500
that both could actually
happen in parallel,

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.000
that they might actually need
to happen that way in order

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.140
to push the conversation
forward in this space.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.980
Sidebar, I want to thank Katy
[inaudible] and Trevor [inaudible]

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.580
who in their piece against cleaning

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.010
from their curating the menus
project, they introduced me

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.610
to Ana [inaudible], who I'm
just going to quote here

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.850
on the next three slides because
she really captures this notion

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.160
of scalability that
I'm trying to get at.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.350
Highly recommend her piece as well.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.890
So when small projects become
big without changing the nature

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.820
of the project, we call that
design feature scalability.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.210
Now, scalability is possible only

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.000
if project elements do not form
transformative relationships

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.300
that might change the project.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.760
And here's the kicker:

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.730
But transformative
relationships are the medium

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.560
for the emergence of diversity.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.850
Tying it all together from what I
would consider a classic piece --

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.500
although it's probably only
four or five years old --

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.310
it's a talk that Bethany Nowviskie
gave, "A Skunk in the Library."

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.030 position:56%
You know, kind of writing on digital
library work -- or speaking on it --

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.220
she had said, "If you want
unusual results, you can't expect

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.860
that they will come from
playing by the usual rules."

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.500
A couple of issues typically
arise as librarians aim

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.220
to extend their commitments in
the collections as data space.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.930 position:56%
First, it is often expected that new
ground is broken, yet the potential

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.760
of the work is mitigated
from the outset by attempting

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.160
to predicate effort on
a scalability paradigm.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.070
Scalability cannot be the sole
precondition of possibility

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.320
in the collections as data space.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.460
In order for diverse
solutions to occur,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.010
we must learn to embrace
experimentation that accommodates

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.550
and even embraces the value of
failure as equally as success.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.630
Some may say that the
ability to engage in the span

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.160
of outcomes constitutes a
luxury, a privileged position.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.880
I would say to look to liberal
arts colleges, oftentimes dwarfed

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.590
by their R1 research university's
peers throughout the country.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.220
They're doing some of the most
interesting work in this space

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.220
and with vastly limited
resources comparatively.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.910
The second issue impeding
forward progress relates to time.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.860
As previously mentioned,
as often the case

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.800
that there is an expectation,
the new ground is broken

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.180
but little is done administratively
to free up individual time

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.470
to contribute to new projects.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:59.520
I find more often than not that
personal interest or excitement --

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.210
what you might call the
preconditions of the empowerment --

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.520
are not the barrier to doing
collections as data work.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.280
Rather, it's simply a
question of whose lack

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.680
of resolution can often be
traced to administrative mishmash

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.250
between goals and reality.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.620
Simply put, let's free people up to
empower themselves in their work,

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.920
whether that's collections as data
work or some other new initiative.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.700
Now, I've long admired the work
that Cooper Hewitt has done

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.610
with collections as data.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.470
They're enthusiastic and very
public about their experiments.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.380
They actually have a menu
on their website called Toys

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.220
with an experiment section.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.230
There are currently four
experiments listed there.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.490
They're all disabled.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.580
Does this mean they've failed?

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.900
Could we consider the possibility
that they may have been meant

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:59.670
to fail, that they may actually
be a good thing, these failures?

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.850
As we move out of the experimental
section of the Toys menu

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.520
to the Exploration menu, we are
presented with a dizzying array

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.640
of ways to engage the collection.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.940
Search by color?

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.240
You got it.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.540
Search by concordance?

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.140
Why not? I don't know with 100%
certainty, but I bet that more

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.770
than one of these features
started in the mind of someone

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.550
who felt empowered to explore.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.410
That exploration was run
as an experiment, disabled,

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.920
and then walked into the
primary collection interface.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.820
On this slide we witness one
of these experiments in action.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.810
What we are seeing is
a really novel solution

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.550
to addressing a particularly
challenging problem.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:48.030 position:56%
Essentially they're trying to deal
with differing scale between objects

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.360
in a collection and the challenge
of how to generate thumbnails

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.320
that convey an equivalent amount
of information to the user.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.120 position:56%
Right? So if you took a picture of
a chair from a distance of five feet

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.550
and maybe a pencil from, you
know, eight inches above,

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.290
how do you create equivalent
thumbnails

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.250
that help a user make a decision?

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.520
Right? So one of the
things that they did

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.840
in the labs is they
wrote a Python script

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.830
to generate Shannon entropy values
for each image in order to inform

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.710
which part of the image
would actually be cropped

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.390
so they would convey
the most information.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.030
The British Library Labs has
been doing fantastic work

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.450
in this space for years now.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:39.150
Folks like Norah McGregor, Mia
Ridge, formerly James Baker.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.000
I feel like they've kind

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.370
of been eating everyone's
lunch a little bit,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.510 position:56%
especially in the national library
space -- sorry, Library of Congress.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.830
[ Laughter ]

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.390
But yeah, they're an
enterprising group.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.910 position:56%
They engage in teaching digital
scholarship within their institution

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.320
and they work toward
releasing a whole slough

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.510
of different types of
collections as data.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.890
You may have heard of their
pioneering work automatically

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.570
extracting a million
images from historical texts

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:11.990
and making them available via
Flickr under a CC0 license.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.970
Subsequently they have encouraged a
number of competitions for working

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.450
with the collections that
they release as data.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.150
These efforts are not
purely about publicity;

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.020
they provide opportunities to
refine the way that we prepare

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.840
and provide access to
collections and can lead

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.650
to concrete reciprocal benefits
from outside our institutions.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.480
For example, in this case Mario
Klingemann's experimentation

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.920
with machine learning and
semiautomated image classification

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.930
to generate additional metadata
for the Flickr release and also

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.190
to enable subsetting by really sort
of interesting features like all

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.600
of a sudden it becomes possible to
subset the collection by portraits.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.540
It's kind of cool.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.660
I'm not sure exactly what
the application would be,

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.540
but it's kind of a cool
functionality to enable.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.010
There are a number of
libraries in North America

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.950
that have been working
in this space as well.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.830
I'm formerly of Michigan
State University.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.620 position:56%
For those of you not working in the
Big Ten or fans of college football,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.730
that's the green helmet
up there on the left.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.280
While our collections across the
board here differed in scope,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.590
we all shared in common a desire to
explore releasing our collections

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.690
as data in order to encourage
additional types of use.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:29.130
The process in my case -- excuse
me -- was fairly straightforward:

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.650
Identifying existing
digital special collections,

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.350 position:56%
evaluate the possibilities latent in
the data -- are they unstructured,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.320
are they structured; what
is the quality of the OCR;

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.870
has it been transcribed; has
it been hand-transcribed;

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:46.010
how representative is the
data given its relationship

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.470
to the totality of the collection?

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.940
The next step was to
create derivatives

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.560
that served anticipated use.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.910
So out with the JPEG
thumbnails, in with the PDF's,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.390
the TI-encoded files, the
plain text derivatives.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.570
Wrap all of the above
in new documentation

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.490
that is geared toward
supporting computational use.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.390 position:56%
Now, subsequently this data was used

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.920
to support digital
humanities pedagogy.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.380
It became a test set in a text
analysis program and was sought

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.590
after to support a computational
analysis of ingredient usage

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.070
in cooking throughout
American history.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.340
Had we not treated this collection
as data and promoted it as such,

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.730
it's not likely that it would
have seen these types of use.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.370
Now, work of this kind
only becomes possible

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.200
when individual people feel
empowered to pursue their passions,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.560
to self-actualize through them.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.180
The cost of that self-actualization
is time and the confidence

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.420
to pursue projects whether
they succeed or fail.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.900
Really, failure should
be a goal, I think.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.710
That said, embracing failure
doesn't mean doing our work

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.130
without attention to ethics.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.250
We must commit to transparency,
inclusivity,

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.930
and respect in the
work that lies ahead.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.630
A number of ethical considerations
are raised in this space --

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.030
some of these are new,
others are familiar

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.390
but possibly more complex
in light of the medium.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:18.150
The first issue relates to
transparency in the process

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.460 position:56%
of collection building: How were the
data processed; what was left in,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.810
what was left out, why; how
representative is the data;

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.720
what bias does our organization

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.670
of the data reflect;
can we admit a bias?

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.170
I think for a number of reasons
the data-driven journalism has some

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:40.670
qualities that we can learn from
as we consider these questions.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.590
Recently journalists at Buzzfeed
supplemented an article --

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.780
"New American Slavery,"
shown here --

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.090
with a blog post that links
to data methods, analysis,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.090
and code used to produce the work.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.410
We see that the level of
transparency is quite granular.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.270
The writers go down to the
level of individual claims

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.680
in their narrative text with
links to the IPython notebook

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.900
that contains the code
that generated the data

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.150
to support that particular claim.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:14.450 position:56%
As I cast my eye over this approach,
I wonder what it can teach us

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.600
in libraries as we work to
provide collections as data.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.140 position:56%
Will our user expect similar levels
of transparency in the documentation

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.140
of computational processes and
analytic decisions that were made

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.270
to generate the collections
that we provide access to?

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.850
They may. Transparency in this
vein may actually be a precondition

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.330
of viable use.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:40.860
As collections as data are
developed, we cannot lose sight

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.880
of interests beyond
North American borders.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.240
We must have an inclusive vision.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.410
Global Outlook Digital Humanities,
affectionately referred to as GODH,

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:53.340
reminds us of this pointedly:
There's a wider world

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.580
to engage with; we
should think deeply

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.170
about how we can best interact.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.100
Part of that consideration
is linguistic.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.630
Part of that consideration
speaks to questioning assumptions

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.270
of normative access to
computational infrastructure.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:13.200
Through GODH's experiments
with minimal computing,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.520
we can discern a model for
encouraging participation

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.470
in these collections as data
conversation that is more expansive

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.000
than it would be otherwise.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.200
Across the board, we require
acts of bravery large and small

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.310
to make our collections
as open as possible.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.750
Few things make the light of
curiosity die more quickly

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.280
in someone's eyes when
they shift to the words

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.670
"rights assessment is
your responsibility."

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.190
I've experienced this myself.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.090
This is something I've
witnessed personally

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.510
from primary school teachers when
I worked in education outreach here

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.320
at the Library of Congress
to researchers interested

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.850
in large-scale text analysis

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.140
in the various universities
that I've worked at.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.870
NYPL, I would argue, is a
shining light in this space

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.200
that I'm very grateful for.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.370
More open collections
equal more access,

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:11.460
which in turn equal a more
inclusive range of use.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:21.840
Now, this is important: Collections
as data represent lived experience

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.280
and we should respect that.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.230
Traces of human activity are
not butterflies to be collected,

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:33.900
cataloged, and pinned in 21st
century cabinets of curiosity.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.900
Documenting the now focuses

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.080
on capturing a liminal
form of data or tweets.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.380
While the technical
development is impressive,

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.000
it also presents an approach
that models how we might engage

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.610
in collections as data activity
that is expressly predicated

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:59.390 position:56%
on sustained attempts to ground the
act of collection in community need.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.570
Documenting the now approaches
this angle of work in a number

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.740
of different ways, but
I'm particularly intrigued

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.710
by Burgess Jules' [assumed
spelling] attempt to map precedent

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:12.260
in arcable practice codified in
the deed of gift to gain a measure

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.190
of purchase over the
challenges that lay ahead,

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.860
particularly as they pertain
to structuring agreements

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.080
between data producers
and data collectors.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.280
I hope we see more efforts
like this in this space.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.130 position:56%
A contract, after all, is about
agreeing on the terms of engagement.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.590
It's about mutual respect.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.720
In her interview with
the LA Review of Books,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.580
Jessica Marie Johnson hits
upon one of the key failings

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.310
of our collections --

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.120
their inclusivity and
their representativeness,

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.050
she like many others have
by necessity sought meaning

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.370
in the fragments and absences
in arcable holdings that testify

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.780
to practices of systematic bias
whose net effect is nothing less

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.120
than an attempt at
historical erasure.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.210
Sometimes it is the case that the
histories are buried beneath the

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.730
homogenized approach to
representing our collections.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.600
Seeing collection as data offers an
opportunity to surface difference

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.900
in the historical record.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.180
In the case of the real
face of white Australia,

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.690
Tim Sherratt leveraged a
facial detection script

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.840 position:56%
to automatically extract faces from
a wide range of historical documents

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.780
and place those front and
center to give people primacy.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.970
In doing so, Sherratt utilized
a data-oriented approach

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.720
to humanize the data
and surface a story

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.770 position:56%
that might have been otherwise told.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:45.670
As we transition our historical
sources to meet the collections

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.100
as data mark, we must be conscious
of the extent to which the bulk

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.380
of the digitized historical record
privileges white, English language,

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.790
predominantly Western history.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.130
This is a legacy born of early
20th Century microfilm collection

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.210
development policies.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:08.110 position:56%
Subsequently, many digital projects
have worked from these data sources,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.340
which biases said projects toward
reinforcing a less pluralistic view

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.230
of the world.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.880
Presently we have an opportunity
to create collections as data

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.670
that better support the
ability to craft narratives

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.710
that reflect a greater
diversity of lived realities.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:32.410
Jared Drake reminds us that we
all are complicit in the creation

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.980
of collections that
reinforce inequity.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:40.620
In order to improve we
must face that reality,

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.730
really look at it,
and aim to do better.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:48.490
As I have mentioned
throughout this talk,

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.630
collections as data provides
an opportunity to do better.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.530
There is some initial
concerted effort seeking

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.630
to improve our work in this space.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.150
The Digital Library Federation
Cultural Assessment Group is one

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.450
promising start.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.610
It's early on, but they're
expressly geared toward identifying

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.990
and questioning the
underlying biases

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.490
that are driving digital
library collection development.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:18.250
You may have noticed throughout
this talk that I didn't talk much

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.230
about infrastructure with
any degree of specificity

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.980
or really anything
particularly technical in nature.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.810
It wasn't my goal to do so.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.440
That said, I wish it went
without saying, but I feel I need

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.530
to say it anyways, any
infrastructure we develop

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.890 position:56%
to push the collections as data
conversation forward must take place

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:44.660
in an environment that recognizes
and works against historic

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.420
and contemporary hostility
toward women, people of color,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.890
and other underrepresented groups.

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:55.770
And we come full circle.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.660
There's an incredible amount
of opportunity that lies ahead.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:04.340
If we stay true to supporting
the agency of our communities

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.150
as they seek to make meaning from
the data, if we empower ourselves

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:13.960
to be inspired by our own
experiments with data,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.900
and if we are guided by an ethics
that focuses on transparency,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.590
inclusivity, and respect, I
truly believe that we are heading

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:28.450 position:56%
in a promising direction -- a
direction whose path charts a course

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.270
to nothing less than
supporting life is worth living.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.510
Thank you.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.280
