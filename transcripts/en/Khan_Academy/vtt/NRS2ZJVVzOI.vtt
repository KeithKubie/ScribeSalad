00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.180
Categorize the following
triangles according to

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.120
whether or not they
are obtuse triangles.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.010
So an obtuse triangle
is a triangle

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.990
that has an obtuse
angle in it, or an angle

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.970
that is larger than 90 degrees.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.320
So it's pretty clear
that this one does not

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.470
have any obtuse angles.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.970
This is a 90 degree
angle, and these

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.010
are going to have to be
less than 90 degrees.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950
So this is not obtuse.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.225
This one right over here,
just by looking at it,

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.400
you see that all of them
are less than 90 degrees,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.100
so I'll put this not obtuse.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.860
Now, these two are interesting.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.960
Angle JKL looks like it
is larger than 90 degrees,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
and we can assume that
these are drawn to scale,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.880
so we can base it on
our visual judgment.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.930
So I would say that
this is obtuse,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.880
and angle BAC also looks like
it is larger than 90 degrees.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.980
So that's an obtuse
angle, so I would

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.050
throw that in the
obtuse bucket as well.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.530
So we had two not
obtuse, two obtuse.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.500
Check our answer.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.980
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.080
Which of the following
are correct descriptions

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.742
of triangle PIG?

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:06.100
Or I guess triangle pig?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.900
Select all that apply.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.994
PIG is equilateral.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:10.910
Well, that's not true.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.410
To be equilateral, all the sides
have to be the same length.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.990
And we see here two
sides are seven,

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.380
but one side has length 4.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.860
So that's not true.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.424
Angle PIG has two equal angles.

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:21.840
Well, we see that
right over here,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.120
these two angles
that are 74 degrees.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.880
So that's true.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.040
Triangle PIG, I guess,
has an obtuse angle.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.796
Well, an obtuse angle is one
that's larger than 90 degrees.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:34.170
None of these are
larger than 90.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.650
That's not true.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.899
Triangle PIG has
three acute angles.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:38.690
Well, that is true.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.980
All of these angles are
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.420
Triangle PIG has a right angle.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.880
No, none of these angles
are exactly 90 degrees,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.390
so it does not
have a right angle.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.477
So let's check our answer.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:52.560
Let's do one more of this.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620
This is actually kind of fun.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.760
Categorize the following
triangles according to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.380
whether or not they
are equilateral.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230
So to be equilateral,
all of the sides

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.890
have to have the same length.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.239
So this is equilateral.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.530
This one, the sides are
definitely not the same length.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.821
In fact, not even two of the
sides are the same length.

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:09.491
That's really a
scalene triangle.

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.490
Here we have two sides
that are the same length,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.410
but the third is different.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.030
This would be an
isosceles triangle,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.600
but it's not equilateral.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.300
And here they're
all the same length,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.600
so we have an
equilateral triangle.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.560
We got it right.
