00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The question is where did this number come from? How did we get at 85%?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To calculate percent error is a pretty straightforward calculation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All we do is look at the absolute error.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In this case, the absolute error was Plato's guess, 74,000,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
minus the actual circumference of the earth, 40,000.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'd look at this absolute error, and we'd divide by the true circumference.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this case, 40,000 km.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When I do this, I get 74,000 - 40,000, so 34,000/40,000.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The absolute error over the known circumference.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can see we can do some cancelling.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We're left with 34/40, which reduces to 17/20 or 85%.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now, this is something we'll be doing quite frequently in this class

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
when we want to talk about error.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, Plato wasn't the only person to make a guess about the circumference of the earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
After Plato, another famous and brilliant thinker made a guess at the circumference of the earth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That was Archimedes.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, Archimedes guessed that the earth had a circumference of 300,000 stadia.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.783
I want you to tell me how far off was Archimedes.

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.505
What was his percent error?  You can enter your number here,

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:21.072
and you don't need to include the percent sign.

00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:24.926
Some additional information you may need to use to make this calculation

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.810
is that the true circumference of the earth is 40,000 km.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.833
One stadium is 185 m, and 1 km is 1,000 meters.

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:34.510
Enter your answer here.
