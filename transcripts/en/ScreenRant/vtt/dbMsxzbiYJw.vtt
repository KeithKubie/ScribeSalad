00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.920
It’s been firmly established that Disney
likes to add details and jokes that they know

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.930
the majority of the audience, i.e. children,
won’t get.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.550
Sometimes these are in the form of innuendo
or subtle jokes, other times it’s a reference

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.270
to an aspect of pop culture that’s too mature
for kids to be aware of yet.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.880
So while the Easter Eggs themselves may not
be R-rated, the films and shows they’re

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880
referencing definitely are.&nbsp;

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.039
10 R Rated Easter Eggs in Disney Movies That
You Never Noticed &nbsp;

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.400
Tangled
In the last act of Tangled, Flynn is getting

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.130
escorted to his execution when he sees a small
ceramic unicorn, signalling that Vladamir

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.100
and the other thugs from the Snugly Duckling
are about to rescue him.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.210
Many older sci fi fans watching saw this as
a nod to Blade Runner, where Harrison Ford’s

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860
Deckard character sees the origami unicorn
while escaping from the police.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.159
Now the real question is, does that mean Flynn
is a replicant?&nbsp;

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.460
The Muppet Movie
In 2010, Jason Segal brought the Muppets back

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.949
to the big screen for the first time in over
a decade, and it wasn’t without its winks

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.949
at older fans.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.110
During the Muppets’ fundraiser, they bring
out the chickens to cluck their own rendition

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.500
of Cee Lo’s pop hit “Forget You”, but
“Forget You” was just the radio friendly

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.590
version of Cee Lo’s much harsher dismissive
lyrics.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.500
Those more familiar with song’s original
version probably hear those clucks as proxies

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.079
for an ‘F’ word that is definitely not
‘Forget’.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.729
Wreck It Ralph
In the case of Wreck It Ralph, the R rated

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.140
Easter Egg comes in the form of actual eggs.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.719
When Ralph is in the first person shooter
game Hero’s Duty, he comes across a room

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.740
full of what appear to be alien eggs.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.509
This is a clear reference to Ridley Scott’s
sci fi horror film Alien, and just in case

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.240
there was any doubt, when Ralph accidentally
steps on one of the eggs, it hatches a Cy-Bug

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.630
that goes straight for Ralph’s face, just
like the face huggers in Alien.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.359
Going all the way and having the Cy-Bug implant
Ralph with an Alien that would later burst

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.880
out of his guts would have probably been a
little too intense for the kids.&nbsp;

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.619
Jungle Book&nbsp;
For the latest version of Disney’s The Jungle

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.270
Book, director Jon Favreau took inspiration
from a variety of influences, including Frances

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.580
Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam war epic Apocalypse
Now.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.440
For the introduction of King Louie, Favreau’s
staging and lighting are practically identical

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.100
to the first time we see Marlon Brando as
Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.569
It’s a classic scene instantly recognizable
to older film fans, but the kids were probably

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.350
just wondering why the monkey was sitting
in the shadows.&nbsp;

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.720
Toy Story
While one might expect the most referenced

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.460
film in Pixar movies to be a Disney classic
like Snow White and the Seven Dwarves or Fantasia,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.360
it’s actually Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 horror
masterpiece The Shining.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.150
The first case appeared in the very first
Pixar feature.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.060
When Buzz and Woody are escaping Sid’s house,
you may have noticed a familiar carpet pattern,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.440
which was of course taken from The Shining’s
Overlook hotel.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.270
The pattern shows up again in Toy Story 3
on small box sitting on the security Monkey’s

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.270
desk.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.690
Director Lee Unkrich also slipped in the haunted
room number 237 wherever he could, including

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.600
on the side of a camera, a garbage truck’s
licence plate, and the username in the online

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.000
chat room Woody uses.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.620
These are pretty subtle references but prove
that Pixar’s filmmakers are into a lot more

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.040
than just toys and cars.&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.460
The Lion King&nbsp;
Most people probably don’t realize that

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.180
The Lion King actually marked the second time
that James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair had

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.540
played a fictional African King and Queen
couple.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.670
It was only a few years prior that the two
actors who voice Mufasa and Sarabi played

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.370
King Jaffe Joffer and Queen Aoleon in the
the R rated Eddie Murphy comedy Coming to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.370
America.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.900
Whether this was a case of typecasting or
the filmmakers acknowledging an affinity for

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.290
a very different movie is unclear, but perhaps
they got the idea from the sash Jones wears

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.010
in Coming to America that happens to be made
from a Lion’s head.&nbsp;

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.200
The Mighty Ducks&nbsp;
Most people remember Mighty Ducks as a fun,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.080
lighthearted sports comedy aimed at kids.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.180
It’s easy to forgot what brought Coach Bombay
to the Ducks in the first place: a drinking

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.470
and driving charge.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.770
For some reason coaching a kids hockey team
was deemed suitable punishment for demonstrating

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.550
irresponsible and reckless behaviour.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.980
Beyond this there isn’t much to imply that
coach has a serious drinking problem, but

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.311
did you ever noticed how Gordon Bombay is
named after two popular brands of gin?&nbsp;

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:55.940
Gordon’s Gin and Bombay Sapphire make a
mighty stiff cocktail.&nbsp;

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.500
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End
The third Pirates of the Caribbean film contains

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.120
what we believe to be a subtle reference to
James Cameron’s Terminator 2: Judgement

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120
Day.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.650
In the scene were Davy Jones visits an imprisoned
Calypso, he gets his claw stuck in the bars

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.160
before he decides to just pass his entire
body through them to the other side.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.010
This is almost an exact reversal of the action
performed by T-1000 when walks through prison

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.220
bars and gets his hand momentarily stuck because
of the gun he’s holding.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.669
It’s a minor detail, but given the popularity
of Cameron’s R rated action flick, we believe

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.599
this was most likely an intentional callback.&nbsp;

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.710
The Incredibles
The villain in The Incredibles has several

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.110
names before coming Syndrome.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.090
As the leader of Mr. Incredibles’s fan club
he was Buddy, as Mr. Incredible’s attempted

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.360
sidekick, he was Incrediboy, but he was never
Brody, not in this movie at least.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.060
When Mr. Incredible is trying to remember
his name he calls him Brody, which is a reference

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.879
to a character in Kevin Smith’s raunchy
comedy Mallrats.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.009
The foul mouthed, stink palming character
in Mallrats was played Jason Lee, who voices

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.169
Buddy in The Incredibles, so you can’t really
blame Mr. Incredible for his mistake.&nbsp;

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.479
Zootopia&nbsp;
Disney’s animated features spend years in

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.320
production so their references aren’t always
the most topical.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.999
In 2013, when Zootopia was in the thick of
production, the gritty, meth fuelled cultural

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.280
phenomenon that was Breaking Bad seemed to
be everywhere at it aired its final season.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.419
The extremely dark show was aimed at mature
audiences, but that didn’t stop the makers

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.560
of Zootopia from paying homage to the show’s
main characters.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.639
In the night howler lab scene, the rams who
deliver the coffee are named Woolter and Jesse,

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.699
after the leads on Breaking Bad who bonded
over cooking meth together.&nbsp;

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.909
The fun thing about all of these references
is that it makes the movies enjoyable to revisit

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.539
as you pick up on stuff you didn’t necessarily
understand the first time around.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:56.240
Were there any we missed this time around?
