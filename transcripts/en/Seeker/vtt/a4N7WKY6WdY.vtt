This Dnews episode is brought to you by Domain.com

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.430
Broken heart?

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:14.349
Here’s a tip: take two aspirin, and don’t
call me in the morning.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.500
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and anyone
who’s ever been through a big breakup, knows

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.560
just how awful they can be.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.650
You don’t eat, you don’t sleep, everything
sucks - but what can you do?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.660
Well, according to Walter Mischel, a Psychology
Professor at Columbia - all you have to do,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.160
is pop a couple aspirin.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.619
Seems almost TOO easy.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.850
But as controversial as his theory is, it
does have a somewhat solid basis in science.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.800
Multiple MRI studies have shown that the part
of your brain that gets activated when you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.620
experience feelings of romantic rejection,
is the same area of your brain that processes

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620
physical pain.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.379
Which is why Mischel recommends that heartbreak
be treated like any other injury.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.670
It sounds ridiculous, but again - there is
evidence that simple painkillers can help

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.679
people deal with feelings of rejection.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.960
Scientists at UCLA conducted a study recently,
where they asked a group of volunteers to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.400
take either an over-the-counter painkiller,
or a placebo pill, for 3 weeks straight.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.840
None of them knew which one they were taking.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.910
They were then asked to monitor their levels
of pain caused by social rejection, on a day-to-day

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.120
basis.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.050
Volunteers who took the placebo pill, showed
no change in their daily feelings of rejection

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.050
- at all.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.310
But by day 9, the volunteers who took painkillers,
began reporting a significant reduction in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.830
their daily hurt feelings, which continued
to last until the end of the 3-week period.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.610
A short while after, they repeated that same
study, but this time - they put all of the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.090
volunteers into an fMRI machine, and asked
them to play a game of Cyberball - which is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.260
a virtual reality game, from which the volunteers
were intentionally socially excluded.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.630
Sure enough, the people who had been on painkillers
for 3 weeks, showed significantly less neural

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260
activity in the parts of their brain that
processes pain.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.370
Of course, not everyone is comfortable with
the idea of using drugs to mitigate heartbreak,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.430
but according to Mischel - there are other
ways to soothe the pain.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.550
His number 1 rule?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.570
Don’t talk about it.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.700
A lot of times, when someone goes through
a breakup, all they wanna do is talk about

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700
it.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.200
And it CAN be good to get those feelings out
in the open.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.270
But there’s a limit.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.190
And as Mischel points out, it’s important
to step outside of the situation, and view

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.530
it from a distance.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.380
“Self-distancing,” he says “allows [people]
to get a more objective view, without reactivating

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.970
their pain,” and that technique has been
shown to lower blood pressure caused by emotional

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.970
distress.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.500
So instead of staring at old photos of your
ex, he recommends you try to think about the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920
people in your life to whom you’re “deeply
attached.”

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.290
People you love, who also love you back.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.600
Ruminating on that, he says, makes it easier
to overcome the pain that otherwise keeps

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.220
you trapped in your past.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.660
