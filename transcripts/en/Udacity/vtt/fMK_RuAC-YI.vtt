I hope this doesn't come as a surprise, but

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.740
I can't really teach you design. The best that I can do is to teach some of

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.526
the surrounding skills such as analysis, modeling and evaluation. Instead,

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:16.740
design must be learned, learned from doing. Hence a significant portion of your

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
effort in this course should be spent actually designing. The vehicle for doing

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.660
this designing is a series of projects, each accompanied by a design study.
