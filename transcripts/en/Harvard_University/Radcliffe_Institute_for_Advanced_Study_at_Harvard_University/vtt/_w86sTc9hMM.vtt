00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.330
- When we ask ourselves now,
why we need the humanities?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.980
Part of the answer
to that question

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.020
is because we need
to think about how

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.100
to survive into a future
that is unprecedented,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.920
in terms of the
climate conditions that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.720
limit our thriving.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.110
And my belief is that
climate change challenges

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.530
what it means to be human
more than any other ecological

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.540
problem we've ever experienced
in the lifetime of the species.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.970
So I'm curious to
find out for myself,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970
but also for others,
for my students,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.280
and just for the
broader public, where

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.570
can we see some practicable
solutions about how

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.500
to be the best kinds
of climate citizens--

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.340
which is an international
planetary kind of citizenship,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.980
how to act ethically
and with empathy

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.700
in conditions that might involve
certain kinds of scarcity

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.010
that we haven't seen before--

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.120
--and also how to remain
democratic, as a culture,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.920
here in the United States, when
we're being pressed very hard

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.280
around questions of
resource scarcity,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
new forms of globalization
that have changed our economy

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.870
profoundly--

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.080
and also, I think
inequities, in terms

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.630
of who is affected
by climate burdens,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.770
that help exacerbate
problems such as racism.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.320
I think it's really
great that the Radcliffe

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.420
Institute and that
Harvard University

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.110
is supporting cultural
work that addresses

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.600
this kind of planetary problem.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.060
And I hope-- because
I'm a Harvard graduate.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.800
I got my PhD here--

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.500
that Harvard continues
as it has been

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.920
to be a leader in
really addressing

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.190
the problem of being human in
the age of climate change--

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.830
--and letting this be
at the center of work

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.320
in the social sciences
and the humanities

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.850
so that the
scientists don't have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.420
to bear the entire burden
of communication on an issue

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.504
that it seems is getting more
and more difficult to speak

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:07.170
about in public.
