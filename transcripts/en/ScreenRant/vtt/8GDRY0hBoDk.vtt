00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
Every now and again, a pairing comes along that makes absolute perfect sense.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.500
De Niro and Pacino, Damon and Afleck, Deadpool and Spiderman..

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.120
..Despite being tasked with saving the world over and over again, superheroes are still human,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720
Well, most of them are at least.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.580
But human or not, these characters all have friends..

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.000
and have bonded to bromance level status with some of their costumed peers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.200
Here are ScreenRant's 10 Marvel Superhero Bromances That Actually Happened.

And before we start, can you guess this movie from these emojis?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.840
Stay tuned for the answer at the end of our video.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.240
(Capt.) I thought you were dead

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.080
(Bucky) I thought you were smaller.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.240
Captain America and the Winter Soldier.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.300
You know you're destined to be bros for life, when you wake up seventy-odd years later..

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.740
And make it your life's mission to save your once- presumed dead friend, and protect him..

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.300
From the clutches of the law.. and evil-Nazi cults.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.120
Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were childhood friends, who grew up together

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.340
in Brooklyn before the second world war..

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.300
Despite being scrawny and weak, he found kinship with the dashing Bucky Barnes, and the two were

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.100
Inseprable

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.160
Even during the war when Captain America disobeyed orders and saved a group of soldiers..

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.360
..Including the injured Barnes.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.600
Even though Barnes was presumed dead, he would reunite with Cap in the 21st century

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.580
and unfortunately they would come to blows.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.100
Despite Bucky being a mind-controlled assassin..

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.200
Cap did his best to bring his friend back.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.760
And eventually succeeded in doing so.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.560
He later did his best to protect Barnes from both the international authorities and from Iron Man.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.400
Who was out on a vendetta on the former assassin.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.700
We think Cap and Bucky may set the bar for what bros would do for each other.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.420
(Prof. X)"You're going to have to do for me, what I once did for you, lead me, guide me.."

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.420
Wolverine and Professor X

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.080
After the world apparently fell apart..

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.440
long-time buddies, Logan and Charles Xavier, hit the road and went into hiding south of the border

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.860
These two hit it off from the moment they met each other.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.840
With Logan finding a mentor and a friend in the telepathic professor.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
There may be an age difference between the two of them, with Logan being Charles' senior and all..

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.600
But when you're bros, age is only a number

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.240
Charles helped Logan piece together his terrible past.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.400
While also acting as a much-needed friend

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.980
When old age came knocking for the two of them, Logan did his best to take care of the Professor.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.380
Despite being unsure as to how exactly to take care of anyone.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.720
We figure he gave it his best given his unstable condition.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.040
But when crisis came-a-calling the first and only priority was the protection of his oldest friend.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.700
When that becomes instinct number one, you know you're bros.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.340
Luke Cage and Iron Fist

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.480
It's only a matter of time before one of comic books favorite bromances makes its way to the small screen.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.960
Making up half of the Defenders, Luke Cage and Iron Fist first hit it off in the 1970's in the comics..

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.360
during a time when Kung Fu and Blaxploitation were quite popular.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.260
Despite having the foundations, the two characters were not a big hit initially..

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
So what happens when you bring two unpopular forces together into the same room?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.700
They obviously create the biggest bromance the seventies has ever seen on paper.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.180
And generate sales.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.140
Unlike most superhero teams such as Avengers or the  X-men, the Defenders don't have much in the way of superpowers.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.440
Relying often on their superior fighting skills that have been enhanced in some way, shape or form.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.220
This ends up feeling like an old-buddy cop film in the comibook form.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.660
(Iron Man rapidly)"Got to sleep go to sleep go to sleep"

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.000
Iron Man and Hulk

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.460
When he's not stealing the limelight as a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, Tony Stark

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.940
can be found talking scientific theory with his buddy, Bruce Banner.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.920
The only person who's on the same intellectual level as him.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.440
Over their love of science, the two have formed a super bromance that may have been too trusting.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.360
As the ever-cautious Bruce Banner helped Tony Stark create the giant murderbot known as Ultron.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.060
Well hey, only best friends forever accidentally create Earth-ending situations

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.380
And only best friends stick around to clean up the mess.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.740
I mean Thor went straight for the one-armed choke against Tony

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.080
We don't think there's any bromance going on there.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.320
But Thor may end up stealing the thunder from Dr.Banner as they team up for the events of Thor Ragnarok(Doomsday)

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.160
(??)"You have the most powerful brain in the world Professor, but the mind can only stretch so far before

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.660
it snaps."

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.440
Professor X and Magneto

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.780
They may be sworn enemies, but there's no denying Charles Xavier's intellectual and spiritual other half is Erik Lehnsher.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.760
Otherwise known as Magneto

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.520
The two met in the 1960's and have stuck with each other over the decades

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.800
Despite constantly fighting and arguing

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.820
Even when Magneto gets imprisoned for trying to turn normal humans into mutants, Charles Xavier is there for his friend.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.320
Stopping by regularly to play a round of chess with the imprisoned supervillain.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.600
They may often come to blows, may even hate each other at the best of times,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.440
But only true bros can eventually put that behind them in the end and team up to save the world

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.280
Daredevil and the Punsiher

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.990
friend well that friend becomes your bro

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.060
which is the case for Frank Castle and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.800
Matt Murdock they may not always get

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.090
along but the to have an understanding

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.100
of the world that most other people just

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.100
don't see and get it see they may

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.200
disagree on ethics and morality but in

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.000
the end both vigilantes want the same

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.800
thing which gives the Punisher someone

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.750
to confide his thoughts to he may not

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.670
realize it but daredevil is extremely

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.990
important for the well being of the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.060
Punisher with their rapport the to try

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.380
to keep each other out of harm's way

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.330
both from criminal and from the clutches

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.220
of the police department The Punisher

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.740
even once traded his life for Daredevils

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.510
in the comics way to take one for the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.930
team Punisher you're welcome the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.630
Warriors three unlike the rest of the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.970
pairings on our list this bromance comes

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.130
from a trio of battle hardy Asgardian

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.770
warriors comprised of Fandral hogan and

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.870
Volstagg the dynamic trio are always

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.700
ready for battle and a drink not

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.440
necessarily in that order the Warriors

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.210
Three often head into battle with the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.520
almighty Thor and the ladies sit making

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.320
one of the greatest fighting forces in

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.750
the cosmos the trio and Roy recounting

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.760
their tails in bars and taverns across

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.040
as God often exaggerating their tails to

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.330
make them seem even more spectacular

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.460
than they already are no matter what the

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.410
task at hand is these three will do

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.940
anything for each other even if that

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.800
means springing a supervillain out of

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.900
jail or disobeying the direct orders of

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.850
Odin himself to bring Thor back to

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.860
Asgard through thick and thin these

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.780
brave warriors will always have each

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.470
other's backs Christopher entry surgeon

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.860
arion Hawkeye and black widow not every

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.990
bromance has to be between teeth dudes

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.419
in fact one of the biggest bromances out

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.190
there in the Marvel Universe comes from

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.080
the friendship between Hawkeye and black

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.280
widow they may be strapped for super

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.530
but together these two make one hell of

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.930
a team the two have a long history which

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.820
was established after Natasha Romanov

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.800
left the dark and dangerous employment

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.300
of the Russian government she eventually

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.190
met up with Quinn Barton and joined

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.260
shield will be changing the purpose of

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.270
her life and erasing the red in her

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.550
ledger she owes a lot too quick and he's

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.380
one of the few people to former assassin

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.660
actually trust you know you're on

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.580
bromance levels of friendship when

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.139
you're in the know about the secret

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:06.010
family that nobody else knows about

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.380
Rocket Raccoon and Groot I am Groot that

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.210
was group speak for you're my best

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.250
friend which is exactly what the dynamic

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.680
duo Rocket Raccoon and groups are the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.690
two buddies travel across the galaxy as

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.700
bounty hunters catching unsavory

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.500
individuals and trading them in for some

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.720
hard-earned cash despite Groot only

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.700
being able to speak three words rocket

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.800
actually understands the meaning behind

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.840
every different iteration of paigham

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.730
groups which must mean the world to him

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.320
imagine if no one else to really

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.940
understand him and Groot was left all

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.340
alone unable to communicate yeah we got

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.140
sad just thinking of it too that's why

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.030
Rocket Raccoon and roots are meant to be

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.130
and have the most intergalactic bromance

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.620
out there they stick together no matter

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.580
what so you gotta hold on to love tight

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.060
Deadpool and spider-man we don't think

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.130
it can get any more bromance than these

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.140
two I mean just look at them in case you

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.940
didn't know Deadpool was initially based

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.070
on spider-man's concept model so these

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.570
two are about as close to being Inc

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.730
brothers as you can get when not dishing

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.770
out the pain on the scum and villainy of

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.870
the world these two are cracking one

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.820
whiners like it's nobody's business a

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.040
more recent comic publication soft

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.750
spider-man questioning the dark and

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.000
gritty nature of modern superhero films

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.740
to which Deadpool replied that he would

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.600
not do his own movie unless it was all

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.669
rated Wade Wilson is known for being

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.740
immature and silly but Peter Parker

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.180
seems to bring out the trials in the

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.100
Canadian super mutant which makes their

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.050
bromance all the more special they're

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.000
funny and they're clearly besties

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.589

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:39.020
