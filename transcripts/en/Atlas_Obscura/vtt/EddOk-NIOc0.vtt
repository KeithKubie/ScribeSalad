00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:05.472
- I think the New York City subway system,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.680
it's the heartbeat of the city.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.770
There is nothing that is
more New York than hearing

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.350
the cadence of a subway
car coming down the tracks

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.473
and into the station.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.903
- Every train that goes by
is just a different rhythm.

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:17.804
(man beatboxes)

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.580
The hidden gems, are the
million dollar talent

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.310
that you find in the subway.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.460
- Almost since the emergence
of the subway system,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.430
when it opened in 1904,
people have realized

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.110
that it's actually quite
a great space to perform.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.210
- I've been singing all my life.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.950
I use what I have, and
the echo of the subway.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.110
I don't need a microphone.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.920
- I like to think of it as really more,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.550
as the subway as muse.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.740
And, that's been true all the way

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.580
from Duke Ellington's Take the A Train,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.340
to, you know, Sean Carter
adopting the name Jay-Z,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.700
from the J/Z lines.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.220
- It really is a one of a kind experience.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.360
And you're gonna get on
a train, a vintage train,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.400
that came on line in the
'30s, and you're gonna pull

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.340
out of our station.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.730
And, you're gonna take
that train in service up

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.250
to your final destination,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.490
which is Willem de Kooning's
loft, which is incredible.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.040
And, along the way, you're going to be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.050
in an immersive, artistic experience.

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:26.584
- This was so cool.

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:28.537
- I had a full sensory overload.

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:31.767
- What is this old train
full of people and music?

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:33.900
- Definitely like, an unreal experience.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.870
- It was so cool that you
went from car to car and,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.150
were transported through time

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.200
with all different performances.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.140
- Definitely like, a one
of a kind experience.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600
Chase Sapphire did it.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.693
Now, my morning commute is ruined.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:56.080
- So, it's truly, a once
in a lifetime opportunity

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.410
to be a part of an iconic
New York experience

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.300
on the subway.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.470
Be exposed to some incredible artists,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.090
who are inspired by the subway.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.023
And then, to have a
great party afterwards.
