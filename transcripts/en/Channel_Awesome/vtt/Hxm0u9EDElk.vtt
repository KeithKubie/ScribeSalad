00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.979
Well seeing how I thought the first Zenon movie was charming enough, I expected the sequel or "zequel"

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500
(Haha) to at least be as good if not better.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.139
As it starts off, it seems like it's gonna be good

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.100
It has a particularly funny opening where she sneaks into a control room and finds what she thinks is a game of pong.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.499
Not only is it funny that she's blown away by a game like pong seeing how it's so simple

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.190
And they just don't have games like that in the future

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.630
That's made even funnier when you find out the paddles are actually the doors

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.300
sucking stuff into space, even starting to get people involved in there.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.450
"Okay", I thought. We're in some good hands

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.839
But sadly, that's where the best stuff of the movie stops. You see, another authority figure is coming to the space station

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.770
and, again, is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.540
threatening to close it down. To make things worse, his daughter is the girl that she didn't get along with in the first movie.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.079
And Zenon's been assigned to show her around and do whatever she wants, even cut her food!

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.920
Oh God, this is dumb...

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.649
But Zenon can't think too much about that, as she's put in a part of a ship to mostly just keep her out of trouble.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.949
It's a section that tries to track any signals for alien life.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.969
Wouldn't you know it, as soon as Zenon takes over, she hears a signal for alien life.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.689
But, for some reason, nobody believes her. She said she heard this sound, like a "zoom, zoom" and...

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.710
What, they don't have a recording of it? They can't go back? They can't hear it again?

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.680
This is the technologically advanced future? Naturally, this happens a couple times and every single time

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.040
She's the only one in the room and she has to tell everybody it happened again with nobody believing her.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.140
So she once again,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.180
travels back to earth. Again, spending the majority of the film down there

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.419
Reuniting with her aunt, her best friend, and of course, the girl she doesn't like who sneaks off with her for some reason.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.850
And they tried to find the rock star from the end of the first film because they think that the message is actually

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.060
His song and the aliens want to talk to him. Oh, do you find this ridiculous yet?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.479
Don't get me wrong, the first Zenon was a silly film,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.300
But it had a little bit of a charm and creativity to it. This is just on repeat.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.780
Except there's little charming about it. Most of the characters aren't even that likable. I hate how nobody believes her. I hate this girl

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.959
That's supposed to be annoying but instead of coming off as "funny annoying", she's just "annoying annoying".

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.959
I hate the fact that she breaks up with the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.900
boyfriend at the beginning of the film and it's treated like no big deal

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.520
No, actually it is a big deal

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.390
It kind of affects her

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.970
But not enough to pay him to have him come back in the movie.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.820
The musician gets annoying, the aunt gets annoying, the parents get annoying, the general is annoying.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.460
Everything just has a slow, unimaginative feel to it.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.340
Even the aliens at the end when you finally see them just kind of look like rejects from "The Abyss"

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.820
At times, it's even hard to follow.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.309
There's a lot of talk about what the aliens want and how they want them and let me tell you I watch a lot of

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.360
Star Trek and even I couldn't follow this. How the hell are kids supposed to comprehend it?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.659
Even the layout of the scenes don't even make sense. Like the aliens finally come, and everybody sees them,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.219
And they're like "Oh my God, life on a different planet," and then Zenon is still being punished

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.359
And she's trying to tell him what's going on, and they're like, "Where's your proof?" What do you mean,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.300
"Where's your proof?" The aliens were just there! How can you still not believe her? But then, they do it again!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.980
Yeah, the aliens just come by and flash things and... yeah, didn't we just see this?

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.440
Why was there that little scene of her getting balled out?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.440
Oh, what? Is it so the annoying girl can finally stand up for her?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.989
You could have had that in an earlier scene. And, truth be told, she's so unlikable

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.019
I'm still not quite on her side. When she sneaks off with Zenon,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.540
She leaves a letter to her father saying that she's been kidnapped. Freaking kidnapped! What the hell is wrong with these people?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.320
Okay, okay, so is this a terrible film? I guess not.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.390
It's just your run-of-the-mill bad. The characters are all morons, a lot of the moments seem recycled. The effects are a little better,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.690
I'll give it that. But aside from that, there's really not much to it.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.659
It's funny, because this is the kind of film I assume the first Zenon would be like. You know, kinda lame, has

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.359
Aliens and some dumb technology that makes no sense and lame lines, but the first one kind of surprised me

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.900
And I thought it was an okay kids film.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.390
Because of that, I was actually expecting more out of this one, and instead I got what I suppose

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.550
I should have been expecting. Like I said,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.380
I'm not gonna act like it's the worst thing ever, but I definitely wouldn't take this trip to the stars anytime soon.
