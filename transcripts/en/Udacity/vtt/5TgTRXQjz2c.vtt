00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.650
As we mentioned before, you're going to still see fake

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.120
data in the app. We'll need to add code to

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.630
actually kick off a background task from the main

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.970
thread. For debugging purposes, it will be nice if we

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.630
can execute the task any time we wanted by

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.980
interacting with the UI somehow. So, we're going to add

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.650
a Refresh menu option for debugging. A warning, though,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.100
this menu option should not shift in the final app.
