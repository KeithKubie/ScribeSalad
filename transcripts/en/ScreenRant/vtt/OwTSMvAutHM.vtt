00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.490
Every movie fans has their favorite superhero,
supervillain, or offbeat comic book star that

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.530
they would love to see done justice on the
big screen.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.260
But as cruel as it might be to be kept waiting
years to see it, it hurts just as much when

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.869
a beloved character's debut is a disappointement.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.179
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Comic Book Characters
Who Deserve Better Movies.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.020
Kitty Pryde
Thanks to the X-Men series of movies, people

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.060
might think that Kitty Pryde - played by Ellen
Page - is a permanent sidekick, but the mutant

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.250
ability to phase through objects or people
is just the start of what makes her unique.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.080
She developed into one of the most experienced
X-Men since her introduction, even being chosen

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.940
by writer Joss Whedon as the star of his "Astonishing
X-Men."

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.650
Who wouldn't want a movie about a girl who
can kick, grab or tackle people through walls,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.559
or if pushed, phase a moon-sized bullet right
through planet Earth?

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.420
That's what we thought.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.500
The Incredible Hulk
It's sad to think that fans are still begging

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.900
for a homerun Hulk movie after the green-skinned
hero has already had two solo films.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.740
Hopefully Marvel starts to realize that Bruce
Banner a.k.a. the Hulk's mythology is as complicated

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.690
as any comic hero, having split his personality,
travelled to faraway planets, and even waged

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.720
war on all of Earth's superheroes.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.320
How his films keep being dragged down by a
cookie-cutter romance is beyond us.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.040
Gambit
The Ragin' Cajun got his big screen debut

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.430
as a back-up player in X-Men Origins: Wolverine,
but the mutant had almost nothing in common

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.500
with his fan-favorite comic book and cartoon
source material.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.800
Blessed with a knack for theft and the ability
to give objects immeasurable kinetic energy,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.380
a solo movie following Gambit a.k.a. Remy
Lebeau's Louisiana hijinks should be as slick

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.030
a superhero movie as they come.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.880
Hopefully, the Channing Tatum movie in development
will even come close to matching the hero's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.229
coolness.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.860
Cyclops
Thanks to the X-Men movies, the world knows

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.580
Cyclops best as the joyless, rule-loving rival
to the ultra-cool Wolverine - who can shoot

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.830
lasers out of his eyes.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.409
That's a tragic definition of one of the most
powerful, most courageous, and most dependable

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.860
mutants in Marvel history.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.440
Even without his powers, Scott Summers is
a born leader, willing to do, or become whatever

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.299
is necessary to get the job done.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.420
He SHOULD be on the same level as Captain
America in the movies, and make one point

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.810
clear: as long as Cyclops is alive to fight,
mutantkind will never be beaten.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.900
Catwoman
In an age of superheroes who are either squeaky-clean

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.730
or beyond saving, you would think that a character
like Catwoman would thrive.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.000
Sure, she's a thief and master criminal in
general, but she knows where to draw the line,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.680
helping Batman when he's in need - as in,
save him or he'll die.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.850
The solo movie Catwoman got was an absolute
disaster, with most of the problems due to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.459
the fact that the movie character had almost
nothing in common with the source material.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.900
But give us a Catwoman as compelling and confident
as the comics, and Ben Affleck's Batman will

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.790
have met his match.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.650
Green Lantern
No fan of DC Comics needs to be told that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.480
the Green Lantern movie fell short of its
hero's mythology, and can only hope that Warner

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.930
Bros. makes sure they get the Justice League
hero right the second time around.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.370
And the hero SHOULD be a hit, since his superpower
is quite literally whatever he can imagine,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.959
made real by his magical ring.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.590
As every other blockbuster tries to find a
new way to destroy Earth, there's no better

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.140
time for a Green Lantern movie to head to
an even bigger scale, uniting an army of Lantern

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.459
space cops to protect the universe, not just
one planet.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.180
Venom
Ask any fan of Spider-Man who the webslinger's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.870
greatest enemy is, and they might disagree.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.190
But ask them which is the coolest - and it's
Venom every time.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.349
The version of the alien/human hybrid that
movie fans got in Spider-Man 3 was a disappointment

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.579
from the start, more quippy villain than horrifying
monster.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.849
We can only hope that a writer, director or
studio will finally realize that a black-suited

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.450
beast with Spider-Man's powers - and none
of his do-gooder attitude - isn't just a villain,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.650
but a potential franchise all on his own.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.919
John Constantine
He may not get the headlines or press of his

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.859
superpowered Justice League comrades, but
when the League can't handle a magical threat,

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.540
it's John Constantine they call.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.670
He operates on a level that DC's brightest
stars can't even touch, inhabiting a shadowy

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.519
world of demons and angels that most never
even notice.

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.629
The Constantine movie actually got much of
the attitude and fiction right, but if a movie

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.870
committed to creating a hero as ruthless,
nasty, and downright unlikeable as the real

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.989
John Constantine, the result would be something
refreshing, if nothing else.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.040
Heck, we'll even settle for Justice League
Dark.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.699
Black Widow
Sure, Scarlett Johansson has helped make Black

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.090
Widow a household name alongside the Avengers,
but without a superpower, she's a long way

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.609
from a starring role in a Marvel movie so
far.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.430
Fans loved The Winter Soldier's grounded style,
so imagine what they'd do with a dark, sinister

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.130
spy story following Black Widow doing what
she does best: operating in the shadows as

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.889
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top covert operative.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.449
So far fans have only heard about the death-defying
missions she's survived with Hawkeye at her

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.400
side - so what's keeping Marvel from giving
us an entire movie devoted to the same badass

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.440
leading lady?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.050
Robin
He may be forever known as Batman's sidekick,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.550
but comic fans know that Robin, no matter
which version, is deserving of a spotlight

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.550
all to himself.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.139
Whether it's Dick Grayson promoted to Nightwing,
one of the most badass characters of DC's

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.039
1990s era, or Tim Drake, the only Robin to
apply for the job, and an even better detective

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.849
than Batman - not to mention the leader of
the Teen Titans.

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.240
Even if a big screen story gave the spotlight
to Jason Todd, the former robin who became

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.729
the murderous vigilante Red Hood, DC fans
would know that a one-of-a-kind story and

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:02.729
star was guaranteed).

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.060
Those are just a handful of comic book heroes
or villains that deserve better live-action

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.560
adaptations than they've gotten so far, but
which comic book stars do you think have been

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.020
given a bad rap by Hollywood blockbusters?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.699
