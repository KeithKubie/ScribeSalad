00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.810
I'm now on page 460 and we'll
start with the number five.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.140
And they have a little
drawing for us.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.945
Let's see, if I had a little
box like that,

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:17.170
I'll do it in yellow.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.780
So the box looks something
like this.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.685
And then it has a
bunch of lines.

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.396
It has a line like that.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:28.730
It has a line like that.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.500
It has a line like that.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.400
It has a line like that.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.220
And then they have a couple
of points here.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.970
They have-- let me switch
to the pen.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.990
That's too dark.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:56.620
So you have point
A, B, C, and D.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.100
And the question is, in the
figure above, a path from

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.670
point A to point D is determined
by moving upwards

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.400
or to the right along the
gridlines-- so you have to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.470
move along the yellow lines--
how many different paths can

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.200
be drawn from A to D that do
not include either B or C?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.150
So we can't have either B
or C in our path that

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.760
goes from A to D.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.500
So the way I think about it is,
which of the-- if we call

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.880
these yellow lines roads, I
guess-- which of these roads

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.840
would be unusable if I can't
go to B or to C?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.540
Well, let me mark the
unusable roads.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.940
Well, the unusable roads would
be the roads that their only

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.510
purpose is to get to B or go
away from B, or get to C or go

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.300
away from C.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.230
So, for example, this road right
here, all it does is go

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.310
towards B or go away from B, so
we can't use that because

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.860
we're not going to
go through B.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.500
Similarly, we can't use that
road, can't use this road, and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.570
we can't use this road, right?

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660
Because those are all the roads
that come to and from B.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.690
So we're not going
to use those.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.050
The only reason why you would
use those roads is if you went

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.460
through B, so you
can't use those.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.410
And similarly for C, same thing,
you can't use that one,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.440
can't use that one, can't
use that one, and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.340
can't use that one.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.400
So what are we left with?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.460
We might as well just erase
those roads, right?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.220
Because they're kind of just
messing up the picture, right?

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.660
So let me just erase them.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.190
So let me erase all the roads
that I can't use.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.960
I can't use any of these
because I can't go

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.470
through B or C.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.680
And then it's going to start
looking a lot clearer.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.150
Then the problem gets
really easy.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.660
So these are all the roads I
can use to go from A to D.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.110
So how many paths are there?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.230
Well, that's one path, one.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.310
I can do this.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.840
Two paths.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.120
Three paths.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.950
Four paths.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.500
And that's choice B.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.800
I hope I'm right.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.470
At least my choice exists.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:23.380
Problem number six, if 3/7 of
n is 42-- so if I write that

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.230
algebraically, that's just
saying 3/7 times

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.700
n is equal to 42.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.260
And they want to know what
5/7 of n is, so they

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.510
want to know 5/7n.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.810
Well, to solve for n here, I
just multiply both sides times

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.852
the reciprocal.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.110
So let me do that.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.190
So 7 over 3-- I'm just
multiplying both sides of the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.190
equation by 7 over 3.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.850
So this cancels out, right?

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.500
So we could say n is equal
to 7 over 3 times 42.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.440
And now we want to know 5/7
times n, so we just take this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.830
n, place it here.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.980
So it'd be 5/7 times
this thing-- right?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.510
This is n-- times 7
over 3, times 42.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.140
And notice, I just kept it that
way because the 7's ended

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.300
up cancelling out, so I have
to do less arithmetic.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.750
So scratch those out.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.529
And then let's see, five times
42 over 3-- let's see, what's

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.020
42 divided by 3?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.550
It's what?

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.880
14, right?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.000
Because 30 and 12.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.030
Right, it's 14.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.960
So this goes to 1, this goes to
14, and 5 times 14 is 70.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.520
And that is choice A.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.560
So all you do is you can
just solve for n and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.555
then multiply by 5/7.

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.310
It's not too fancy.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.580
This is probably one just to see
how fast can you do this

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.722
type of problem.

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:52.310
OK, clear image, invert.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.910
All right, I'm on problem
number seven

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.340
and I'm getting sleepy.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.460
I'm just going to go to
bed after this video.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.980
All right, the figure
above-- well, let me

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.990
draw the figure above.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:13.625
We have that, and then we don't
know what this figure is

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:14.875
for, just yet.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:28.440
And then they say A,
B, C, D, E, and F.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.440
And now let's read
the problem.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.980
The figure above shows the top
view of an open square box

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.120
that is is divided into six
compartments with walls of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.050
equal height.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.300
Each of the rectangles D, E, and
F have twice the area of

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.250
each of the equal squares
A, B, and C.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.820
So they're saying D is twice the
area of A, I guess, right?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.820
The way I drew it, it looks
like a little more, but we

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.670
know this is twice the
area of this, OK.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.600
When a marble is dropped into
the box at random-- so it's

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.850
kind of being dropped from above
into this box-- it falls

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.910
into one of the compartments.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.060
What is the probability
that it will fall

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.780
into compartment F?

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.040
So the way you really just have
to think about it, the

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.720
marble has an equal
chance of falling

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.630
anywhere on this square.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.200
And so, if you want to know the
probability that it falls

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.300
into F, you just have to figure
out the fraction of the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.470
area that F is of the
entire square.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.634
So if we said that A has an area
of x, then B also has an

00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:39.240
area of x, and C also has an
area of x, and they told us

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.110
that these are twice these, so
this would be 2x, this would

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.300
be 2x, and this would
be 2x, so the total

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.780
area would be what?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.130
It would be x plus x, plus x.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.410
So 3x plus 2x, plus
2x, plus 2x.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.880
So these three are 6x, so the
total area is 9x, right?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.590
9x is the total area
of the box.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.370
I mean, we don't know how big x
is, but 9x is its total area

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.670
of the box.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.740
And F is 2x, right?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.200
F is 2x.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:17.170
So the area of F over total
area-- I don't like this

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.690
toothpaste blue color,
but we'll deal.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.850
So the area of F, I wrote
here before I

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.900
scratched it out, is 2x.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.630
Over the total area is 9x,
and the x's cancel out.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.660
So F is 2/9 of this total box's
area, so there's a 2/9

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.710
probability that a marble
dropped randomly on top of

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.990
this box, with kind of a uniform
distribution anywhere

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.480
in the box, there's a 2/9
chance that it will

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.640
fall into cubby E.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.375
Sorry, cubby F, that's what they
asked us in the question.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:52.750
And actually, it would also be
2/9 that it would fall into

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.390
cubby hole E, because
it's the same area.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.130
Problem number eight.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:04.380
So if a and b are odd integers,
which of the

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.650
following must also
be an odd integer?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.590
Oh, these are fun.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:18.270
All right, so choice one they
give is a plus 1 times b.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.740
Well, can this be odd?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.250
Let's just try it with
some numbers.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.870
Let's say a and b are
3 and 5, right?

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.380
These are two odd integers.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:35.120
If a 3, then a plus 1 is 4,
times 5, this equals 20.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.000
So we immediately, we ended
up getting an even answer.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.640
And that makes sense, because if
you take an odd number, add

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.990
1, you get an even number.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.490
And anything times an even is
even, so it's not going to be

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.680
choice one.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.110
Choice one is going to give us
an even number, actually, no

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.300
matter what.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.550
Choice two.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.260
a plus 1 plus b.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.480
So we figured out that a plus
1, this is going to be even,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.750
and we know that b is odd.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.450
And you could try this out, but
if you take an even number

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.350
and you were to add an odd
number to it, you're going to

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.880
get an odd number.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.890
And that makes sense, I mean,
you could try it out with a

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.300
bunch of different numbers,
but that's

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.410
always going to happen.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.250
Because if you add an even
number to an even number you

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.140
get another even number.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.950
And then if you add one more,
an odd number-- I think you

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.730
get the point.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.160
And you could try it out with
our 3 and 5 examples.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.210
That wouldn't prove it for sure,
but it does work for

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.760
that example.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.880
And then similarly,
a plus 1 minus b.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.850
It's the same notion.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.980
I mean, you could try it
out with some numbers.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.340
But if you have an even number
here-- because an odd plus 1

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:54.420
is even-- and then if you were
to subtract another odd

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.490
number, you'd also get
an odd number.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.770
So the choice is E.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.310
See you soon.
