00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.800

afternoon and greetings.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.720
I'm Pam Jackson and I am the newly

We're continuing on

from the Black Arts Movement to
Cave Canem and we welcome you

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.360
to this afternoon's panel.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.380
I'm going to mention first that
the symposium today is sponsored

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.080
by the Library of Congress
Poetry and Literature Center.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.710
It's a very important component
of the Center for the Book

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.470
with a mission to foster and
enhance the public's appreciation

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.160
of poetry and literature.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.910
To read about the Poetry
and Literature Center,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.910

please feel free to visit us on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.590

Series, the PEN/Faulkner Foundation,
and the Cave Canem Foundation.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780
Thank you to each of you
for your collaboration

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.950
and your partnership
for today's event.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.710
So this morning, we presented
a fabulous master class

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.560
in children's literature,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.830
and we want to thank the cosponsor
responsible for this class,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.230
which was the organization
We Need Diverse Books,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.420
and we also offer a special thanks
to Kwame Alexander for working

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.900
with the Poetry and Literature
Center to develop the symposium.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.980
So this afternoon, let's get
ready for this conversation.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.850
It's an amazing and exciting
two panels that we'll have,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.380
Writing Across Genre
and Organizing Founders.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.300
You can read more about
our panelists

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.400
and moderators in your
print program.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800
And there are two print
programs that --

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.690
that should be your seat
and if you need one,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320
perhaps you can just wave your hand
and we can have somebody bring it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.220
over to you if you
didn't get them there.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.530
One for our two o'clock
that's beginning now

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.210
and one for the 3:30 panel.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.150
We're honored to feature such
prominent poets and writers,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.530
as well as founders and
leaders from across the country.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
All are here to help us better
understand the enduring influence

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.360 position:56%
of black -- of the Black Arts
Movement started half a century ago.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.060
Each panel will include
brief introductions

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.370
by the participants followed
by a moderated discussion.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.590
We'll leave time at the end
of each panel for questions

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.140
and there will be a short
break in between the panels.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.030
Before we begin, though,
I do have a few logistics.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.230
We would like to encourage
all of us to be undistracted.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.850
So if you could check that
your phones are on vibrate

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.670
and any other electronic devices
that may chime while we're here.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.430
Also, please note, this
event is being video-taped

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.010
for future webcast by the Library.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.060
And by participating
in the Q and A session,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.630
you give the Library
permission to include you

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.770
in future audio and webcasts.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.790
And to conclude, we will have a
book signing after the panel talks

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.340
and we'll direct you to that
location at the end of the talks.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.410
So please join me in
welcoming the participants

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.660
of the first panel,
Writing Across Genre.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.170
We'll -- we'll have moderator,
Marita Golden, Marilyn Nelson,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.540 position:56%
Tony Medina, Rachel Eliza Griffiths.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.510
Please give us a warm
hand for our panel.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:09.780
[ Applause ]

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.720
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Thank you Pam.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.670
I'm Marita Golden.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.980
I am the Cofounder
and President Emeritus

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.630
of the Hurston/Wright
Foundation and I was --

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.710
I feel a wonderful connection
with this program today

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.020
and with these panelists because
I am old enough and young enough

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.440
to remember having been there at
the birth of Black Arts Movement,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.100 position:56%
to have had Mickey Giovanni choose
one of my poems when I was a student

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.410
at American University to be
published in an anthology,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.030
to have had Audrey Lord and June
Jordan when I was young, gifted,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.780
and black in the early '70s in New
York City look at my poetry and say

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.130
that I should keep writing.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.480
And the only reason I'm not a
poet today is because I felt

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.770
that poetry was not big enough
for the stories I wanted to tell

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.010
which means, the problem was
not poetry, the problem was me.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.840
Because for poets, there's no such
thing as the structure or the form

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.200
of poetry being too small
so that in my case, fiction

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.640
and non-fiction called me.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.510
I'm also glad to be
here today because,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.390
at the Hurston/Wright
Foundation, we've been very honored

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:47.220
that we have recognized and honored
so many of the fantastic poets

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.610
that Cave Canem has nurtured,
produced, and created.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.660
Toi Derricotte has
received our North Star

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.180 position:56%
and Cornelius Eady has been a member
of our summer workshop faculty,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.170
so I feel a real connection
to today's topic,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.750
today's people, and to the panel.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.550
So I will introduce everyone

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.180
and then they will make
their presentations

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.720
and we'll have a wonderful
discussion.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.140
To my left is my new buddy,
Rachel Eliza Griffiths,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.810
who's a poet and visual artist.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.230
Her most recent collection of
poetry, "Lighting the Shadow,"

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.840
was published by Four
Way Books in 2015.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.310
A Kimbilio and Cave
Canem fellow, her visual

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.310
and Lib Hub, and many others.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.210
She teaches at the Institute
of American Indian Arts

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.330
and Sarah Lawrence College,
and she lives in Brooklyn.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.690
Next to Rachel is Tony Medina
who's a two-time winner

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.870

and "I and I Bob Marley."

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.290

His latest anthology is "Resisting
Arrest," poems to stretch the sky.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.080
Tony is a professor
of creating writing --

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.340
creative writing at
Howard University.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.440
And Marilyn Nelson is the author

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.040

I Discovered Poetry."

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.310 position:56%

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.680
I love that book, Marilyn --

and she was the Poet

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.430

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.510
Let's give everyone a hand.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.660
So I think we're going to start
the presentations with Eliza.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.770
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths:
Good afternoon.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:37.510
It's a very large gift to be
here with all of you today.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.130
Thank you so much for this
dialogue and this conversation.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.760
And to sit in the presence of these
celebrated poets and dear friends

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.500
and family really to
me is -- is so much.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.560 position:56%
I'd like to start with a piece of
writing as I'm thinking about family

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.800
and thinking of my brothers
and sisters in Orlando,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.610
I'd like to read this piece of
an excerpt from Toni Morrison's,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.540
"Beloved," and I -- I'm
interested when I think

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.080
about the Black Arts
Movement, thinking of Morrison

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.390
and her role as an editor.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.530
And then I'll read a
poem by Henry Dumas.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.760
And Morrison was very
influential in making sure

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.460
that Henry Dumas's work
reached the world in a way --

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.510
he was killed very young,
murdered by the police,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.950
and so I'll read a poem of his
and I'll read a poem of mine.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:38.410 position:56%
And then I will share a video that I
created as part of the conversation

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:43.740
of Black Poets Speak Out in terms
of activism, and that poem is by --

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.930
a visual poem that I made about
Amiri Baraka's poem, "Incident."

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.940
But first Morrison.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:59.300
In this here place, we flesh;
flesh that weeps, laughs;

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:05.290
flesh that dances on
bare feet in grass.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.180
Love it. Love it hard.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.540
Yonder they do not love your flesh.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.840
They despise it.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.910
They don't love your eyes;
they'd just as soon pick 'em out.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.620
No more do they love
the skin on your back.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.570
Yonder, they flay it.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:30.010
And oh my people, they
do not love your hands.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:37.030
Those they only use, tie, bind,
chop off, and leave empty.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.700
Love your hands!

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.000
Love them.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.030
Raise them up and kiss them.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.720
Touch others with them.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.220
Pat them together.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.150
Stroke them on your face 'cause
they don't love that either.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.880
You got to love it.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.090
You! And no, they ain't
in love with your mouth.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.810
Yonder, out there, they will see
it broken and break it again.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.550
What you say out of
it, they will not heed.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.280
What you scream from
it, they do not hear.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.270
What you put into it to nourish
your body, they will snatch away

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.300
and give you leavin's instead.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.220
No, they don't love your mouth.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.310
You got to love it.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.950
This is flesh I'm talking
about here.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.100
Flesh that needs to be loved.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.030
Feet that need to rest and to
dance; backs that need support;

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:38.760
shoulders that need arms --
strong arms I'm telling you.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.280
And oh my people out
yonder, hear me,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.460
they do not love your neck
unnoosed and straight.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.660 position:56%
So love your neck; put a hand on it,
grace it, stroke it, and hold it up

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:02.210
and all your inside parts that
they'd just as soon slop for hogs.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.870
You got to love them.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.120
The dark, the dark liver --
love it, love it, and the beat

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.580
and beating heart, love that, too.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.850
More than eyes or feet,
more than lungs that have

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.800
yet to draw free air, more
than your life-holding womb

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.280
and your life-giving private parts,
hear me now, love your heart.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.590
For this is the prize.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.890
For Orlando.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.130
This poem is by Henry Dumas,
"The Coming of Eagles."

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.190
Let us have eagles.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.530
Let us have eagles among my people.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.750
The hot wind has melted
ice and the ice has fallen.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.760
The cold wind has chiseled
mountains and they have fallen.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:04.770
The dry wind has gnawed away
stone and stone is sand.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.830
The cruel winds have cut
feathers, skin, and bones

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.590
and the sparrows have died.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.140
Let us have new wings
among my people.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.600
Let us have bones among my people.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.450 position:56%
Let us have visions among my people.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:31.240
Let us ride the wind
into the high country.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.580
Let us have eagles.

And this is a -- a poem of mine from
a chat book that I had this poem

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.330
and some other poems
included in recently thinking

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.190
about Langston Hughes and kind
of The Negro Speaks of Rivers,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.510
which I think is interesting to --

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.650
to think about Hughes and
the Harlem Renaissance as --

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.550
as pre-kind of forefathers and
mothers of Black Arts Movement.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.210
Aubade to Langston.

When the light wakes and finds again
the music of brooms in Mississippi,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:18.920
Africa, Mexico; when daylight
pulls our hands from grief,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.720
and hearts cleaned raw with sawdust

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.840 position:56%
and saltwater flood their dazzling
vessels; when the catfish towards --

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.260
when the catfish in the river raise
their eyelids towards your face;

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.980
when sweetgrass bends in waves
across battlefields where sweat

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.890
and sugar marry; when we hear
our people wearing tongues fine

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:50.860
with plain greeting, how you doing,
good morning; when I pour coffee

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.780
and remember my mother's
love of buttered grits;

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.370
when the trains far
away in memory begin

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:04.400
to turn their engines toward a deep
past of knowing; when all I want

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.070
to do is burn my masks;
when I see a woman walking

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.340
down the street holding her
mind like a leather belt;

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.930
when I pluck a blues note for
my lazy shadow and cast its soul

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:26.860
from my page; when I see God's eyes
looking up at black folks flying

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:33.310
between moonlight &amp; museum;
when I see a good-looking people

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:39.630
who are my truest poetry; when I
pick up this pencil like a flute

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.700
and blow myself away from my death,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:50.510
I listen to you again beneath the
mercy of a blue morning's grammar.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.220 position:56%
And then, the last poem of mine that
I'll read is just one part of a --

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.670
a two -- a two-part poem
called, "Elegy," and there's an

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:13.050
"Anti-Elegy," and I imagine these
two parts of the poem being,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.050
as a visual artist, a dip
tick, and so there's one panel

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.850
and then there's another panel,
and together, they make a vision.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.460
And so the part that I'm going to
read from is an ancestral voice

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.380
and so there is an
element, too, of call

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.610
and response which
is the anti-elegy.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.470
But I'm just going to
read the first part.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:38.120
Elegy. I remember the black
boys and their open hands.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.060
High fives of farewell.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.290
I remember that the
birches waved, too,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:50.530
the white jagged limbs turning
away from incessant wildfires.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.280
The future wavered,
unlike a question,

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.860
unlike a hand or headstone.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.390
The future moved and the
fields already knew it.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.730
I remember the war of the alphabet,
its ears sliced from its face.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.250 position:56%
I know that language asks for blood.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:16.380
The children of kudzu, lilac,
the spit of unknown rivers.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.200
I remember the jury and
the judge of the people,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.740
the buckshot that blew the
morning's torso into smoke.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.980
That last morning, I
begged the grandmothers

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.740
to leave their rage
next to red candles.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.900
I scattered the stones
the trees bore.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.880
Great vultures came for my children
and black boys were pouring,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.330
wanted and unwanted, and
missing, yet from the long mouth

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.150
where their voices were forced
to say they were nothing.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.450
But they were men,
invisible, and native

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.910
and guilty beyond their
glottal doubt.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:03.780 position:56%
I remember calling out to the savage
fields where more black boys knelt

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.750
and swung through the air.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:12.110
I remember how their eyes rolled
back in blood, milk, and gasoline.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.060
They gave me their last words.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.220
They gave me smiles
for their fathers.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:25.310
They slept in my arms, dead and
bruised, long as the brambles,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:30.620
the bullets in their heads and
groins quieting like a day.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.520 position:56%
I held their million heads in my lap

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.130
when their black bodies
were taken away.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.420
I don't know if what's
left will dance or burn.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.430
I washed their eyelids with mint.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:48.950
Let God beg pardon to them and
their mothers, and I don't know

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.000
if the body is a pendulum
of where love cannot go

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.670
when the tongue is swollen
with the milk of black boys.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.020
I pulled their lives from the
trees and lawns and schools,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.200
the unlit houses, and the river,
their forewings wet with clouds

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.860
and screaming, but
I won't leave them.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.870
I won't leave them huddled

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.950
like bulls inside the
stalls of our words.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.940
I am the shriek, the suture,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:26.450
the rose petal shook
loose from their silence.

to press a magical button
and -- I will say there is --

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.170
it is graphic, but I was -- I made
this for Black Poets Speak Out

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.300
and because I -- I felt I could
not speak, I felt so silenced,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.850
and I feel silenced today, in
a way, but I am going to speak.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.750
And so this video is a way for me,
as a poet, to also speak visually

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.080
about what is happening
in this country

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.630
and how we're really failing
each other and our future.

America, you have too many guns and
too much anger and too many TV shows

He ordered them to kill
me, kill me, kill me now.

They lit him up with
nine rounds till blood

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:01.890
One of my heroes is the
late, great Jayne Cortez.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.470
Her passing just threw
me for a loop.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.050
I just could not believe
that she passed so soon.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:13.310
Of course, I devoured all of her
work and I was just fortunate

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:19.770
to meet her and befriend her
and she supported my work.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.640
And she was just a
beautiful, incredible poet.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.130
This is called, "Give
me the Red on the Black

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.110 position:56%
of the Bullet for Claude Reece, Jr."

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:38.780 position:56%
Bring back the life of Claude Reece,
Jr. I want the bullet from his head

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.780
to make a Benin bronze,
to make an explosion

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.360
of thunder, to make a cyclone.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.130
I want the 14 years of Claude
Reece, Jr., shot on the 15th day

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.140
of September, shot in
the back of his head,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:59.530
shot by a police officer,
shot for being black.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:06.030
Give me the black on the red of the
bullet, I want to make a tornado,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.350
to make an earthquake, to make a
fleet of stilts for the blackness

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.710
of Claude Reece, Jr., the
blackness called dangerous weapon,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.210
called resisting an arrest,
called nigger threat.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:23.300
I want the life of the blackness of
Claude Reece, Jr. I want the bullet

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.150
from his head to make a protective
staff for startled children,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.020
to make hooks and studs
for warrior masks.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:37.700 position:56%
Give me the bullet with the odor and
the smoke and the skin and the hair

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.590
of Claude Reece, Jr.
I want to make power,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.160
to make power for the
blackness of Claude Reece, Jr.,

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.720
the blackness called
pent-up frustration,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.970
called unidentified negro,
called nigger revolutionary.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.740
I want the life of the blackness of
Claude Reece, Jr. I want the bullet

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.590
from his head to make a protective
staff for startled children,

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.280
to make a Benin bronze,
to make an explosion

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.550
of thunder, to make a cyclone.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.230
I want the bullet to bring
back the blood of Claude Reece,

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.580
Jr. I want to make justice.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.230
I want to make justice for
the blackness of Claude Reece,

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.900
Jr. Bring back the bullet with
the blood of the blackness

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.710
of Claude Reece, Jr. I
want to make justice.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.150
I want to make justice for
the blackness of Claude Reece,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:40.390 position:56%
Jr. And last, I want to read this
poem -- another one by Jayne Cortez.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:47.170
If the drum is a woman, why
are you pounding your drum

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.240
into an insane babble?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.310
Why are you pistol
whipping your drum at dawn?

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:57.670
Why are you shooting
through the head of your drum

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.440
and making a drum tragedy of drums?

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.670
If the drum is a woman,
don't abuse your drum,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:08.110
don't abuse your drum,
don't abuse your drum.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.140
I know the night is full
of displaced persons.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.450
I see skins striped with flames.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.430
I know the ugly disposition
of underpaid clerks,

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.050
they constantly menstruate
through the eyes.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:24.750 position:56%
I know bitterness embedded in flesh,

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.780
the itching alone can
drive you crazy.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.740
I know that this is America
and chickens are coming home

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.320
to roost on -- on the MX missile.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.540
But if the drum is a woman,
why are you choking your drum?

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.450
Why are you raping your drum?

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.420
Why are you saying disrespectful
things to your mother drum,

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.820
your sister drum, your wife drum,
and your infant daughter drum?

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.440
If the drum is a woman,
then understand your drum.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.990
Your drum is not docile.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.290
Your drum is not invisible.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.470
Your drum is not inferior to you.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:01.770
Your drum is a woman.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:07.630
So don't reject your drum,
don't try to dominate your drum,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:12.910
don't become weak and cold and
desert your drum, don't be forced

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.830
into the position as
an oppressor of drums

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:21.440
and make a drum tragedy of drums.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:28.800
If the drum is a woman, don't abuse
your drum, don't abuse your drum,

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.600
don't abuse your drum,
drum, drum, drum, drum.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:45.070
[ Applause ]

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:50.490
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I
was just telling Tony

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.610
that I can't follow him at all.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.910
[Laughter].

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.210
I'm -- I'm really pleased
to be here.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:03.540
I don't have anything really to add
to what Rachel and Tony have said

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.270
about what's happening in
this country right now.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:13.500
It's -- it's -- well,
as the Chinese curses,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.960
my you live in interesting times.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:23.510
These are truly terrifyingly
interesting times.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:30.340
I'm going to read two
poems by Amiri Baraka.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:36.790 position:56%
I'm the oldest person on the panel,
so I'm the only one here who can say

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.420
that Amiri Baraka, his book,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.450
"Preface to a Twenty Volume
Suicide Note," was the first book

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:49.660
of poems I bought for myself.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:58.600
I was a freshman in college,
1964, and I was blown away.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.870
So I'm going to read a -- a couple

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:07.460
of early Baraka poems written
basically during the time he was

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.480
still LeRoi Jones.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.600
He was struggling with
the question of how

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.560
to apply this gift he knew
he had, how to apply it

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:27.620
to fight the interestingness
of the period he was living in.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.220
And I'm going to read "I Substitute

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:35.390
for the Dead Lecturer"
as an epigraph.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:40.250
What is most precious
because it is lost.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:47.010
What is lost because
it is most precious.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.310
They have turned, and
say that I am dying,

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.360
that I have thrown my life away.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:03.050
They have left me alone where there
is no one, nothing save who I am.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:07.730
Not a note nor a word.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:15.660
Cold air batters the poor, and
their minds turn open like sores.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.230
What kindness, what
wealth can I offer?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:26.860
Except what is, for me, ugliest.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:33.490
What is for me, shadows,
shrieking phantoms.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.200
Except they have need of life.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.600
Flesh at least, should be theirs.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.190
The Lord has saved me to do this.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:49.420
The Lord has made me strong.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:55.170
I am as I must have myself.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:37:01.590
Against all thought, all
music, all my soft loves.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:10.830
For all these wan roads I am pushed
to follow, are my own conceit.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.810
A simple muttering elegance,
slipped in my head pressed

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.480
on my soul, is my heart's worth.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.080
And I am frightened that the flame

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:31.680
of my sickness will burn off
my face, and leave the bones,

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:43.760
my stewed black skull,
an empty cage of failure.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:52.330
I was so moved by the sense of
fear in that poem taking the risk

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.490
of standing up against injustice.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.260
This is another early Baraka poem.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.350
It's called, "Jitterbugs."

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.580
The imperfection of
the world is a burden

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.580
if you know it, think
about it, at all.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:16.520
Look up in the sky wishing you were
free, placed so terribly in time,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:24.050
mind out among new stars, working
propositions, and not this planet

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:28.740
where you can't go anywhere
without an awareness

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.590
of the hurt the white man
has put on the people.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.380
Any people.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:42.020
You can't escape, there's
nowhere to go.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:50.620
They have made this star
unsafe, and this age, primitive.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:56.510
Though your mind is somewhere
else, your ass ain't.

[ Soft Laughter and Talking ]

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.150
I read a -- a couple of mine.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.910
It seemed to me reading the "I
Substitute for the Dead Lecturer,"

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:17.660
that what Baraka had done was
to create a persona for himself.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.250
He created this persona, the dead
lecturer, and then he killed it.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.340 position:56%
And then he emerged, his truer self.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.440
And the freedom to create a persona
like that instead of speaking

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.410
in his own voice has
stayed with me as --

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:43.450
as an idea of what
we can do as writers.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:48.330
So I -- I read a couple of poems
written in different personas.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:53.800
This poem is -- it's
based on a slave narrative

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.580
that was published in 1798.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:01.890 position:56%
It's the narrative of the life of
Venture Smith who was born in Guinea

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:09.870
in 1729 and was captured as a
child, brought to North America,

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.190
served for about 30 years
in slavery in Connecticut,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.860
New York, and Rhode Island.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.800
And -- so what I -- what I
did is write a book based

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.050
on Venture's narrative, so it's a
-- it's a slave narrative in verse.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.590 position:56%
This is called "Keeper of the Keys."

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.970
It's dated 1740.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:38.120
What makes a man a
man is his good name.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.870
The rest of it is beyond
our control.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:46.530
Trustworthiness and honor
are riches no one can steal.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:53.340
Let men have faith in you,
hold true to your promise.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:41:01.120
My father's values were my sum and
substance during that cocoon year.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:08.850
From freedom to a new world was
one year of grief, shock, sorrow,

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.380
and learning my new name

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:16.690
and master's language,
but not master's values.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.670
Here, at least, was
something I could control.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:27.260
Here, there was a true essential
eye which only I could own.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.570
Here were my riches.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:35.460
In Barbados, the surviving
unpurchased riches were barbered,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.010
washed, and oiled.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:43.570 position:56%
After a year of misery and
homeward yearning, they were marched

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:49.680
to market, sold, and given new
names, their present strength

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.530
and their futures under
white control,

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:59.390
their traditional beliefs
toppled under Christian values.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:05.500
I was nine years old and
filled with my father's values

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.680
when we reached Rhode Island.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.430
From there, my master's
riches sailed to his home,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:18.300
his keys under my control, while
he disembarked for business.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.390
For a year, I had practiced,
become true virtue,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.610
bring honor to your name.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:33.360
Now, I promised my master his
keys would be safe with me.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.480
At master's home, his father
ordered me to give him the keys

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.790
as there were some things of
value among master's thing

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.110
which were purchased in his name.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.900
I told him, my master had
trusted me with his riches.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.080
I had promised to keep them safe.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:59.720
After a year of becoming,
I emerged, I took control.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:07.100
My master's father threatened, but
I controlled the keys concealed

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.300
in my shirt or under
me while I slept,

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.570
more watchfully than
I'd slept all year.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.670
When at last my master
unpacked his things of value,

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.770
he told his father he would
trust me with all his riches

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:27.360
because where I come from, a
man is as good as his name.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:33.280
What value has a man
beyond his name?

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.710
Can he control his fate?

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.940
Know his death year?

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:45.510
He is richest whose
honor outlives him.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:52.290
[ Applause ]

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.590
Thank you.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:58.530
I -- I just read one -- one more.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.740
The -- another persona
I've picked up is George --

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:05.620
George Washington Carver,
and I'll just read.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.360
No, excuse me.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.510
I'm going to read a poem
in the voice of Carver.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.730
Well --

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.520
Well, I'm going to read
one that's kind of, maybe,

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.700
I don't know if it will work today.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.400
But Carver was a very
deeply religious person.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:44.690
He taught a Bible class once a week
at Tuskegee for the entire duration

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:49.640
of his teaching at Tuskegee
which was almost 50 years.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.200
He -- the -- the Bible study
class started in a small classroom

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.670
and within a few years, it was in
the largest lecture hall on campus.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.630
It lasted about 15 minutes.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.580
There are a couple
of collections of --

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.820
of Carver's teachings
remembered by students.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.250
And this is one of his --
one of Carver's teachings,

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:16.040
which may be relevant
to the events in Orlando

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.710
and to the horrible police murders.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:24.770
This is how Carver taught
people to deal with them.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.090
The poem is called, "Goliath."

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.890
And it's -- it's about a
period when there were a lot

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.920
of lynchings in the south.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.870
Another lynching.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.570
Madness grips the south.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:44.630
A black man's hacked off penis in
his mouth, his broken body torched.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:50.780
The terrorized blacks cower
and the whites are satanized.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:56.310
His students ask in Carver's
Bible class, where is God now?

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.870
What does he want from us?

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.790
Professor Carver smiles.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:06.100
God is right here.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.320
Don't lose contact with him.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.190
Don't yield to fear.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:19.160
Fear is the root of hate
and hate destroys the hater.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.540
When Saul's army went to
war against the Philistines,

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:29.160
the Israelites lost contact,
fearful of Goliath's might.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:36.690
When we lose contact, we see
only hate, only injustice,

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:41.830
a giant so great it's
shadow blocks our son.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.760
But David slew Goliath with
the only things he knew,

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.330
the slingshot of intelligence
and one pebble

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:57.060
of truth, and the battle was done.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:03.940
We kill Goliath by going about
the business of the universal good

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:10.420
which our Creator wills, obediently
yielding to Him the opportunity

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:15.740
to work wonders through us
for all of His children.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.270
That's all.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:21.890
Read 1 Samuel 17:47.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.510
Thank you.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:36.850
[ Applause ]

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.270
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: I'd like to
thank each of you individually

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:43.660
and collectively for an
extraordinary reading.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.510
Let's give them another hand.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:52.570
[ Applause ]

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.910
And Rachel, you -- you had
the wisdom of a 80-year old.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.210
I mean, that was some [laughter],

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.560
you were channeling an
enormous amount of wisdom there.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.500
And Tony, yeah -- Baraka
was smiling.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.690
Baraka's smiling.

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:13.360
And Marilyn, I think that --
you know, when we have these --

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.040
these readings like this and
the artists come together,

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.930
there's a beautiful synchronicity.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.990
And there was a beautiful
synchronicity to the way we began

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.170
and to the way we ended,
and I thank you Marilyn

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.280
for ending with that poem.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.600
I think it was perfect.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:36.380
So we're going to talk a little
bit about the Black Arts Movement

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:41.400
and also as writers
writing across genres.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.950
And I wanted to start the
conversation by asking you each

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.780
to talk a little bit about
the Black Arts Movement.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.150
And I think it's wonderful that,
you know, we have different ages

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.010
and -- and experiences here.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:02.550
As -- as an inspiration and
as an artistic influence,

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:07.770
what did the Black Arts
Movement mean to you

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.700
and I think we can also think of
the Black Arts Movement as dynamic

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.600
and vibrant and still
living with us here today.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:20.440
I know for me, as someone who
was just beginning to think

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:28.670
about the possibility of being
a writer, it meant to me power

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:31.580
because the -- the
movement was so connected

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.420
to the Black Power Movement and
the political changes of the time.

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:44.410
It meant to me audacity, democracy,
that anybody could write a poem,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:49.270
anybody could write a powerful
poem, anybody could be a writer.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:53.620
And particularly listening to
the poems that we heard, it --

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:59.340
it meant to me that many of
the most difficult and taboo

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.680
and marginalized emotions that we

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.870
as an oppressed people
could actually be the center

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.980
of our artistic endeavors.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.900
Eliza, you want to start for us?

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.200
What does it mean, you know,

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.510
that's those are some
things it meant to me, but.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.810
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths: Sure.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:21.880
In the moment, I'm thinking
of the Black Arts Movement

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.510
in terms of -- of lineage for me.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:31.370
As -- as an emerging poet, the
Black Arts Movement for me kind

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.830
of collages a lineage of
justice, a lineage of power --

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.270 position:56%
that word, I think is very resonant.

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:43.340
But also for me a lineage
of imagination that resisted

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:48.790
and pushed away from the white
gaze and turned its look inward

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:53.000
on its own, you know, black and
brown skin, and what was at stake

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.150
for black lives, black history,
black culture, black music,

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.970
black art, all of these
different spaces of embodiment

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.510
and disembodiment within
this country.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:09.720
And so, as an emerging poet,
looking, you know, backwards

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.810
and also trying to look ahead about
what will poetry be like for me

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:18.810
or my identity, my
experience, I feel very grateful

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:28.780 position:56%
that there was this movement that --

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:38.240
that really changed the energy
of what had come before it

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.670
in very defiant unapologetic terms.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:46.460
And I -- I like the funkiness
of it, I like the texture of it,

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:50.490
the wildness of it, for
me, especially as --

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.710 position:56%
as a poet who does different genres.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.410
Like, you can be anything.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.580
You don't need permission, you
don't need authority, you know,

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.220
open up the door and get
it yourself, you know.

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.480
And -- and for me, those poets are
about getting it for themselves

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.580
and using that oppressive
language in a way that said, no.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:18.330
And, you know, thinking of moments
when I have been in a room with --

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:23.040
with Amiri Baraka or am fortunate
enough to be in the presence

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.480
of Sister Sonya and so many
other poets from that time

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.430 position:56%
and to see them even now, there is a
great feeling of legacy and lineage.

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.320
So I'll -- I'll pause.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.810
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: The great
poet, James Brown, said,

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.070
open up the door, I'll
get it myself.

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.120
[ Laughter ]

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.480
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths:
That's exactly right.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.780
That's exactly right.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.080
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: And, you know,

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.730
it's like Black Lives Matter
could be a poem from that period.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:50.030
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths: Exactly.

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:51.330
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: You know.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:52.630
It could just be a poem.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:53.930
It could be a stanza.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:55.230
It could be a title.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.030
Yeah. So that, you know,

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.610
the movement is still
articulate and inspiring people.

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.360
Tony.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.950
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: I see it
in two different ways.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.940
I see it personally on one hand.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.420
I also see it in the
more philosophical way.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:16.380
The Black Arts Movement to me, it
begins on the continent of Africa,

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.670
you know, as people are
getting abducted and kidnapped

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.630
and being placed, you know, in --

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:27.760
in chains, on the slave
ships, you know.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.790
Then it comes onto the land, then
you get Phyllis Wheatley and --

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.450
and Hammond and all these folks.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:38.150
Then, of course, you have
that big tremendous flowering

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.620
with the Harlem Renaissance Period

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.030
or the New Negro Movement,
as they call it.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:49.160 position:56%
So that's where the grounding starts
to begin, and I don't really see it

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.850
as a movement unto itself,
but a continuum, you know,

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.690
it's like the struggle continues.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:54:00.900
The art is always continuing
and it's always, you know.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.920
Like I tell my students at Howard,

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.630
if you read -- and
this is just poetry.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.320
We're not talking about all of the
black arts, because it's bigger

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.630
than just the poetry
and -- and the fiction.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:19.450
I tell them, if you read the
whole history of black poetry,

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:25.240 position:56%
you will get everything you need to
know in terms of history, sociology,

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.420 position:56%
you know, people's way of thinking
and how people respond to the times.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.250
But personally, to me, it begins

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:37.030
when I first started
reading, seriously.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.870
Because I didn't grow up with
books, I grew up in the projects.

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:43.370
In my household, nobody really
read except for my grandmother

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:48.150
who read the Bible and some
cheap paperback novels.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:52.010
So I didn't have any models
as Lucille Clifton would say.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.810
There were no models.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.110
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths:
I made it up.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:00.110
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: So it wasn't until
I really, you know, the 9th grade,

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:01.410
I fell in love with literature.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:04.860
I started reading, and
then some years after that,

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:10.360
I remember reading, "A Man Called
James Baldwin from Harlem."

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.080
Reading his essays
taught me how to write.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.110 position:56%
Literally, I -- I would study his
sentences which lasted a whole page.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.410
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Exactly.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:21.810
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: And that taught
me how to punctuate stuff.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.590
Not only did it teach me how to
write and how to use punctuation,

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.510
but the things that he
was saying, I said, wow,

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.410
that's how my family lives.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:33.250
That's how we -- that's
where -- where I come from.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:38.600
So it was reading James Baldwin
and -- I don't know about you guys,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.650
but I used to be one of these
kids that was, you know,

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:44.580
every time I got depressed, I
would end up in a bookstore.

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.130
That's why, you know, my --
my crib is like a library.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.850
So I remember one time going
into this bookstore which was

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.260
on Grand Central Station.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:56.690
It was both -- it had an
entranceway inside and outside

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:00.760
of the train station, on the street
and also in the subway system.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.490
And so I would go there and I
would just, from A through Z,

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.370
I would browse the poetry section.

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:14.410
And this one time, I'm browsing,
and there's this book faced out

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:21.060
and it's Langston Hughes, and he's
at his typewriter looking this way,

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.190
and I was like, whoa, that
looks my uncle such and such.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.360
[ Laughter ]

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:32.980
So to see, you know, a brown
face on the cover of a book,

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.410
it reminded of when Amiri was
browsing through the streets

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:40.000
of the village and he
sees in the bookstore one

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.210
of James Baldwin's books and he
sees Baldwin's face on the cover.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.950
And, you know, there's a
seismic shift that happens

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.570
in your whole psychology.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:51.880 position:56%
So it always begins with those guys.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:58.070
And then , I went into the
military to make money for college,

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:01.460
I get out, I go to Baruch College.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.980
And just as, you know, the
stars align and destiny

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.230
and all this stuff, I happen to
take a black literature course

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:14.750
by Addison Gayle, Jr., the chief
proponent of The Black Aesthetic.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:18.810
I didn't know that at the time,
of course, but he used to --

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:20.640
he used to hold court
in the classroom

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:25.000
and he would just name
drop like crazy.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.010
He's like, you know, Jimmy and I --

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.510
[ Laughter ]

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.730
Jimmy and I -- and I'm like,
holy shit, he know Jimmy Baldwin.

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:37.220
So I would run to the library
to find all of Addison's books

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.680
and take them out and
read them and stuff.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:45.660
And I would -- after class, I
would go to him and he, you know,

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.970
just ask him a thousand
questions, like,

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:49.270
you know, students do to me now.

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:54.050
And I was trying to start this
magazine once called writers --

00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:59.580
Voices of Color, and he said, Tony,
just tell me anybody you want.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.950
I know everybody.

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:03.470
I'll get you anybody.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:06.340
And I just asked him, who
are your favorite poets.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.780
He said, well I like Quincy,
but he's kind of cute sometimes.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.190
And I'm like -- this poetry's
kind of cute sometimes.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:15.510
Whoa. So I was getting all
the -- the -- the dirt.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:18.710
[ Laughter ]

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:27.460 position:56%
So, but in -- in -- in Gayle's
class, he assigned "The Black Poets"

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.100
by Dudley Randall, and
that became the bible

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.000
and that blew the brains out.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.330
And then that led to me
shifting to also, you know,

00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:38.710
include the Nuyorican
poets, and then the --

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.150
the Central American poets,
and the African poets,

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:43.600
and the Caribbean poets,
and on and on and on.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.520
So it's a very personal thing.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.080
I think that the Black
Arts is very foundational.

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.030
It's probably the most
revolutionary,

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.330
outside of the Harlem Renaissance,

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.960
the most revolutionary literary
movement in our country.

00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.260
I talk a lot.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.630
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: And
the great think of course

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:04.380
about reading Baldwin is not just
that he teaches you how to write,

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.800
but he teaches you how to think.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.100
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths: Yes.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.400
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: He really
teaches you how to think.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.700
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: Analyze.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.000
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Yeah.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.900
Yeah. And when you mentioned the
-- the book, "The Black Poets,"

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:19.210
Dwayne Betts, wonderful
memoirist and poet, talks about --

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:23.910
writes about being in
prison and becoming a poet

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:28.700
because one day they were shifting
books, you know, just on --

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:33.100
on the floor just between
cells, and one day he got --

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.980
he was sent "The Black
Poets" -- that collection.

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.820
And from that point on, prison
was just, you know, school.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.410
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: But -- but like
you said, James Baldwin, Langston,

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:50.300
the black arts poets and
writers, they did to me, you know,

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.920
they gave me a voice for what
I was thinking and feeling,

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.580
which I didn't have at the time.

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.780
And they gave me the permission
to say, you could do this

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:05.470
on the page and on the stage.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.770
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Marilyn.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.930
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I grew
up with Gwendolyn Brooks

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:18.000
who won the Pulitzer in about, when
was it -- 1950 -- 50-something.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.010
I -- I remember, I
was about -- pardon?

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.460
[ Inaudible Audience Response ]

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.760
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: '54.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.060
Thank you.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.950
So I -- I was about 10
at that time and my --

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:31.520
my father was in the Airforce
and we moved around a lot.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.640
And at that point, we
were stationed in --

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.950
he was stationed in New Hampshire
and we were living in a village

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.810
in Maine and all of our
neighbors said, Marilyn,

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.580
Gwendolyn Brooks just won
-- you're a poet, too.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.860
Everybody thought -- I --
I was writing poetry then,

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.620
but everybody sort of pushing
me to read Gwendolyn Brooks

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.990
so I had this model early.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:01:01.560
My -- and -- and I was encouraged
by my family, the -- my --

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.340
my father was interested
in poetry and wrote.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:12.060
And then, in our -- although
there were no collections of --

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:17.070
then it as negro -- poetry
in the school libraries

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.840
or public libraries
wherever we were,

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.470
I remember we had James
Weldon Johnson's Book

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:26.920
of American Negro Poetry
which I must have read --

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.510
I probably had a lot of
it memorized as a child.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:35.120
And then -- and then
I went off to college.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.650
That's where LeRoi
Jones happened to me.

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:42.090
And he really happened to me.

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:46.560
It was -- it was like riding a
horse and being struck by lightning

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.230
and falling off the horse because
he was doing something I had never

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:55.630
imagined a negro poet doing before.

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.330
I was just blown away.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:02.920
And then, after that, the Black
Arts Movement gave me other models,

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.370
like Heike [phonetic] and the
last poets and -- and what --

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.360
what they did with poetry,
for me, it was not --

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:20.280
not so much what they were saying
as it was how they were saying it.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.890
They were -- they were -- a lot
of those -- especially, Heike,

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:28.560
I must have heard him three times
during my four undergraduate years.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.100
And his readings were unlike
anything I had ever heard before.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.470
They were performative in ways
that I had never heard before.

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:48.180
So that was a very important
direction to be pushed in.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.130
I wanted to say one thing.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:54.190
My mother was always telling
people that I was a poet

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:57.060
from the time I was 12 or 13.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.570
And when I was in high school,
Eugene Redmond was teaching at,

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:06.510
I think Sacks State University,
and Maya Angelo taught there also,

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.010
and my mother invited
Eugene to the house --

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:11.310
[ Laughter ]

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.380
so I could meet a black poet.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.700
You know, I was -- I was
a little kid, really.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm sure he didn't what it was.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.090
But it was a really indelible
moment to have a poet in the house.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:27.370
It was kind of like
being blessed by him.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:31.880
And then, the -- the last thing
I would like to say is that,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.840
when I first started writing
really seriously in my --

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:41.860
in my mid- and late twenties, I
started really writing seriously

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:49.950
and for several of those years,
I was living in Minneapolis

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:53.750
and teaching at St. Olaf College

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.080
which is a Norwegian
Lutheran College.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.460
And -- but in the twin cities,

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:04.050
Etheridge Knight somehow
had landed in Minneapolis.

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.430
I've never quite understood why.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:12.130
And he and Robert Bly
offered a poetry workshop

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:16.550
which was called The Free
People's Poetry Workshop.

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:23.760 position:56%
And I was in this workshop for maybe
two or possibly even three years.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.220
And we met in people's
homes and then at -- at --

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.050
at an arts center in Minneapolis.

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:35.220
We met as a workshopping group
and workshopped our poems,

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.380
and Etheridge was a really
great workshop leader.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:43.240
He was a very insightful
reader of our poems.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.400
And then we he thought we had
been workshopping long enough,

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.020
he decided we should
go out of the workshop

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:54.910
and take our poems to the people.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:59.070
And he would say, okay, we --

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:00.370
we're going to meet

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:04.940
at the such-and-such hamburger
stand next Wednesday night

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.350
at 7:30, show up there.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.910
And he -- he had a little PA system
with little speakers like this,

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:13.670
and a little microphone,
and we would -- he --

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.820
we would go into this
place unannounced.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.390 position:56%
People were there for dinner eating
hamburgers, and Etheridge would say,

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:23.510
okay, "Yo, we gonna
read ya some poems."

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:26.040
[ Laughter ]

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.800
People would put their hamburgers
down and listen to our poems.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.120
Nobody ever walked out on us.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.360
It was -- it was an -- it was an --

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.080
this was a period of my life
that was so important to me.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.260
Baraka said that you know a poem
is good when you can tap a workman

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.580
on the street on the shoulder,
you know, with a, you know,

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.050
some kind of a -- yeah -- tap
him on the shoulder, and say,

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.380 position:56%
would you mind listening to my poem?

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.920
And if he listens to your poem and
then doesn't hit you in the mouth,

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.260
you know it's a good poem.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.300
[ Laughter ]

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.940
And that's -- that's what that
workshop was for me with Etheridge,

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.290
but it wasn't specifically
a black arts workshop.

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.580
The people, I think -- Etheridge

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.620
and I were probably the only
black people in the workshop.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.810
But the people who came up --
Mary Karr was in that workshop.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.120
David Wojahn was in that workshop.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.370
Etheridge taught us so much.

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:30.660
He gave us his heart
and -- and he --

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.760
I think he kind of
counts as black arts.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.320
It kind of came at the
-- at the tail end of it.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:43.530
But he initiated all of us into
the sense of what is valuable,

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:46.450
what are we doing as writers?

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.920
What are we doing as poets?

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.540
And his answer to that would
be that we are freeing people.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.080
We are setting people free.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.510
And that I guess is the end of
what I have to say about that.

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:07.040
[ Applause ]

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.340

Go straight to the Q and A. Okay.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:17.960
At this point, let's open
it up to the audience.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.280
Who has a question?

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.110
Mics? We have mics in the back.

01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:28.760
And particularly any questions,
though we'll accept all questions,

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.000
but that deal with, you
know, crossing genre.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.370
We are running a little tight
on time, so any questions?

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:44.180
Okay. Well we'll start talking
and maybe some questions.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:47.800
The -- the question I wanted
to ask next was -- oh, Darlene?

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Rachel, I'm
really interested

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.080 position:56%
in the work that you shared with us.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.840
You're a poet and a visual artist.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.580
Please talk to me about how
you bring those two together.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.880
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Yeah.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.580
&gt;&gt; And that was such a powerful
poem that you shared with us.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.030
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: I think that's
an entre for everybody to talk

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.590
about working across genre.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:11.270
Thanks.

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:17.350
&gt;&gt; Rachel Eliza Griffiths:
Thank you for that question.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:20.170
I -- I -- I would say
maybe for a long time,

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:23.410
since I was a little girl, I
always wrote, I always drew,

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:26.320
I always painted, I was
always a visual artist.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.520
And, you know, in the
last maybe 10 or 12 years,

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.030
those two spaces have become
indivisible from my --

01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:38.850
my practice of just being in the
world and being -- being an artist.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:44.210
And so one of the things to -- to
think about Black Arts Movement

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.160
and then also to think -- I'm
going to talk for a moment

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.880
about Cave Canem is that when I --
when I was accepted in Cave Canem

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.060
in 2006, I look around, I had
just started photographing.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.450
I had moved to New York.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:01.630
Left a very well-endowed Ph.D.

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:03.180
because I thought,
I'm going to try this.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.050
I -- I have to fly or I fall.

01:09:05.050 --> 01:09:08.380
And I have no money, I'm moving
to New York because I'm --

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.250
this is who I am and I have
to see what will happen.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:15.020
And so my nice painting easel and
natural light all disappeared.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:20.170
I lived in a one-room women's
residence with shared bathrooms.

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:22.830
And so in the city, I had --

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.300
I started taking a camera
around because the rhythm

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:29.580
of the city needed
that kind of machine.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.060
And so when I got accepted in Cave
Canem, I looked around and thought,

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.500
where is the visual record, right?

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.590
So in my room where I write, I have
my post cards of Langston Hughes

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:45.850
and Toni Morrison and Alice Walker
and, you know, all of these writers

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:47.780
who I need to see brown faces.

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.690
I need to see them at their
typewriters, their pencils,

01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:56.330
their papers, and I thought,
this movement of Cave Canem,

01:09:56.330 --> 01:10:01.690
we need to know what we look like
in our time and what that means.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.200
And so when I -- when
I asked, you know,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.070
is anyone taking pictures of this?

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:10.330
And this was the 2006, 10th
anniversary reunion that --

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:11.840
that was being celebrated.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.320
I think it was at City College
or Cuny -- Cuny Graduate Center.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.450
Wow, I'm -- I'm old
now and dating myself.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.530
I think it was at Cuny
Graduate Center.

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:23.130
And so I said, well,
I'm going to do it.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.630
I'm going to start photographing
because we need to have a record.

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:28.540
We need to have an archive.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:35.470
People in this narrative, this
story, need to not be faceless.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:39.710
And so I began a very
sustained, and it is continuing.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.910 position:56%
I have photographed may 200 fellows.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:47.720
And now it's expanded where I have
photographed quite a few black

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.110
poets, writers, musicians, across
the board, fiction writers as well.

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:58.210
And so, for me in that space, as
-- as a portrait photographer,

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:02.530
I also felt connected to, you
know, Gordon Parks and Van Der Zee

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:06.040
and saw myself in that
tradition of continuing

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.900
that legacy of making an archive.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.010
And in my fine arts photography,

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:13.060
which I think is more
closely aligned

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.900
to the actual poetry I write, I
focus particularly on narratives

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:23.650
of black womanhood and black
women's bodies and the narrative

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:27.820 position:56%
of the black figure in this country.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:33.010 position:56%
And the more outward I look at that
history, the more inward it helps me

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:34.700
where language is concerned.

01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.270 position:56%
For a few years, my poems and
photographs did not like each other,

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:39.920
they didn't want to
be around each other,

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.490 position:56%
they did not want me double-dipping.

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:46.560
But as I -- as I'm getting
older and learning so much more

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.350 position:56%
as an emerging poet and as a
photographer, they have a lot to say

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:55.980
to each other and I -- and
I feel grateful for that.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.280
&gt;&gt; Marita Golden: Tony?

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.950
And we have about 8
minutes, 5 minutes, so --

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.250
&gt;&gt; Tony Medina: I'll
try and do it quickly.

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:06.350
When -- when I started -- when
I fell in love with literature,

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:08.360
I was in the 9th grade,
I was 15 years old,

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.940
I was forced to do a book report,
or make up a book report that I --

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.920
I didn't do it because I was lazy.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.080
And so, I had the opportunity
to make up the assignment

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.580
and my favorite teacher was
Mr. Del Los Rios [phonetic],

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.370
our English teacher.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:26.300
He gave us a list of books.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.860
On that list was a book whose
title intrigued me and I was like,

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.750
what's an Algernon, "Flowers
for Algernon" by Daniel Keyes.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:38.690
That led me into reading
everything on the list of books

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:41.250
that Mr. Del Los Rios gave me.

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:43.750
And so my first love,
of course, was fiction.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.970
Then, I don't know,
three years later,

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:51.320 position:56%
I just found myself being seized by
the muse of poetry and poems came --

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.840
came out of me so readily.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.090
And it was like, I would
read my fiction and hate it,

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:58.130
and I would read my
poetry and like it.

01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:01.260
That led me to read poetry
and fall in love with --

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:04.040
with poetry on the page and
-- and, you know, Dylan Thomas

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.730
and Hart Crane and Emily
Dickinson, and all these people,

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.950
and then Langston Hughes,
you know, changed the game.

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:14.080
Also Langston Hughes -- I didn't
grow up with children's books.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.820
As an adult, I grew to really
love the -- the form of, you know,

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.200
the art and the text
merging together,

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.080
so I started just collecting
children's books

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.700
and reading children's books.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.450
And that led me to writing
children's books, and of course,

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:29.750
one of my models was Langston.

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:32.550 position:56%
I said, you know, I'm sick and tired
of dealing with my own generation.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.550
I want to talk to younger people.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:40.330
So that allowed me to do that
because I saw someone like Langston

01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:45.370
who was able to what he
did for adults politically

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:48.760
and socially also do
it for young people.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.240
So that was like my model.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.650
And since I read so -- so
voraciously in all the genres,

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:58.120
I just always considered myself
a writer so I should be able

01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.960
to try to write in every genre.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.590
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Nelson: I --
I don't know what to say.

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:11.670
Genre crossing for me has
been -- as I said, I --

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:17.990
I have written what I think of
as a slave narrative in verse.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:23.020
I've -- what else have I done.

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:28.180
I -- I -- I've done a
biography in verse of Carver.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:34.370
I do a lot of history -- African
American History in poetry

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:38.750
because it seems -- it
seems to be a way of --

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.820
of reaching people
with little scenes,

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.790
little gems of scenes
from our history.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:50.230
And a lot of my poems,
especially the history poems,

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:53.560
have been published for
young adult audiences that --

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.860
that's a marketing decision.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:00.260
But I think it's a good
decision because, as Tony said,

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.220 position:56%
we're reaching a different audience.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.330
You can write for people who are
your own age, or you can write

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:06.990
for people who are younger.

01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:09.010
If you write for people
who are younger,

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.570
you're both introducing
them to things

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:17.350 position:56%
that they might not be introduced to
otherwise, you're preparing them --

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:21.350
giving them eyes to see
the world more clearly.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:29.390 position:56%
And I think you're also pulling them
into poetry, making lovers of poetry

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:33.950
out of them which I think is
-- is a valuable thing to do.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:39.960
And the fact that I do
a lot of research for --

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:43.840
for my books and encourage
young people

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.430 position:56%
to do their own historical research,
I've been at schools where,

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:53.670
because they had read my book --
books and the work of Karen Hesse,

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:58.930
who also writes history
based on research.

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:01.110
I've seen kids do their
own research.

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:04.730
I've seen -- I -- I was in
a school once where the --

01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:08.180
it was a middle school and
the children had done research

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:14.270 position:56%
about where -- which homes in their
community -- this was in New York --

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:18.770
which homes in their
community had held slaves.

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:21.800
They had done original research.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.970
They had discovered
things about their own town

01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:32.000 position:56%
that the local PBS station heard
about it and did a program about it.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.230
These were middle school children
who had done original research.

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:40.550
And I think that's a worthwhile
thing to do, to encourage people

01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:43.520
to learn about their own history.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.620
So I -- I guess that's the
most I have to say about it.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:52.920
I don't -- I'm -- I'm
not much of a talker.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.790
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
