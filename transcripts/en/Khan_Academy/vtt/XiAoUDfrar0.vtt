00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.742
- [Voiceover] What I hope to
introduce you to in this video

00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:06.602
is the notion of a
transformation in mathematics,

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.942
and you're probably used to
the word in everyday language.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.761
Transformation means
something is changing,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.282
it's transforming from
one thing to another.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.038
What would transformation mean
in a mathematical context?

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:21.413
Well, it could mean that
you're taking something

00:00:21.413 --> 00:00:22.531
mathematical and you're changing it into

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.586
something else mathematical,
that's exactly what it is.

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:26.734
It's talking about taking

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:29.022
a set of coordinates or a set of points,

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:30.926
and then changing them
into a different set

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.585
of coordinates or a
different set of points.

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.442
For example, this right over here,

00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:37.381
this is a quadrilateral we've plotted

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:39.064
it on the coordinate plane.

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:41.048
This is a set of points,
not just the four points

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:44.079
that represent the vertices
of the quadrilateral,

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.181
but all the points along the sides too.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.340
There's a bunch of points along this.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.582
You could argue there's an infinite,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.859
or there are an infinite number

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.185
of points along this quadrilateral.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.973
This right over here, the point X

00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:56.389
equals 0I equals negative four,

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.909
this is a point on the quadrilateral.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.706
Now, we can apply a
transformation to this,

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:05.769
and the first one I'm going
to show you is a translation,

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:07.749
which just means moving all the points

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:09.880
in the same direction,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.619
and the same amount in
that same direction,

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.183
and I'm using the Khan Academy
translation widget to do it.

00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:19.096
Let's translate, let's translate this,

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:22.522
and I can do it by grabbing
onto one of the vertices,

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:25.238
and notice I've now shifted
it to the right by two.

00:01:25.238 --> 00:01:27.096
Every point here, not
just the orange points

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.023
has shifted to the right by two.

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:30.578
This one has shifted to the right by two,

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:33.620
this point right over here has
shifted to the right by two,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.942
every point has shifted
in the same direction

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:39.924
by the same amount, that's
what a translation is.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:43.813
Now, I've shifted, let's see
if I put it here every point

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:47.156
has shifted to the right one and up one,

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:49.235
they've all shifted by the same amount

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.857
in the same directions.

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:54.052
That is a translation,
but you could imagine

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:57.198
a translation is not the
only kind of transformation.

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.520
In fact, there is an unlimited variation,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.770
there's an unlimited number
different transformations.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.834
So, for example, I could do a rotation.

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:08.296
I have another set of points here

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:10.572
that's represented by quadrilateral,

00:02:10.572 --> 00:02:15.494
I guess we could call it CD or
BCDE, and I could rotate it,

00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:17.653
and I rotate it I would
rotate it around the point.

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:20.602
So for example, I could
rotate it around the point D,

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:22.239
so this is what I started with,

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.978
if I, let me see if I can do this,

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.602
I could rotate it like,
actually let me see.

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:31.526
So if I start like this I
could rotate it 90 degrees,

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.009
I could rotate 90 degrees,
so I could rotate it,

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.505
I could rotate it like, that looks

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:40.523
pretty close to a 90-degree rotation.

00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:44.388
So, every point that was on the original

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:47.303
or in the original set of
points I've now shifted it

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:49.984
relative to that point
that I'm rotating around.

00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:52.061
I've now rotated it 90 degrees,

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.346
so this point has now mapped
to this point over here.

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:58.389
This point has now mapped
to this point over here,

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.701
and I'm just picking the
vertices because those

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:01.582
are a little bit easier to think about.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:03.428
This point has mapped to this point.

00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:04.763
The point of rotation, actually,

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.746
since D is actually the point of rotation

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:09.963
that one actually has not shifted,

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:11.821
and just 'til you get some terminology,

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:15.966
the set of points after you
apply the transformation

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.705
this is called the image
of the transformation.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:23.705
So, I had quadrilateral BCDE,

00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:27.795
I applied a 90-degree counterclockwise

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:29.978
rotation around the point D,

00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:33.054
and so this new set of
points this is the image

00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:37.035
of our original quadrilateral
after the transformation.

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:39.462
I don't have to just, let me undo this,

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:41.900
I don't have to rotate
around just one of the points

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.242
that are on the original set
that are on our quadrilateral,

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:49.863
I could rotate around, I could
rotate around the origin.

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.031
I could do something like that.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.084
Notice it's a different rotation now.

00:03:53.084 --> 00:03:54.070
It's a different rotation.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.008
I could rotate around any point.

00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:59.144
Now let's look at another transformation,

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:02.940
and that would be the
notion of a reflection,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.343
and you know what reflection
means in everyday life.

00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:06.609
You imagine the reflection of

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.708
an image in a mirror or on the water,

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.169
and that's exactly what
we're going to do over here.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.593
If we reflect, we reflect across
a line, so let me do that.

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:19.053
This, what is this one,
two, three, four, five,

00:04:19.053 --> 00:04:24.053
this not-irregular
pentagon, let's reflect it.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.784
To reflect it, let me actually,

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:31.568
let me actually make a line like this.

00:04:31.568 --> 00:04:34.598
I could reflect it across
a whole series of lines.

00:04:34.598 --> 00:04:38.116
Woops, let me see if I can, so
let's reflect it across this.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.890
Now, what does it mean to
reflect across something?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.469
One way I imagine is if this was,

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:43.909
we're going to get its mirror image,

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.147
and you imagine this
as the line of symmetry

00:04:47.147 --> 00:04:51.315
that the image and the
original shape they should

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.776
be mirror images across
this line we could see that.

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:55.192
Let's do the reflection.

00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:58.397
There you go, and you see
we have a mirror image.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.521
This is this far away from the line.

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:02.715
This, its corresponding point in the image

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:05.896
is on the other side of the
line but the same distance.

00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:08.682
This point over here is
this distance from the line,

00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:10.572
and this point over here
is the same distance

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:13.941
but on the other side.

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:17.435
Now, all of the transformations
that I've just showed you,

00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:21.638
the translation, the
reflection, the rotation,

00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:24.494
these are called rigid transformations.

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.759
Once again you could just think about

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.663
what does rigid mean in everyday life?

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:29.741
It means something that's not flexible.

00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.713
It means something that you can't stretch

00:05:32.713 --> 00:05:36.106
or scale up or scale down it
kind of maintains its shape,

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.452
and that's what rigid transformations

00:05:37.452 --> 00:05:38.798
are fundamentally about.

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.073
If you want to think a little
bit more mathematically,

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:44.034
a rigid transformation is one in which

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:46.413
lengths and angles are preserved.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:48.654
You can see in this
transformation right over here

00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:51.115
the distance between this
point and this point,

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:52.775
between points T and R,

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:54.685
and the difference between
their corresponding

00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:57.825
image points, that distance is the same.

00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:00.727
The angle here, angle R, T, Y,

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:02.910
the measure of this angle over here,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.626
if you look at the
corresponding angle in the image

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:08.703
it's going to be the same angle.

00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:11.721
The same thing is true if
you're doing a translation.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.147
You could imagine these are
acting like rigid objects.

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:16.144
You can't stretch them,
they're not flexible

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:18.443
they're maintaining their shape.

00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:20.021
Now what would be examples
of transformations

00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:22.146
that are not rigid transformations?

00:06:22.146 --> 00:06:24.444
Well you could imagine
scaling things up and down.

00:06:24.444 --> 00:06:27.544
If I were to scale this out where it has

00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:29.007
maybe the angles are preserved,

00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:30.054
but the lengths aren't preserved

00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:31.923
that would not be a rigid transformation.

00:06:31.923 --> 00:06:33.757
If I were to just stretch one side of it,

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:37.077
or if I were to just pull
this point while the other

00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:39.341
points stayed where they
are I'd be distorting it

00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.474
or stretching it that would
not be a rigid transformation.

00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:45.840
So hopefully this gets you,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.490
it's actually very, very interesting.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.034
When you use an art program,

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.892
or actually you use a
lot of computer graphics,

00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:52.790
or you play a video game, most of what

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.408
the video game is doing is
actually doing transformations.

00:06:55.408 --> 00:06:58.612
Sometimes in two dimensions,
sometimes in three dimensions,

00:06:58.612 --> 00:07:00.713
and once you get into more advanced math,

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:03.347
especially things like linear
algebra, there's a whole field

00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:05.738
that's really focused
around transformations.

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.096
In fact, some of the computers

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:08.861
with really good graphics processors,

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.007
a graphics processor is
just a piece of hardware

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:13.516
that is really good at performing

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.420
mathematical transformations,

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.546
so that you can immerse yourself

00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:18.578
in a 3D reality or whatever else.

00:07:18.578 --> 00:07:20.906
This is really really interesting stuff.
