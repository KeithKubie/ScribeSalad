00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.910
We're asked to graph y is
equal to 5 to the x-th power.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.060
And we'll just do this
the most basic way.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.100
We'll just try out
some values for x

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.500
and see what we get for y.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.950
And then we'll plot
those coordinates.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.180
So let's try some negative
and some positive values.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.840
And I'll try to
center them around 0.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.840
So this will be my x values.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.760
This will be my y values.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.480
Let's start first with something
reasonably negative but not

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.140
too negative.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.920
So let's say we start with
x is equal to negative 2.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.400
Then y is equal to
5 to the x power,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.280
or 5 to the negative
2 power, which we know

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.290
is the same thing as 1 over 5
to the positive 2 power, which

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.174
is just 1/25.

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:45.340
Now let's try another value.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.000
What happens when x is
equal to negative 1?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.920
Then y is 5 to the
negative 1 power, which

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.460
is the same thing as 1 over 5
to the first power, or just 1/5.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.780
Now let's think about
when x is equal to 0.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.769
Then y is going to be equal
to 5 to the 0-th power, which

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.580
we know anything
to the 0-th power

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.910
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.480
So this is going
to be equal to 1.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.670
And then finally,
we have-- well,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.560
actually, let's try a
couple of more points here.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.240
Let me extend this table
a little bit further.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140
Let's try out x is equal to 1.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
Then y is 5 to the first power,
which is just equal to 5.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340
And let's do one
last value over here.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.190
Let's see what happens
when x is equal to 2.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.350
Then y is 5 squared,
5 to the second power,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.650
which is just equal to 25.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.660
And now we can plot it to
see how this actually looks.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.670
So let me get some
graph paper going here.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.410
My x's go as low as negative
2, as high as positive 2.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.590
And then my y's go all the way
from 1/25 all the way to 25.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.560
So I have positive
values over here.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.490
So let me draw it like this.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
So this could be my x-axis.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.610
That could be my x-axis.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.715
And then let's make
this my y-axis.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.710
I'll draw it as neatly as I can.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.940
So let's make that my y-axis.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.150
And my x values, this
could be negative 2.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.570
Actually, make my
y-axis keep going.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.000
So that's y.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.170
This is x.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.330
That's a negative 2.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.300
That's negative 1.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.670
That's 0.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.310
That is 1.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.690
And that is positive 2.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.350
And let's plot the points.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.970
x is negative 2. y is 1/25.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.040
Actually, let me make
the scale on the y-axis.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.396
So let's make this.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:44.020
So we're going to go
all the way to 25.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.235
So let's say that this is 5.

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.610
Actually, I have to do it a
little bit smaller than that,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.250
too.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.650
So this is going to
be 5, 10, 15, 20.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.530
And then 25 would be right where
I wrote the y, give or take.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.780
So now let's plot them.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.773
Negative 2, 1/25.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.700
1 is going to be like there.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.670
So 1/25 is going to be really,
really close to the x-axis.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.830
That's about 1/25.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.772
So that is negative 2, 1/25.

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:15.230
It's not going to
be on the x-axis.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.710
1/25 is obviously
greater than 0.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.240
It's going to be really,
really, really, really, close.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.040
Now let's do this point here
in orange, negative 1, 1/5.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.750
Negative 1/5-- 1/5 on this
scale is still pretty close.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.700
It's pretty close.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.620
So that right over there
is negative 1, 1/5.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.680
And now in blue,
we have 0 comma 1.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.150
0 comma 1 is going to
be right about there.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.280
If this is 2 and 1/2, that
looks about right for 1.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.590
And then we have 1 comma 5.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.660
1 comma 5 puts us
right over there.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.710
And then finally,
we have 2 comma 25.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.730
When x is 2, y is 25.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.420
2 comma 25 puts us
right about there.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.140
And so I think you see what
happens with this function,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.640
with this graph.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.010
The further in the
negative direction we go,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.720
5 to ever-increasing
negative powers

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440
gets closer and closer
to 0, but never quite.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.706
So we're leaving 0, getting
slightly further, further,

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:20.230
further from 0.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.235
Right at the y-axis,
we have y equal 1.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.600
Right at x is equal to 0,
we have y is equal to 1.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.960
And then once x starts
increasing beyond 0,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.310
then we start seeing what
the exponential is good at,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.197
which is just this
very rapid increase.

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:41.280
Some people would call it
an exponential increase,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.400
which is obviously the
case right over here.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.140
So then if I just
keep this curve going,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.970
you see it's just going
on this sometimes called

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.140
a hockey stick.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.980
It just keeps on
going up like this

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.000
at a super fast rate,
ever-increasing rate.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So you could keep going
forever to the left,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.958
and you'd get closer and
closer and closer to 0

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.550
without quite getting to 0.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.202
So 5 to the negative
billionth power

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:04.660
is still not going
to get you to 0,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.890
but it's going to get you
pretty darn close to 0.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.490
But obviously, if you go to 5
to the positive billionth power,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.260
you're going to get
to a super huge number

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.990
because this thing is just
going to keep skyrocketing up

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.491
like that.

00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:16.198
So let me just draw
the whole curve, just

00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:17.210
to make sure you see it.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.940
Over here, I'm not actually on
0, although the way I drew it,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.940
it might look like that.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.910
I'm slightly above 0.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.770
I'm increasing above that,
increasing above that.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.210
And once I get into the
positive x's, then I

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.270
start really,
really shooting up.
