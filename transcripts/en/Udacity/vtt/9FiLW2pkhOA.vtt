00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we know the total force must be 0, because it's not accelerating,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because it's not accelerating, and the acceleration is therefore 0.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This means that downward forces must equal upward forces.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That's the only way these could balance, and that means that this is the best answer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If this one were the answer, mg would over power it, and that would indicate

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and downward accelerating object.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If this were the correct answer, this force is bigger than g, and it would be accelerating upward.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This might be the correct answer if, let's say, we were pulling on a rope

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and accelerating the ball upwards.
