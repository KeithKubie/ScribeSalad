00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.630
landscaped and beautiful not only will
it create this connection them but will

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640
it create this connection them but will
 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.839
it create this connection them but will
have hundreds maybe thousands of people

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849

every day walking through this
magnificent computer science building

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350
magnificent computer science building
 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.460
magnificent computer science building
and that's the way we want this notion

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470
and that's the way we want this notion
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.190
and that's the way we want this notion
about openness that referred to and that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
about openness that referred to and that
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.140
about openness that referred to and that
we heard from our alumni at the alumni

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150
we heard from our alumni at the alumni
 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.509
we heard from our alumni at the alumni
awards last night is absolutely true

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519
awards last night is absolutely true
 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.940
awards last night is absolutely true
about Carnegie Mellon in a key trait and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950
about Carnegie Mellon in a key trait and
 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.339
about Carnegie Mellon in a key trait and
something that were capturing and

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349
something that were capturing and
 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.309
something that were capturing and
preserving in our buildings themselves

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319
preserving in our buildings themselves
 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.830
preserving in our buildings themselves
so that's the computer science building

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
so that's the computer science building
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.780
so that's the computer science building
that's next door to the newell simon

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790
that's next door to the newell simon
 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.759
that's next door to the newell simon
building which for many of you seems

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769
building which for many of you seems
 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.470
building which for many of you seems
like a new building though for us now

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480
like a new building though for us now
 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080
like a new building though for us now
it's been there for I don't know seven

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
it's been there for I don't know seven
 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.420
it's been there for I don't know seven
or eight years I guess the current home

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430
or eight years I guess the current home
 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.130
or eight years I guess the current home
of computer science and of course name

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140
of computer science and of course name
 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.560
of computer science and of course name
for herb Simon and Alan Newell the two

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570
for herb Simon and Alan Newell the two
 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.620
for herb Simon and Alan Newell the two
great leaders in computer science and

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
great leaders in computer science and
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.690
great leaders in computer science and
next to that is a building that opened

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700
next to that is a building that opened
 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.490
next to that is a building that opened
three years ago a collaborative

what they'd say actually I I'm sure one

guarantee you that I think if they were

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.170
guarantee you that I think if they were
 

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.510
guarantee you that I think if they were
thoughtful about it you would get

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:57.520
thoughtful about it you would get
 

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.140
thoughtful about it you would get
teamwork and collaboration and if you

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.150
teamwork and collaboration and if you
 

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.100
teamwork and collaboration and if you
sort of prompted them you probably get

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.110
sort of prompted them you probably get
 

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.079
sort of prompted them you probably get
problem-solving out of them to them

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:07.089
