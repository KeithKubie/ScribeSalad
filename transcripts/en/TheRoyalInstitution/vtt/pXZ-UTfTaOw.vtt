00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.550
Early in the 1950s a Russian chemist by the
name of Boris Belousov

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.470
reported one of the weirdest reactions that
has ever been seen in chemistry.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.020
It was a reaction that seemed to not be able
to make up its mind.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.060
Let me show you.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.499
Now I'm pouring in a little bit of hydrogen
peroxide into this mixture, and you can see

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.999
that yellow colour as iodine is produced.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.200
Then it turns deep blue.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.520
And then the whole process goes back to yellow
again.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.820
I mean, this reaction flip flops between these
yellow and blue states.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.010
To the chemists who read the report, this
seemed a complete outrage.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:07.690
Could this reaction actually represent a violation
of the second law of thermodynamics?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.690
Let me explain:

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.929
In a typical chemical reaction in which A
is reacted with B,

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.630
what we might do is get some kind of product.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.549
And in this case you can see this beautiful
pink colour.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.409
Well, that reaction is effectively over.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.409
We've formed the product, and that's it.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.760
And when chemists think about a reaction like
this, they imagine that the reaction is travelling

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.840
through a landscape,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.689
from the starting materials, high up in the
mountains,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:49.200
down to the much lower energy, much more dispersed
plains where the product lies.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.079
This ball provides a really good analogy of
the way in which this second chemical reaction

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.149
went.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.119
When we place it at the top, and as the reaction
proceeds,

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.939
the reaction essentially rolls down the slope
until it reaches the bottom.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.440
And when the ball is at the bottom we all
know there's no prospect of it ever coming

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.160
back up to the top,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.390
and the same applies to our pink solution.
Our pink solution has reached the bottom of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.220
that chemical slope.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.310
Now what Belousov discovered, was not a simple
reaction,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.000
in which A and B are combined and simply form
a product.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.940
What he'd seen was the path that his chemical
reaction was taking on the way down the slope.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.780
Now the way to illustrate this is not to use
a ball, but instead to use one of these simple

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.780
toys,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.370
this is called a slope walker.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.960
What he does is he walks down the slope effectively
going yellow, blue, yellow blue,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.220
just like our reaction.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.370
But in the end he gets to the bottom.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.300
And at that point our reaction is over.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.360
And therefore this is no violation of the
second law.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.690
We have a reaction which starts at the beginning
and finishes at the end.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.330
When we look back at Belousov's reaction,
we can see that it's now gone a steady blue.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.650
The reaction is over.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.900
And in many ways this reaction that Belousov
found, are a metaphor almost for life itself.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.080
The action takes place on the slope while
the energy flows.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.120
But ultimately, everything comes to an end.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120
Everything finishes.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.330
Everything dies.
