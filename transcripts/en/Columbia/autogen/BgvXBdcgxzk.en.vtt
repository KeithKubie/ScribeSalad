first off first of all I think that we

consider that everybody should be able
 

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:04.710
consider that everybody should be able
to be a subject so if you had read this

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:04.720
to be a subject so if you had read this
 

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.590
to be a subject so if you had read this
principle then you introduce the notion

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600
principle then you introduce the notion
 

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.770
principle then you introduce the notion
of collective responsibility so the idea

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:10.780
of collective responsibility so the idea
 

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.280
of collective responsibility so the idea

condition so that everybody could be
considered as a subject and would be

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:20.290
considered as a subject and would be
 

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:22.920
