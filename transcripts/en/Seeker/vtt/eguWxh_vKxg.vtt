00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.249
The world is buzzing with Pluto right now,
but what about Ceres?

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.190
Let’s give Ceres some love!

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.369
Hey all, Amy here, talking space with you
on DNews today, and specifically, the other

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.360
little planet we’re currently learning a
more about almost every day.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.570
When Ceres was first discovered, it was a
planet.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.290
Then it was reclassified as an asteroid.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.430
Now, it’s considered a dwarf planet.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.080
But NASA’s Dawn mission is revealing the
world to be increasingly interesting.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.490
By now we’re all pretty familiar with Ceres’
spots.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.150
When Dawn was about 29,000 miles away from
Ceres, images revealed two bright spots on

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.150
the surface.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.030
Since the spacecraft has settled into orbit
around Ceres, better imagery showed that the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.010
two spots are actually two of a dozen or so
in the area.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.180
What’s more, they have different temperatures,
one being warmer than its surrounding terrain

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.740
and the other being colder.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.010
There was also the interesting discovery of
what looked like plumes.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.220
Imaging along the terminator, that is, the
side of the dwarf planets just passing from

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.370
day to night, Dawn found what looked like
jets of ice shooting out of the planet’s

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.750
subsurface, glowing in reflected sunlight.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.070
And it just keeps getting weirder.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.750
The latest, as reported in Nature last week,
is that the bright spots seem to be producing

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
a haze.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.400
But not a planet-wide haze, just a localized
haze, which is pretty interesting.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.490
And it only shows up when seen from certain
angles at noon local time on Ceres.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170
It comes back in a regular patterns, covering
half the crater before stopping at the rim.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.610
But that’s not all that’s catching scientists’
attention.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.240
There are mountains on Ceres!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.910
Not huge ones - they’re about 3 miles high
- but it’s still evidence of something actively

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.130
shaping the little world in its past!

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.850
And we’ve learned that Ceres is a little
smaller than expected and its axis is tilted

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.270
at the reverse angle that scientists expected
meaning that on Ceres, summer is winter and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.270
winter is summer!

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.700
So what does all this mean?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.940
It means there’s a lot more to learn about
the little dwarf planet, and what we learn

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.410
will ultimately help scientists get a better
grasp on how all the bodies in the solar system

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.410
are related.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.560
Ceres is too big to be an asteroid but also
stuck in the nebulous dwarf planet category.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.090
Learning more about Ceres might help us call
it by the right name.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.210
And speaking of planets turned dwarf planets,
are you curious about Pluto’s status as

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.210
a planet?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.980
I dug into this one on my own channel, Vintage
