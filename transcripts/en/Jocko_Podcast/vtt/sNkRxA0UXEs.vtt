1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.040
Does micromanaging ever work?

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.120
Well,
yes.
And and more importantly,

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.670
does it work?
Yes.
Sometimes it works and more importantly,

4
00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:15.910
sometimes you have to micro manage.
Um,

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.920
so you get somebody that isn't good at their job,
doesn't do a good job,

6
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:24.880
doesn't show up,
doesn't run things right.
Of course,
you know how you fix them.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.730
You got to get into micromanage.
Well first of all,
you can't do mission failure.

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.210
So you've got to get it in their micromanage.
Once you're done micromanaging or,

9
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.770
or once you've got them up to speed,
then you can stop micromanaging.
This is,

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.590
this is totally good to go.

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.350
And even if you asked life or you know,

12
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:44.290
the other platoon commanders that worked for me or assist in between commanders

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.430
at work for me,
if when we say,

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.590
when they got to know me,
when they met me,

15
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.400
I was micromanaged master cause I'm in their grill.
Hey this,

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.740
you've got to do this.
No,
come over here a little bit.

17
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.960
No and wouldn't give me any slack.
But then as soon as I see that they get it,

18
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.230
of course,
then it's like,
okay,
you got this,
you got this,
and I'm going to,

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.250
I'm going to macro manage and barely manage and let them run with it.

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.563
And so that's,

21
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
that's absolutely micromanagement is sometimes it's a necessity.

22
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.120
And by the weight,
if you're getting micromanaged,

23
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.550
that's a little bit of a red flag.
Sure.

24
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:21.790
You might have somebody that's a control freak that is a compulsive
micromanager,

25
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.970
and that sucks.
But you also might have somebody that doesn't trust you yet.

26
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.120
And so how do you build up their trust?
Is it by hiding from them?
No,

27
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.280
it's by being open and being like,
hey boss,
here's what I'm going to do.

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.460
You actually send them more information than they could even want.

29
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.020
You show them how responsible you are.

30
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:37.570
You show them what a handle you have on the situation,

31
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.360
and that's how you can help overcome the micromanager.

32
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.870
But if someone's not doing what they're supposed to do,
or they're failing,

33
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.550
or they're,
they're letting you down,
then yeah,

34
00:01:45.551 --> 00:01:47.290
you gotta get in their grill and micromanage them.

35
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.400
The other time that I sort of said this is when you're mentoring someone,

36
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.630
that can also be viewed as micromanagement because now I'm sitting side by side

37
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.490
on my breathing down your neck a little bit.

38
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.960
And that might be viewed as micromanagement.
But again,
sometimes it's necessary.

39
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.880
If you don't know the ropes yet,
I got to show you the ropes.

40
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:07.270
That means I got to sit by you and make sure you know what I'm teaching.

41
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.410
So if you're teaching somebody something in a work environment that can also be

42
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:14.080
viewed as micromanagement,
it actually is because you're saying,
hey,

43
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.390
put this over here,
put that over here,
wait back off,
let me do this.
No,
no,

44
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.780
you don't know how to do it.
So I've got to show you how to do.

45
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.870
I'm teaching you how to do it.
So there's that and,

46
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.430
and then that's teaching and then sometimes you got to show people how to do it.

47
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.160
And I told that long story in here one time where I just said,
hey,

48
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.380
you sit and watch how I'm going to run this squad.

49
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.090
And I ran the squad and got fired up and told people where to go and moved down

50
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.510
the line and the platoon commander looked at me and said,
okay,
I can do that.

51
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.400
And as soon as you saw at one time,
he got it.

52
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:46.270
So that's sometimes micromanagement is okay.

53
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.900
The thing is you don't want to get stuck in the Rut of micromanagement.

54
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.420
So if I mentor you,
if I teach you,
if I instruct you,

55
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:55.630
if I show you the way doesn't mean stay there and keep micromanaging cause

56
00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:57.160
you're not doing your job.

57
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.410
You shouldn't have the or the capacity to micromanagement to micromanage

58
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.590
everybody that works for you.
If you have that ability,
you're not doing your job,

59
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.610
you're not looking up the chain of command,
you're not looking out your troopers,

60
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.120
your subordinate leadership should be stepping up and leading and you should

61
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.200
expect that of them.
And if you have to micro management,

62
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.360
it should be a chore that you don't like doing.

63
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.690
And when you get in there and you micromanage for a certain amount of time,

64
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.580
then you say,
okay,
you got this.
You know,
um,
I'm stepping back.

65
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.540
And then you've got to step back because no one likes to be micromanaged.

66
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.280
So once you get people up to speed,
step back,
let them run.

67
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.650
Let your leaders lead.
Yeah.

68
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.930
Sometimes people who who like to micromanage or they feel compelled to,

69
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.900
they can fall in that trap where where it,

70
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.810
let's say they do need to micromanage and they'll get that pay off of,
Oh yeah,

71
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.040
I see this guy kind of getting it,

72
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.490
but instead of understanding the full scope of things where,
oh,

73
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.750
he's getting it now,
I need to,
I don't need to manage as much.
They'll be like,

74
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.920
they'll still start chasing that payoff of them getting it with their little

75
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.680
micromanagement,
you know?
So they'll like constantly need that.
Pay Off.

76
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.160
Some people.
Now that you mentioned,
some people micromanage because their ego,

77
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.690
they want to,
they want to exercise,
they want to do two things,

78
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.900
exercise their power over the person or,

79
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.610
or show off their knowledge to the person.
Yeah.

80
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.450
So those two are just such a pain and they're such a pain.
But you know what?

81
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.290
What do you do?
Okay,
cool.
I'm going to work harder.
I'm going to be ahead of you.

82
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.340
I'm going to get better at this and we're going to move on.
Yeah.

83
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.720
The showing off knowledge thing that,
that,

84
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.740
that it's in a micromanagement situation it seems like,
okay,

85
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.830
that's obviously you shouldn't do that and you could probably see it from a mile

86
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.310
away,
but,

87
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.970
but just in everyday life probably that's a compelling thing to want to show

88
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:50.020
people.
You ever,

89
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.500
you ever hear someone telling you something that you already know and you just

90
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.960
want to tell them?
Probably.
I already know.
I know,
I know.
You know,

91
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.440
like you don't have to explain it to me when really when you really kind of

92
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.530
search your own feelings,
it's not that they're wasting your time,

93
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.800
it's kind of that you just want to let them know that I have that knowledge,

94
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.530
worry about,
you know what I mean?
I see that all the time.

95
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:12.830
I feel that all the time.
Just got to like find your talk or any barrier.

96
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.500
But I think that's,
that's a real compelling,
like one desire,
you know,
to,

97
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.330
to show,
hey,
I already know that.
Or look how much I know,
you know.

98
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.430
Yet people definitely like that.
It's,

99
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.190
it makes them feel good and look at what I know,
you know.
