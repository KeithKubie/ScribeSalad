00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.241
Okay, let's try to find a couple more equations of lines. For these two problems

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.367
we're given slightly different information. For the first problem, I want to

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:12.462
find the equation of a line that goes through the point 3 negative 4, that has

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:16.536
the slope of 0. You can put your answer in this box. For the second problem, I

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:20.568
want you to find the equation of a line that goes through the point 3 negative

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:27.345
4. With undefined slope. And you can put your answer in this box. Good luck.
