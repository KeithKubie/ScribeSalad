00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.390
To one. Boom. Andre ward, ladies and gentlemen, Hawaii brother. I'm good man.

2
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.820
How you doing? Thank you very much for doing this, man. I'm a big fan,

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:10.650
so I was very excited to do this. Appreciate you have me.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.690
You did it in terms of like,

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:16.230
if you're a young fighter and you've got aspirations, what do you want to do?

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.090
You want to be an Olympic gold medalist?

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
You want to win multiple world titles to division world champion and you're

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:27.300
retired undefeated. You, you're the one, you're like a unicorn man.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.370
You have rare dude because you were tired at 35, right? 33 33.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.320
That's crazy. Like you're in the peak of your athletic abilities and you go,

11
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.860
you know what? I did enough. I'm out. Yeah,

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
I made it sound. It sounds all neat and buttoned up. Uh, but it wasn't,

13
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.210
it wasn't that easy.

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.880
Like I didn't know how things were going to go throughout the course of my

15
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.450
career. Um, but for whatever reason, like I always, even as a young kid,

16
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:59.010
and I'm talking 10 years old, like I had this thought like, you know,

17
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:03.990
I don't want to end up like a lot of fighters end up. Like I seen my go high,

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.570
really high, and then all of a sudden they come crashing down.

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.420
Like they start well, but they don't end well. That's what,

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.090
that's what drew me to Roy Jones jr um,

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.320
country boy has swag and he'd always talk about himself in the third person.

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.120
He'd be like, man, you know, Roy Jones, I don't, you know,

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.700
I don't love this sport. Like that, man. I'm gonna get in and get out.

24
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.450
I'm just special at it and I'm gonna be fishing on my farm one, you know,

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.310
one day in Pensacola, Florida. And I was like, man, this dude is different.

26
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.810
Fighters don't talk like that.

27
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.320
So he was the first one that gave me the thought of getting in and getting out.

28
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.440
And then again, I just, I just studied it throughout the course of my career,

29
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.350
even other athletes and entertainers. Like I just, I was enamored by it.

30
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.510
So that was always a goal.

31
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:42.270
Just as much as I wanted to win a gold medal world championship.

32
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.460
I wanted to leave on top when people were asking, why are you leaving? Yeah.

33
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.480
It's so difficult to make that decision though for something.

34
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.550
Roy Jones jr didn't even make that decision.

35
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.260
He said he was going to do it and then,

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.800
I mean he had some rough knockouts late in his career.

37
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.050
It's hard to watch that some of them that people even didn't even see. Yeah.

38
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.760
Yeah. Heartbreaking. Yeah.

39
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.940
Especially if you followed him and supported him like I have. Especially if,

40
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:12.090
you know, his decision was based on Gerald McClellan. A lot of it was

41
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490
Gerald McClellan for people who don't know was a murderer man.

42
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.350
He was a Savage light heavyweight, but he caught,

43
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.310
he was cutting a lot of weight and um, you know,

44
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.200
he wound up having a serious brain injury and,

45
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
and in that Epic fight with Nigel badge, which is an amazing, amazing fight.

46
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.250
Would Ben got off the deck? It looked like the fight was over. Yup.

47
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.910
Cause Gerald McClellan would just Merck people, man. Absolutely.

48
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.680
A truck like a prototypical Cronk destroyer, you know, the right hand,

49
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.750
Ooh, tall, strong as fuck, super aggressive, knockout, striker,

50
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.850
and for whatever reason, Roy, um, decided, you know what?

51
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.240
Let's just keep doing it. Fuck it.

52
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.110
So a lot of different reasons why people do that, man.

53
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.200
I just didn't want to be one of them. Simple, simply put. Um,

54
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.830
but it's like the retirement is coming up on two years, September 21st. Um,

55
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.270
it's harder than I thought it was going to be.

56
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.580
One of the most hardest things I've ever had to do.

57
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.880
But one of the most rewarding and the way I reconcile it in my brain is that,

58
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.520
okay, at some point I'm going to have to do this.

59
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:16.060
At some point I'm gonna have to face the emotions and the pool to come back.

60
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.511
And you know,

61
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.180
trying to figure out if your body can still do it and just all the different

62
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:23.350
things you go through, whether I'm in my prime or whether I'm 40,

63
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.720
45 years old. So you can't avoid it.

64
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.570
It's just when do you want to take take on that task?

65
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:32.770
So you retired at 33 35 now. So God damn man, you're right there.

66
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.820
I mean you've like four more years to be, unless you're Bernard Hopkins,

67
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.090
then you have another decade. But to Bernard's credit, he started late.

68
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.020
He did when our started at 20 some years old and greater for state prison. Yes,

69
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.280
I started at nine years old.

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.790
Well also Bernard developed this insane discipline while I was in prison that

71
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.060
the hardships of prison were so awful.

72
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.570
The feeling of being locked up and contained, that he fucked up his life.

73
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.650
He was so bound and determined to become something special than me.

74
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.860
He's so disciplined. Yeah. Well even beyond that,

75
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.340
like he opened up his eyes and he looked at the landscape and he realized that

76
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:08.920
most fighters are not disciplined. Most fighters,

77
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.670
they liked the idea of being a champion. They liked the idea of winning,

78
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.250
you know, championships and what that brings,

79
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.580
not just the championship of what the championships and the money brings the

80
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.390
ladies, the, you know, the party and all the stuff. And he said,

81
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.950
I'm going to do it a different way.

82
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.800
Like these guys are out gaining weight 20 pounds in between fights.

83
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.660
I'm gonna live like a Spartan. He under,

84
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.320
he got the revelation and he just stuck to it. Yeah, he ate clean.

85
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.670
He lived a clean life and he thought so disobey. He fought so smart.

86
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.950
He was one of the best defensive fighters ever just,

87
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.630
and people didn't like that style man.

88
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:44.050
He would pop you and grab you poppy and grab you and people get frustrated.

89
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.470
They would get out of composure and they would start doing the things that maybe

90
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.050
they shouldn't have done and then he would capitalize those things.

91
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.590
I remember when he fought Trinidad man, I mean now

92
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.630
these Trinidad was a killer and I love Tito. I do too. I mean, he was a killer.

93
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.080
I got a chance to see Tito fight live in Vegas once. It was amazing,

94
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.220
but when Bernard started putting it on him, I was like, wow,

95
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.850
this is first of all you, this is a like a legitimate middleweight finding guys,

96
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:14.380
really a welterweight and this is also a really special fighter who just figures

97
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:17.920
people out. He fought Tito in New York city in Madison square garden,

98
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.860
which teaches little Puerto Rico like, you know,

99
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.820
I think it was the week of the Puerto Rican day parade lights.

100
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.810
And previously to that fight in Puerto Rico,

101
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.640
Bernard Hopkins took the Puerto Rican flag, threw it down, caused a Malay,

102
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.440
had to run out of there and get snatched out of the arena wherever they were.

103
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:37.150
Having a press conference get thrown on the plane,

104
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.990
like the beef was real and a to be able to like,

105
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.650
like perform under that kind of pressure. Unreal.

106
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:48.580
One of my favorite fights when he was running away from the crowd in Puerto Rico

107
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.470
and you realize like, Oh my God, he's on his own here.

108
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.180
Like literally people were trying to kill him,

109
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.710
but w w what's even crazier is he knew that was gonna happen. Like he knew,

110
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:59.540
okay, is getting ready to happen in three, two, one three to flag down.

111
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.990
And it was on. Oh man. But it worked. First of all,

112
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.130
it got so many people to pay attention to that fight. And then too, it got,

113
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.430
you know, it got t-tell emotional. If he lost that fight,

114
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.400
he was back to the back of the bus. If he wins the fight, which he did,

115
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.900
he moves on and become great on. Yeah, he moves onto greatness. You know,

116
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:22.220
it's interesting when you watch his style as well, that very technical,

117
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:25.310
very disciplined style versus Roy style,

118
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.780
which was so athletic and explosive and very unusual with that lead left hook

119
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:31.640
that he would fire off more than a jam. I mean,

120
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:36.641
Roy had a crazy style and then when you watch Roy out point Bernard early.

121
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.460
Yep.

122
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.760
But then Bernard comes back later in his career and really kinda like shut Roy

123
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:46.700
down and showed like when the athleticism starts to slip away a little bit.

124
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.430
Roy is normal. He's a human. He's a human. Yeah.

125
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.670
Whereas Bernard was still this incredibly disciplined,

126
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:57.480
very well schooled boxer was a real good lesson for fighters to see the deal.

127
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.220
Like this is why you use the fundamentals. This is why you fight correctly.

128
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.050
You can get away with being Roy Jones jr,

129
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.240
but Roy Jones jr with his physical gifts.

130
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.450
I feel like he could've got away with fighting discipline too.

131
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.870
He could've got away with fighting technically, but you know,

132
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.850
he just chose to fight his way. It worked for a long time until it didn't work.

133
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.770
But it worked better than anybody. I mean,

134
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:22.160
it was amazing to watch in the day when he was on top. Yeah. You know,

135
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.100
when he was knocking out Virgil Hill with body shots and putting his hands

136
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:26.930
behind his back and knocking dudes out. I mean,

137
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.690
how was the guy fell in love with, you know,

138
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.200
<v 1>he could've, he could've,</v>

139
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.340
he could've gone and had a full career and rode off in the sunset and been in

140
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.510
Pensacola fishing, hunting,

141
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.460
doing whatever he does and still not really been super fundamentally sound.

142
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.540
But I mean,

143
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.760
after he beat John Ruiz for the heavyweight championship of the world, uh,

144
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.560
and I had been going to multiple Roy fights leading up to that heavyweight

145
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.740
fight. Antonio Tarver, who I have a lot of respect for it, you know,

146
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.680
they were rivals in Florida when they were young. Um,

147
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.090
Antonio was following Roy around trying to get him to notice.

148
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.330
I'm trying to get him to take a fight and our members are clear as day.

149
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.630
And the post-fight press conference after Roy became the heavyweight champion of

150
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:13.510
the world after being the middleweight champion, starting at one 60 10,

151
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.050
uh, Antonio, Tara interrupted the press conference. He said, Roy Jones,

152
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.320
you've been ducking me. You can run in. He's going on and on and on.

153
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.730
Roy looks at Tarver and gives him the attention that he's been after.

154
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.410
And he said, Whoa. He said, I'm a whoop you. I'm, I'm gonna whip you.

155
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.170
We don't make that fight happen. And at that moment I'm thinking like, no rule.

156
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.190
Like, no, don't do it. You're the heavyweight champion of the world.

157
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:39.710
Tarver was still light, heavy weight and sure enough,

158
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.890
Roy went down or stripped off 25 pounds a muscle that he had built up with

159
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.460
Mackey shields stone to get ready for the heavyweight fight. Went down there,

160
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.070
fought a close fight, but he didn't look like himself.

161
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.070
Took the rematch net out even after the first fight with Tarver.

162
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.130
May you run for the Hills?

163
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.920
<v 0>You know what? I beat him. I wasn't myself. I'm going back up,</v>

164
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.640
took the rematch and then got knocked out. Yeah I didn't,

165
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.520
that's where I thought the re the first fight was earlier.

166
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.990
Now my brain scrambled here cause I thought that that was immediately after the

167
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:13.620
Ruiz fight that he got knocked out. Yeah, it was he, when he went back down.

168
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.740
Yes. So Ruiz, light heavyweight went down,

169
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.110
fought target with the first time they fought the rematch and then got knocked

170
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.670
out two times in a row.

171
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.760
They fought two times in a row and then they ended up fighting a third time,

172
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:25.320
like way down the road. Did they really?

173
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.050
I didn't even know they fought a third time in Florida.

174
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.840
The loss of the weight was a terrible idea.

175
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:35.841
And also let's be realistic about how we put that weight on is most likely there

176
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.010
was some Mexican supplements involved and if you're going to put that kind of

177
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.810
bulk on, you know, I mean, I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to say Roy Jones,

178
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:45.660
one of my heroes. Not disrespect. No, I hear you.

179
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.280
And I've heard people say stuff like that, but like that's my guy. I hear you.

180
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.280
I'm a kid, so I'm like, no. Again, I know. I get it.

181
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.760
I'm believing that it was just Roy Mackey shale stone and hard work.

182
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:00.960
I believe it is. It's possible. It's possible. But I mean, what did you like?

183
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.530
He was like 33 34 if he was, he was somewhere on it.

184
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.340
Very hard to put 25 pounds of muscle on it. Well,

185
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:11.520
it didn't really see he cut weight to make the light heavyweight limit. Right.

186
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:15.900
So you got to think he was probably like one 85 one one 90 probably. Yeah.

187
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:20.280
And so he really only gained maybe 10 15 pounds still. Yeah,

188
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.870
he was leaning as fuck. Yeah. He was pretty lazy though, too. Roy had it,

189
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:27.930
bro had that kind of bill. Oh, he was country strong. Very muscular. I mean,

190
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:30.510
he had crazy biceps and no tribe steps.

191
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.570
It was all just whipping last until the trial was weird. Right.

192
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.250
He had a crazy body. I didn't notice that dude. His, his body was very unusual.

193
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.360
The way he was built. Like he was all biceps. It was just whipping. You know?

194
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:46.740
He's just from whipping punches. [inaudible] shots. Yeah, no, he was phenomenal.

195
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:50.700
You got a picture of him, Jamie? Yeah. Oh, the TVs are out there. That's my guy.

196
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.440
No, I listen, I'm a gigantic Roy Jones jr fan. But I mean, I feel like that's,

197
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.770
there's one example right there. You see how gigantic his biceps are,

198
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.080
but you see it almost more while he's fighting.

199
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.600
I mean really had like a body built a hook.

200
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.720
You know what if Jones remained heavyweight, I mean, look,

201
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:08.580
he was so God damn fast as,

202
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:11.400
I mean John Ruiz just was Wiffen at air in that fight.

203
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.800
Most thing about them after the Ruiz fight is, you know,

204
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:18.690
we had the same manager, James Prince. There was a Tyson fight on the table.

205
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.080
Uh, and I believe I'm accurate when I say this.

206
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:25.980
It was somewhere around 40 million guaranteed. Whoa.

207
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.880
There's an upside to you. Stay at heavyweight, keep the weight on it.

208
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:32.670
Tyson wasn't quite Tyson at that time. Was still dangerous,

209
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.770
but wasn't quite Tyson. I think they were working toward it.

210
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.850
From what I've heard, Roy wanted more money. James Prince was like, bro,

211
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
take this 40 million. There's going to be an upside.

212
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.660
Is you in my ties and Roy Jones and Mike Tyson. Roy somehow said, Nope.

213
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.230
The fight will be there later on down the road. Put his attention toward it.

214
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:52.980
Antonio Tarver the rest is history. Wow. I'm kinda glad I didn't fight Tyson.

215
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.760
I wanted to see him fight Tyson and ride off in a sunset. Well, no, mass.

216
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.510
One more. Wow. Yeah, but he, I don't think he would have re,

217
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.400
I don't think Roy was ever really gonna ride off in the sunset.

218
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:04.870
He likes being Roy Jones jr.

219
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.620
So Mike Tyson Jones head 2003 fight card,

220
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.130
2000 T is that what around when he fought gelada they were supposed to start at

221
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.010
HBO paper view and they were supposed to be the first fight on it.

222
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.230
What happened?

223
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.230
Go to a Mike Tyson's Wikipedia did his record cause I think that was around the

224
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:24.400
time where he fought gelada he was still merkin people.

225
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.670
I mean he wasn't the Mike Tyson of, you know,

226
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:31.880
the later years he was still, I don't think Tyson fuck a lot of Diddy. Oh yeah,

227
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.560
he stopped him. Yeah. Gelada left the ring. He, he dropped him and hurt him.

228
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.700
Yeah. And GLAAD was like, fuck, this is his trainer called him a coward.

229
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.750
They use yelling, screaming.

230
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:43.960
When he hit him with one punch and dropped him and go out. I was like fuck this.

231
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.490
And he broke something in his neck. He broke his face and something in his neck.

232
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.300
Yeah. You gotta look three years before this? I was 2000 Oh, okay.

233
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.530
You never seen that? I probably did. I don't know.

234
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.170
I don't remember him fighting Tyson. Yeah. Gelada left the ring. He dropped his,

235
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:03.430
he says, well R T D what does that stand for? Retired.

236
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.530
Cause he quit. Yeah. And so the next dude too. Yeah,

237
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.540
like Tyson was last thing I remember there was a lot as his fights were ready to

238
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:14.320
go. Oh, those were Carlo blow. That's amazing. I remember gelada it was crazy.

239
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.300
He just decided to keep punching them in the deck.

240
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.370
Like I never saw anything like that in my life.

241
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.540
Like he fought him well in the first fight, but was hitting him.

242
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.660
He kept hitting them low.

243
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.510
Like whenever things would go bad for him looking for a way out,

244
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.820
he would just look for way out. And that's what he did with Tyson. Yeah.

245
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.950
Tyson dropped him. See if he could pull that up,

246
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.120
pull up the the Kao cause Tyson hit him with like a perfect right hand boom.

247
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:36.810
Dropped him and go out and got up. I was like fuck this.

248
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.090
His corner was screaming at him and he literally just climbed out of the ropes

249
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:43.640
and said, see ya just walked back to the dressing room. Some was off. Look,

250
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:47.050
a lot of man, definitely some was off. Well he was crazy.

251
00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:50.440
Like he had done a lot of crazy street shit too and been with all of his bar

252
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.290
fights and stuff like that too. Like he went down,

253
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.760
he'd just quit after the second round. You can find out I'm watching the video.

254
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.620
I don't see it. We'll pull on so we could watch it.

255
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.790
What are you watching by yourself?

256
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.200
You're still trying to interrupt the conversation. Yeah, he went down, man.

257
00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:06.760
I remember the fight very clearly.

258
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:10.690
He hit him with a clean right hand open around one here. Show it yo.

259
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:12.600
He was the one round fight. Two out fight.

260
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.090
I think he went down in the first [inaudible]. Here it is. Boom. When there,

261
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:20.590
right? Yeah, so gelada went down and at the end,

262
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.740
I think it was in between rounds. It was when he decided to bail.

263
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.720
I think that's why it's after the second here.

264
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:29.890
This is the second ending and he quits here. Guys come in.

265
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.000
Yeah. He's just like, no. Well we'd have to watch a little thing.

266
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.090
I remember that bro.

267
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.690
It was the right hand and liquor stores and everybody goes like, fuck you.

268
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.690
I'm out of here. He knew something was wrong too, and he had,

269
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:43.870
I think he had a fractured orbital and I believe there was something wrong with

270
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.250
his neck too. I get broke. A bone in his neck. I don't know.

271
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.370
Badass Andrew gelada for you man. Yeah. He was crazy. Yeah, it was some,

272
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:55.170
it was some offered him, I don't know. Whatever happened to him, you know?

273
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.370
I don't know. Probably not good. I hope. I hope. I hope he got some help.

274
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.040
You know what I mean? It's, you know,

275
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:05.630
when you think about a career as a heavyweight fight or two and all the heavy

276
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:06.500
blows at dot.

277
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.430
Chi took whatever mental problems he might've had were certainly compounded by

278
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.210
didn't help. No, no, no, no. You know, you,

279
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.520
you had an amazing career.

280
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.260
But one of the things that I think maybe people aren't as aware of is makes your

281
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:25.130
career even more incredible is that you fought for a long time with a bad

282
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:28.580
shoulder. Like if you go back and wants to crawl frosh fight.

283
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:31.310
I watched that getting ready for this. I watched it again.

284
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.990
You boxed the shit out of him with mostly your left hand. Yeah. It was crazy.

285
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:40.790
Yeah. 12 years old toward my subscapularis.

286
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.160
Um, which is 50 is responsible for 50% of the strength and the rotator,

287
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.200
um, didn't really know it at the time. We were told, Hey, he's too young.

288
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.010
You know, he shouldn't have surgery, just rehab it. Wrong advice.

289
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:59.000
Found that out, you know, 10 years later. But we just rehabbed it with,

290
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.540
you know, bands and strengthening exercises. But we never had surgery,

291
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:04.850
so that was always kind of my Achilles heel man. Like I,

292
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.450
there's been plenty of fights where I just fought one handed because it didn't

293
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:12.230
feel strong. It didn't feel like safe. I feel like anytime I would throw it,

294
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.660
it could pop out of the socket. Like that's how it felt.

295
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.670
So it had popped out before. It had not, Oh, I could, um,

296
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.780
got it fixed right around 2013 and, and it wasn't a hundred,

297
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:26.810
but it was better and I was able to finish out the rest of my career.

298
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.850
So it still not a hundred now. It's not a hundred, but I'll take it. Yeah,

299
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:35.420
I'll take it bro. Like I probably gained about 30, 40% with that surgery.

300
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:39.170
Like they grabbed it because the subscapularis was loose. It wasn't attached,

301
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:42.050
but it wasn't atrophied. It was still like a fat thriving muscle.

302
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:43.560
Just wasn't attached. My doctor was like, Whoa,

303
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:45.230
like is this ever popped out of the socket,

304
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.320
Dr. Michael Dillingham and in San Francisco? I was like, nah. He was like,

305
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.330
how like your shoulder capsule was like shot. The subscap is hanging. He said,

306
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.330
well, the good news is it's still a thriving muscle. Let's get it attached.

307
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.080
Pull me attached it like a four hour surgery, something like that.

308
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.800
One of those surgeries that you're not guaranteed to come out of the same, um,

309
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.010
and you had to wait for a month or so to see if the surgery took,

310
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.040
like if everything would mend and kind of get, you know, kind of gets stronger.

311
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.120
It took man. And like I said, I'll finish out the rest of my career strong. Wow.

312
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:18.140
So how long was the rehab? Probably about eight months. So you went from,

313
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.200
it was about 2012 to 2015 where you didn't fight very often.

314
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:25.730
Is that, was that very 10 frequently? Yeah.

315
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.990
Was that because of the combination of a lawsuit? Uh, and the injury? Yeah.

316
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.670
It's kinda like back to back blows.

317
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.050
So for eight months you're rehabbing it and just still like,

318
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:38.510
when did you know that for sure you're gonna be able to come back,

319
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.710
you kind of turn a corner and rehab, you know, three, three month Mark,

320
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.330
you know, four month Mark. You kinda realize that dude. Like, I'm, I'm,

321
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.080
I'm good. Like I'm not where I need to be, but like I'm, I'm headed there.

322
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.170
So probably about that time,

323
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:51.060
about halfway through you realize that you're going to be okay.

324
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.190
It's just gonna take some time to fully get the strength back.

325
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.290
But even my next fight against Edwin Rodriguez,

326
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.080
like I still didn't throw it and I didn't realize I didn't throw it until I

327
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:00.270
watched the tape. I watched the tape, I was like, Hey,

328
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.920
you still just like a one hand that affair.

329
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.890
And then after that thing about injuries is weird.

330
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.000
Like that 12 month period for me has always been like, just like the sweet spot.

331
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.610
So I got to that 12 month period with the shoulder and all of a sudden my

332
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:14.910
overhand right came back, hadn't thrown over here, right. In 10 years, you know,

333
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:17.100
my, the power am my right uppercut came back online,

334
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.350
told this is getting better. So after that,

335
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.230
then you started to see that thing flying and started whistling.

336
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.180
And ironically enough, my last fight,

337
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:26.760
that was the punch that started all the trouble for Sergey Kovalev.

338
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:32.090
Well it's interesting because you were so successful with one hand,

339
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:32.761
you know,

340
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:36.690
it makes you wonder like w how goddamn good would you have been if you had two

341
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:40.860
hands or was it your left hand was so educated.

342
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.150
One had to be had to be, but one of the things you were so good at man was a,

343
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:47.090
I don't have to tell you, you know, this was uh,

344
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:52.190
using your jab to shut down southpaw fighters shut down their jab and counter,

345
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.110
you know, and you just had that,

346
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.570
you had like extra juice with your left hand because you used it so much.

347
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.540
I had to like when you have one hand or one arm that that functions really well,

348
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:05.550
like you learned to make that thing great. Like, you know,

349
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:08.670
you overcompensate and that's what that left hand was overcompensation because I

350
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:11.010
didn't have the right hand to fall back on, you know,

351
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:12.690
but the whole South pole thing,

352
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.710
shout out to my boy Nick and ideas like in all the work we've done in camp,

353
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.850
like those guys got me ready for a lot and my South park opponents like you

354
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.710
know, midway through and toward the end of my career.

355
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.710
So a lot of work with those guys. And specifically Nate,

356
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.730
at a certain point I started working with Nick because he was doing other things

357
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:34.170
but Nate man and the volume and having to like deal with the awkwardness and the

358
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:38.310
height and the reach and like that got me ready for Chad Dawson. That's amazing.

359
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.240
How's my boy? Yeah, he's a tough dude man. You know,

360
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.180
watching him come back after three years out of the game and beat pedis like

361
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:48.230
that. I shot him a message. I was like, bro, you a bad man. Bad man,

362
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.370
like three years. Really. He's a bad man. Well,

363
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:55.371
I'm just happy that the UFC is finally recognizing the love and support that guy

364
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:58.020
has from the fans too. Because for whatever reason,

365
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:01.380
they were so high on Conor McGregor and all these other people. They didn't see.

366
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.530
One of the reasons why the Conor fight was so big was because of Nate Diaz.

367
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.870
They DHEAS is a fucking star. When he,

368
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:09.420
when they put his face on the screen for the Pettis fight,

369
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.450
I mean the arena erupted. It was chaos. They went nuts. Yeah,

370
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.990
I mean it, I don't know why they couldn't see it. I mean, Connor obviously was,

371
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:19.261
you know,

372
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.600
he was a little bit different and he brought what he brought to the table,

373
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:24.710
but probably would've been a good thing to try to balance them both out,

374
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:27.630
show love to, to Nate. But you know, he was like the rebel child, you know,

375
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.410
you say whatever came to his mind and you know, that the powers that beat,

376
00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:33.900
I don't like that. Um, I think he was a little overshadowed by his brother too,

377
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:37.200
because you know, when for awhile there's a superstar, there's something about,

378
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:40.320
I mean, and especially like his brother when he was fighting in strike force in

379
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:43.740
particular was one of the best fighters in the world. He was just amazing.

380
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.770
And then, you know, like, especially like, um, you know,

381
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.740
during like his title reign, like when he was at, at,

382
00:20:49.741 --> 00:20:51.670
at his peak and when he's fighting in strike force,

383
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.270
but for whatever reason they just, you know,

384
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.200
Nate just flew under the radar until that kind of McGregor fight the first one.

385
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.460
Yeah. And they recognize, yeah. I hope they capitalize on it now. You know,

386
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:06.260
while he still has a few years left. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's,

387
00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:10.510
it's that whole layoff thing and not even trying to stay relevant,

388
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:12.370
but just trying to keep your skills from enrolling.

389
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.470
Like that's a whole thing right there. And then,

390
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:18.130
and then trying to go perform after that amount of time. Like it's, it's hard.

391
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.570
Yeah. Me and have fallen from that. Yeah. Matt come back to saying, yeah,

392
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.370
he didn't lose a beat. It was crazy. He looked as good as ever.

393
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.820
It was amazing is though he seems to always be working and that's what saved me

394
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:30.760
when I was off. Like just always like chipping away in the gym, you know,

395
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.320
he's got, you know, him and his brother got,

396
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.560
they got their own schools and they're always in there grappling, working out.

397
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:39.130
So that's what saved him. Have you take off three years of nothing.

398
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.780
Two years of nothing. A year of nothing.

399
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:42.940
That's when you come back and you look like a totally different person.

400
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.240
I always point to Mohammad Ali when Muhammad Ali was forced to retire when he

401
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:50.440
took three years off and then he came back,

402
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.440
he did not look physically like the same guy. You know?

403
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.800
Who did he come back and fight? It wasn't Chuck Wepner.

404
00:21:56.801 --> 00:22:01.480
It was a what the fuck's is zero Foley? No, no, no, no, no. It was um,

405
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.790
fuck the, it's, it's a tragic guy.

406
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.180
A white dude. And then his brother was also like a,

407
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.800
how can I not remember his phone? They're gonna know you talking about man. Um,

408
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.490
on my mama, my mom, Jamie, pull it up. I know you're talking about to a Corey.

409
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.290
Yes. Jerry quarry. Yeah,

410
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:24.760
Jerry quarry and his brother apparently who only had like one or two pro fights

411
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:28.700
at all. Also had severe dementia by the time he died. How many fights?

412
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.200
His brother, his brother only had a couple [inaudible] and a couple of profiles.

413
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.710
So there's no Jim Wars if I'm, I think I remember correctly.

414
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.390
But Corey and his,

415
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:41.530
his dad apparently forced them to have that kind of fight style.

416
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.380
They just went to war all the time. Good bro. And yes,

417
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:47.710
and during the end of his career, the end of his life I should say.

418
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.660
But that's why I don't, that's why I don't, I don't subscribe.

419
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.400
Like here's the thing, like for me,

420
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:54.520
this is my view on it is you love combat sports. If you love fighting,

421
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:56.530
if you love boxing, like you enjoy it all.

422
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.870
Like I love the guy that has to take two to get one.

423
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.810
But I also loved the master and I'll just speak for boxing. The,

424
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.710
the problem that we have is like we've ostracized the,

425
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.410
the master of the game instead of articulating what we're seeing or trying to

426
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:14.950
articulate what we're saying and leaving that, you know, leaving it right there,

427
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:17.320
let it be what it is and let the fans decide what they like and don't like.

428
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.600
We tried to tell the fans what they should like, ah, you know,

429
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.220
and this is boring. Oh, hold on.

430
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.610
That's the guy that's going to be speaking properly when all of a sudden done

431
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.290
this guy. Hopefully he is too,

432
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.530
but the likelihood is a lot less because he'd take given two to give one,

433
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.570
but as soon as that guy gets knocked out,

434
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.190
then all of a sudden everybody turns on. Yeah.

435
00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.430
So I'm thankful that when I walked into the gym for the first time,

436
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.680
my dad was scouring for a trainer who could teach his son how to hit and not get

437
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:46.010
hit. He saw verge who became my godfather and has been my trainer, you know,

438
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.770
from my whole career. He said, he said, man, how was it? You know,

439
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:51.740
I'm a fan of Muhammad Ali. He said, I've had 15 you know,

440
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:53.180
amateur fights as a heavyweight.

441
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.570
Can you teach my son how to hit and not get hit and viruses.

442
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.860
That's my specialty. But just think of my dad was on something else.

443
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.650
What if my dad was making my son tough? Yeah.

444
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.390
I want him to take it and dish it out. Right.

445
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.690
I may not be sitting before you right now and if you did it,

446
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:10.860
it would probably be a different kind of conversation. You know,

447
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:13.040
Virgil Hunter is a special guy. He really is.

448
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:15.410
You can tell when you hear him talking, you know,

449
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.310
when you hear him talk about the game and the way he would formulate game plans

450
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:22.970
and strategies, you know, so you know, I remember,

451
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.100
I think it was a Chad Dawson fight.

452
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.340
I think it was that when you knocked out Chad Dawson, when you know,

453
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:33.110
you could see the look in his face of happiness and accomplishment.

454
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.760
But also we got through the danger. Yeah, we did it. It's over.

455
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.510
But game accomplished. You know, when you, when you had a special relationship,

456
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:46.511
whether it's an MMA or whether it's unboxing those special relationships between

457
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:49.580
a trainer and a fighter, they're so valuable. It's, it's,

458
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:52.040
and to me as a person who loves to watch the sport,

459
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.630
I appreciate them so much because I know that like you could get there on your

460
00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:57.650
own. You know,

461
00:24:57.651 --> 00:25:00.830
you can get there and have like fuse with your trainer and breakup.

462
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.960
You can get like Kovalev love does, you know,

463
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.990
like Cove loves John David Jackson for a while and you know,

464
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:10.991
now I like that he's with buddy McCart but it's better if you have a real

465
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.260
harmonious relationship with a master. Cause that's what Virgil Hunter is,

466
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:19.040
is a master. He understands the game. He understands it inside and out. Yeah.

467
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.820
One thing he used to always tell me, and I never looked at it like that,

468
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.110
he was like, son, my, my, my sole purpose,

469
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:27.200
my main focus is to get you home safe to your family said,

470
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:28.490
it's not for us to win championships.

471
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:32.090
It's not for you to be all everything because it gets you home to Tiffany.

472
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.880
And those kids safely. And when he said that,

473
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:37.700
it just put it all in perspective for me. He's a competitor,

474
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:40.490
he wants to win but not at the expense of my Hill.

475
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.980
And because he taught me the right way,

476
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.620
we got the winds and the belts and everything anyway,

477
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.990
and then I was also able to go home to my family.

478
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:51.320
So that's amazing relationship. You know,

479
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.210
one of the things that always stood out to me about you was how composed you are

480
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.460
and you rarely get emotional. You know?

481
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:00.580
Even like I remember when you fought Carl frosh,

482
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.870
Carr Foche hit you clearly after the bell.

483
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.120
Clearly in a fight you were dominating and you just went like this.

484
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.440
[inaudible] you said you didn't even get mad, you didn't go fuck you,

485
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.180
you did nothing. You took that punch,

486
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:15.200
you just went turned and just went back to corner. Like it never happened.

487
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.210
Like you just just wiped it clean.

488
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:19.550
Like that's not going to benefit me to get upset here.

489
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.160
How did you develop that kind of composure?

490
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.010
I think one thing that my dad and verbs did really well from me and my brother

491
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.800
Jonathan who box with me for many years, uh,

492
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.670
they gave us mentor reps like,

493
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.600
like I'd be driving in the car or riding in the car with verge and my dad and

494
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:40.430
they'd be telling me, listen man, when you get in that ring,

495
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:42.410
when you spot a Damien listen, that dude tried to hit you low,

496
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:43.890
you make sure you get your respect.

497
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.070
<v 1>You don't accept this in the ring. Like this is,</v>

498
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.630
these are things that I was taught. I was like,

499
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:53.631
I was taught to be a warrior at a young age and oftentimes trainers will train

500
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.220
the body, but they don't train the mind. So plus you and also life experiences,

501
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.530
things that I've been through with my mom and my dad and just,

502
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:04.410
just all that kind of stuff. Plus my internal makeup, the way, you know,

503
00:27:04.411 --> 00:27:06.870
God made me all of that combined.

504
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.660
I never had to be the loudest talker in the room because I knew that all the,

505
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.780
all the stuff, the real stuff is in me. It's not on me.

506
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.460
So I'm the tight that you hit me like that. I'm going to smile at you.

507
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.240
I got you. We got another round of Pfizer. So my, my,

508
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.780
my anger, my get back.

509
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.630
I'm gonna get it within the confines of these rules,

510
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.760
but you're going to feel me. Kovalev knocked me down. All right bro. I got you.

511
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.510
I smile. You're embarrassed, you're mad, you're frustrated,

512
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.460
you're everything in that eight seconds at eight counts, you're getting,

513
00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:45.840
you feel all every emotion you could possibly feel. But inside I knew,

514
00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:48.960
like now you're gonna have to knock me out because I'm coming to get it.

515
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.770
So some of it is he Nate, some of that was taught.

516
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.160
And then throughout the course of my life and career, I was,

517
00:27:56.161 --> 00:27:58.920
I was given the mentor reps a son. Watch him right here.

518
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.700
Watch how someone so pushed his hand down and he got right back in his face,

519
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:03.271
not out of the room,

520
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:07.890
but in the me teaching me and showing me in highlighting what a strong mind was

521
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.910
and what a weak mind was. And typically the weak mind was the loudest talker.

522
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.270
Now, don't get me wrong, I love, I got, I can talk to talking back it up.

523
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.270
It's not a lot of those in the game now MMA or boxing.

524
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.720
So I'm afraid of the guy who's not saying very much the guy that's hard to read.

525
00:28:24.301 --> 00:28:26.370
The guy we were trying to figure out, man, is he what? What's up with him?

526
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.950
That's the guy I'm concerned about the loudest talker.

527
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.180
I used to get excited when guys used to just go over the top. I'd be like, man,

528
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:37.850
this dude, I gotta keep talking. I got him. Same thing with Coppola.

529
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.980
Fought the first fight. Clothes could've went either way. Uh,

530
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.790
but from the time the first fight ended until the time,

531
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.470
the second second fight started.

532
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.610
I learned more about that guy in that period of time than I did in any around

533
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.444
that I fought him in.

534
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.650
He said so much and I was poking holes in and I was quiet and I was just sitting

535
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:59.310
back and everybody was misreading the silence. Oh. Or it's scary.

536
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.930
He's not going to check the email. I'm just sitting there like, you know,

537
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.920
taking notes, man. This guy. Keep talking, keep talking.

538
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.910
He was just saying things where I was like, this is a weakness. Now,

539
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:11.460
if he would've said, look, I felt like I won that fight.

540
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.290
I felt like they robbed me.

541
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.980
I'm coming back to get it and then went silent when dark. Now I'm like, man,

542
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:19.950
this dude is getting ready. We gotta, we gotta tighten up. Kept talking, man.

543
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.010
Sometimes that talking to reveal a little bit too much about yourself.

544
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.890
What did you see from the talk and just excuse making,

545
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.200
he didn't give me any credit. He started, I mean if it wasn't the written,

546
00:29:31.201 --> 00:29:34.020
I'm exaggerating, but just for the, for the case of emphasis, you know,

547
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.230
if the ring lights weren't too bright, the referee was against them.

548
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.060
If it wasn't the referee, it was the judge is like,

549
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:42.820
he never owned up to anything that he did wrong.

550
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.660
But if I go back to the research that we did about him before we even fought him

551
00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:51.250
the first time, that line double what we heard. The guy, he doesn't, he doesn't,

552
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.830
he doesn't take ownership of anything. He blames everybody.

553
00:29:53.831 --> 00:29:57.190
Anytime anything goes wrong. He's a front runner. He's a bully. He's this,

554
00:29:57.191 --> 00:30:02.140
he's that. That confirmed everything we had heard. So you're the crusher.

555
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.420
You're Sergei Kovalev. You knocked me down in the second round,

556
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.680
not the 11th the second round you were supposed to finish me, sir.

557
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.650
The fact that we're even talking about a fight being close and the fact that I

558
00:30:15.651 --> 00:30:20.350
finished the fight that's bothering you, that, that, that, that's a,

559
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.490
that that's, that's chipping away at this whole crusher thing that you've been,

560
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.550
that you've been living on. And he couldn't handle it. And instead of owning it,

561
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.430
he blamed John David Jackson. He blamed Ms. Guy. I blame that guy.

562
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.250
That's a sign of weakness, man. Not striking. Mm.

563
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:37.420
Were you impressed with him getting through the eighth round against yard and

564
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.900
his last fight? I wouldn't say impressed. I mean, listen,

565
00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:44.410
he hasn't gotten where he's gotten by not being tough.

566
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.210
So generally speaking, he's tough. He's a tough individual to a point.

567
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.060
I wasn't surprised. I was just, I was like, dude, if you ever,

568
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:59.200
if a fighter has ever been saved by the bale, you were just saved by the bail.

569
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:02.110
Like you were a punch punch or two away from getting, you know,

570
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.250
getting stopped in your home country and in your home, your home city, hometown.

571
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.030
That was the only kind of like jarring part of it. Um,

572
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.980
and in my next door was Kenny recovered.

573
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.250
Is he going to be able to physically recover it then psychologically come back

574
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.130
and try to get back with y'all took from him in that round and he did that.

575
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:22.450
So he showed me that he's still got something in the tank, but he, he, he's um,

576
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.010
he was the right way to say it. He's fading fast.

577
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.730
Like he's fading right before our eyes. He doesn't have the reaction.

578
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:33.550
He doesn't have. I still very good and you still,

579
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:35.980
you still can beat a lot of guys, but he's fading fast.

580
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:37.510
If there's a Canelo fight on the table,

581
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.570
I think you should take it and ride off in the sunset, man. Go enjoy your life.

582
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.450
Well,

583
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.490
it was interesting how you exposed him in the second fight because the body

584
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:48.730
shots, the body shots have been a weakness.

585
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.750
Like since then everybody is kind of compromised his body,

586
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:54.790
they've found what you found out.

587
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.660
Is that something you knew going into the second fight or did you know it in the

588
00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:00.700
first fight? Like when, when do that in the first way?

589
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.370
Did you problem with me in the, in the first fight? Um,

590
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.240
first couple of rounds I was thinking too much and as dude came out fast,

591
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.780
so I'm thinking like I'm trying to get my range and he's like, boom, boom, boom.

592
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.850
And he's, it's not that he's like this crazy power puncher,

593
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.890
it's just that he's sharp and he's accurate. So I'm like catching shots,

594
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.890
I'm getting hit with jabs, I'm trying to figure,

595
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.750
he didn't give me a chance to think and then boom,

596
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.430
I got hit with the right hand and I'm like, I said, bro.

597
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.010
So that was the best thing that could have happened to me. Like I said earlier.

598
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.250
And then you saw the body attack get implemented.

599
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:31.750
So that was always the game plan.

600
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.500
I won the second fight with everything that I did in the first fight.

601
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:37.690
Like we unlocked the code in the first fight,

602
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.810
but people couldn't get and knocked down.

603
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.220
<v 0>They failed to look at the, you know, the next 10 rounds. But yeah,</v>

604
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:46.820
the next 10 rounds you started to take over and you were solving the riddle.

605
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.970
It's interesting the, the,

606
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.940
the difference in power punchers like there's levels of power punchers yeah,

607
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.790
we always thought of him as this power puncher but cause the crusher knocked a

608
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:59.420
lot of people out. But then there's like a Julian Jackson dear level,

609
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.620
there's a different, some people just go stiff and George Foreman. Yes.

610
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.270
Like George could kill you. Yes. He hit the Joe Frazier fight like Jesus Christ.

611
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:12.710
Yes. Terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. George was one of them. I mean there was a,

612
00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:14.960
there's been a bunch of guys like that, but that's that,

613
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.190
that different level of power punching. I mean Ernie shavers was another one.

614
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:22.700
There was this certain guys, you know, I mean fuck man,

615
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:25.670
Thomas Hearns in his prime. The way, the way he put away Roberto Duran,

616
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:28.490
Holy shit. Cue you. And it also the torque,

617
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.630
you know the a there was so much distance between like the, the,

618
00:33:32.631 --> 00:33:33.830
the length of his arms,

619
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.420
the width of his shoulders and then black when that punch would come and cheeses

620
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.270
catch you on the and you got trouble get caught. And that last,

621
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.990
that last power area, yes, yes. It would just put the lights out.

622
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.060
Kurt Coalville have never had that kind of power. It was like a snapping power.

623
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.910
I mean listen he did have power I don't want to take away from no.

624
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.490
Yes he definitely beat a lot of guys in their home towns.

625
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.580
Home countries like an S a reason why like at a certain point in the fight you

626
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:01.370
would see him hit a guy and then all of a sudden their body language is

627
00:34:01.371 --> 00:34:02.204
different.

628
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.540
And I think one thing that was lost on my whole career that nobody ever talked

629
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:07.230
about was I probably had one of the best 10

630
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.680
<v 1>in the sport of boxing over the last, you know, at that time,</v>

631
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.260
10 years like I had beaten the best,

632
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.980
the heaviest punchers in the game and in my weight class. Like,

633
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:18.860
if you look at Kovalev out of all the damage that he's done in the light

634
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.970
heavyweight division, he had 20 rounds.

635
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.940
He had one moment, he didn't have a wobble,

636
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.340
he didn't have a sh he didn't shake me up anywhere,

637
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.900
be one moment and it was a flash moment. So just quantify that like a guy who,

638
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.970
cause they was the crusher, like he is who he is.

639
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.540
He had one moment in 20 rounds. So a lot of it had to do with my chin.

640
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:42.620
A lot of it had to do with my toughness, um, which is also underrated and,

641
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.650
and I just like, I know this is going to sound dramatic.

642
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:49.940
I know it's gonna sound dramatic, but I didn't like to lose.

643
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.310
And for me it was kind of like either win or die. Like that's a fact.

644
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:59.300
Like that's how I felt. Like it wasn't that serious, but that's how it felt.

645
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:03.380
Like I always thought about Sunday morning like, dude, if you lose,

646
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.050
it's going to be a crazy ride home on that plane.

647
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.660
Family's going to be looking crazy, feeling bad.

648
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.330
Everybody's going to be looking at you different like,

649
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.650
and you're going to feel crazy.

650
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:17.651
Like I remember being curled up like in a ball on a Southwest flight coming back

651
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:20.870
from the next of Kansas. Uh, losing my, the,

652
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:25.460
the last fight ever lost against John ravish, a guy from Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

653
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:30.510
14 years old, 14 that is hilarious. 14, 14 years old,

654
00:35:30.511 --> 00:35:34.250
retired, never lost again. And John was,

655
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.740
it was a 14, 15 year old bracket.

656
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.660
So he was a little bit older and he was kind of a stocky kid again,

657
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:42.540
country strong. And we were watching these other ones separate back.

658
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.100
So you know, it's like a five day tournament,

659
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:45.960
you could fight four to five times and get to the finals.

660
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.610
And I'm looking at him and I was a little bit intimidating.

661
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.210
He didn't punk me like, Oh, I'm scared to death. But like I was like, man,

662
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:55.044
I'm a little leery.

663
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.990
And he was knocking guys out and I was decisioning guys along the way.

664
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.070
It could have went either way. I think he wanted a three, two decision,

665
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.340
three judges. One his way too. Judges went my way, but that was I.

666
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:06.780
But if I was honest with myself,

667
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:09.930
like I got beat before the fight and at that moment,

668
00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:14.170
like fill in the way I felt coming home, I made up my mind like, dude,

669
00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.350
as much as that's up to me, like that's never gonna happen again.

670
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.560
Like I can't control every, every aspect of the fight gang stuff happens.

671
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.560
But it's not going to be because you beat me before the fight.

672
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:28.380
I can't live with this anymore. So that was my motivation, man,

673
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:31.800
that just the drive, like it was like win or die. And then,

674
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.790
and then here's the thing about boxing. The only, I don't know about MMA,

675
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.620
but the only sport that I know of where one loss changes your pay scale.

676
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.430
Like if you have a minimum, I, Hey, you went to title,

677
00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:47.250
your first defense is this second defense is that these are your minimums.

678
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.920
We'll negotiate beyond that. You know, whatever, whatever.

679
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.010
Go ahead and lose one that don't get cut in half.

680
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.670
So a lost literally takes food off my family's table.

681
00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.240
I also knew that my critics and my supporters, but namely my critics,

682
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.160
they had a front row seat every fight

683
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.020
[inaudible] at the time they're looking down or looking up, looking down,

684
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.330
look and get in a ring. You know,

685
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:12.240
before the first bill would would ring and I go around and kind of just filled a

686
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:14.910
ring out and kind of look out and I'd always see them looking,

687
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.630
is tonight gonna be the night? So I had that weigh in on me.

688
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.080
I had the support is that believed in me and was riding for me. And I look,

689
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.570
you know, first couple of rows, my family's right there, my wife,

690
00:37:24.571 --> 00:37:25.740
my kids would always blow her a kiss.

691
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.450
Like all of this stuff was like tangible and real to me and that's the stuff

692
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:35.220
that would drive me. And so when I get knocked down by a Cova lip,

693
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:36.810
like that's fight or flight time baby.

694
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.340
Like whatever's in you just going to come out. If you got some turn in you,

695
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.750
that's the time you going to turn.

696
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.200
It's going to be self preservation mode and you're going to be,

697
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:49.890
so you're going to be more focused on surviving than you are trying to win.

698
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.790
And I think God, man, that, that, that he had his hand on me that night, bro,

699
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.680
and that what was in me was real and it was enough to break him.

700
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.980
And the rest is history, dresses, injury. It isn't,

701
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.530
it is amazing how much energy people get from haters. I mean,

702
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.240
I don't, I don't recommend reading negative comments or negative articles,

703
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:16.470
but it's amazing how people with a certain kind of resolve a championship

704
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:17.190
resolve.

705
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.160
We'll take that hater shit and you'll get up 15 minutes earlier than you're

706
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:23.820
supposed to and you'll have more intensity and you're shadowboxing and you'll,

707
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:25.680
you'll just push harder. You'll feel it.

708
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.540
But I don't want to give the haters too much credit that it's, well,

709
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.430
it's all you. I don't want to give too much credit. They gave you fuel though.

710
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.290
But it was, it was weird though, and I don't even know how to quantify.

711
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.550
I don't even know how to like explain it, but like early in my career, uh,

712
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:45.430
they got a lot more credit and you know, I got great mentors,

713
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:49.120
man. Um, my pastor, Napoleon Kaufman, former Raider, um,

714
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.470
it's a great man of God. Just a great, great man. He would always call him like,

715
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:56.980
man, pastor man, they're hating on me. And he'd be like, listen son, listen,

716
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.330
stop giving these people all this credit, man. He said, listen man, they got,

717
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.350
they can't do anything to you unless God allows it, man.

718
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:06.910
Stay focused on what you gotta do.

719
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.350
So I started to get it as I evolved in my pro career and as I started to mature

720
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.820
as a man, so I knew they were there. That element was always going to be there.

721
00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:18.610
But I started letting that element of work for me. Like I wouldn't, like,

722
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.380
I wouldn't just, you know,

723
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.710
just just be enamored with it and I wouldn't just sit there and read comments

724
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:26.020
and stuff. You know, frankly, the last three or four years of my career,

725
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:30.220
I didn't read a mention, not one mention on Twitter.

726
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:32.620
I didn't look at comments on Instagram. Every now and again,

727
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.693
some would slip through,

728
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.900
but I knew they were there and I knew generally what was being said.

729
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:42.130
I knew generally what the articles in the headline would read. So it was there.

730
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.610
But the real driving force was the people that were riding for me,

731
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:47.590
fighting for me, supporting me, believing in me.

732
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.430
That element was there and I was going to address that element through my

733
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:54.580
performance, but they didn't. I don't want to give them too much credit though.

734
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.850
They don't deserve that much because they don't deserve that much credit.

735
00:39:57.851 --> 00:39:59.980
But they're good. That are good to have something there.

736
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:03.400
But you were very wise in the way you manage.

737
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.220
They're influenced by not reading those comments. Not all the time,

738
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:08.530
but like I got the revelation, like I said, at a certain point, like, man,

739
00:40:08.531 --> 00:40:12.880
I'm done with this, bro. Not doing this. I only started to read comments again.

740
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.531
Um, frankly,

741
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:18.160
I didn't watch boxing for the past three or four years of my career really.

742
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:23.410
And I'm a boxing buff. Why didn't you watch? I was burnt out.

743
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.900
The opinions, the biased, the, the, the double standards,

744
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.760
good stuff to boots. I would just burn.

745
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.630
And it was so weird for me because I'm the guy that would break his neck to go

746
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:38.830
watch Tuesday night. Gillette fights as a kid. I gotta get back, dude,

747
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:40.420
you don't even know who's fighting. It doesn't matter.

748
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:43.990
It's two guys in the ring. I'm watching it Friday night fights for many years.

749
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.980
I was over it going through what I went through with the lawsuit going through

750
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:49.210
what I went through with the injuries,

751
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:52.900
the highs and lows and everything in between. I was just burnt out. What,

752
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.770
can you refresh my memory? The loss. It was a promotion lawsuit that lose. Yeah,

753
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:59.530
yeah, it was, it was, uh, you know, I can't get too much into it,

754
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:04.090
but it was just something that man, I just, I fought for myself and you know,

755
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:07.300
but it was, it was a long two year journey. Um,

756
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.560
on my best day, I'm like, you're doing the right thing. So stay, stay,

757
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:13.750
stay in the race, keep fighting. It may not look it.

758
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.170
It may not be going your way now, but just staying like you're not fighting.

759
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:20.440
Money's not coming in, but just stay the course. You're doing the right thing.

760
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:24.280
On my worst day, I'm like, bro, you blowing it. You getting a rust on you.

761
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.530
You know people are writing hot war would rather fight in the courtroom than

762
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.800
fight in the ring. And I'm like, look, that's not, Hey, I'm just trying to,

763
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.260
I'm trying to fight for what I believe is true. So, but, but I grew up a lot.

764
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.520
But coming out of that I was like, man, I'm done with all that stuff man.

765
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:40.280
Like I don't know how many years I got left in this sport, but I'm,

766
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.800
I'm not focused on y'all. I got to focus on me.

767
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.330
And it wasn't until I retired and got full time in a broadcasting and

768
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:50.240
commentating that I started to watch again. I started to, you know,

769
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:51.860
understand who was out there on the, you know,

770
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:55.370
in the landscape and researching it. But I didn't watch it for many years.

771
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.320
That's crazy. Yeah, I was done. It makes sense.

772
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:57.740
<v 0>I mean,</v>

773
00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.250
you probably in your early days were so hungry for boxing because you had so

774
00:42:02.251 --> 00:42:05.340
much desire that you wanted to watch it all the time. Excuse me.

775
00:42:05.341 --> 00:42:07.920
But the amount of effort required to become a champion,

776
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.340
that you start to see the behind the scenes though. Hmm.

777
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.330
<v 1>Then you grow up and you see the business side and you see the dark side.</v>

778
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:17.090
It's like [inaudible] it's different.

779
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.470
<v 0>That darkness, dark side. Yeah. There's a lot of that man in boxing. I mean,</v>

780
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:25.790
it's historical that Don King, Mike Tyson stories, the, I mean,

781
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.150
there's so many stories like the man Don King, Muhammad Ali,

782
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.900
there's so many stories like that. It's, it's so sad.

783
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.340
It's an awful side of the business. Now, when,

784
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.620
what was this before or after the super six tournament? Which one?

785
00:42:41.621 --> 00:42:44.530
That all this was going on with your lawsuits? It was after, shortly after.

786
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.070
So the super six tournament though was where people knew you were an Olympic

787
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:52.040
gold medalist, but that was where like coming to that,

788
00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:53.080
who was the famous favorite?

789
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:59.320
<v 1>Uh, the favorite was just kinda like threefold, but it was Kessler.</v>

790
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.810
Um, Arthur Abraham was dominant at one 60. He had just moved up to 68,

791
00:43:04.811 --> 00:43:06.640
so everybody felt like it was a foregone conclusion.

792
00:43:06.641 --> 00:43:10.540
And he was gonna dominate at the heavier weight class called frosh was the WBC

793
00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:13.990
champion. But he was still kind of like relatively unknown. Like, you know,

794
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.260
he had potential, had a belt, but w you know, he was probably, you know,

795
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.090
I don't know the third favorite. And then you had, uh,

796
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.230
Andre derail.

797
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.520
Obviously you had myself and you had your main Taylor and the Americans,

798
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:30.010
or at least this is how I viewed it. We were just like,

799
00:43:30.011 --> 00:43:33.340
we were just there to make an interesting, it wasn't about us. It was the,

800
00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:35.740
it was the Europeans party. Um,

801
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.950
and it's funny because almost didn't fight in a tournament.

802
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:44.430
I was in Mexico on vacation and I'd been hearing about the super six,

803
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.790
but internally, me and my manager, he was like, Dre, I don't,

804
00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:50.320
I don't think his things will come together. These guys are fighting it as,

805
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.020
Hey man, go enjoy your vacation. So I did that. You're right.

806
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.570
I flew in in San Diego,

807
00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.490
we drove to Mexico and I ended up getting like a double ear infection. Uh,

808
00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.600
I was messed up from the ocean. I probably just something like that. Yeah.

809
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.570
It just kinda came upon me. I don't know. I don't exactly know the origin of it,

810
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.750
so I'm like, I had a little bit of internet access.

811
00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:12.730
I'm looking at something like that. Hey, these guys at wait,

812
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.660
they're doing a kickoff press conference in New York. So I called James.

813
00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:19.180
I'm like, yeah, Jay, what's up? He was like, Hey man,

814
00:44:19.181 --> 00:44:22.270
you need to get there like ASAP, bro. This thing's going down. I'm like, Whoa.

815
00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:23.830
I'm like, you told me it wasn't going to happen. He's like,

816
00:44:23.831 --> 00:44:28.240
I didn't think it was so, but he was also like, you know what though?

817
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.790
If you don't want to go, it's all good. We'll figure it out. So I'm like, man,

818
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:35.700
I don't want to go with my family. I call verge.

819
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:39.810
I give him the whole spiel. It's probably like two, three times in my life.

820
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:43.890
He's had this kind of tone. He was like, listen son, you need to get on a plane.

821
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.050
You're not going to make the New York press conference.

822
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.610
The next stop is Germany are there. Abraham's home country. Get there.

823
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.460
I'm like man, I'm in. You know, I'm with my family. Give him the whole piece.

824
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.840
They get there. So we pack up, we drive two or three hours to San Diego,

825
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.590
get on a fly job. My family back to the Bay area, boom, dropped him off,

826
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:05.460
get on a flight or red eye that night, double ear infection, wake up in Germany.

827
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.180
And that was my, that was their second stop.

828
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.850
But that was my first stop and that's when I really got the revelation that man

829
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:12.930
they, this is a joke, like, like this,

830
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.200
they think that me derail and Taylor like we're just gone.

831
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.390
Like that's when I took exception and I was,

832
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:21.480
when I really kinda like realized that dude like this, this is either,

833
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:23.160
this is going to be a sink or swim moment for you.

834
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.250
Either you're going to get like, I could've got ruined in a super six.

835
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.590
Like it could've went a whole nother way.

836
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.670
Or what I knew was in me was going to be, you know,

837
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.010
displayed and shown to the world.

838
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.430
And so when you beat Kessler and you won your first title,

839
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:43.770
that had to be a beautiful moment. I mean, real unreal,

840
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:47.730
unreal. And it was in my home town, like the same arena,

841
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:49.920
Oracle arena where the warriors had played for many, many years.

842
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.060
And I'm kind of salty. They're leaving man, chasing Rena. I'm not happy, man.

843
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:56.160
I'm not happy. Um,

844
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.840
I used to pass by that arena on a highway eight 80 going to King's gym and I

845
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:03.210
used to look and it'd be, it'd be on the right side and I'd be like,

846
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:06.330
man of ours, I wonder if I'm a fight. Then one day he said, baby fight.

847
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:10.710
There you go. Headline. And I was like, really? I'm talking 12, 13 years old.

848
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.650
Wow. I'm like, man, I'm,

849
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:18.690
I'm a headline and Kessler's arrogance allowed that fight to take place in my

850
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.210
hometown. He had more knockouts than I had. Victories I guys is dope. Like I'm,

851
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.480
I'm not going to beat him. I beat him in his home town. Uh, so we fought there.

852
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.860
Uh, I think it was November 19. And, uh, just unreal man.

853
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.560
And like for a gold medalist, like,

854
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.780
like people don't understand the pressure you have coming into the game. Like,

855
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.360
like everything you do, well, you're expected to do well,

856
00:46:39.361 --> 00:46:41.610
but if there's one slip up now it's like, you know,

857
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.520
everybody comes out the woodworks. Huh? I told you it wasn't going to be that.

858
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.780
So to get the monkey off my back to win my first title was just that pressure,

859
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.120
like that release, the pressure would just immense.

860
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.000
I remember when I was a kid,

861
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.800
when the Olympic team had so many guys that went on to win world champions,

862
00:46:58.801 --> 00:47:02.100
like personnel Whitaker, was it the 76 Olympic team? 84, 84.

863
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.690
Pernell Whitaker, Mark Breland, you know, there was a,

864
00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.710
there was so many guys from that era that was Meldrick Taylor,

865
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.630
you know, uh, who else? Who else? Uh, Holyfield Holyfield was there,

866
00:47:15.631 --> 00:47:18.250
but I think Holly forgot does qualify. You got a silver, right?

867
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.610
Something happen when you,

868
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.770
you think about the amount of pressure that mean so many people were looking at

869
00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:28.710
those guys. And I remember when Brenan last tomorrow and Starling,

870
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.070
we got knocked up.

871
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.740
<v 0>Our mom's tall. I remember so many people were happy.</v>

872
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.640
They were happy that he lost like, ah, another Olympic gold medalists, you know,

873
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:38.530
he couldn't take him like God. First of all,

874
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:41.260
God damn Marlon styling was a fucking tail piece.

875
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.860
He was a killer and the super slick. Yup. You know, just a wheel,

876
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.570
seasoned knockout artists in an excellent boxer, you know? I mean, it wasn't,

877
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.950
that's just a great boxer beat another grain boxer.

878
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:59.240
But there was a weird feeling to it. Like people were happy that Brelyn loss.

879
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:03.520
I was like, wow, this is, that's crazy. Pressure is different. Yeah,

880
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.880
it's different. Um, and people talk about pressure all the time. Like,

881
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:08.750
how'd you deal with this? How'd you deal with that? Well,

882
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.600
I credit my faith in God and just, you know,

883
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:14.440
feeling like there was a purpose for me to be in the game as the foundational

884
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:15.380
reason. But the,

885
00:48:15.381 --> 00:48:18.080
the practical reason what I've been dealing with pressure since I've been in ma,

886
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.180
you know, since I've been a baby,

887
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:24.360
like having two parents who were drug addicted, uh,

888
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.230
at a young age and one is a functional addict. Um,

889
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.150
and my dad who raised me as a single parent and then my mother was a full blown

890
00:48:31.151 --> 00:48:33.670
addict for many, many years. She's clean now. She's doing good.

891
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.160
Like that's pressure started there.

892
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.150
Then like coming up throughout the ranks and like dealing with haters and all

893
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:43.960
this stuff in the gym, in your private gym, well not private gym,

894
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:48.220
but the gym that you train at and you've got some people that are with you and

895
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:50.920
this kid is going to be the next and you got some people over in the corner.

896
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:54.100
Mumbling kid ain't gonna be, y'all ain't gonna be nothing. He's all right.

897
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.170
Like you learn to deal with that stuff,

898
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:57.820
then they ain't going to the national tournament.

899
00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:01.150
You're dealing with people from all over the U S then you go into the world

900
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.730
tournaments. Like that's pressure. Then you get to a point.

901
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:07.420
So when I fought a guy like Sergei CoLab, I'd already seen him before.

902
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.050
I'd fought over live 1520 times and mercury already the big, you know,

903
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.820
menacing guy who everybody's afraid of. Like I've fought him before.

904
00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:19.030
I fought him in the Olympics. I fought three Russians in the Olympics.

905
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:23.830
So it wasn't that odd. I'm guaranteed to win, but I had seen that before.

906
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.320
Even the critics and all the P like we,

907
00:49:26.321 --> 00:49:29.500
I've been dealing with this stuff my whole life and,

908
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:34.360
and it wasn't anything new. Does, does it feel good? Absolutely not. I mean,

909
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:37.140
you, you, your hope is that everybody supports you, but you know as,

910
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.080
as successful as this podcast is, you got your bull birds,

911
00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.420
you have your critics, birds. I never heard them talk like that. Booboo birds,

912
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.910
you've got people that as soon as you slip up, ah, ah, I knew he was gone.

913
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.830
That's part of the game man. Yeah.

914
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.830
That must have enhanced your relationship with Virgil.

915
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:56.650
It must've because he believed in you. Yeah, of course.

916
00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.430
When you fought for the world title in that very arena where he said you are

917
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.240
going to be headlining when you were like 12, 13 years old,

918
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.780
what the fuck was that like? I must've been amazed. This a real man.

919
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:09.100
You're just trying to manage your emotions.

920
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:13.210
Like I remember the night before the fight, uh, I had to, I had my God,

921
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:16.690
Jack Edward Jackson man who's a great coach, great assistant,

922
00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.510
great strength conditioning coach, boxing coach from Houston, Texas.

923
00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:24.250
He'd been with me from day one. Um, I say, man, I gotta get out of the room man.

924
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:28.010
Like we, we, we, um, drove to trader Joe's just to get some, some, some

925
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.790
<v 1>cliff bars.</v>

926
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:32.510
I just needed to clear my head and I remember like talking to my uncle Bob,

927
00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:35.810
who you know, is my dad's best friend who, you know, it wasn't my blood uncle,

928
00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:38.220
but he's basically like an uncle to me. He was boxing fan.

929
00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:41.240
And I remember just like talking to him and him saying, baby,

930
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.540
tomorrow's your day. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be there front row baby.

931
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:45.763
Tomorrow is your day. Your dad,

932
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:49.790
your dad always dreamed about this moment and like just tears running down my

933
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:52.160
eyes because I was just feeling the pressure. I'm like, dude,

934
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:56.960
I'm getting ready to fight for a world title at home. Like the pressure,

935
00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:59.480
like you could cut, you can cut it with a knife. Um,

936
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:04.460
but to be able to bear up under it and, and, and to go get it done bro.

937
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.620
Unreal. Unreal. Could you couldn't, you couldn't script it any better.

938
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.750
Was the second fight with Coalville love your second most satisfying fight?

939
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.610
I like the first one better. The first five better. Really?

940
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.360
Because you managed to survive and come back and then start out pointing.

941
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.770
I just got it a different way. Hmm.

942
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:31.370
I got it a different way and like it's crazy that you liked that fight better.

943
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:34.760
Yeah. That's interesting. It's a lot about you. I love the moment with uh,

944
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.510
me and verge in the corner. Um, he showed his worth. I already knew what he had,

945
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:42.390
but he showed his worth. He said, baby, listen, I leave been knocked down.

946
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:47.260
SugarRae has been knocked down. They got up now you get up like that.

947
00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:48.740
That's what those are moments you live for.

948
00:51:48.741 --> 00:51:50.030
Like you don't want to be on the cameras,

949
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:51.650
but if you happen to find yourself there,

950
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.500
you want to know that your team has what it takes and you want to know that you

951
00:51:54.501 --> 00:51:57.200
have would have taken a second round. Bro.

952
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:01.010
I clawed back 10 rounds against that guy,

953
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:06.520
the biggest night in my life and then having to deal with everything afterward.

954
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:11.420
It built me, man, it made me strong like stronger and

955
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.990
that was just that, that, that,

956
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.510
that I won the second fight again with the first fight.

957
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:19.520
Like I already broke him in the first fight.

958
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.820
Something happened to him like right around a six round.

959
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.360
He was still trying to win to a degree, but I knew physically I was like, man,

960
00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:28.100
I got him. He's not the same.

961
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:31.190
So of course he's going to whine about the decision because it didn't go his

962
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:36.020
way. Um, but I beat him in the first fight. We only saw the,

963
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:39.080
the second fight was the window dressing. We just picked up where we left off.

964
00:52:39.081 --> 00:52:41.900
But everything that that transpired in the second fight really started in the

965
00:52:41.901 --> 00:52:44.150
first fight, the second fight. It's,

966
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.180
it was stunning to me when it seemed like he just quit because it didn't seem

967
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:53.000
like it. D I mean it almost seemed like a premature stoppage,

968
00:52:53.001 --> 00:52:55.710
but then you realize that he didn't want to fight any longer. Yeah.

969
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.930
Tony weeks did a great job. He saved Coke. I mean, you know, and in hindsight,

970
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.050
you know, you wish you would have landed the one shot and he went, you know,

971
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:06.130
you got knocked out and it was clear. But listen, man, um,

972
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.760
I'll all the excuses and stuff like I was thinking about this the other day,

973
00:53:10.761 --> 00:53:14.480
every big win that I've had, there was an excuse attached to it.

974
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:19.850
So you go back to Kessler. Oh, he headbutted me. He's fighting dirty. No,

975
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.340
I'm fighting in a style that you don't know how to deal with.

976
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.920
You look at call frosh. It was boring.

977
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.750
<v 0>Why didn't you make it more interesting? You look at Chad Dawson. Oh,</v>

978
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:33.670
he was waiting [inaudible] Chad Dawson called me out.

979
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:37.620
I was at home minding my own business and he said, I want to fight Andre ward.

980
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.330
I'll come down to his weight and I'll fight him in Oakland. You look at Kessler,

981
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.170
I mean you look at Coalville lip first fight. I got Rob second fight.

982
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.000
They cheated me. Come on y'all.

983
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.550
Every big win that Andre ward has cannot have an asterick next to it.

984
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:55.260
Like so either either.

985
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:59.640
I'm not the guy that my record says that I am or somebody is not being honest

986
00:53:59.641 --> 00:54:01.020
over here. You see what I'm saying?

987
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:05.010
But don't you think that's inherent with boxing when there's certain people that

988
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:08.940
don't ever want to accept defeat no matter what and when there's a situation

989
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.540
where there's a possible reason why they lost,

990
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:17.340
that didn't sort of fit into the rule books. Like he hit me low or they stopped.

991
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.830
It's too soon. Or the Kovalev fight.

992
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.680
You know like the second fight in particular, like the first fight.

993
00:54:22.681 --> 00:54:26.160
Maybe he could make an argument that he thinks he should've won a decision,

994
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.650
but the second fight, I mean he wasn't,

995
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:31.710
he wasn't jumping up looking to beat that eight count,

996
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.720
dust his gloves off and get back at it.

997
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.710
He was basically surrendering. He was done man.

998
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:39.840
Those body shots with everything,

999
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:43.200
people forget about the right hand that started all the trouble where he did the

1000
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:47.440
funny dance and then like the, the, the 15 unanswered shots after that. Yeah.

1001
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.510
Um, and I'll probably sound of the body shots that landed maybe one straight,

1002
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:55.440
a little low. But again, bro, your name is the crusher. Like,

1003
00:54:55.441 --> 00:54:57.660
like why like if you hit me low, like,

1004
00:54:57.661 --> 00:55:00.780
and I tried to be as fair as I possibly can. I'm coming to get that back bro.

1005
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:03.750
Like if it's, if I feel like it's intentional, like this accident, you know,

1006
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:06.500
I was all good, you know it happened. But if you're trying to like, like,

1007
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.200
like dethrone me or beat me from, from a foul, like I'm coming to get that back.

1008
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.700
Why all of a sudden, like all the people that said that, that, that, you know,

1009
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.640
you're not going to beat Kovalev you, you know,

1010
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.380
look what he did to this guy's gonna do the same thing to you. You're too small.

1011
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.710
Those are the same people coming to the rescue of a guy whose nickname is a

1012
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:25.920
crusher and who's missing and all this stuff I've been saying, you know, like,

1013
00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:28.320
like he should be able to defend himself.

1014
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:29.940
He should be able to get me off of him.

1015
00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:33.390
A little guy that just moved up from one 68 little old me

1016
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.040
was the thing about Cove live too. Like he killed a guy early in his career,

1017
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:41.010
right? Yeah. And that was something that, you know,

1018
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:47.090
that there's a feeling when a car has done that is there's a fear to facing that

1019
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:52.210
guy. And I had to face that fear. I had to face that fear. I'm human. Um,

1020
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.430
so that was presented to me, but that's where the mindset comes into play.

1021
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.680
That's where my faith comes into play where I'm like, listen man,

1022
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:02.550
unfortunately that happened to that guy, but you ain't doing it to me.

1023
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.080
Like that's the mindset part.

1024
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:08.850
Like if you allow that stuff to see Penn take root and start to fester in your

1025
00:56:08.851 --> 00:56:11.010
heart, in your mind, you'll never, you'll never get it.

1026
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.760
Get past fit the starting line. You'll go out there and be like, man,

1027
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:18.180
who was that dude that was performing that night? That wasn't me. Um,

1028
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:21.100
he was going to have to do something to me cause cause I was coming to whim.

1029
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.100
And again, it's not that I'm just, I'm not the toughest guy

1030
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.530
<v 1>in the world, but like I just believed what I believed.</v>

1031
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:31.050
I felt like I was there for a reason and unfortunately that happened to that

1032
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.340
young man, but I just didn't believe that was gonna happen to me.

1033
00:56:33.341 --> 00:56:36.790
And that's what I had to keep feeding myself in order to get past that and then

1034
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:40.300
go perform. Now how did you make the decision? You stop him in the second fight.

1035
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.040
How did you make the decision that that's it?

1036
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:46.750
It was almost it for me after the first fight. Really? Yeah.

1037
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:50.330
That's the closest I've ever, I've talked retirement in the past, uh,

1038
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.860
like internally with my wife and stuff. Um,

1039
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.560
but after the first fight, I don't know if it was, uh, I think it was physical,

1040
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:02.090
like all of the surgeries and rehab and just the years.

1041
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.170
How many different surgeries? Joe? About three. Which all in the shoulder?

1042
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:09.080
I'm not shoulders. Knee. Yeah. Yeah man. That's kiss or something. Yeah.

1043
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.980
At one ACO woman discuss. Yeah. Um,

1044
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:16.190
I think it was the physical part. I think it was just the,

1045
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.830
the toll of the sport and then may,

1046
00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.390
may maybe some of the reaction like, like, you know,

1047
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:25.780
for a split second I'm like, here we go again. Like, like it's always something,

1048
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.870
you know, I beat the guy that you guys say, I couldn't be Matt now.

1049
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.390
Now you know, people feel like I got robbed.

1050
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:34.510
Like that's a fight that could have went either way, you know, by pointed to,

1051
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.750
you can't, you can't have a polarizing opinion about, you may say, man,

1052
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:41.470
I thought Wardlaw I can live with that. But all the Rob stuff like,

1053
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.110
so I think it was a combination of just everything. I was like, man,

1054
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:46.540
I'm done man. Like I'm not doing this no more.

1055
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.090
I didn't do anything for three months after that fight.

1056
00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.230
And I remember going to speak to my pastor about it because he did the same

1057
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:54.430
thing. Like he, you know, he was all,

1058
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:58.240
everything at U dub play six years in the league and all of a sudden, boom,

1059
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.490
one day he was like, I'm done. And never looked back.

1060
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:04.240
So I went and sat with them and I was like, man, passion man. I don't know man.

1061
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:08.500
I think I'm done. And he's just listening. Look very wise man. And um,

1062
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:10.330
so I'm giving them the whole spiel. I'm like, man,

1063
00:58:10.331 --> 00:58:12.970
I haven't done it in three months. I've never done that. That's gotta be a sign.

1064
00:58:12.971 --> 00:58:16.450
I'm done. He said, you know what son? He said, I think, uh, he's,

1065
00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:18.340
I think you'll be fine if you, if you retire. He said,

1066
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:22.200
but I think you got one more left in you. I remember just,

1067
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.840
I thought he was going to side with me. I thought it would be like, yeah, sign,

1068
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:30.010
that's it. And I was a little disappointed, honestly. I was like,

1069
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.460
really? I was like, yeah, but I told you I hadn't done anything in three months.

1070
00:58:33.461 --> 00:58:35.920
He was like, Oh no, no, no. He said, once you get going,

1071
00:58:35.921 --> 00:58:38.710
you know the fire will be rekindled. Wow.

1072
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.940
So I took him at his word and I started to kind of get back going,

1073
00:58:42.941 --> 00:58:47.610
moving my body, and then that happened. I started to get that fire back. And uh,

1074
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.820
once we got the money right, I was like, I'm gonna do it again. Boom.

1075
00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:56.650
Won the fight. And I didn't know for sure, but I was kinda feeling like,

1076
00:58:56.651 --> 00:58:58.570
okay, well, you know, I felt like that after the first one,

1077
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:02.830
this may be it after the second one, but then the opportunity started coming.

1078
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.540
HBO had a three-five deal on the table and basically it was going to be a gimme

1079
00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:10.000
fight in Oakland at home. Kind of a celebration.

1080
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.810
I moved to cruise away against Tony bell. You probably in the UK.

1081
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.450
Did you want to move to cruiserweight? Yay.

1082
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.810
There was nothing else at light heavyweight.

1083
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.920
What about a rubber match that wasn't exciting for, you know, beat him twice.

1084
00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:25.190
It Kovalev have for a rubber man. No, no, really. I mean he will probably put,

1085
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.560
if somebody asked him like, you want to reimagine? Well yes,

1086
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:29.810
of course he didn't want it. He didn't really want it.

1087
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:35.050
So that was the three fight exit strategy with HBO gimme fight ally heavy or

1088
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:40.190
puck onto a catch weight at home away when they walk around the back then, yeah,

1089
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:45.170
about 85 so you would have had a gain weight out.

1090
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:48.600
I had to tighten myself up at 85 90 you're probably low weight. Yeah, yeah,

1091
00:59:48.601 --> 00:59:53.110
yeah. It's crazy. Weight limit is 90 it's 200 it's 200 yeah, I probably would.

1092
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.320
I probably wouldn't got to two though.

1093
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.780
High would have been on one 91 92 something like that.

1094
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.330
So that was a three five deal and then 35 was going to be Anthony Joshua.

1095
01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:03.380
I don't know if he would have been made. We hadn't even gotten that far,

1096
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:06.590
but that was our plan. Jesus Christ. Right.

1097
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.210
How much would you have gained to get up to heavyweight? Maybe two.

1098
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.280
That's it. Maybe too. I can't, I'm never going to be as big as you guys,

1099
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:20.000
so why would I weigh myself down? Right. Yeah. Very dangerous situation,

1100
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.680
you know? Uh,

1101
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:23.900
but that was something we were talking about and verge mentioned it in the

1102
01:00:23.901 --> 01:00:26.720
post-fight press conference with Kovalev. That guy's fucking gigantic,

1103
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:29.630
but we hadn't been, him being vert hadn't talked about like we talked about it,

1104
01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:32.680
but we didn't say we were gonna mention anything publicly. Oh.

1105
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.510
And then he came out with, I'm sitting there chilling out, just one of my,

1106
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:40.340
he's like, yeah, you only want Anthony Joshua like chill, bro.

1107
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:43.460
Like he's so much bigger than you. Yeah. It's all good though.

1108
01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:46.160
That guy's gigantic. I've been fighting big guys my whole life.

1109
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.770
I'm sure you have. So the three fight deal was on the table

1110
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:55.660
and Roman Gonzalez [inaudible] or [inaudible] coy,

1111
01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.750
[inaudible] Chi, sobering VSI side.

1112
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.440
We're getting ready to fight their rematch at the home Depot center.

1113
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:05.450
I think it was September 9th, September 6th. That was a Wednesday.

1114
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:10.630
I was supposed to be in LA to announce the new signing and get ready to call

1115
01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:14.910
that fight that Wednesday I come home and I'm kinda like, I'm,

1116
01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:17.630
I'm not Bullhorn, but I'm in tears. And I told my wife, I was like,

1117
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.880
I don't want to do it anymore. And even saying that sounded crazy to me.

1118
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:25.370
She was like, she was just real quiet. I'm thinking like,

1119
01:01:25.371 --> 01:01:28.700
why is he not saying nothing? I'm like, I don't think I want to do this anymore.

1120
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.540
And she said something she had never said previously. Typically she's like,

1121
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.830
Bay loo. It's not time. Come on, you gotta get up. I know you feel this way.

1122
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:39.320
I know you're by, but come on. I feel like you still got time in the sport.

1123
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.780
First time she ever agreed with me, she was like,

1124
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.170
I think the decision has already made, right. I was like, what

1125
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.140
should I think the decision has already made? She said,

1126
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.380
I've been looking at you throughout this whole day and some of the stuff you've

1127
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:54.080
been saying, and I've never really seen you like this. She said,

1128
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:58.370
I think it's already made. I took that out, bro. Started making phone calls,

1129
01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:02.120
call, call my lawyer who was, you know, one of my good friends, Josh Dubin,

1130
01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.960
said, Hey bro, I think that may be it for me. And he had been wanting me to be,

1131
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.570
you know, done. He was like, if you feel that way, bro, I'm gonna support you.

1132
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:12.290
Call my manager the next morning. And it took us. So I went, I went,

1133
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.390
I went that weekend and call the fight.

1134
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.740
We held off on the announcement and my lawyer just told HBO like, look,

1135
01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:21.840
he's going through some things. We're good. Give us a couple of days.

1136
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:24.750
So I got through that weekend and he said, do you still feel like that?

1137
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:28.940
Come Monday one. I was like, bro, I think I'm done. Long story short, uh,

1138
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:32.040
we ended up announcing it September 21st, so it was like a two week period.

1139
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:33.300
We are trying to keep it under wraps,

1140
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:36.330
but I was undoing all the stuff I was letting the necessary people know.

1141
01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:41.280
Rock nation, HBO, everybody know. And, um, the night before I announced it, man,

1142
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:45.550
me and my good friend, um, who is a director, he's also directing my doc, uh,

1143
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.350
Deontay Thompson. He, um, we put together this video,

1144
01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.040
it was like a legacy video where I had my young son,

1145
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.190
my middle son and my oldest son. And those are like, those are like, you know,

1146
01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:00.030
that was me at that point in time in my career and we did this whole video that

1147
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:02.870
I was going to announce my retirement with and um,

1148
01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.120
and actually have the doc that I'm working on right now is about this.

1149
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:09.720
Like why did the best fighter in the world of the world at that time walk away

1150
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:14.670
from the sport on top shot that video man, the day of my retirement, bro.

1151
01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:17.470
And the response was just overwhelming. You know, it was overwhelming.

1152
01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.190
Like I just couldn't believe the amount of people that were reaching out. And,

1153
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.260
and it was, it was, it was like good and bad.

1154
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:25.260
Like it was good cause I was getting support, but it felt like somebody died.

1155
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.150
Like I felt like I died, bro. I'm looking at, he's arrest in Pete,

1156
01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:32.060
like not literal rest in pieces, but like the comments were like Arestin peace,

1157
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:36.570
like, bro, are you? So I couldn't be like, man, I'm like ward, not you man.

1158
01:03:36.571 --> 01:03:38.880
Oh my God, man. And it was just,

1159
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:43.881
it was like just this huge reaction and it was overwhelming.

1160
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:48.210
Um, and in the two years that followed,

1161
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:51.480
like I said at the beginning of this podcast,

1162
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:55.170
harder than I thought it was going to be one of the hardest,

1163
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:57.360
if not the hardest thing I've ever tried, had to do.

1164
01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:00.780
And still like I still have to do, like it's a daily decision and be like,

1165
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:01.800
I'm not doing it no more.

1166
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.090
But one of the most rewarding man and it was a necessary evil.

1167
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.320
And I hope that one day, man, the young guys can look up one day and say, man,

1168
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:13.590
I'm gonna do the Andre ward. I'm done. I'm out. Like,

1169
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:16.950
how long do we have to do it before we feel satisfied? Look, bro,

1170
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:19.950
save your money if you don't, if you're not financially literate,

1171
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:23.190
go get some help. Um, ask questions.

1172
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.370
And as soon as you feel like you're not really there,

1173
01:04:26.371 --> 01:04:27.210
you don't want to do it no more.

1174
01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.460
<v 0>I don't have no son. I said, bro, there's other stuff you can do.</v>

1175
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:31.760
Hope to be an example in that area. Well,

1176
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:36.330
it's so important I think for there to be a guy like you because people always

1177
01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:39.120
have this narrative. Fighters always come back.

1178
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:43.770
They always fight like sugar Ray Leonard did when he fought, you know,

1179
01:04:43.771 --> 01:04:47.670
later in his career when he fought Zani Leilani,

1180
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.360
but then he went and fought. Yeah, the Terry Norris fight was hard to watch,

1181
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:53.990
man. And then, you know, Hector Camacho stopped.

1182
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.120
I mean it was like it got Camacho couldn't punch either.

1183
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:01.200
It was in his calf was all fucked up back then and Billy blanks were training

1184
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.700
them. You remember that? Yup. I mean,

1185
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.760
is this sad when you see these guys to still try to do it over and over and over

1186
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:12.450
again until the same story keeps repeating itself? When a guy like you,

1187
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.620
the,

1188
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.490
it was only Hagler before you Hagler was only the only guy living his lowest

1189
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.400
too. Oh, that's true. Lennox Lewis, a handful. Yes, a handful. Yeah.

1190
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.400
Lenox Hill was a brilliant guy too. You know, it's like plays chess.

1191
01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:27.940
He's articulate. He's like, he's an interesting,

1192
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:31.240
intelligent guy that just say, nah, we're good.

1193
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.770
As we did everything we need to do. We did everything we needed to do.

1194
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.530
The the having those guys like you is so important for young fighters because

1195
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:42.970
they get told by the, by the assholes, you know, Hey, you know,

1196
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:44.920
all fighters is gonna wind up with brain damage.

1197
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:46.780
All fighters is gonna wind up going out on their back.

1198
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:48.910
They're all gonna wind up coming back after their prime.

1199
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:53.020
It's so important for guys like you to say, you know,

1200
01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:57.430
know that you can manage it correctly. These are shark infested waters,

1201
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.210
but if you stay on the rocks and you do your due diligence and you put in the

1202
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:03.580
work and your discipline and you fight correctly,

1203
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.940
I agree with you so wholeheartedly about appreciation of the masters of a real

1204
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:12.610
masterful boxer. Like when I always talk to people, Buffalo may,

1205
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.830
whether they talk all this shit, he does this, he does that.

1206
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:17.830
He's got all this money. I go save all that. Forget about us talking.

1207
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:21.790
Watch how that guy fights. He fucking barely gets hit.

1208
01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:25.120
He's been rocked maybe twice in his whole career.

1209
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:29.770
My Donna and I'm Shane and sugar Shane Mosley. Those are the only two,

1210
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.310
the only two guys that cracked him and he wound up winning both those fights.

1211
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.520
He's a master masterful boxer and that's what everybody should emulate this

1212
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:39.821
they, I mean,

1213
01:06:39.821 --> 01:06:43.480
I loved the Arturo Gotti making sure fights as much as anybody did,

1214
01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:47.620
but if that was my son, I'd be freaking the fuck out. I'd be like,

1215
01:06:47.621 --> 01:06:50.050
don't fight like that. It's not worth it.

1216
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:52.870
I don't give a fuck how many of these drunk and assholes cheer you on.

1217
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.450
They're not going to be with you when you wake up in the morning.

1218
01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:59.410
Your head is pounding in your head when you have a hard time looking at light,

1219
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.810
when you have to have all the shades closed,

1220
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:05.950
when the the just a little crack of light coming into the shade is hurting you.

1221
01:07:05.951 --> 01:07:07.090
It's giving you a headache now.

1222
01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.010
They're not going to be there with you when you're old.

1223
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.500
[inaudible] just always put it like this and that's the shed a lot of people

1224
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:12.820
down. He said, man, let me ask you a question.

1225
01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:14.800
He'd do this to reel to report it and stuff like on a,

1226
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:18.160
like if there was an open workout and he knew it was a particular reporter in

1227
01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:21.880
there that was, you know, around, you know, talking down against, you know,

1228
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:26.590
guys who go by, he was an actual question. You got kids. Oh yeah, you got a son.

1229
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.040
Absolutely. If you want to just send a box.

1230
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.000
And it was two guys at the gym and one coach said, amen.

1231
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:38.650
I'm a teach us how not to hit and I get here, period. I know this art,

1232
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:40.750
I've mastered it and I'm going to help him master it.

1233
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:44.030
And then you got this guy over here to see, look man, I'm a, um,

1234
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.570
he may have to take two to give one, but look, he's going to be tough.

1235
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.370
He's going to be durable. And who would you send your kid with? And they go, ah,

1236
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:54.940
the first guy. Well there you have it. Well,

1237
01:07:54.941 --> 01:07:56.380
I think there's a false narrative too.

1238
01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:00.880
Here's the false narrative is that the guy who takes two to give one is tougher.

1239
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.080
I think that's nonsense.

1240
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:07.230
I think the guy who hits and doesn't get hit can be just as tough if not tougher

1241
01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:13.450
cause it's hard. It's not talked about. Right. It's a false narrative.

1242
01:08:13.451 --> 01:08:17.480
To your point. Yes. Like my lazy days in the gym would be, man,

1243
01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:18.980
I'm just going to fight today bro.

1244
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.790
I'm gonna stand toe to toe and just get it in. I'm tired physically.

1245
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:26.030
I'm not trying to, you know, execute this game plan and day.

1246
01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:29.330
I'm just going to try to keep a tight defense. You just go to war. Those are my,

1247
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:33.410
those are my, like my lazy days that when you gotta like,

1248
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:38.890
like embody a game plan and then round after round,

1249
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.680
even when things aren't going your way, try to stick to that game plan, bro.

1250
01:08:42.681 --> 01:08:46.910
That's hard. Yeah. That, that, that's draining. Right. Um,

1251
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.570
and this is something again that I've never said cause I don't, I'm not,

1252
01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:55.040
I don't like talking about myself, man. I try to stay out the way and, but bro,

1253
01:08:55.041 --> 01:09:00.041
I was one of the toughest fighters in the sport of boxing for the past 10 years

1254
01:09:00.441 --> 01:09:04.040
when I was active. Period. No, no question about it.

1255
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:08.000
It's just not talked about the chains and not talked about, you know,

1256
01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:11.300
the toughness part because it's not really associated with the guy who can,

1257
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:12.530
you know, do it a certain way.

1258
01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:15.080
But if you really think about my big fight in the end,

1259
01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:18.200
the big guys that could punch like I didn't beat them by moving away.

1260
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:22.910
I beat them by being in the wheelhouse period. And even Floyd,

1261
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:27.940
like people don't realize like we will highlight like visible times that we saw

1262
01:09:28.281 --> 01:09:31.700
Floyd get hit, man, you're getting buzzed and all kinds of stuff is going on.

1263
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:35.120
People don't even know. Right. But we're chameleons as fighters.

1264
01:09:35.121 --> 01:09:37.370
We have to be because if we show weakness,

1265
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.740
now's water is water and shark infested water.

1266
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.530
I mean his blood and shark infested water. Sure. Even in the economy,

1267
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:45.230
McGregor fight, he got clipped with a big left up or cut man.

1268
01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:48.110
You get bud being and you just tighten down and people thought, God,

1269
01:09:48.111 --> 01:09:51.260
I wasn't a hard shot. Yes it was. You didn't know it. No float.

1270
01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.850
Floyd Floyd has had to deal with that throughout the course of his careers.

1271
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.910
Many times that we didn't know. I like how Floyd changed his style too.

1272
01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:03.110
He would the pretty boy, pretty boy Floyd style early in his career.

1273
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:05.630
I mean he was much more knockout oriented.

1274
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.800
He was much more aggressive but he would get hit more than to it and he also

1275
01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:11.750
broke his hand a bunch of times, you know,

1276
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:14.600
and he just developed a smarter style.

1277
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.290
But people don't remember those knockouts like when he just see that fight with

1278
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:19.124
that Japanese dude.

1279
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.670
I had so many fucking arguments about that five same where they were trying to

1280
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:25.820
say that that was a fixed fight. I'm like, God dammit. Listen to me.

1281
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:27.780
That dude is 126 pounds. Yup.

1282
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:30.680
He had no fucking business being in there with Floyd Mayweather ever,

1283
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.680
ever forget about Conor McGregor. Conor McGregor is a big man. Yup.

1284
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.430
That's a tiny dude. That dude is 126 pound fighter.

1285
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.960
He's fighting Floyd Mayweather who's arguably the best boxer of all time and

1286
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.700
Florida doesn't even have to fucking train for that guy.

1287
01:10:43.701 --> 01:10:46.840
He came in there with a little bit of a belly and he's just moving his arms

1288
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.770
round like this, smiling at him. Hey man,

1289
01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:52.150
you fucked your never seen flow look like that before man.

1290
01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:55.700
But he want easy and people were saying, Oh look how the guy went down.

1291
01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:00.790
That's how it happens when a big man who's real natural welterweight hits 126

1292
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:05.150
pound fighter. That's what the fuck happens. Slow was, I heard him too.

1293
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.150
He was trying to hurt him. It's almost like fluid.

1294
01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:10.180
I don't know what the agreement was but it was almost like, yeah exhibition.

1295
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.330
Wait. Yeah and Floyd's a competitor like like,

1296
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:17.310
like unapologetically he's coming to win every time he,

1297
01:11:17.311 --> 01:11:19.680
you could tell flow with opening up flows. Truck flow was trying to hurt him.

1298
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:21.450
Do you think he's going to go about it again?

1299
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.210
Cause there's talk of other fighters. There's talk of,

1300
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.980
I mean he goes through money like water and he's got a fuck load of it,

1301
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.840
but God damn, he loves to spend it.

1302
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:34.050
And he's had some financial troubles in the past because of his flashy

1303
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:34.884
lifestyle.

1304
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.900
But his skill and his overall boxing ability and his ability to talk shit and

1305
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:43.380
generate interest have pulled him out of these problems. I hope not

1306
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.630
50 now, 50 times 50 fights. Pretty amazed. The training camp, I said no.

1307
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:52.470
Pretty amazing. If he does, if he does stop, pretty amazing. That's enough.

1308
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:53.363
Yeah. He's,

1309
01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:57.060
he's retired on what three different occasions came back benefited from it?

1310
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.860
I think he's good. Selfishly I would love to see it but,

1311
01:11:59.861 --> 01:12:01.740
but realistically I think, I think he's good.

1312
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:07.170
The only thing I could think would maybe talk him out of it is if there was

1313
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:11.310
something that could generate a massive amount of money, like a pack-out fight,

1314
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.600
like a PAC. I'll fight, you know, pack y'all still.

1315
01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:18.730
I mean after he beat Keith Thurman, like, Ooh,

1316
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.910
well what's a massive amount of money? I don't know.

1317
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.630
Cause he's had a massive amount. I know I comp team time.

1318
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:27.450
I would like to ask him like legitimately, Hey man, how much you got left?

1319
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.740
I think he would do it for a B. There was a B behind it or like, like,

1320
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:36.720
like a strong like 750 million upside.

1321
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.470
Like Floyd ain't it down a B. Is that possible?

1322
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.620
Can you get $1 billion? Why not? Right.

1323
01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:47.340
If anybody could do it right now it's Floyd. I mean who would he fight?

1324
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.750
I feel like floated out to fight a young guy. Like he would have to be like,

1325
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.910
like he's, he's, he's, he's done the kind of McGregor thing. People are like,

1326
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:58.680
Oh you got us. Like he'd have to fight a real threat. Like dude,

1327
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.960
cause people, people are pay that kind of money to see that,

1328
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:05.790
that OGO so like who like Terrence would have to be at, I don't know.

1329
01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:09.330
But again, I don't know commercially if it's Terrance big enough, I'm not sure.

1330
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.230
But it would have to be one of those kinda guys. Arrow,

1331
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.960
you know Terrance before people would say job, I don't care.

1332
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.120
Pay-per-view is 200 I don't care. Like,

1333
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.170
I don't think there's any star on that level right now. Right.

1334
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:25.380
I don't think there's any star on the level of where Floyd was when he was

1335
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.470
younger in his prom. Yeah.

1336
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:31.500
There's no one who generates that amount of eyes. Okay.

1337
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:33.820
Nello fight could do something like that. It could but can.

1338
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:36.360
I was talking about fighting Colette Lev. Right, but he would, he would,

1339
01:13:36.361 --> 01:13:39.230
he would stop talking about finding Kobalanski running marathons.

1340
01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.840
If flow was coming back it would be in a couple of who have a Floyd would make

1341
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.450
him drop down like 145 pounds or something crazy as he should.

1342
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.730
What did he make them fight at the first time? One 52 or something like that.

1343
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:55.540
He came with some arbitrary number. Low bit. It was below junior middle weight.

1344
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.890
I think it was like 50 to Oscar de LA Jolla did it to float when they fought.

1345
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.120
Yeah, because he was the ASI. Yeah. He picked the gloves, right? Del Rayez.

1346
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.390
He picked the size of the ring. He picked everything. You got to,

1347
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.620
you're in the driver's seat. Yes.

1348
01:14:07.621 --> 01:14:11.130
So don't get mad cause Floyd is doing it right now. Right. Canelo great fighter.

1349
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.770
He's the a side the majority of the time, unless you're fighting me.

1350
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:18.790
So look right. If you want this money, this is what we're going to do, isn't it?

1351
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:21.310
Right now the a plus in the a side though,

1352
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.450
it seems like Canelo's so huge. Particularly the Mexican medium.

1353
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:29.350
They will fight again. Yes. If they fought right now Floyd's still the a plus.

1354
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.960
But Canelo is kind of a, or at least to a minus maybe to everybody.

1355
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.560
But he'll always be,

1356
01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:38.880
Floyd will always be the bigger star just based on what he's amassed in his

1357
01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.530
career and just who you use. But when you look at what Canelo does,

1358
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:44.890
like when he knocked out Amir Khan, he's at, you know, he,

1359
01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:47.940
that motherfucker could put some heat on some punches. You can punch shit.

1360
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.070
He can punish box. You could box too. Do you think he very,

1361
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.900
that's one thing he really did learn from fighting Florida.

1362
01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.320
You know how to not be there. You know?

1363
01:14:56.321 --> 01:14:59.470
And you saw that in the subsequent fights, like he learned from that fight.

1364
01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.060
Like that was a learning lesson and you could see in that fight him like,

1365
01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.090
like realizing as a fight was going on, like, no, fuck,

1366
01:15:07.091 --> 01:15:10.420
I'm on another level of this video game and I don't know how to beat this boss.

1367
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:14.590
Like Floyd was just shutting them down and just doing beautiful things for

1368
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.810
levels to the game from people appreciate boxing.

1369
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.500
That's one of the best fights to watch cause you've got this murderous young

1370
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:22.840
upstart who's a devastating puncher,

1371
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.570
was a big strong kid who's just tough as fuck.

1372
01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:28.570
He just embraces that Mexican style of fighting pressure.

1373
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.640
A lot of power moving forward. That's exciting to me, man. Yeah. Like pee pee.

1374
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:36.400
I don't, I get it. But like on the other hand, I don't get it.

1375
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:38.230
Like how do you not see what's happening right now?

1376
01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:41.680
You have a young dude who can really punch, like we just said,

1377
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:45.250
one punch can change it. All employees a little bit older. He's not old,

1378
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:50.020
but he's older. Yeah. And he found a way to neutralize this young bull,

1379
01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:54.610
this young lion, and then expose him like he took away his strength and then,

1380
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.100
you know, exposed his weakness like tight, like in a 12 round fashion. Yeah.

1381
01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.440
Like not one round, not five,

1382
01:15:59.441 --> 01:16:03.640
not 10 but 12 rounds and left and left Canelo without answers.

1383
01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:07.450
Like that type of stuff. That's the way I was brought up. Yeah. Like man,

1384
01:16:07.451 --> 01:16:12.210
take away his greatest strength and, and, and, and exposes weakness, bro. Like,

1385
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.190
like that to me, I'm, I can watch 20 rounds like that.

1386
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.440
I think that's because you are,

1387
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:22.030
you're not just a great fighter, but you're also,

1388
01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.990
you're a deep fan of the sport. I mean, but it wasn't always like that.

1389
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:30.130
But when you were a kid, were you a big fan of it? Yeah, of course.

1390
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.590
So you understand like the, the,

1391
01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.080
when you're seeing a masterful performance, you understand that the,

1392
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:40.090
the general public really doesn't understand what's happening.

1393
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:40.990
They don't see it.

1394
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:45.010
And that's our job as analysts and writers to educate the people.

1395
01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:46.240
You're gonna have your dye hearts,

1396
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:49.150
they're going to pick and choose what they like. And generally speaking,

1397
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.760
the die hard is gonna you know, appreciate both styles.

1398
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:54.100
They maybe have a favorite style but they're going to an end for all of them.

1399
01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:58.420
Yeah. It's the fight is over the casual, right. And we in boxing we kill our,

1400
01:16:58.421 --> 01:17:00.920
so we shoot ourselves in the foot because a,

1401
01:17:00.921 --> 01:17:04.360
there's so much in fighting and then you have people literally like when a guy's

1402
01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:06.920
fighting a masters fight and Aw man, it's not worth you.

1403
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:11.000
It's not worth watching. I'll you an example, I'll bring it to the MMA world.

1404
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:15.790
I'm a casual MMA fan. Like Gilbert Melendez. We've,

1405
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:20.570
I've worked out with him, Nick and Nate. Um, and a couple other guys like,

1406
01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:22.700
so I'll watch if one of those guys a final, you know,

1407
01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.200
some of those guys don't fight anymore, but like,

1408
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.810
or core me a or maybe a challenge. Joan was like,

1409
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.120
I'll watch those types of guys. I've never heard, maybe you can inline,

1410
01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.950
but I've never heard an announcer like rip a guy.

1411
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:36.800
Like even if a guy has no ground game, he's like, look,

1412
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:39.020
if so and so gets him on the ground, he's in trouble.

1413
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:43.460
But if you stand up with this guy, you're giving me a reason to stay engaged.

1414
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.990
We inboxing a lot of times. Um, and we have in past times,

1415
01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:51.890
I think we've gotten a little bit better as of late. Ah know this is terrible.

1416
01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.800
Listen man, if I'm a casual fan, why am I going to stick around?

1417
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:59.840
The fight is over the casual and not the hardcore fan. So we make, you know,

1418
01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:03.500
a guy who can hit and not get hit. Like it's some, you know,

1419
01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:07.340
some super S like this is some special thing that you know, you know,

1420
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:10.250
you gotta be really, really smart to understand. It's really not.

1421
01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:12.560
It's the fundamentals of the game.

1422
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:15.830
Like when you go into a gym for the first time, Hey man, you, your J, Hey man,

1423
01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:18.590
you hit this guy, take a half step back so we can return fire.

1424
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:22.460
It's the fundamentals of the game at the highest level. It's not that deep.

1425
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.930
It's really not. It's being presented to people like as deep. It's not,

1426
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.400
it's hit and not get hit. And even in the whole hitting, I get hit concept,

1427
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:34.660
you're going to get hit, you're going to get hit,

1428
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:38.360
you can't avoid contact all the time. And then you got to be able to see, okay,

1429
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:38.930
this dude,

1430
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:41.150
he really doesn't like to get up and may he just got hit with that good shot

1431
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:44.810
man. He came back and many, many responded. Wow man, that dude does have heart.

1432
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:48.350
If you're really looking at him, you're going to see a fight.

1433
01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:51.530
You're gonna see boxing all in one fight. Even against the guy who was a master.

1434
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:53.240
You're gonna see the whole gamut. Well,

1435
01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:58.190
in sports commentary there is a way that sports people, right?

1436
01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.810
And there's a way that sports people do commentary where it's very negative and

1437
01:19:02.811 --> 01:19:06.680
they like to call people. They like to call people bombs. They like,

1438
01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:11.540
there's an appeal to a certain kind of fan and it's very profitable to be very

1439
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:15.380
negative and to to to him to talk about a certain way.

1440
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.040
I made a very conscious decision when I started doing commentary to celebrate

1441
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.800
these fighters and to try to honor their hard work and what they're doing.

1442
01:19:26.841 --> 01:19:29.480
And to let people know how spectacular it is to me,

1443
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:34.780
someone who loves the sport and I stay away from negative as much as possible

1444
01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:40.610
unless it's absolutely negative to talk about to show like maybe if someone

1445
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.510
would have to make some egregious error for me, for me to say,

1446
01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:49.160
don't ever do this. When I talk about these guys,

1447
01:19:49.161 --> 01:19:53.390
I want people to feel how I feel when I watch.

1448
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.780
If I watch like Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson was like one of my favorite of

1449
01:19:56.781 --> 01:20:01.781
all time and one of the thing about Demetrius to me that's so spectacular was

1450
01:20:02.271 --> 01:20:06.590
that he was able to fight these amazing fighters and make them look like they

1451
01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:11.130
had no business being in there with him, his movement, his arsenal,

1452
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:14.310
his technique, he could do anything. He could take you down, he could submit,

1453
01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:17.490
you could kick you, he could punch you. He moved his footwork, his movement.

1454
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:21.720
It was a masterful, but he had a hard time finding an audience. I did my best.

1455
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.920
I did my best to let people know like you are watching a special person.

1456
01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.480
You are watching a magician in here. I mean, he's,

1457
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.370
he's on the highest level I've ever seen in all my years of watching combat

1458
01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:34.280
sports. That's as high as it ever gets. Yeah.

1459
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.600
He's just 125 pounds and someone could get excited about it, but you,

1460
01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:43.140
you did your part and try it. You did your part. Um, and listen,

1461
01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.200
there's times you gotta call fighters out for stuff. I'm not, I'm not opposed.

1462
01:20:46.201 --> 01:20:48.960
And I'm not saying that you always have to be in alignment with a fighter.

1463
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.950
You know, if his, if his justified to call him out, if he, if he, if he,

1464
01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:54.390
if he put on a bad performance, look bro,

1465
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.730
he didn't perform the way Timothy Bradley did that recently.

1466
01:20:56.731 --> 01:20:58.560
And I think it was very justified. Which one was a,

1467
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:00.480
there was a Russian heavyweight and a,

1468
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.460
he was on an undercard and he was fighting this other dude.

1469
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:05.460
And the dude kinda laid down. And Timothy Bradley was like, listen,

1470
01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:10.140
let's be honest, that mom support. He felt like he wanted a way out.

1471
01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.560
He wasn't really here to fight. He was here to Pat this guy's record. I'm like,

1472
01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:15.590
man, you know, that's, that's exactly true. Yeah.

1473
01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.580
You got to remain credible to yes. You know. [inaudible] incredible.

1474
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.370
That's one of the things that's important about you.

1475
01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:25.290
Like you are very credible and, but also very positive and fair.

1476
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:29.660
You're fair. Praise. I try to be, man. I like, I think also what's,

1477
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.960
what's hurt like, uh, and I think we do a great job, uh, at ESPN will not Cruz,

1478
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:37.800
you know what? You guys have replaced the best, which used to be HBS.

1479
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.750
When HBO went away, man, I was like,

1480
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.420
I can't believe they're getting out of the boxing game. I couldn't believe.

1481
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:45.900
I'm still shocked. I can't, there was a foot with 40 years or something.

1482
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.080
I grew up from dozy duh, duh, duh, duh. Look, I grew up on, yeah,

1483
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:54.690
I'll get it on my DVR every time. Like, here we go. Who's fighting?

1484
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.430
That's one thing that we try to stress. You know, our, our, our lead producer,

1485
01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.290
Mike McQuade, uh, Joe Teza toward Tim Braley, Mark Kriegel, Bernardo as sooner,

1486
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:06.300
Christina poncho, like we are trying to be fair and objective,

1487
01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.320
but yet truthful. And if you and we,

1488
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:13.320
everybody has a reference for the guys that are getting in there and with all of

1489
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:13.981
that on the table,

1490
01:22:13.981 --> 01:22:17.460
then we tried to call it from that point what's happening in or what's happening

1491
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:21.840
in past times and even a little bit still today is personal agendas,

1492
01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:26.730
personal issues like spill over into the commentary or in to the article that's

1493
01:22:26.731 --> 01:22:29.100
being written. Like if you don't like Floyd's lifestyle,

1494
01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:33.870
I don't ascribe to Floyd's lifestyle, but that's not my business as a fighter.

1495
01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.020
We're going to call this the way we see it. Yes,

1496
01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.050
he is arguably one of the greatest of all time. Now,

1497
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:43.050
wherever you have on that list, that's your decision. Subjective.

1498
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.790
But people would take the lifestyle and things that was [inaudible]. He'll flip.

1499
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:50.190
No man, you're, you're letting that spill over into this and that.

1500
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:53.640
Now you're messing up this broadcast right now because Floyd's doing something

1501
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:56.250
and we're not acknowledging it and it's clear that you don't like him.

1502
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.630
That's the issue. Keep those things separate lifestyles, lifestyle.

1503
01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:01.890
You're gonna talk about that and you're doing a background story, whatever.

1504
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:05.860
Okay, address that. But if we're talking in the ring, come on man. Genius. Well,

1505
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.060
it's so interesting too,

1506
01:23:07.061 --> 01:23:12.010
to see a guy like you who is a former two division world champion and an Olympic

1507
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:15.910
gold medalist who also transitions to be an excellent broadcaster because

1508
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:20.050
there's only been a few George Foreman. I love him to death, but he was odd.

1509
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:25.000
Big Joe was doing commentary, but he would say crazy shit.

1510
01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.640
Yeah. You'd be like, what does he say? I may spoke his mind.

1511
01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:32.160
I think that's why people loved him yet. So folksy. Yeah, it was such a a,

1512
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.720
you know, I mean, and you knew, I mean,

1513
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.650
he's obviously a fantastic heavyweight and then the oldest heavy,

1514
01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:42.200
the oldest guy ever to win the heavyweight title. Yeah. Roy was great as,

1515
01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.490
as a commentator as well, you know, but where the fuck is Jim Lampley?

1516
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.180
I'm not sure what Jim's doing right now. You know,

1517
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.810
I'm surprised he's not out there too. I actually owe Jim a call. Um,

1518
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.800
I don't know. I don't understand that. He was so good. He is to me,

1519
01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.620
the gold standard of play by play that got him could do whatever he wants.

1520
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.610
I did hear that he was teaching somewhere, you know,

1521
01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:05.770
that's one thing he's doing about teaching. Teaching.

1522
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:09.430
You had a college somewhere. Really? Yeah. Wow. What's he teaching?

1523
01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.700
I'm not sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. Wow. How interesting.

1524
01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:15.610
Jim could do whatever he wants. A dad who's intelligent, he's smart.

1525
01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:17.740
He's paid his dues, I think. I think he's going to have his pick.

1526
01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:20.050
I'm not sure why we haven't seen him out there in the forefront,

1527
01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:23.170
but I'm sure he's doing something. Yeah, I miss him. Yeah, me too man.

1528
01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.160
Like that's one of my mentors.

1529
01:24:24.161 --> 01:24:26.560
Like I started off without burns thing is show time.

1530
01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:29.140
That was one of my first mentors. Um,

1531
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.080
then obviously Lampley Kellerman where's Kellerman?

1532
01:24:32.081 --> 01:24:35.950
Cause Kellerman's doing other things for ESPN, but he's not calling fight.

1533
01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.770
He works with us. Does he? But he's, he doesn't do every fight.

1534
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.630
He'll do specific fights. He'll be at the desk.

1535
01:24:40.810 --> 01:24:43.750
So he's not [inaudible] he's not going side. But what is that?

1536
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.320
Why isn't he doing recess shoe or man, he's got a lot going on. What the fuck?

1537
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:49.700
He's got a lot going on. But we have a, we have a great crew man.

1538
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:52.870
Have a great week. Joe. Tessa toy man. Come on. Legend in the game. Yes.

1539
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:57.340
Legend in the game and you and Tim together. A fantastic combination. You know,

1540
01:24:57.341 --> 01:25:00.490
it's amazing man. We got our guy Mark Kriegel you know doin during the,

1541
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:00.760
you know,

1542
01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.530
personal stories and getting guys back around like probably the best storyteller

1543
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.960
that I know that's out right now. Well it's so interesting,

1544
01:25:07.961 --> 01:25:12.190
this ESPN plus thing and the zone and these streaming services that have come

1545
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.770
along that have sort of changed. Everything changed.

1546
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:17.650
I mean I don't worry about taping anything anymore.

1547
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.770
I know I'm going to go home and I'm either going to watch like I watch them on

1548
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:22.000
my phone if I'm out,

1549
01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:25.990
like I was at dinner with my wife and I was sneaking fights in the bathroom.

1550
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.440
Am I sure I have to take a leak or see what the fuck is going on?

1551
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:32.690
Have watching fights while I'm peeing.

1552
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.050
It's like you can get it anywhere as long as you have internet service now,

1553
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.430
you know, I mean it's, that's so fantastic. That's where we're headed.

1554
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:44.140
My like exclusively. Yeah, I think so too.

1555
01:25:44.141 --> 01:25:48.130
I mean UFC thinks so as well and they made this deal with ESPN and a lot of

1556
01:25:48.131 --> 01:25:51.910
people freaked out. But for me it's fucking great. I, I mean it's great.

1557
01:25:51.911 --> 01:25:55.310
You know, my daughter had this, uh, event that she was going to and uh,

1558
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.800
you know, as soon as it was over, I ran upstairs and I pull out the phone.

1559
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:02.410
I'm watching fights. I mean it's just crazy. It's crazy. Instantaneously.

1560
01:26:02.411 --> 01:26:04.970
You don't have to go home. You get them right there, you know?

1561
01:26:04.971 --> 01:26:09.890
It's just a whole new world, this world of I want it right now. You know,

1562
01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.890
it was funny though, cause I hear people with the, you know,

1563
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:15.860
that I have the old narrative of boxing. You still don't listen. The, the,

1564
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:18.950
the reports of boxing's demise has been greatly exaggerated.

1565
01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:21.490
I've been hearing this stuff for so long, like boxing,

1566
01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:25.460
like it's just like for casual fans or just something cool to say like, no,

1567
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.700
or why? Why isn't boxing what it used to be listened to? Arrows are there areas,

1568
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:31.670
but in times of like available content, available fights,

1569
01:26:31.671 --> 01:26:34.260
like I think we're at an all time high, right? Yes, I think so too.

1570
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.710
There are other people doing what they're doing. God bless them.

1571
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.750
But what we're doing at ESPN, man, I think it's unmatched. Yeah.

1572
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:43.130
I think ESPN is fantastic right now and I appreciate the zone as well. I mean,

1573
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.290
boxing is an amazing place right now.

1574
01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:49.550
There's so many elite fighters and there's a lot of hype on the sport right now.

1575
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:52.070
There's people that are very excited about it. People that are casual fans.

1576
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:57.000
Look that Tyson Feuer Deontay Wilder fight did more for heavyweight boxing than

1577
01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:58.550
I think any fight in recent memory.

1578
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:03.850
When Deontay knocked him down the 12th round and Tyson fury Rose like Lazarus

1579
01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:07.250
and you're like, Holy shit, this fight still going on.

1580
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.480
He did and then after that he won the round. They're like, this is insane.

1581
01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.680
He looks like he's getting, it looked like his soul left his fucking body.

1582
01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:20.200
I turned on my wife. I was like, Oh, that's a rat turned back. I was like, what?

1583
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:24.470
He got up within the tink out like I'm trying to figure out if it was over and

1584
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:27.470
they were, they just had to, one dude got up and when the rest of the round,

1585
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.430
dude, I was watching in my bed, right. So I'm, I'm S, I'm leaning back,

1586
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.370
my feet are on the bed. Deontay hits him.

1587
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.450
I rock it towards the front of the bed. I'm sitting down. I'm like, Holy shit.

1588
01:27:38.451 --> 01:27:42.020
He knocked him out in the 12th round. He got up,

1589
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:46.000
he got up and I'm sitting there. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1590
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:48.740
My wife comes in the room. She's like, what the fuck are you doing? I'm like,

1591
01:27:48.741 --> 01:27:52.160
he got up. He got up. She just walks way with her hands up.

1592
01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:55.610
If he really saved his career, he did. He put tens of millions of that,

1593
01:27:55.611 --> 01:27:58.400
that that was the the a hundred million dollar up.

1594
01:27:58.650 --> 01:27:59.930
It was the greatest getup of all time.

1595
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:02.480
I don't know how much you got from ESPN is reported 100 million.

1596
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:06.590
Some people say no, but that get up was, was, was a very, very wealthy get up.

1597
01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:10.580
And then how about the fact that he gives his entire purse away and charity?

1598
01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.720
I mean, who the fuck gives $10 million away to charity? I love to give,

1599
01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:18.960
but I ain't given a whole way. No way. After that fight, keep half.

1600
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:21.920
I'm doing, I got something for you. But on the million,

1601
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:24.470
everybody was still love you. I can't do that. Not the whole thing.

1602
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:26.060
He's an interesting cat man.

1603
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:31.090
And the the will to get up mean Deontay Wilder is a terrifying puncher.

1604
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.890
He's a terrifying puncher. But it's like I said earlier,

1605
01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:37.010
they're those intangibles. They're in you, not on you. Yeah.

1606
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:40.520
And he showed what was in him in that moment. Oh, it's 100% in him. You,

1607
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:43.990
there's not a goddamn person in the world that can count out Tyson fury after

1608
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.850
that. I mean, that man is special. The way he Rose.

1609
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.500
I can't wait to see the rain man. Woo. Is that gonna happen? It's gonna happen.

1610
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:56.150
There's all this talk, but [inaudible] reportedly not official,

1611
01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.170
but reportedly February Las Vegas, but doesn't he have to?

1612
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:06.090
Tyson has to get past, what was his name? Otto wiling. Valine. Valine.

1613
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.700
Marlene. He's got to get past that dude. That might not happen.

1614
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:13.180
I mean he could lose to that guy. All weird shit happens. Sort T's. Yes.

1615
01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:16.530
He's dangerous fight. Put it on him in that first fight,

1616
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.300
but you'll lose our tease at least 150 years old at least. Right. At least.

1617
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.340
At least on the Cuban birth certificates. He's been like 40 for like 10 years.

1618
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:28.700
Like bro, come on. You, you keep saying you 40 years or you're,

1619
01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.180
you're older than that, right? No, no.

1620
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:34.230
He's been telling us that he's been the same age for a long time. Um,

1621
01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:38.190
I'm hopeful. I think both guys know what's on the tape. They're gonna rise, man.

1622
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:41.130
I think they gonna get it then. No guarantees. Right. Boxing stuff happens,

1623
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:44.730
but crazy. Hopefully they take care of business when we get the rematch. Well,

1624
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.440
I hope neither fighter looks past particularly Deontay and Ortiz cause Ortiz hit

1625
01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:53.520
him with some fucking bombs in that first fight and had them hurt man.

1626
01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.520
And he recovered. He did recover. He recovered and stopped him.

1627
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:58.470
What a crazy record. That guy's guy.

1628
01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.970
He's like 39 and Oh right. No,

1629
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:06.360
40 39 knockouts. 40 wins. One draw.

1630
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:12.210
Fuck. 39 knockouts. No two does to fight.

1631
01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:16.560
Yeah. One draw and one decision to um, uh,

1632
01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:19.950
was it Brazil? No, no, no. Brazil. He just knocked out stubborn. Right.

1633
01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:22.020
And then he came back and knocks to Vern out in the rematch,

1634
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:24.570
but that's made him pay for going the distance.

1635
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.580
Like you want to go to distance with me. I'm like, I got some fun.

1636
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:31.410
Not only that, the way he did it, just defiant hands down,

1637
01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:35.490
winging punches that come from Jupiter. Oh, that was like my biggest fear.

1638
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.740
Like losing was one thing. But like just getting knocked out ugly. Like,

1639
01:30:40.741 --> 01:30:41.320
like my,

1640
01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.300
my biggest fear was like getting hit with a shot I didn't see or even feel and

1641
01:30:45.301 --> 01:30:49.200
then woke up like what happened bro? And hung down like that. What happened?

1642
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:53.650
He was an amateur. No, never thank God, but that was my biggest fear.

1643
01:30:53.651 --> 01:30:55.920
Like you can't control that. You can be in tip top shape.

1644
01:30:55.921 --> 01:30:57.990
You're gonna have all the mental stuff down, check all the boxes,

1645
01:30:58.110 --> 01:30:58.943
and all of a sudden, boom.

1646
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:03.180
If the shower Cove live landed a little bit left or right. Who knows. Right,

1647
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.850
right. That's the crazy thing about getting punched. Right,

1648
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:09.930
because in this day and age, bro, they're merciless. Yeah.

1649
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.520
The internet is bursal. They're so merciless. It's crazy. When I was a kid,

1650
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:17.270
I was a giant fan of Donald Curry [inaudible].

1651
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:19.230
Donald Curry fought Milton McCrory,

1652
01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.830
milk McCrory hit him with a left hook to the body and then a left hook on the

1653
01:31:22.831 --> 01:31:27.720
chin and I was like, Oh no. Oh no. Mike McCallum, I'm sorry.

1654
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:29.670
He knocked out Milt McCoy with a left hook,

1655
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:33.450
but Mike McCowen the body snatcher hit him with a left hook to the body and then

1656
01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:37.550
one up top and the one up top starched him and he went flat on his back.

1657
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:41.160
I was like, no, and I remember I couldn't take it. I put my shoes on.

1658
01:31:41.161 --> 01:31:42.810
I went running, I couldn't take it.

1659
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:45.300
And I decided at that point as I was running down the street, I was like,

1660
01:31:45.301 --> 01:31:48.290
I am never going to get emotionally attached to a fighter again.

1661
01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.980
I'm never gonna like put all my eggs and pass. It's too hard because I lost too.

1662
01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.490
Yeah. It wasn't just, I saw Mike who I'm a fan of, I'm a fan of Mike McCowen.

1663
01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.760
He was an amazing fighter. It wasn't just that, it was just that, it was like,

1664
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:01.803
it hurt me.

1665
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:05.200
That's how I felt when Roy lost for the first time I was in New Jersey and it

1666
01:32:05.201 --> 01:32:05.890
was like a us,

1667
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:09.700
I was still an amateur to USA versus Ireland duel and I wasn't fighting it,

1668
01:32:09.701 --> 01:32:12.520
but I was just out there supporting the team and uh,

1669
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:16.090
we couldn't get the fight and then all of a sudden people started blowing me up

1670
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.360
and like, cause I knew Roy was my dude. You heard what happened?

1671
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:23.290
What'd you mean? I got knocked out. I ain't getting knocked out, mr.

1672
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:27.280
So I'm like trying to look them, Roy got knocked out where I was. I was,

1673
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:31.450
I was done. Like, I just like, I just dragged, I went to my room, bro,

1674
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.510
put the covers over. My head went to sleep and I woke up and I just felt like,

1675
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:39.190
I felt like I lost. Like it was so painful. Like that's my guy.

1676
01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:42.340
That's Roy Jones jr. He's super man. He don't get knocked out.

1677
01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:47.230
He got knocked down. He was in a nod song. The new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones.

1678
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:50.740
I mean that was when, when he was in his prime,

1679
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:53.920
people don't understand when you would watch him, he,

1680
01:32:53.921 --> 01:32:56.410
the way he would just dice guys up.

1681
01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.050
It's different and do it so unorthodox.

1682
01:32:59.051 --> 01:33:02.270
That leaping left hook was crazy flagged though. Oh my God.

1683
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:05.770
It wasn't just the average like, Oh, I'm talking tough. I believe in myself.

1684
01:33:05.771 --> 01:33:10.090
He danced to the ring man. He came, he came in a ring and like a tuxedo road.

1685
01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.720
Hey, I wanted the little Roy. John was duct tape back there, bro.

1686
01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:16.180
Like I wanted to do a, Roy did. Yeah, man.

1687
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:19.150
I remember I wrote him a letter and Brad Jacobs,

1688
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:23.080
who's the COO of top rank boxing right now. Uh,

1689
01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.900
or the sheet CFO, excuse me.

1690
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.700
He was over Roy's company's square ring at the time and I remember Brad wrote me

1691
01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:33.080
back and was like, Hey, thanks for riding Roy.

1692
01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.930
Roy's getting ready for Vinny pads. Patsy Enza.

1693
01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:39.220
Next time you're in Vegas he wants to meet you and a the next time I ended up

1694
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:41.560
being John Ruiz. I was up next time Roy fought in Vegas.

1695
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.980
But like I've been rocking Roy for a long time. He was a fun [inaudible].

1696
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.390
That was,

1697
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:50.740
I believe the only time a fighter never scored a single punch in around

1698
01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:55.030
[inaudible] literally couldn't hit him. But the way he did it again, like yes,

1699
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.190
he had pads, he has a goal and he's looking at the rough like, Hey man,

1700
01:33:57.191 --> 01:33:59.830
stop the fight. Yep. Okay. Shrug like this. And boom, boom,

1701
01:33:59.831 --> 01:34:02.890
hit him like three uppercuts, fight over. I'm like, who does that? Nobody.

1702
01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.240
Nobody did it. Like Roy did it. Not in the,

1703
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:10.320
you know when it's hard for people to look back now cause he's not happening

1704
01:34:10.331 --> 01:34:13.390
while it's happening. Yup. Well, but when it was happening back then,

1705
01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:17.890
you would just go, God, he played a full game of basketball the day of a fight.

1706
01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:21.880
Who does that? Nobody does. I can't say Eric Lucas on HBO. Yeah, it was crazy.

1707
01:34:21.881 --> 01:34:24.610
Who does that? Nobody. He did amazing shit man.

1708
01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.310
When he kept fighting,

1709
01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.020
what did that cement in your idea that that was never going to happen to you?

1710
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.870
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I hate that he was kinda,

1711
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.380
he was one of the ones, I'm not gonna say he was the one,

1712
01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:40.360
cause there's a lot of that stuff going on in boxing. But he,

1713
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:42.010
like when I seen that, I was like, dude,

1714
01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:45.770
I can't man the Glenn Johnson fight was hard. I was there.

1715
01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:49.420
The Glenn Johnson fight was hard because he was stiff, he was stiff.

1716
01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:52.930
And that was right after the Tarver fight. He came out with my gold medal on,

1717
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.280
I had just got back from Greece and Roy had my metal on it rapping to the ring

1718
01:34:58.281 --> 01:35:02.420
and he's got my metal on it and I'm sitting probably like in the third row or

1719
01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:06.050
something like that. And he got stars and his two boys who, you know,

1720
01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:06.711
they're grown now,

1721
01:35:06.711 --> 01:35:09.080
but they were young and they're trying to like get over the little, like,

1722
01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:13.510
like barrier to trying to get in the ring. And I remember,

1723
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:15.560
I remember like a couple of hours after that,

1724
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.540
I'm walking around downtown and I saw one of Roy's guys and uh, he was like,

1725
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:25.541
I dry come in and Roy was in the back of a rolls Royce and it was just,

1726
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:29.030
just him and it was all dark and he had his head down and you know,

1727
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:32.630
he opened the door and he, Roy kind of looked up, I was like, man, what sub Roy?

1728
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:35.810
He was like, what's up baby? I said, man, I love you man. I love you.

1729
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.360
That's all I could tell him. I said, I love you. I've tapped him up,

1730
01:35:38.361 --> 01:35:41.390
gave him a hug and then I was it. But I'll never forget that moment.

1731
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:46.100
Never forget that. And it just, for whatever reason, he just,

1732
01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:50.540
he just wasn't able to recover, man. And I think, you know, and you know again,

1733
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:52.760
the blue birds. Yeah. You got the people that are,

1734
01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:54.680
I knew where I couldn't talk about, listen bro,

1735
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:57.080
you don't get as far as he'd gotten. Not being able to take a punch,

1736
01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:00.860
but when you strip off 25 pounds of muscle abruptly, yeah, right.

1737
01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:04.760
It's shocks you. You can't, you can't take a punch. Like Bonnie's weak, weak,

1738
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:09.050
and your whole neural muscular system messed up. Excuse me.

1739
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.820
No, it's, it's, I mean,

1740
01:36:10.821 --> 01:36:13.370
we see it in fights all the time or fighters lose too much weight.

1741
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.340
It's terrifying to see that. But to see Roy,

1742
01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:21.350
the Tarver fight was hard to watch. The Todd is a great fighter. He caught him.

1743
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:24.050
He clipped him, he hurt him, he knocked him down, they stopped the fight.

1744
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:25.460
He couldn't get up. That mean,

1745
01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:29.930
but the Glenn Johnson fight was much more terrifying to me because he banged his

1746
01:36:29.931 --> 01:36:33.560
head off the ground when he went out and he went out stiff or one leg was up in

1747
01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:34.640
the air. Those,

1748
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:38.000
those ones where guys looks like he's getting electrocuted when they go out.

1749
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.730
Scary. Those are the scary ones. And Tarver, you know,

1750
01:36:40.731 --> 01:36:44.740
taking out the from Glen Johnson, he was a total total overachiever, you know,

1751
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:47.330
animal lunch pill type guy, blue collar fighter.

1752
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.630
But she didn't expect him to do that. Right.

1753
01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:52.160
And a lot of people didn't expect her to do it either. But like, you know,

1754
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:56.090
Olympian, you know, like you could see the skillset.

1755
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.530
Big left-handed guy.

1756
01:36:57.531 --> 01:36:59.930
So I was not like out of the question and something like that can happen.

1757
01:36:59.931 --> 01:37:02.510
But nobody saw that coming with Glenn Johnson? No.

1758
01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.380
Do you think that he just hadn't recovered really truly from the Tarver

1759
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:10.660
knockout? I think my gut, I think it was that a, and then B, I,

1760
01:37:10.670 --> 01:37:14.060
I don't think he took land serious. I think he looked at it like, you know,

1761
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.133
it was cool.

1762
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:17.180
I'm going to get back with this guy and I'm gonna get back to the top.

1763
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:20.600
I just don't think he took him serious. And Glen, I was his Superbowl. Yeah,

1764
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:23.600
he's a road warrior. That's his nickname. Yes. So he had to get it the hard way.

1765
01:37:23.601 --> 01:37:27.710
So I got Roy Jones coming off a knockout to target, let's go.

1766
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:29.870
He came in tiptop shape and I just went over to,

1767
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:32.510
took a series that made Glen Johnson's career.

1768
01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:36.620
Now literally you literally know Tarver went on to fight.

1769
01:37:36.621 --> 01:37:38.960
I mean all the way up to heavyweight, right?

1770
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:42.020
I mean I think he was fighting fairly recently.

1771
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:44.330
What does it mean he's got a fight coming up?

1772
01:37:44.331 --> 01:37:47.380
Him and his son are gonna fight on the same car target, target jewel.

1773
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.640
I think in Florida. I don't know the details but yeah,

1774
01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:51.170
but he hasn't fought in a couple of years.

1775
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.700
I think he's been trying to get a fight. You know,

1776
01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:56.190
you'll see Tarver post of like, yo, I'm ready let, and I don't know why

1777
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:59.430
<v 1>he hasn't been able to get a chance. I don't know. But I got,</v>

1778
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:02.730
I got once I got over the Roy stuff and I'll never fully get over it,

1779
01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:07.350
but like I've forgiven to before it hit like it took a minute.

1780
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.860
But like I, I got, I got an immense amount of respect for Tarver respect him.

1781
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:12.000
He had to get it the hard way too.

1782
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:15.810
Like he's a guy that didn't really get a lot of respect and love but did,

1783
01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:17.940
did so much for the sport and in the sport.

1784
01:38:17.941 --> 01:38:21.420
So I've got a soft spot photographer cause I know again he didn't get his just

1785
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:25.080
do but like he pressed his way. Man, he beat a lot of good guys.

1786
01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:28.020
I don't think he'd got is just to after he knocked Roy out.

1787
01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:30.600
I feel like there was a lot of people that were second guessing it.

1788
01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.600
If they were saying, well it's just evidence of Roy's demise.

1789
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:38.340
Like wait a minute. Tarver said at the fucking touch of gloves,

1790
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.940
got any excuses tonight Roy and then knocks him out.

1791
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:45.120
I mean if that doesn't get people's respect, I mean he,

1792
01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:47.730
he did what he was supposed to do even more than that.

1793
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:51.600
Like to have the guts to chase Roy down like yeah, he literally chased him down.

1794
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.880
Like when Roy fought Clinton woods in Portland,

1795
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:58.260
Tarver was at that press conference and every fight leading up to the Ruiz fight

1796
01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.880
Tarver was at that press conference.

1797
01:38:59.881 --> 01:39:02.980
He'd have his phone up with his manager on the phone so they could hear what Roy

1798
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.160
is saying. Like that takes a lot of guts, bro,

1799
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:09.270
to chase the best fighter in the world that seems invincible. And I say, look,

1800
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.280
give me a shot. Like, cause if you lose, that's it for you bro. Yeah.

1801
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.480
You know he did it believed in himself.

1802
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.900
The first fight was close and the second fight he said what he said in the

1803
01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:21.840
beginning like what kind of guts does that take to build it like the whole

1804
01:39:21.841 --> 01:39:22.170
world.

1805
01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:26.730
And then you got any excuses tonight and even before the knockout buddy McGirt

1806
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:29.970
says something about respect. He said, man, you showing him too much respect.

1807
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.500
Maybe he said don't use that word in his corner. He was locked in. Wow.

1808
01:39:34.530 --> 01:39:37.140
He was locked in and then went out and knocked her way out. So yeah,

1809
01:39:37.141 --> 01:39:39.420
it had something to do with that. But that's not Tara's fault.

1810
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.020
Don't use that word in this corner. Never heard nothing like that, but

1811
01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.870
wow. Wow. Who do you, when you look at the game right now,

1812
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.740
who do you think, who is exciting too?

1813
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:54.570
Obviously this Terrence Crawford and Loma Chanko, but is there any,

1814
01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:57.480
anybody that really stands out for you? And my little brother,

1815
01:39:58.350 --> 01:40:02.730
Chicago Stevenson co-manage him along with James Prince and Josh Steuben. Uh,

1816
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.550
silver medalists. Uh,

1817
01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.830
he's getting ready to fight his first title fight coming up at featherweight.

1818
01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.250
Um, he, he stays focused, which I believe you will.

1819
01:40:11.251 --> 01:40:15.270
He's going to be on top for a long time. Um, [inaudible] female Lopez, uh,

1820
01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.820
he's a young up and coming guy. He's getting ready to fight.

1821
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:22.080
Reportedly Richard me sometime in December. Possibly. He's a young guy.

1822
01:40:22.081 --> 01:40:25.800
Obviously Terrance Aero spends, um, they have to fight, right?

1823
01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.380
It's tough, man. It's tough. But for a fan, listen, God, listen,

1824
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.430
I want to see it. But if you're on his side,

1825
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:39.300
I see what they're doing and honestly, what are they doing?

1826
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:42.840
You can't even be mad at it. Well, Al Haymon and those guys over there,

1827
01:40:42.841 --> 01:40:47.370
they got all the welterweights. So if you don't, if you're not, you know,

1828
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:50.490
if you don't really like the other side or if you feel some type of way about

1829
01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:55.360
ESPN and top rank and you know that Terrence is wanting this fight,

1830
01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.890
why not make him wait a year or two and let your guy arrow,

1831
01:40:59.891 --> 01:41:03.080
Spence try to clean out the whole welterweight division.

1832
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.160
Now he has Shawn Porter coming up and that's not going to be easy fight for

1833
01:41:06.161 --> 01:41:08.710
either guy. And I and I respect it and got a lot of love for both,

1834
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.280
but they're trying to squeeze them out. So they're looking at us like, yeah,

1835
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:14.680
I hear you. You want that fight. But we've got bigger plans.

1836
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:20.020
I'm gonna let my guy, you know, a mass, you know, a bigger following.

1837
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:23.500
He's got a big following in Dallas and Jerry's world. Jerry Jones is behind,

1838
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:25.220
you know, Errol Spence. So that's what they're,

1839
01:41:25.221 --> 01:41:29.690
that's what they're doing right now. And as a fan, I don't like it. Um,

1840
01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:34.300
but as a businessman I get it. I understand what they're doing. But from Europe,

1841
01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:38.950
like what you're saying, you know, to your point, my only thing with that,

1842
01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:41.140
and I've told both guys this,

1843
01:41:41.141 --> 01:41:45.760
like you can't say that you're the best and you may feel like you're the best.

1844
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:48.130
You may tell yourself you're the best,

1845
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.850
but you really don't know if you're the best until you fight the best.

1846
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:55.360
And that's my only thing with boxing as a stance today,

1847
01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:58.150
like social media, man,

1848
01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.620
social media tells a lot of lies. Like it's some young guys coming up.

1849
01:42:05.650 --> 01:42:09.010
I'm not gonna name any names, but it's some young guys coming up who,

1850
01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:12.790
who have a lot of potential could possibly beat the guy,

1851
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:18.810
but they're not fighting anybody. But yet they'll go to social, you know, I'm,

1852
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:23.430
I'm the man, I'm, I'm next Floyd's going, I'm next. And you get social media.

1853
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.870
You right man. You huh? Come on man.

1854
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.640
It's something called box wreck or fight facts punching.

1855
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:34.540
And now you go to the search punching first last night and you gotta be specific

1856
01:42:34.541 --> 01:42:36.280
with box rec because if you're not,

1857
01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:39.490
if you miss bill a letter in the word in the name, it won't pop up.

1858
01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:41.350
So get the name right first and last,

1859
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.510
and then all of a sudden the record pops up first fight to whatever their last

1860
01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:48.910
fight was and then you can cross reference the guys they beat.

1861
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:53.560
Oh this duty beat was 20 and Oh, click on click on that dude's name. Ah,

1862
01:42:53.561 --> 01:42:56.290
this dude ain't fought nobody. So his 20th Oh really?

1863
01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:58.600
Ain't a real 20 and old and you're hanging your hat on.

1864
01:42:58.601 --> 01:42:59.650
The fact that you beat that guy,

1865
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:03.610
it's a lot of that in the game and guys aren't willing to test themselves.

1866
01:43:03.611 --> 01:43:07.480
Now listen, it's a place for it building. It's a place for getting seasoning.

1867
01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:09.850
I'm not, I'm not a fan of rushing like I'm not, you know,

1868
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.730
that's not what I'm saying. But at a certain point in time,

1869
01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.520
if you're going to say that shirt the best and that you're the next Floyd and

1870
01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:19.780
that you, regardless of what way class you may be,

1871
01:43:19.781 --> 01:43:22.120
you gotta test yourself against the best because guess what?

1872
01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:26.620
You don't even know how good you are. You won't know until you face another guy.

1873
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:29.050
Like I said this the other day when I was in the UK, I said,

1874
01:43:29.051 --> 01:43:31.870
everybody wants to be allying when there's no lions around.

1875
01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:35.140
You can be aligned in the, in the, in the company of hyenas,

1876
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.320
but when you're facing another lion,

1877
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:41.080
now we're gonna see what you're really working with. Yeah,

1878
01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.430
everybody's a soldier when there's no Wars going on, but when a war happens,

1879
01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:46.810
now we're going to see what you made them.

1880
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:50.500
I would just like to see at a certain point in time, I get making money.

1881
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:52.280
I get the political stuff that's going

1882
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.410
<v 0>on, we don't like, but at some point in time,</v>

1883
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:56.930
if your pupil is going to say that they're the best,

1884
01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.130
you got to face the best so we can really see who's who. Now,

1885
01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:02.780
if you're not about that life and you're like, dude,

1886
01:44:02.781 --> 01:44:05.090
I'm just trying to make as much money, but at least amount of risk,

1887
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:09.110
I suppose I respect, respected and uh, at least you made your intentions clear,

1888
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.960
but you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say you're the best,

1889
01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.570
but not fight the best. You gotta face the best at some point in time.

1890
01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:20.140
I like what boxing does in that the managers dictate who the fighters fight and

1891
01:44:20.331 --> 01:44:22.790
that they do build their fighters up correctly.

1892
01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.200
And one of the things that bothers me about MMA is I think there's some really

1893
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:31.940
good young fighters who get ruined because they get thrown to the wolves too

1894
01:44:31.941 --> 01:44:35.150
quickly and they wind up getting their confidence shattered.

1895
01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:36.920
They get knocked out maybe when they shouldn't be.

1896
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:40.250
They're finding a caliber of fighter. They're not prepared for,

1897
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:42.020
for every one fighter like that. You know,

1898
01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:44.150
there's always the arguments of like a guy like Jon Jones,

1899
01:44:44.151 --> 01:44:46.400
youngest ever light heavyweight champion, like youngest,

1900
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:50.200
every UFC champion fights a legend. Mauricio Shogun who, uh,

1901
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:53.540
when he was a 22 or 23, I think it was 23 years old,

1902
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:56.630
opens up with a flying knee, hits him in the face,

1903
01:44:56.631 --> 01:45:00.500
beats the fuck out of them and takes the title for every John Jones.

1904
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:02.540
There's a guy who's coming up that may be,

1905
01:45:02.541 --> 01:45:06.680
could have been a world champion but didn't get managed correctly.

1906
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:09.500
And the UFC doesn't give you any options. The doc says, Hey,

1907
01:45:09.501 --> 01:45:13.860
you want to fight Camaros, man? Okay, here's your fight. This is a tradeoff,

1908
01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.700
right? So fans get the big fights, but, but, but you know,

1909
01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.640
in the wake of how many careers, you know,

1910
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:20.660
that's the trade off the fans get the big fights.

1911
01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:25.660
But I don't think we necessarily see the highest caliber of fighter fight,

1912
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:30.710
the highest caliber of fighter with the,

1913
01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.730
the best case scenario at all times. Do you know what I'm saying? I don't,

1914
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:39.170
I don't think we get to see the most out of some of these guys cause I think

1915
01:45:39.171 --> 01:45:40.460
that if they were managed, if there was,

1916
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:43.880
it was a ton of different promoters around and you weren't locked in any

1917
01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:46.520
specific sort of an organization like the UFC has.

1918
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.170
I think you could see more managers saying, you know, Hey man,

1919
01:45:51.171 --> 01:45:53.600
you're not ready for Robbie Lawler. Hey man, you're not ready for this guy.

1920
01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.390
We're going to take this, this fight on a regional level.

1921
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.650
We're going to build you up. We're going to get you to, you know,

1922
01:45:58.670 --> 01:45:59.870
1516 [inaudible].

1923
01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:03.140
Then we're going to start challenging some top 10 contenders and some at your

1924
01:46:03.141 --> 01:46:06.320
place. But this way you'll have seen all the looks.

1925
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:09.430
You'll have seen a great wrestler. You've seen a great striker or you, you,

1926
01:46:09.431 --> 01:46:12.230
you fought a Moitai champion, you fought a jujitsu guy.

1927
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:15.560
You know how to handle all these different scenarios and an MMA.

1928
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.590
That is part of the problem is that it's not just your hands.

1929
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:21.020
There's so many different scenarios that you have to deal with.

1930
01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.460
It's like the JG Wentworth commercial. I need my money now.

1931
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.800
That's what it is. I tried Dana white, like, bro, I need to get paid now.

1932
01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:33.500
Right now you had you ever come in, I can't find a better match up.

1933
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:34.334
Let's make it happen.

1934
01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.810
The UFC will throw a guy on his UFC debut against a guy who's a world-class

1935
01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:41.570
contender and you'll watch them get lit up like a Christmas tree.

1936
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:44.600
And I'm not a fan of that man. I'm a fan of again, seasoning.

1937
01:46:44.601 --> 01:46:48.650
Make sure you're ready. But it's like in boxing man and not everybody.

1938
01:46:48.651 --> 01:46:49.110
Like if you look,

1939
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:51.930
the light heavyweight division is one of the hottest and the most willing

1940
01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:55.400
divisions for guys to face each other. [inaudible] yeah,

1941
01:46:55.590 --> 01:47:00.210
it is division. They spit them out. Woo. They spit them out. Yeah.

1942
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:03.960
Um, but like as you look at some of these other divisions, it's like, man, dude,

1943
01:47:03.961 --> 01:47:08.400
like how many posts can you have where you're saying that you're the best,

1944
01:47:08.401 --> 01:47:10.290
but yet you're refusing to fight the best.

1945
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:12.360
But there is a thing about social media though,

1946
01:47:12.361 --> 01:47:16.430
where these guys can self promote in a way that's never really been available

1947
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.310
then it's all good. But like just don't expect everybody to buy it, right? Well,

1948
01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:24.630
as a champion, you, you value that title the best.

1949
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:29.370
So and also as a, I still care about it then,

1950
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.410
then we're not going to bother you. But when you,

1951
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:35.070
when you bring that light on yourself right now we want to, we want to have you,

1952
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.540
you know, backup what you're saying.

1953
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:39.450
Well that's one of the reasons why the UFC takes this strategy.

1954
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.240
They give a young fighter fight you like, you think you're a beast. Okay,

1955
01:47:42.241 --> 01:47:44.160
we're going to throw you into the beasts.

1956
01:47:44.161 --> 01:47:47.490
You might have four or five professional fights and occasionally guys get

1957
01:47:47.491 --> 01:47:49.950
through and you realize, wow, this guy truly is special.

1958
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.840
That's the philosophy of the UFC is put together the best fights all the time.

1959
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:57.090
Like every car, they want murderers, fight and murderers.

1960
01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.260
And I see that from a promotional perspective. It's brilliant.

1961
01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:03.330
And from a fan perspective, it's brilliant.

1962
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.430
But from a person who values a fighter's development, yeah, I would go,

1963
01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:12.600
Ooh, if I was a manager, I'd go, don't take that fine. Don't take that fight.

1964
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:15.880
Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. It's like a Tyson fear.

1965
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.160
Get ready to fight out of volleying. Uh, another tone fight. Right.

1966
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.430
People are like, Oh well listen, while Eileen is a good fighter,

1967
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:24.750
we'll see how good he is.

1968
01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.560
But you also have to look at like Tyson fury and everything. He came off of,

1969
01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.830
you know, drugging and boozing and you know, just on the brink of disaster,

1970
01:48:31.831 --> 01:48:36.090
personal disaster. Like give him a couple of fights to get the rest off. Right.

1971
01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.440
So when he does face Wilder, it's an even better fight. Yes. Why? Why is,

1972
01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:43.530
why is water find Luis or T listen, give it some time.

1973
01:48:43.531 --> 01:48:46.050
So it's not that we're trying to like sell these fights individually,

1974
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.500
but we're selling the package deal. Like support that you support these guys.

1975
01:48:49.501 --> 01:48:50.970
Yeah. You want to see their rematch. Yeah,

1976
01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:53.910
we're going to get a better fight if you let them go through the maturation

1977
01:48:53.911 --> 01:48:55.790
process, you know, Wilder's trying to, you know,

1978
01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.370
stall and wait for Tyson fear to get what he needs to get out of the way.

1979
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:02.340
Tyson's trying to get a little bit more rust off so it could be a better fight

1980
01:49:02.341 --> 01:49:05.970
than it was the first time. And sometimes fans don't see that.

1981
01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:10.470
And like you said, to your point, we as broadcasters and writers, we have to,

1982
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:13.470
we have to educate the people a little bit. They still may not like it,

1983
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.120
but at least we have to present the facts and say,

1984
01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:19.860
this is why we're seeing this right now. So you do a fantastic job to try, man.

1985
01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:24.060
I try, I try. You know, I'm, I'm trying to, you know,

1986
01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.000
just continue to just keep, keep on keeping on man. But again, I gotta dude,

1987
01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.170
I got a great team and I had a great team at HBO. Again,

1988
01:49:31.171 --> 01:49:34.530
I still can't believe they're not in the business and I still keep in contact

1989
01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:37.440
with a lot of those guys and then we'll be have it at ESPN, man. It's just,

1990
01:49:37.441 --> 01:49:41.430
it's just different man. Like our lead producer, like I said, Mike McQuade. Uh,

1991
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:46.540
like we like in past times I would just show up to the, to the,

1992
01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.250
the site location on a Thursday night, a fighter meetings,

1993
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:54.670
production meeting on Friday, Saturdays, the fight,

1994
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:56.920
I go home Sunday now.

1995
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.150
Like we have a production call the week of a fight on Tuesday and probably an

1996
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:01.420
hour long.

1997
01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:05.380
We're constantly texting and sending emails of information and you know,

1998
01:50:05.381 --> 01:50:07.090
either Joe test is, you know,

1999
01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:10.870
challenging us in this area or Tim sending an article or I'm sending something

2000
01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:13.150
or Bernardo sending something or you know, Mark crew,

2001
01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:16.420
like we're growing like w it's just on another level right now.

2002
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:19.840
And I think that's why people get the production that they're getting. No,

2003
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:21.220
you can tell, you can tell,

2004
01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:25.000
you can tell in the actual fight itself while you guys are doing the commentary

2005
01:50:25.001 --> 01:50:27.650
that you guys are buttoned down and locked up. I mean it's,

2006
01:50:27.651 --> 01:50:32.380
it's all your T's are crossed and your I's are dotted. So performance business.

2007
01:50:32.381 --> 01:50:33.730
But yes, it is. You know,

2008
01:50:33.731 --> 01:50:36.800
you're approaching that the same way you approached your fight career.

2009
01:50:36.801 --> 01:50:39.340
I don't know any other way. I don't know any other way.

2010
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:42.980
When you're doing it though, I mean you're, you're 20,

2011
01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.690
how many months out of your last fight when you're doing it though,

2012
01:50:46.691 --> 01:50:50.470
there's gotta be a itch. Sometimes this gotta be itch.

2013
01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.490
It's not going to go away.

2014
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.190
How did you just accept the fact that you have that itch?

2015
01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:56.900
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2016
01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:00.560
<v 0>is there a part of you that thinks like there's a 10% chance you might make it</v>

2017
01:51:00.561 --> 01:51:03.110
come back? Like, do you have a number in your head? Yes.

2018
01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.520
It's whatever percent it is.

2019
01:51:04.521 --> 01:51:07.130
And then I wake up and I started hearing a pop pop boom, boom.

2020
01:51:07.131 --> 01:51:11.270
My knees and my back and they're like, I'm not as wired. Tired. That's why.

2021
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:16.370
So that, that discourages me quick man. Um, do you still exercise?

2022
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:20.510
Yeah, I gotta stay fit. Yeah, I hit the bag. Uh, I haven't done a boxing thing,

2023
01:51:20.511 --> 01:51:23.030
but I think I'm gonna do it. I, it's weird,

2024
01:51:23.031 --> 01:51:27.740
like part of me has done it for my whole life, so I'm kind of burnt out.

2025
01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.330
And then the other part I'm like, dude, I don't want to miss it. Like the wait,

2026
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.440
I want to do something else. So I'll do a lot of, you know, spinning,

2027
01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.630
spinning classes, spin classes.

2028
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:39.200
I take spin classes but then also have a Peloton at my house.

2029
01:51:39.201 --> 01:51:43.910
I have the Peloton treadmill and the Peloton spinning bike Varsa climber. Um,

2030
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:47.330
I love that thing. So I do, I do a lot of, you know, alternative stuff,

2031
01:51:47.331 --> 01:51:49.820
but I think I'm gonna get back in and because a great way to just keep the

2032
01:51:49.821 --> 01:51:52.400
weight off and, um, after two years,

2033
01:51:52.401 --> 01:51:54.080
I think I'm ready to start hitting the back again. Man,

2034
01:51:54.110 --> 01:51:57.020
Mike Tyson says he can't, he said he doesn't want to.

2035
01:51:57.290 --> 01:52:00.690
He says if he starts hitting the pads again and hitting the bag, well,

2036
01:52:00.710 --> 01:52:04.460
even at 50, he says his ego starts firing up again. It starts thinking about,

2037
01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:08.480
I feel, I'm not saying Richardson, legendary train out of Philly.

2038
01:52:08.630 --> 01:52:12.230
He put it to me like this, like, like last year sometime. Um,

2039
01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:15.140
he said somebody asked him like, man, you think like,

2040
01:52:15.141 --> 01:52:17.600
we interviewed him for my doc and um,

2041
01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.650
my boy Deontay he was the director. He said, listen,

2042
01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:25.740
do you think Joy's ever going to come back? He said, you know what? He said, ah,

2043
01:52:25.741 --> 01:52:30.020
I don't think so. He said, you got to realize Android hasn't,

2044
01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:32.630
hasn't lost in a long time. He said,

2045
01:52:32.631 --> 01:52:34.940
as soon as you start looking at retirement like an opponent,

2046
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:39.140
I think he's going to be just fine, and I never looked at it like that before,

2047
01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:41.150
but then when I finally understood what he was saying,

2048
01:52:41.151 --> 01:52:43.850
it's like that's what I'm fighting against right now.

2049
01:52:43.851 --> 01:52:47.600
So like just like a regular, I study retirement, right? Like I said earlier,

2050
01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.300
the highs and the lows, the good, the bad stories.

2051
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:54.950
Just like when I fight in a fight, I got my supporters and I got my detractors.

2052
01:52:54.951 --> 01:52:57.860
I got people saying, man, amen. Stay gone bro. Way to get out on top.

2053
01:52:57.861 --> 01:52:59.780
I miss you, but man, Hey man, I'm happy you did it like that.

2054
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.670
Then I got people saying, Oh, he's coming back.

2055
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.730
All fighters come back just like I was in in a real fight.

2056
01:53:04.731 --> 01:53:08.690
I wanted to win that battle. Right? This is a battle that I want to win too.

2057
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:12.410
So I'm looking at retirement like an opponent right now and,

2058
01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.330
and my last, you know,

2059
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.910
I don't know how many years I've been doing pretty good against opponents.

2060
01:53:16.911 --> 01:53:19.920
So I like my chance. I like your chances too. And I,

2061
01:53:19.921 --> 01:53:22.160
I think you are very important for the sport.

2062
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:26.630
I think you're an important shining example of what's possible, what's possible,

2063
01:53:26.631 --> 01:53:30.980
both with your accomplishments and also what's possible with walking away with

2064
01:53:30.981 --> 01:53:33.890
you all your marbles and tight man. So thank you for everything, brother.

2065
01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:36.310
Thank you for doing this. Appreciate it. Really appreciate it. I'll go.

2066
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.580
Thank you, ma'am. Bye everybody.

2067
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.863
<v 3>Great.</v>

2068
01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:50.620
