00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.880
It's time for more cheesy spookiness with Halloweentown II,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.580
a far better follow up from the last lame movie,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.120
with much better acting, much better effects, much better visuals...

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.980
Does that make it good? Well, let's not say anything we can't take back.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.600
The Crumbwell's are finally throwing a Halloween party, and even invited over their grandma,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.800
This is being done because the mother has no intention the kids ever going back to spooky old Halloweentown.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.540
But that of course changes when an evil boy comes into the mix,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.600
steals the grandma's magical book, and uses it to literally suck all the color out of Halloweentown.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
Yup, all the crazy ghouls and weird goblins are now being replaced with normal people,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.100
bland attitudes, and a black-and-white landscape.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.740
To make things worse, the boy, which we now find out is the son of the villain from the last film,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.220
takes their grandma once again out of commission, meaning it's up to the kids to figure out how to set everything right.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.580
So for the most part, everything is a big upgrade.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.400
First of all, look at these effects.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.660
Okay they're not phenomenal, but they're pretty damn good for that time period!

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
The black and white filters are almost as good as Pleasant-ville,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.120
and they don't just turn everything black and white, there are still hints of color around so it's not visually uninteresting to look at

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.180
and the color that is in there really pops a lot more.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.000
The acting is also a lot better.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.960
Unlike the last film where you're constantly trying to not snicker at how awkward the performances are,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.060
here, I don't know if they got a new director, or if just more time has passed for them to get used to their roles,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060
but everybody seems much more on track.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.460
Okay, they're not phenomenal performances, but they're not in any way distracting.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.840
The story allows for a lot of fun ideas too,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.200
like did you know to undo a spell you literally just say the spell backwards?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.260
That's kinda smart!

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
And it also leads to some good problem solving,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.120
as they said a word that apparently reversed the spell, so they know that if they say it backwards, that'll be what the spell is.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.280
So they have to retrace their steps, remember what they said, say the words backwards, it's actually kind of neat.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.480
There's also a place where all your missing items go,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.780
you ever miss the remote, or your earring or something like that?

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.700
This place in Halloweentown has it.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.020
But the owner got infected by the spell too, so he has everything clean,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.480
and now they can find everything, which is against the idea, it has to be lost in order to be found,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.640
and yeah, it's kind of creative!

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.980
The worlds themselves look a lot better, there's much more of a visual art design,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580
and its more colorful and interesting.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.080
But the major downside is that they don't go to that many places

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.500
A lot of the movie is them just staying in one spot,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100
talking to each other, trying to figure out what to do.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.880
And because the spell is de-monster-izing everybody

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.200
you don't really get to see that many monsters either,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.700
that is, until the end.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.000
They have this really cool idea where the bad guy casts this spell

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
and whatever mask they're wearing at the Halloween party, they become that creature.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.680
The monsters become monsters, the vampires become vampires, it's really neat.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.940
But the problem is this happens in the climax. Why didn't this happen in the middle of the film?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.440
A lot of these makeups are very creative and goofy and fun again,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440
why weren't we allowed to see 'em more?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.020
As cheesy as the makeup was in the first film, they were at least creative and allowed us to see a lot of them.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.020
Here, it's all kind of kept until the last couple minutes.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.420
And they're cool, but for a movie called Halloweentown, I expected to see a little more Halloween imagery.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.980
So I guess that is the one thing the first film has over this one is that it does have a little bit more variety

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.100
in locations, and weird makeup designs and so forth

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.340
But for everything else, this movie does things a lot better.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.780
The ideas are more interesting, the acting is more interesting, the visuals are more interesting

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.380
I feel like they got a bigger budget to work on this,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.380
but they still had a lot of time restraints,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.900
so they had to move things around and maybe they only had certain locations for a certain amount of time,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.920
and I dunno, but that's what it feels like watching it.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.660
Though they're given a lot more, you're still always made aware of the limitations.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.040
But for the most part, I think did the limitations, okay,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.680
at least, better than the last one.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.340
Would I watch it again? No

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.500
Is there anything really in it for adults? Not much

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.740
But as kid's TV movies go, I think it's got enough to be imaginative.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.780
Not a glowing review, but a positive one.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.540
If you've got a kid that's interested, just like Halloween candy, it's perfect junk food.
