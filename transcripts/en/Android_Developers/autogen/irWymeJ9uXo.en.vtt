 Voice of a Man: When it comes to reaping profits from your app, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.900
 You have to pay attention to quality. 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.133
 High-quality application will receive a better evaluation, 

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.800
 Leading to more downloads, 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.100
 And then more profits. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.866
 Here are ten tips for successful developers 

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.700
 When the application is ready. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.533
 The app developer unit can automatically convert your app's price 

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.233
 To local currencies around the world. 

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.900
 However, conversion rates do not reflect local expectations 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.400
 Purchasing power, 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
 So look for local economic conditions and research 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.833
 Good looking interests. 

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.500
 If you see that the price of your app will be frustrating for users, 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.833
 But you see that they will see a value worth the price after using it, 

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.700
 Download and try it for free. 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.333
 After a certain time, you can view your purchase on them once 

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.200
 So they can use it forever. 

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.766
 Applying the application for free helps overcome any obstacles 

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.133
 Resulting from the price, 

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.200
 You can also view additional features for users at a certain price 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.666
 After attracting their attention towards the application. 

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.566
 Create a free application with basic features 

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.866
 So that the user will interact with it 

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.800
 Then showcase advanced features with in-app purchases 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.366
 Such as ad removal, 

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.400
 Or add an enhanced function, 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.466
 Or add items within the game. 

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.700
 Instead of selling digital goods within applications, 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.533
 Especially when there are recurrent costs of content, 

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:31.066
 You can sell content and features through a subscription. 

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.866
 You can view the free trial experience for users to familiarize them with the app, 

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.966
 Followed by a recurring subscription 

00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.600
 On a variety of time periods, 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.300
 Whether weekly, monthly or annually. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.133
 If you offer to subscribe to the app, 

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.433
 It may add additional content or features to your site 

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:49.833
 Users have value to subscribe 

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.433
 And makes it more attractive. 

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.033

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.766

 To enable features or content on the web. 

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.966
 Google Analytics helps provide useful information 

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.033
 About the behavior of users in your app. 

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.600
 You can use the flow of behavior 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.766
 To understand how users navigate within the app 

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.266
 And the content they are alienating from. 

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.400
 E-commerce applications can take advantage of this information in 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.866

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.266

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.166
 And when assistance should be provided to players. 

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.333
 You can take advantage of this information to improve your app experience, 

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.500
 With increased conversions for installation to users who pay. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.133

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.300

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.833

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:57.266
 More important than what you can target with other offers.
