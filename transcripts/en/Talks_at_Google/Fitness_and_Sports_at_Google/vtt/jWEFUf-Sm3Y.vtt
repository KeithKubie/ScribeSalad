00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.304
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.360
SPEAKER: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.510
Gershon Ben Deren is a
fifth degree black belt

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.600
in Krav Maga, the fighting
system of the IDF,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.080
and is a professional security
consultant with over 20 years

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.100
working as both an
operative and as a trainer.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.920
His book "Krav Maga
Tactical Survival"

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.380
presents as many
nonphysical solutions

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.530
to violence as physical
ones and describes in detail

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.850
how and when to de-escalate
potentially violent situations,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.400
recognizing the warning
signs of an attack,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.920
and how to shut it
down before it happens.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.070
In this talk, you'll learn
the psychology of violence

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.840
and how to effectively
communicate

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.390
with angry and aggressive
people in order

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.810
to resolve conflicts and
disputes before they turn

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.330
physical, skills that he
has learned and employed

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
over his 20-year career dealing
with aggressive and violent

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.830
individuals.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.402
Please let me introduce
Gershon Ben Keren.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:05.288
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:08.660
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Thank you.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.820
I always try and like
to start these things

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.490
by taking something
from real life

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.990
and bring it to you
to make it relevant.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.380
So in 2015 July, there
were two women walking back

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.380
from a club in South Boston
about 1 AM in the morning.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.820
And they were
jumped by two guys.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.840
One had an imitation pistol.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.150
And it was a basic
mugging scenario.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.960
They screamed.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.590
They shouted.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.470
They were fortunate that there
was an off-duty cop nearby

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.330
who came and broke it up.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.160
And the two guys
ran off, escaped,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
got into a white car that
was waiting for them, boom.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.750
The women-- or one of them--
wrote a letter to Fox News.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.700
And is really good
to get experiences

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.130
from people who've been
in real life situations

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.100
and see what they did
right, what they did wrong.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.020
This isn't to blame
anybody, but so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.590
that we can have some
takeaways to see how we can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.230
improve our survival chances.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.680
And one of the lines
that was in the letter

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.450
was that she wrote,
"Although we'd both

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.530
taken self-defense courses
before, and they were useful,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.430
everything happened so fast
that we didn't have time

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.600
to do anything."

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.180
And I could take that as
a self-defense instructor

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.890
and be insulted by it, and
say, well hang on a minute,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.850
why didn't you get your
self-defense to work.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.010
But I actually agree with them.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.600
And I don't believe
that self-defense

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.129
as self-defense works.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.920
And this is something
I've experienced over

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.280
20 years personally,
from my own experiences,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.650
talking to other
security personnel,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.230
and watching violence unfold.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.800
Self-defense, or physical
self-defense, as a standalone

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.900
simply doesn't work.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.060
If I was to be standing
here talking to you,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.730
and suddenly, somebody
ran out from the curtains,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.360
tackled me from behind,
and took me to the ground,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.760
I would have a lot
of catching up to do.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.130
I'd be a long way
behind the curve.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.440
This person had the initiative.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.330
They're the one that's
putting a plan into action.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.340
However, if I had a
level of awareness to me

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.890
that I heard movement behind
me, and I turned to face,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.010
now I stand a better chance
of getting my self-defense

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.600
to work.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.620
And that piece, that
awareness piece, the knowledge

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.470
and the skills to identify
and predict violence

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.910
before it occurs we refer to
as the self-protection piece.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.220
And without that
self-protection piece,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.750
self-defense really falls flat.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.370
And I think
everybody knows that.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.430
Inherently, we kind of know it,
which is why a lot of people

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.880
have a lot of doubts about
learning self-defense.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.680
Because they really
don't believe

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.749
that it's going to work.

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.040
And one of the things we've
tried to do in both books--

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.450
and I would say "we," because
it's a collective effort.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.350
I may write it,
but I have a team

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.060
of instructors who we
discuss, debate, and work out

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.230
the choreography of the
photographs, et cetera.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.050
We try and put
violence into context.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.200
So rather than just
say, here's a technique,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.750
we really talk about solutions.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.700
Because techniques,
on their own, fail.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.590
But as part of a solution,
we can make them work.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.970
So part of what I want to
discuss and present today

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.800
is to give you an
understanding of how

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.740
certain violent
situations evolve,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.190
get created, how you
can identify them,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.060
and what nonphysical things you
can do to possibly avoid them,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.780
or at the very least, get
your self-defense techniques

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.020
to work, or improve
their chances.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.390
And that's that
self-protection piece.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.510
So I know some of you have
scanned through the book.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.280
I know it's a first book.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.890
But you will probably have seen
that we shot the photographs

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.340
in the locations where assaults
are likely to take place,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.010
some bars, around ATMs,
restaurants, parking lots, all

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.610
of those places where
we can give a context,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.120
and where we can talk about how
a violent situation actually

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.300
develops and evolve, and
how you can pick out warning

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.950
signs in that situation.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.910
And we do exactly the
same in the second book.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.660
So a large part of
our effectiveness

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.150
comes from putting
violence in context,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.690
helping people understand how
violent situations develop

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.970
so that they can spot
those warning signs,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.410
hopefully walk away, if
not in certain situations,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.865
de-escalate, resolve
the conflict.

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:51.290
And in other situations, if
they need a physical solution,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.350
at least they've had time to
put some level of preparation

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.670
into place to get those physical
techniques to work as part

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.190
of the overall solution.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.630
One of the simple
things I always

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.630
see lacking in a lot of
self-defense instructionals

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.810
when I watch on
YouTube and in videos

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.810
is a key piece that seems to get
forgotten all the time, which

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.470
is disengagement.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.980
So even after you've
done something,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.930
you've got to disengage.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.710
And often we get blinded by,
we need to learn the technique

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.490
and forget that, possibly, using
a technique to escape a hold

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.290
or get out of a
situation, we need

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.020
to put a disengagement
piece in and go.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.430
Because it's only when we're
out of that situation that

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.020
the violent incident
actually ends.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.570
So what I'm going to
talk about a lot today

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.560
is de-escalation
and disengagement.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.590
I'm a big believer in
creating decision trees.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.350
Because one of the things
which is really hard for us

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.880
to do when we're
under the stress

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.130
and duress of a
violent situation

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.140
dealing with an
aggressive individual

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.570
is actually deciding what to do.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.740
Should we walk away?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.970
Should we talk?

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.550
Should we get physical?

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.480
So most people
get caught in what

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.420
we call a deliberation
loop of trying to decide

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.490
what the best solution is.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.410
So what I'm going
to do now is go

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.070
through a kind of top-down
decision tree of understanding

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.230
violent situations
so that you almost

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.320
have a pre-built
set of responses

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.270
based on an aggressor's actions
and behaviors towards you.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.260
There's basically
two types of violence

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.420
that you're going to face.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.720
We have what we
call premeditated,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.130
and we have spontaneous.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.870
A premeditated
situation would be

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.870
one such as a mugging, where an
aggressor goes out, purchases

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.200
a weapon, sets themselves up in
a location, looks for victims,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.080
carries out some form
of surveillance on them,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.680
watches how they
act, behave, moves,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.770
or what we call synchronizes
their movement to theirs,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.830
and then sticks a knife to
them and demands a wallet.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.150
It's all planned, yeah?

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.610
We have spontaneous
acts of violence.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.060
These would be examples
such as cutting somebody off

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.490
in traffic.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.630
And because you've cut
them off in traffic,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.590
they've spontaneously become
aggressive towards you.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.460
Accidentally spilling
a drink over somebody--

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.820
that person didn't come to
that scene, that situation,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.970
with the intent of becoming
aggressive and violent,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.570
but your actions and behaviors
have caused them to do so.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.860
And they might not be real.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.570
It could be the perception.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.870
Maybe it wasn't you that
spilled the drink over them.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.850
Maybe it was somebody
else that forced

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.820
you to cut them off in traffic.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.960
But the perception is that
your actions and behaviors

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.500
have caused them to become
aggressive towards you.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.700
In premeditated situations,
we have the chance

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.830
of spotting and identifying
the stages and processes

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.180
that a predatory
individual uses.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.440
So for example, if
I'm in a crowded area

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.020
and I catch somebody
target glancing--

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.130
that's somebody who might move
to a location, glance at me,

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.460
move to another
location, glance at me--

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.730
this person has
an interest in me.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.300
It might be I see them
scanning, looking around.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.000
So maybe they're
checking for exits

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.090
that they can go down after
they commit the crime.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.290
Maybe they're looking for the
presence of law enforcement,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.290
of CCTV cameras.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.800
These are things
that I can spot.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.250
And so I can predict.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.160
Spontaneous situations,
by the very nature,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.850
I can't predict, because
they just happen.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.110
I can be as careful as I want
carrying some drinks back

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.690
from a bar, and
somebody knocks into me.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.180
I can't predict that
that was going to happen.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.170
And there's two big differences
between premeditated and

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.810
spontaneous situations.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.790
In premeditated situations,
there's an outcome.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.480
If somebody wants to mug you,
they have an outcome in mind.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.830
They want your wallet.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.050
They want your mobile phone.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.080
In a spontaneous
situation, the person

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.540
doesn't have an outcome in mind.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.000
The person that
you spill a drink

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.910
over doesn't really know what's
going to make that situation

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.230
right for them.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.990
The person that you
cut off in traffic

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.480
doesn't really know what's
going to make the situation

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.900
right for them.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.770
They've just become
aggressive towards you because

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.150
of your actions and behaviors.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.780
So when we look at
premeditated situations,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.640
we have a simple choice.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.060
If you're a mugger
who wants my wallet,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.340
I can hand it over to you.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.570
And in probably 99% of
situations, you're going to go.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.560
If you stay, there's obviously
a secondary motive at play.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.740
And I probably need to
enact a physical solution

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.920
to deal with it.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.700
So I've got a nice,
simple decision tree.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.970
If you want me, and
you want to move me

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.850
from one location to another,
that's a different matter.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.490
Because now you obviously want
to do something to me that you

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.100
couldn't do in this location.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.250
So I have a little decision tree
with premeditated situations.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.860
Do you want my resources?

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.420
Do you want me?

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.215
If you want my resources,
I give them to you.

00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:29.560
You go.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.400
If you don't go, I need to
enact a physical solution.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.460
If you want me rather
than my resources,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.540
I need to enact a
physical solution.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.440
Does that makes sense to people?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.450
But the first
question I have to ask

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.240
is, is it a premeditated
situation or a spontaneous one.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.657
And obviously, the
person involved

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:49.781
will give me clues to that.

00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:50.920
If they stick a wallet--

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.680
a knife to me and demand my
wallet, there's an outcome.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.480
It's premeditated.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.040
If I spill a drink
over somebody,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.350
and somebody starts
screaming and shouting at me

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.350
without making an actual
demand, then I kind of

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.590
know it's a
spontaneous situation.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.010
When we look at the
two books in tandem,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.180
the first book largely deals
with premeditated situations.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.580
So it looks at mugging
situations, abduction

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.090
situations.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.090
The second book largely looks
at spontaneous situations,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.030
violence that happens
in social settings.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.810
So that's a kind of
balance of the two books.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.570
And what I want to
talk about today now

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.490
is more about those
spontaneous situations

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.590
and what you need to do to try
and de-escalate them, resolve

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.110
the conflict, and be
able to walk away.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.120
And I'm actually going
to explain the process

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.540
for doing that.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.880
So if you're confronted by an
aggressor-- first question,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.410
premeditated or spontaneous?

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.680
Premeditated-- I work
down that decision tree.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.250
Spontaneous-- I'm going to
try and help this person

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.100
find a nonviolent outcome.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.800
So I'm going to help
them define an outcome.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.200
At the moment, if I
spill a drink over them,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.700
they have nothing
in their head that

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.610
says this is what they want
to get out of the situation.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.280
And that's why they're
becoming aggressive.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.200
And if we look at what it takes
for somebody to be aggressive,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.190
we see a couple of things.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:24.910
The first one-- they
need to feel justified.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.390
They need to feel
justified to be aggressive,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.510
to be angry towards you.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:35.050
The other thing is they
can't see any alternatives.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.710
So they're justified in acting
aggressively towards you,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.860
and they can't see any
alternatives other than acting

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.660
aggressively towards you.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.140
So part of our job in
de-escalating a situation

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.230
and resolving the conflict
without it going physical

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.340
is to help present
alternatives to that aggressor

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.350
so that they can consider
a nonviolent solution.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.630
And often we get confused
between de-escalation

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.460
and conflict resolution.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.070
And one has to come
before the other.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.240
If somebody is in a highly
emotional state over having

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.310
a drink spilt over them, until
we can get that emotion down,

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.840
they won't really be able to see
a resolution to the conflict.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.950
And we won't be able to,
because they're too emotional.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.190
And I'm going to kind of draw a
little picture here, hopefully,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.290
which will explain
how people think

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.740
and act when they
become violent.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.810
So you'll have to
excuse me here.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.090
My drawing skills used
to be pretty good,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.570
and they're even worse now.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.850
This is a brain believe,
it or not, yeah?

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.610
Thank you.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.950
And I'm going to
explain a theory

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:57.140
that a guy, McClellan, put
forward in the '60s called

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.680
triune brain theory.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.690
He was an evolutionary
psychologist.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.430
And he was trying
to explain kind

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:07.440
of how we have come to
have the brain that we do.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.200
His theory, as an
evolutionary theory,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.800
has kind of been
dispelled and debunked.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.430
But conceptually, his model
gives us a good understanding

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.300
of how different areas of our
understanding and emotions

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.410
control our actions
and behaviors,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.570
especially when angry.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:32.860
So he put forward the idea
that we have a reasoning brain,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.820
the brain that we're
using now, the brain that

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.660
helps us understand ideas,
concepts, principles,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.540
be creative, all of
those things, the one

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.730
that, hopefully, we're
using most of the time.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:51.060
But he also said we have a
mammalian or limbic system

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.010
brain.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:59.540
And at the base, we also
have a reptilian brain.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.060
So what he was basically
putting forward

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.700
is, we have this kind of
human reasoning brain,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.810
but we also have this
animalistic type of brain,

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.260
which is split into two.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.590
Most of the time, we're
using our reasoning brain.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:19.210
But as we become more emotional,
we start to switch that off,

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.350
and we start moving
to the limbic brain.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.710
And when we're
highly emotional, we

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.800
start using that
reptilian brain.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.340
Have you ever told an
angry person to calm down?

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.140
Has it ever worked?

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.350
No, and I'll explain why.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.740
When somebody uses
their limbic brain--

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.290
and it's good to think of the
limbic brain as a dog brain,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.120
yeah?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.210
Dogs are social
creatures, and they

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.830
resolve conflict in a number
of ways other than fighting.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.720
Dogs in a pack will rarely
fight, same in a wolf pack.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.640
Because the wolf pack's survival
relies on every one of the dogs

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.010
being healthy and able to hunt.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.310
So they have different
ways of resolving conflict

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.140
within the pecking order.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.677
And two of the ways they do
it is through posturing--

00:17:13.677 --> 00:17:15.280
well, it gets a bit messy--

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.548
and submission.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.400
So when dogs have a
conflict in a pack,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.630
there'll be some growling.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.619
There will be some snarling.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:26.785
They'll raise their hackles.

00:17:26.785 --> 00:17:28.020
Their tails will come up.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.960
And then one will normally
go down, roll on its back,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.400
show its throat--

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.700
conflict resolved.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.389
When you tell
somebody to calm down,

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.930
and they're using
their limbic system

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.500
brain because they've
become emotional,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.520
you're posturing to them.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.740
You're telling them what to do.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.072
Calm down-- you're
giving them an order.

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:50.780
And if you've told
somebody to calm down,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.380
you were probably met with
the response, I am calm.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.920
Because that person's
posturing back to you.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.250
And you can say as nicely,
and as pleasantly, you know,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.800
and as pleading as you want.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.490
But that instruction is taken
as an act of posturing, yeah?

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.700
Please be quiet, don't shout--

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.200
these are all instructions.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.800
They're all acts of posturing,
which are basically just going

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.850
to elevate the situation
and escalate it rather

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.220
than de-escalate it.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.340
Now, if the person
is highly emotive

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.610
and they're working with
the reptilian brain,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.990
they're going to interpret
as either fight or flight.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.710
We all heard of fight
or flight responses.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.610
So if you tell somebody who's
working off that reptilian

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.770
brain, yeah--

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.580
they've bypassed the
limbic system brain.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.260
They're highly emotional.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.490
They're really angry, and
you tell them to calm down--

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.950
that's fighting talk.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.850
So what we have to
do is get the person

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:03.180
back to using their
reasoning brain.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.030
Because if we're dealing with
a reasonable person, well,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.080
we know that reasonable people
aren't going to attack us,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.420
aren't going to become violent.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.510
So when we look at what
de-escalation actually is,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.330
we're trying to move
the person from working

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.940
with the reptilian or
limbic system brain

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.720
back up to working with
their reasoning brain.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.840
Because if their reasoning
brain is functioned,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.640
they can start to
consider alternatives.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.070
When they're highly emotional,
and the reasoning brain

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.350
is switched off, and
they're working primarily

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.260
with their limbic system
or reptilian brain,

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.630
they're not thinking
about alternatives.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.660
They're working off
emotional justification.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.480
And part of what we
also have to do--

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.840
and I'll explain about that--

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.660
is take away that
justification so the person

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.280
doesn't have a justification
to become violent towards us.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.650
And this is how we
can resolve a conflict

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:02.690
without it going physical, which
really should be our end game.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.699
Sometimes when I'm interviewed,
people will say, well yeah,

00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:07.490
I know that's all right
for everybody else.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.410
But you'd do it
differently, wouldn't you?

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.400
You'd get physical.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.180
And it's like, no, I wouldn't.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.150
If I can walk away
from a situation,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.070
if I can de-escalate
a situation,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.350
that's the way I'm going.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.930
Three assumptions I make about
anyone I'm dealing with--

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.515
they're armed, even if I can't
see a weapon, they're assisted,

00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.140
there are people in
the environment who

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.900
can come to their
aid, and they're able,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.890
they're able to deal with
whatever physical solution I

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.090
put in place.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.100
So if I know how to punch,
they know how to block.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.860
So when I look at
that, I want to walk

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.170
away from every situation
just like everybody else.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.572
Because I'm no Superman.

00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:46.280
I don't want to be in
a situation dealing

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.850
with armed multiple assailants
who are competent at what

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.570
they're doing.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.530
I want to de-escalate.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.662
I want to walk away as well.

00:20:54.662 --> 00:20:56.120
And the easiest
way to get somebody

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.880
back to using their
reasoning brain

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.810
is to ask questions,
open-ended questions.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.550
And they need to be open-ended.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:13.200
So a good open-ended question
that I've used a lot in my time

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.140
working security--

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.790
what can I do to sort this out?

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.220
I don't say sorry.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.020
And this is sometimes
where people make

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.509
a mistake in de-escalating.

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:27.550
Because remember, I don't
want to give the person

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.580
justification.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.530
And if I say sorry,
I'm automatically

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.830
justifying the fact
that they have a right

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.650
to be angry and
aggressive with me.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.100
So one of the common mistakes
I see in de-escalation

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.050
is people apologizing.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.620
Now, when I say, what
can I do sort this out,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.950
there's kind of an
implicit apology

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.470
there, but not an explicit one.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:57.020
So I'm not giving the
person justification

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.610
by saying I'm sorry.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.410
But I'm letting them know that
I'm kind of responsible here,

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.640
not necessarily
for what happened,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.570
but for what is going to happen.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.510
And often, a lot of
emotional people,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.400
when they're
aggressive, are almost

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.160
dying to have a
lifeline thrown to them.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.350
A lot of people
don't want to fight,

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.660
but they feel that they have to.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.030
So if somebody can
throw a lifeline to them

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.880
and take responsibility
away from them

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.770
to deal with the
situation, a lot of people

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.660
are happy to take that.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.350
I've seen that a lot working
door and bar security.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.390
So not everybody who
becomes spontaneously

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.510
aggressive towards you wants
to move towards violence,

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.490
but they kind of feel
compelled that they

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.440
have to, especially
if they're in a group

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.590
and there's a social setting.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.440
So I'm going to say, what
can I do to sort this out.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.690
And in doing that, I'm letting
the person choose the solution.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.700
So they're having
to think, well, what

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.960
would sort this situation out.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.310
Maybe if I spilt
a drink over them,

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.630
well, you can buy
me another drink.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.210
OK, the person's now thinking
about nonviolent alternatives

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.490
that will resolve
this situation.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.100
And it's a huge difference
between them saying,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.980
well, you can buy me
another drink and me saying,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.810
when I spill a
drink over somebody,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.790
I'll buy you another drink.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.390
Because for them, that will be
taken as an act of posturing.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.220
Because I'm telling
them, this is what's

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.345
going to resolve the conflict.

00:23:26.345 --> 00:23:27.220
I'll buy you a drink.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.260
That's an end to it.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:34.060
Whereas if they say to me,
you can buy me another drink,

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.320
I'm allowing them
to posture to me.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.870
And violence is
largely ritualistic.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.470
If you look at animals
fight, it's very ritualistic.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.850
Human beings are the same.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.860
So if I allow this person
to posture to me and say,

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.490
you can buy me another
drink, and I say, that's OK,

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.770
will that sort
the situation out,

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.720
I'm playing that
submissive role.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.990
I'm the equivalent of the
dog lying down, rolling

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.390
onto its back,
showing its throat.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.500
And one of the things when
we look at social violence

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.130
posturing, submission, posturing
will recognize submission,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.630
yeah?

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.980
Somebody who's posturing will
recognize submissive behavior.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.160
If they're fight/flight
mode in reptilian brain,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.540
that's probably
not going to work.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.710
So we have to work out, are they
working with the limbic system

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.940
brain, are they working
with the reptilian brain.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.340
And people will talk a
lot about warning signs.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:39.050
How do you identify, how do you
spot when somebody is actually

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.250
going to be physically
violent towards you?

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.144
And there's so much
research done in this area.

00:24:47.144 --> 00:24:49.310
There are so many people
who have worked in security

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:52.670
will tell you all about
the physical cues,

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.660
that they'll jut
the chin forward,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:00.510
they'll bring the arms back,
their color will change.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.930
And these things are all true.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.980
But I challenge anyone
in a state of stress

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.070
and duress to pick
up on these things.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.400
They're small, subtle cues.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.686
They exist.

00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:15.560
A good example I was
always told when I first

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.650
started working door
was, yeah, the blood

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.320
will drain away from their
face towards the larger muscle

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.020
groups.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.220
That does happen.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.760
But if you're in low
lighting in a club or a bar,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.350
I challenge anyone to spot
that change take place.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.450
And also, you have to
have a point of reference.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.130
Were you looking
at their complexion

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.390
before they became angry?

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.810
So although, again,
these things happen,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.570
they're not really
good warning signs.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.560
However there are three
really good warning signs

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.240
that tell us when somebody
is becoming motivated

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.340
towards physical violence.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.730
And this is one of the reasons
why I ask the question, what

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.929
can I do to sort this out.

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:01.720
Because I'm going to
judge where the person

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.200
is emotionally on their
response to that question.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.330
So there are three
warning signs--

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.690
and these are based on my
experiences and others'--

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.060
which really tell you when
somebody is getting ready,

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.780
as it were, to throw that
punch, make that grab.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:22.190
First one-- silence.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.630
If you are met with silence when
you say to somebody, what can I

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:31.040
do to sort this out, what
it means is their ability

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.310
to verbally process has gone.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.910
And when somebody is moving
towards physical violence,

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.950
certain things switch off.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.986
And one of those is the ability
to verbally communicate.

00:26:43.986 --> 00:26:45.360
Because if you're
going to fight,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.880
you don't need verbal
communication skills.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.820
So basically, the brain will
clear that to create bandwidth,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.520
yeah, to pick up reaction--
to increase reaction time--

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.590
to pick up on physical cues.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.050
So when somebody meets
you with silence,

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.960
be pretty sure that
that person is getting

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.890
ready to swing that punch.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.050
One big cue when you
look at it physically

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.380
is when people turn away.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.040
And they'll turn away, and
then they'll make that strike.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.980
So I'll talk again about
some of the physical setups

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.355
when somebody is
going to strike.

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:22.813
Because what you
want to do is look

00:27:22.813 --> 00:27:25.440
at all of these in conjunction.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.780
So silence, garbled words--

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.490
so when somebody's
speech is garbled,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.160
they mix up the
order of the words.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.080
You drink my spill--

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.600
heard that a lot.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.940
And that's kind of like the
one step before silence.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.300
The person is not able
to form sentences.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.250
Their verbal
communication skills

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.110
have started to shut down.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.990
They're getting
ready to go physical.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.390
So when I say, what can
I do to sort this out,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.960
and the person is mixing their
words up or meeting with me

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.290
silence, I'm pretty sure
de-escalation is not

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.147
going to be successful.

00:28:08.147 --> 00:28:09.980
And we need to know
when de-escalation won't

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.070
be successful as when it will.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.260
The third one is something that
we call repetitive looping.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:26.960
Repetitive-- when
somebody keeps insisting

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.295
their claim against you.

00:28:28.295 --> 00:28:29.930
You spilled my drink.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.340
You spilled my drink.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.930
You spilled my drink.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.670
And what the person
is doing is they're

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.330
self-justifying to themselves.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.590
Remember that people have to
feel justified to use violence.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.450
So they're repeating
this in their head

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.720
over and over again, basically,
to convince themselves

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.750
that they're justified
to go physical.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:53.880
So when I get met with these
three responses to my question,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.030
I know that de-escalation
as de-escalation

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.970
is probably not going to work,
that the person's reasoning

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.360
brain is so far shut
off that they're not

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.800
going to be able to
consider any alternatives.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.630
You might have noticed,
as well, that my--

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.780
as I'm talking about this, my--

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.870
body language moves and shifts.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.990
Because I want to prepare
myself for that situation

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.720
where my de-escalation
is not going to work.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.670
And this is, again, part of what
gets my self-defense to work.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:29.660
So if I'm standing nose to
nose to somebody with my hands

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.930
down as they're screaming
and shouting in my face,

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.350
if they want to grab me, punch
me, my chances of actually

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.660
defending that are pretty low.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.880
Their action will
beat my reaction.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.650
Remember what we said
about catching up

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.746
when you're behind the curve?

00:29:44.746 --> 00:29:46.370
So one of the first
things I want to do

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.150
is step away and
control range so

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:54.350
that if that person wants to
make a physical assault on me,

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.780
they have to move forward.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.270
Because it's much easier
for me to deal with a punch

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.150
where the person has to
move forward than somebody

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.470
who just has to punch me.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.330
I'm putting my hands up and out,
so I'm defending this space.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.510
And my hands are in the
international language

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.420
for "I don't want any trouble."

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.340
If I was to stand here
in a fighting stance,

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.020
I'm really giving
that person a reason

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.430
why they should attack me.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.320
Because if they don't,
I'm going to attack them.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.170
So I'll put my hands out.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.170
If it needs to be a
little bit more forceful,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.680
I can move my hands right out
into the international language

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.720
for "stop."

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.400
So I'll do all of this, hey,
what can I do to sort this out,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.900
with this passive
motion of my hands.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.140
Notice, though, that my
body is very upright.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.400
So I'm not acting
submissive and scared.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.980
And what I'm
effectively doing here

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.050
is acting like the
alpha dog in a pack.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.330
A lot of times, people
think that the alpha dog

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.570
gets involved in every
little minor dispute.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:06.050
The alpha dog's a little bit
beyond that in a wolf pack.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:09.290
The alpha dog will let the
other dogs play with its bone.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.460
Doesn't care about that.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.040
That doesn't affect its
standing in the pecking order.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.710
If its position is
challenged, oh yeah,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:23.090
it'll posture and possibly
fight to defend that position.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.820
I'm sending mixed signals here.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:30.820
My hands are passive, but
my posture is confident.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.340
And what I want to do is just,
from that animalistic signal,

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.580
put a little bit of doubt
into the person's head who

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.440
I'm dealing with.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.080
Maybe I'm not the alpha.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.760
But if I stand there as the
alpha, giving that impression,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.450
and at the same time saying,
what can I do to sort this out,

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.270
again, there's
just enough doubts

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.610
circulating in my
aggressor's mind

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.280
to wonder who they've actually
picked this fight with.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.590
And maybe it would be
better, because I'm

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.660
giving you that option
to posture to me,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.300
to go down that route.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.080
The other thing I
do when I step back

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.390
is not just to
control range, it's

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.380
to judge the person's
response towards me.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.830
Do they follow me
into that space?

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.540
And one of the
things I've done here

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.660
is set myself up, from
the legal perspective,

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.270
to give myself the
right to defend myself.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.210
So a lot of people, when
they think about an assault,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.670
they think it's got to
involve somebody grabbing you,

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.900
somebody hitting you.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.850
That's battery.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.300
Assault is when somebody
gives you reason

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.070
to fear for your safety--

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.620
so they're shouting,
screaming threats at you--

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.720
and puts themselves
in a position

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.500
where they can cause you harm.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.930
So even though, here,
when he's nose to nose,

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:54.700
it's assault, if I step
back, I'm also confirming,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.400
from a legal position,
if he follows in,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.710
that it's definitely
a case of assault.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.320
And this gives me the
option, under the law,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.690
to preemptively attack.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.030
So I don't have to wait
for him to throw a punch.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.030
And that isn't necessarily
what I'm going to do.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.210
But I'm in a position,
now, to do it if necessary.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.010
So that's what assault is.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.440
If he moved into space,
pulled his arm back,

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.270
that's assault and battery.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.157
So it's good to know
where you stand legally.

00:33:21.157 --> 00:33:23.740
Because one of the things that
will happen when you're dealing

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.420
with an aggressive
person is you'll

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.270
have all these doubts
come into your head.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.790
Is it legal for me to hit him?

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.370
What are the police
going to say?

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.010
What's his attorney going
to say if it goes to court?

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.770
And all these doubts will
cause you to hesitate.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.080
So what I like to do,
just as I'm saying,

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.050
what can I do to sort
this out, I'm judging,

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.077
from what I say,
what his response is.

00:33:47.077 --> 00:33:49.660
Do I get a reasonable response--
you can buy me another drink.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.580
You can pay for dry cleaning.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.900
Do I get silence?

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.370
Do I get garbled words?

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.380
Do I get repetitive looping?

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.320
His responses are
basically determining

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.690
what my next move is.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.550
So I've stepped back here.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:07.660
So let's say he follows me
in, and he starts shouting.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:14.350
I still have one last chance to
try a nonphysical solution, one

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.480
last chance.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.989
It's not a guarantee.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.429
Nothing's a guarantee.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.350
As Clint Eastwood
said in Dirty Harry,

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.510
"if you want a guarantee,
buy a toaster."

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:28.070
I can kind of help guide, but
none of this is a guarantee.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.870
So I've got my hands up here.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.230
Often I'll talk with
them, and I'll move them.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.489
So if I have to
work preemptively,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.540
is not spotted as
easily as if it's

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.969
movement from a static hand.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.710
So I'll talk here.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.729
And the guy's still in my
face, screaming and shouting.

00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:48.610
And what I'm going to do
here is push the hands,

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.010
not making contact
fast towards his face,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:56.730
and shout, back off, and
move a good way back.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.740
There's two fears that
we're born with, yeah?

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.570
Most other fears we learn.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.784
If you have a fear of
dogs, a fear of snakes,

00:35:03.784 --> 00:35:04.450
you learnt that.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.875
You weren't born with it.

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:09.310
And most times, you're
educated by your parents.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.840
There's a famous
experiment that was

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.950
done where there was a monkey
that had basically been

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.365
bred domestically in captivity.

00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:19.780
It had never seen
a snake before.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.770
And so they introduced,
into its enclosure, a snake.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.130
And the monkey goes over
to it and starts poking it.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.090
They then bring a monkey
that grew up in the wild

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.020
and introduce it.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.710
And that monkey starts whooping
and screaming, explaining,

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.930
this is dangerous,
this is dangerous.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.150
And this domesticated
monkey steps

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.940
back, copies the response.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.880
So it's like a learnt fear.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.790
They then repeated this
with the newly-learnt monkey

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.430
being introduced to
another monkey who

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.780
hadn't seen a snake before.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.880
And so the chain goes
on, this teaching, yep?

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.630
So a lot of the time, we are
actually learning our fears.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.120
But two that we're born with--

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.480
fast movement, loud noise.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.390
And they stimulate
our flinch reflex.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.430
And what I'm doing
here when I push

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:13.750
my hands fast towards a person's
face is to get them to flinch.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:18.146
I'm reinforcing that with a
loud noise and a instruction--

00:36:18.146 --> 00:36:20.340
back off!

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.120
So what I want to do
is get them to flinch.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.330
And what this can do-- and I'm
going to say can do rather than

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.290
will do--

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:32.580
is cause them to undergo
an emotional reset.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.910
So suddenly, they've kind of
had the emotion taken away

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.720
from them.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.260
And people, unless
they're psychopaths,

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.420
need to have a certain level of
emotion, yeah, to attack you.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.870
You see this in the
"pre-fight rituals"

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.560
when people are making threats.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.390
They're building
themselves up when they're

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.740
doing their repetitive looping.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.170
They're building
themselves up emotionally.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.580
This is why most altercations--
certainly male on male--

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.330
start with a bit
of shoving first.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.750
The person's getting
themselves ready emotionally

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.870
to make that large,
physically damaging attack.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.100
So while this guy's going
through all of his rituals--

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.750
back off!

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.976
And also, I'm moving away.

00:37:20.976 --> 00:37:22.850
And if I had more space,
I would demonstrate.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.690
But I move a good distance
away from the person.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.490
So they now also have to make
a conscious choice about,

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:33.334
are they going to continue
on with this assault.

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:35.250
Because now they've got
to get themselves back

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.420
into an emotional space where
they're justified, yeah,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.680
and they feel ready.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.350
And they've got to make
a physical movement

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.130
across that space to
make their attack.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.430
And to be honest, if I'm doing
that back off, I'm not really

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.920
staying to watch
the results, yeah?

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.420
I'll get that flinch.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.300
That's creating me
time and distance

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.490
to make my movement
away from them.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.360
So when I look at my
de-escalation process, what

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.550
I'm trying to do
is get the person

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.810
to work back using
their reasoning brain.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.180
Easiest way--
open-ended questions.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.400
Don't tell them what to do.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.630
Don't tell them to calm down.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.020
Don't tell them to
please be quiet, yeah?

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.550
Don't tell them
to stop shouting.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:21.550
It's not going to work.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.420
It's just going to escalate the
situation, because they'll take

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.240
it as you posturing to them.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.540
I ask my open-ended
question in the hope

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.080
that they will re-engage with
their reasoning brain again,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.330
that they'll be able to
consider alternatives,

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.480
and they'll be able
to posture to me.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.630
So they'll be able to tell me,
you can buy me another drink.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.450
Great, will that sort
the situation out?

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.610
Yep.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.850
Notice I've taken away
their justification now.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.750
As soon as I agree
to their demand,

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.500
they now no longer have
a justifiable reason

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.120
to assault me.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.570
I'm also, by asking
them the question,

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:07.730
judging silence, garbled
words, repetitive looping.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.070
Are they receptive
to de-escalation?

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.920
If that fails, hands come out,
loud noise, fast movement,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.390
trying to stimulate
the flinch reflex.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:25.512
Get that emotional
reset button going.

00:39:25.512 --> 00:39:27.470
There are some things
you can do, as well, when

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:30.680
your de-escalation process is
possibly not going to plan.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.290
When I used to
work door security,

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.860
sometimes people would make
some very unreasonable claims.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.610
So you'd walk over, what
can I do to sort this out,

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.730
and somebody would tell me that
I should give them a lifetime

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:44.750
membership to the club.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.250
They should never
have to pay again.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.640
Drinks should always be on
the house, et cetera, et

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.150
cetera, et cetera.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:54.090
And I'm not in a
position to go, yes.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.840
So in that situation, I ask
more open-ended questions.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.420
I'm sorry, I'm not
able to do that.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.930
I don't have the authority.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.240
Is there anything else
you can think of that

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.070
would sort this out for you?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.010
Because all I've got to do--

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.770
pardon me-- is keep them
thinking of alternatives.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.020
And the more they use
their reasoning brain,

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.090
the more they're moving away
from their limbic or reptilian.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.910
Other tricks I can do--

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.420
I can sometimes ask
them to slow down.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.560
I used to do work with
collections agencies back

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.699
in the UK.

00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:33.240
And you'd get people ringing up
on the phone going, dear Mrs.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.050
Jones, you owe us 10,000 pounds.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.110
What?

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.060
And the guy would
go off on a rant.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.620
And one of the things that
we found worked very well

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.166
was asking the
person to slow down.

00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:47.290
Could you please slow down?

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.980
I'm having trouble understanding
exactly what you're saying.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:57.250
Because when people speak very
slowly, it's hard for them

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.299
to say in that emotional space.

00:41:00.299 --> 00:41:02.090
So there are certain
things that I can do--

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.880
and we describe
these in the book--

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.030
how I can kind of reinforce
that de-escalation process.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.790
But the big one is opening--

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.310
is asking that
open-ended question.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.590
What can I do to sort this out?

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.520
Don't apologize.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.670
There's an implicit
apology in that statement.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:23.080
And you want to move
the situation on, yeah?

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.020
Apology is moving back
into the situation.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.110
You need to move it on for
a solution, because violence

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.410
is extremely fast-moving.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.990
Do it with your body language.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:38.890
Appear confident,
but also passive.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.230
Don't appear like
a threat to them.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.920
If I do this, maybe he's
justified to attack me first,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.320
yeah, because he's in
fear for his safety.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.130
And I'm in a position
where I can attack him.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.540
So when we start looking
at violent situations,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.300
when we have our decision
tree, premeditated situations,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.140
you want my resources,
here they are.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.300
Violence avoided.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.670
Maybe if you don't go,
you move off-script,

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.980
you're not behaving
like a mugger anymore,

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.890
maybe now I need to deal
with you physically.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.040
If you want me,
that's another matter.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.280
I'll deal with you physically.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.220
Spontaneous-- start the
de-escalation process.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.190
When I ask the
question, does a person

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.320
respond presenting alternatives?

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.860
Great, continue
de-escalation process.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.260
They meet me with
silence, garbled words,

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.770
repetitive looping, back off!

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.400
Does that work?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.880
Yeah, violence avoided.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.220
When we look at
violence as a whole

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.910
and we consider that kind of
understanding of the landscape,

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.760
we can see that most
violent situations don't

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.540
require a physical solution.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.850
We can de-escalate
most situations.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:58.150
Most violent situations or
potentially violent situations

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.650
that you're going
to face are going

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.930
to be spontaneous
acts of violence,

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.370
yeah, disputes over
parking spaces.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.270
We live in Boston.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:10.530
I know we haven't had
bad snow this year.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:15.222
Last year, there was a guy shot
over a parking space, yeah?

00:43:15.222 --> 00:43:16.680
He parked in
somebody's space where

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.930
the guy had cleared the snow.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.530
I don't think he just
said, I'll move the car.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.340
I'm sure there were words spoken
how that wasn't his space,

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.350
he wasn't legally entitled.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.750
And you know what, the guy
might be totally right.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.296
But he got shot being right.

00:43:34.296 --> 00:43:37.560
And most times, when you're
dealing with violence,

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.730
you have a choice.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.130
Be effective, or be right.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.810
Better to be effective.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.230
And sometimes that means
putting your ego in check,

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.540
not arguing whether
you spilt the drink

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.760
or you didn't spill
the drink, yeah?

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.430
That might not be
the best way to go.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.500
Just what can I do
to sort this out?

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.890
From there, maybe
we can branch out.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.500
Maybe you have to buy a drink.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.670
But if I'm thinking that this
guy is armed, he's assisted,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:13.015
and he's abled, much better
solution for me to go down.

00:44:13.015 --> 00:44:17.960
A guy I do a lot of work with
in South Africa, Gabriel Snyder,

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:23.450
says there's two reasons why
you fight, ego or survival.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.820
And that's a question that you
always have to ask yourself.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.470
If I'm not going to hand
over my wallet to the mugger,

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.290
is that an ego or
survival choice?

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.210
It's an ego choice.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.490
Survival tells me, hand it over.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:40.490
And in 99% of occasions,
that person will go.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:44.930
Only when they stay and it's
now a survival situation

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.510
do I need to fight.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.490
And when you fight
for ego, there's

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.170
a lot of questions in your head.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.760
Am I legally entitled,
morally entitled to do this?

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.420
When you're fighting for
survival, everything's open.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.680
Everything's on the table.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:08.390
And so it's better to have
your decision tree direct

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.040
your physical
solutions down to where

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.370
it constitutes a survival
situation rather than one

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.320
where it's ego-driven.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.270
And that can be hard.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.580
Because when you're
handing over the wallet--

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.480
and I've done this.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.570
I've been mugged--
in your head, you're

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.920
kind of wanting to
go, oh man, yeah,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.560
you shouldn't have this, yeah?

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.870
I actually now
carry two wallets,

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.070
one which has about $20,
small business cards,

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.580
and looks quite big, and then
a smaller slim-fitting one.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.107
Only in the worst
case scenarios am

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:45.690
I going to be found out, maybe
where it's multiple muggers who

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.011
pat me down.

00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:49.260
But in most situations, a
mugger wants that over with,

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.551
done with as quick as possible.

00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:52.830
Here you go.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.890
So again, I can
put things in place

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:02.670
which kind of satisfy my ego
and make me more likely to act.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.669
But that's your question,
ego or survival.

00:46:05.669 --> 00:46:07.710
And when you start putting
those situations down,

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.190
survival situations are
actually quite rare.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.430
And this is part of what we
talk about in both of the books,

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.840
how to avoid, how to
predict, how to identify, how

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.140
to walk away, how to disengage.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.850
And all of our
physical solutions

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.600
are put in those contexts,
that you don't have a choice,

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.540
that they're about survival.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.134
Does anybody have any questions?

00:46:33.134 --> 00:46:35.300
AUDIENCE: So you've talked
a lot about de-escalation

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.750
and nonviolent solutions,
non-physical solutions when

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.300
someone is specifically
coming at you.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.120
Could you comment on, I guess,
both the wisdom and techniques,

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.600
or variations on
these techniques,

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.574
of choosing to intervene in
situations between other people

00:46:49.574 --> 00:46:51.365
that you think might
develop into violence?

00:46:53.527 --> 00:46:55.610
GERSHON BEN KEREN: So first
I'll talk a little bit

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.670
about the pitfalls and
perils of intervening

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:03.050
on other people's behalfs.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.362
I'll give you a personal story.

00:47:04.362 --> 00:47:05.820
There's myself and
another doorman.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.640
We'd finished shift.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.850
We were walking
back to our cars.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:14.870
And we hear bang, bang, bang.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.640
So we look across
the road, and we

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:23.150
see this guy slamming this woman
of a glass front of a shop.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:27.680
And we started talking, going,
we can't really walk by this.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.060
We're going to
have to intervene.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.180
So this is intervening
in two strangers.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.130
And we go over.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:38.510
And the guy I was working with
taps the man on the shoulder

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:39.980
and says, excuse me sir--

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.110
because it's Britain,
and we're very polite--

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.720
and it also kind of is
what the police would say,

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.465
excuse me sir, you know.

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:49.010
So the guy turns
around and goes,

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.620
ah, thank god you're here.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:55.040
So this is obvious that he felt
very justified to be engaged

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.320
in this act of violence.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.020
When he realized we
weren't the police--

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.800
obviously, we didn't
have any real authority--

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.260
he started to get
aggressive towards us.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.240
We found out what
the situation was,

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:13.700
that he'd given his
keys to his girlfriend.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.850
He wanted to go home.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.100
They'd obviously had some row.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.590
And she wasn't
handing the keys back.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.280
So I wouldn't say he was
justified to use force.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.330
But obviously, for
him, he felt justified.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.240
So we're gradually sort of
getting to the bottom of this.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.030
And then suddenly, she
starts shouting at us,

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.660
saying, leave him
alone, leave him alone.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.880
So now we're dealing
with two people

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.920
who are aggressive
towards us, one of whom

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.860
we've tried to intervene
on their behalf.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.130
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Exactly.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.850
And things that will have
gone through her head

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.580
was, she was probably
thinking what would happen

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.650
when this situation ended.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:59.330
And this guy, her boyfriend,
has been somewhat humiliated,

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:04.220
questioned, and possibly
made to back down.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.940
And obviously, that could
prompt a further act of violence

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:08.810
against her.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.640
So you know, it's
understandable.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.700
It's kind of like a survival
mechanism where, OK,

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.710
now I'm on your team.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.110
We showed those guys--

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.420
like you said, the common enemy.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:25.954
So there's always a pitfall
in intervening that you're--

00:49:25.954 --> 00:49:30.500
what is a well-meant gesture
by you to solve a situation

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:37.430
might not be well taken on board
by either party in the group.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.230
Once we realized that
they were a team,

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.830
that's when we walked away.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:46.640
So you know, again, it's a
certain level of de-escalation

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.470
towards her-- calm down--

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.780
by aggression towards us.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:56.000
So again, there's obviously
the pitfall of intervening.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.820
Let's say, though, it's
a situation where--

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.950
and we might all have
been in this situation

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.010
where you're out for a
drink with a friend who's

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.350
had a few too many.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.900
And he's started
acting a little bit

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.130
obnoxious towards other people.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.920
Maybe somebody's
given him reason

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.100
in his mind to be a little
bit aggressive towards them.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.600
And now we start to see
the situation build.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.990
And we start to see where
this is possibly going to go.

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.000
And we want to save our friend.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.510
So we want to intervene
on their behalf.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.970
Because at the
end of the day, we

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:38.360
know that they're not capable
of de-escalating in their state.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.730
And there's only one
way this is going to go.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.870
Or maybe they don't even
know how to de-escalate.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.930
One of the tricks we used
to do as doormen when

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:53.480
somebody had some form of
friction over the evening--

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.670
so let's say, for
whatever reason,

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:59.900
I'd had to explain to somebody
that they couldn't do this,

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.480
or they were on a warning
that if this happens again,

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.640
they would be kicked
out of the club.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.770
When it came time
to kick them out,

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.870
I wouldn't be the person
that would kick them out.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:15.190
Because we've got that
sort of history together.

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:18.900
Somebody else would, because
it's now a new face for them

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.650
to interact with.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:24.600
They don't have a history
of aggression towards them.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.640
And that's kind of what you
have to do with this person.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:35.550
So you need to get the
attention away from your friend

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.140
and on to you.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:42.690
And that can sometimes mean
physically moving him away.

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.310
Tricks you can do--

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.050
make yourself a bit more human.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:47.550
Introduce yourself.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.630
Hey, I'm Gershon.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.600
I saw what was going on, yeah?

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.900
Is there any way we
can sort this out?

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.090
So you might have to
put yourself in there,

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.370
introduce yourself--

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:02.040
something somebody's
not really expecting

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.630
if they're acting aggressively.

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:07.130
And sometimes these kind
of unexpected behaviors,

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.900
yeah, the person has to
use their reasoning mind

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.030
to work out what's going on.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.670
Again, none of it's foolproof.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.530
So that's kind of
the way I would

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:20.520
look in that situation
of intervening.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.440
Move the attention
away from this guy.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.290
Be the new face
in the situation.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:27.790
And then run through the
de-escalation process.

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.790
What can we do to sort this out?

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.950
Get the guy's reasoning
brain working again.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:33.240
Like I say, asking--

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.400
introducing yourself is one way.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.950
It's not expected, in an
aggressive confrontation,

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.920
for somebody to go,
hi, I'm Dave, yeah?

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.060
And that person now, is like,
why-- why has he introduced?

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.480
So you're starting
to get the whys.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.532
Does that help?

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:49.356
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:49.356 --> 00:52:49.770
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Excellent.

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.040
Anybody else got anything?

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:51.540
Yes.

00:52:55.149 --> 00:52:56.940
AUDIENCE: So over the
last couple of years,

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.250
there's been a lot of focus on
the news about confrontations

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.490
between police and civilians.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.100
I was wondering if you had any
thoughts about if, you know,

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.880
this sort of de-escalation
is insufficient for that

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.290
because police maybe can't
always walk away or anything,

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:17.710
you know, along those lines.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.090
GERSHON BEN KEREN:
At the end of day,

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:26.060
if police are telling you
to move back, to move away,

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.040
you kind of have to.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.650
And it might be,
in that situation,

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.730
that your civil rights are
being compromised, whatever.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:38.660
You have that choice, to be
right or to be effective.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:43.040
When somebody in law enforcement
puts on their uniform

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.690
and tells you to do
something, they're

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:48.650
doing so from a
position of authority.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:50.510
They might have
overstepped the mark.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:52.820
They might not have
overstepped the mark.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.030
But they don't have a way
to back down from that.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.374
Because not in that
situation, but if we

00:53:59.374 --> 00:54:01.790
took other situations, if law
enforcement were continually

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.100
backing down, their
authority would diminish,

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.410
and nobody would
listen to any command

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.530
that they gave
when it was needed.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.860
The other thing
to understand is,

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.410
when somebody's maybe
standing on that line

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:20.180
with an aggressive crowd
moving towards them,

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.060
they're undergoing
stress and duress.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.340
And this is something I
think we sometimes forget

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:30.380
about law enforcement, that when
there's a protester screaming

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.680
and shouting in their face,
their adrenaline's going,

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.200
you know?

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.290
And I'm amazed, often, at how
composed law enforcement can be

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:43.100
in the face of such aggression.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.070
So in terms of in
that situation,

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.260
you have to make a
decision, you know?

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.450
Do you feel that
your civil rights

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:52.820
are being restricted here?

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.270
Is this a battle that you
want to have here and now,

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:59.960
in the moment, with that
person who's enforcing the law,

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.230
or their understanding
of the law?

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:07.490
Or is it one that's better
left for another day?

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:11.312
Or is there another way that
you can draw attention to it?

00:55:11.312 --> 00:55:12.770
I'm always going
to tell everybody,

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.770
when law enforcement tells you
to do something, you do it.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.300
It's simple as that.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.580
Because I don't know--

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.901
and this is not--

00:55:20.901 --> 00:55:22.400
I'm trying to think
of the best way.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.390
I don't know what day this
guy's had to get him to here.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:32.465
If he's had to turn up and
deal with the death of a child,

00:55:32.465 --> 00:55:35.540
you know, in a real
traffic accident,

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:39.830
he's had a series of other
high-stress incidents,

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:43.340
and now he's here put
on that front line,

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.700
he's going to be
in a certain state.

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.200
And while I don't want to
do is provoke that state.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.090
So if that guy's
telling me to back away,

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.414
I'll be backing away.

00:55:53.414 --> 00:55:55.830
I might have to explain to him
if I'm being pushed forward

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:57.515
by the crowd.

00:55:57.515 --> 00:55:58.140
Hands come out.

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.320
Hey, I'm trying to
comply with your order.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.540
Trying to comply.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.870
I'm getting pushed.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.695
I'm getting pushed.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.990
But in terms of the
instruction and the order,

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:13.160
that guy's there to be
obeyed, even if it's wrong.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:19.230
And I know that's a
very complicated issue

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.120
for certain sections
of society who

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.240
might feel that they're being
over-policed, might feel

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.142
that they're being victimized.

00:56:26.142 --> 00:56:28.350
And they might hear this
and go, well, you don't what

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:31.050
it's like to walk in my shoes.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:34.790
And I'm concerned about getting
in that car, that cruiser,

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.060
or getting in the van.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.680
I understand all of that.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.900
But at the end of the
day, my general rule

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.800
is going to be, if
law enforcement are

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.220
telling me to do something,
I'm going to do it.

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.480
And you'll often
see, on news clips,

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.080
how those who comply
with police when they're

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.600
physically restrained
are treated

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.940
versus those that fight back.

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.310
And often it's those
that are fighting back

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.260
that get treated a
lot more harshly.

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.330
Because at the end of
the day, this person

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.280
needs to be controlled.

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.940
If you comply, yeah,
you're probably not going

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.680
to get hurt in the slightest.

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.287
And I know there are
situations in terms

00:57:14.287 --> 00:57:15.870
of some of the control
positions which

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:17.850
have been inappropriately used.

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:20.880
In Boston, in Massachusetts,
with all the police

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:26.454
forces I know, all I've ever
seen is sensible policing.

00:57:26.454 --> 00:57:28.120
I don't know if you
go to another state.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.130
I can't speak for that.

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.760
Does not make sense?

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.329
I know it's a complicated one.

00:57:33.329 --> 00:57:34.120
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.328
GERSHON BEN KEREN: Thank you.

00:57:35.328 --> 00:57:38.070
