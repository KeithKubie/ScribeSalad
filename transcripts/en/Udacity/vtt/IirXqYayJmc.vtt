00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
According to Aristotle, objects all fall at a constant speed, and that speed depends

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
on their weight, and when Aristotle says "constant speed," what he means is that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the instant you release the ball, it's already traveling at the same speed that it will hit the ground.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay. So, objects fall at constant speed and that speed is proportional to the mass.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, what does this meanâ€”speed proportional to mass?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It means that if you double the mass of an object you double the speed.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you triple the mass, you triple the speed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We can write this proportionality with this funny-looking symbol here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In fact, she looks a little bit like the alpha we saw in the first unit.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, we can use this proportional relationships to make mathematical calculations.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's say we have two objects, a one-kilogram and a two-kilogram mass.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If this falls with a certain speed S1, this one will follow the speed S2.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The way we can use this proportionality relationship to a make calculation

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is in the following line.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We say that the ratio of speed S1 to S2 is equal to the ratio of the masses,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we can say that because they are proportional.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In this simple example, I just want you to tell me,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
if S1 is 2 meters per second and these are the masses, what is S2?

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Well, we can just plug in here.
