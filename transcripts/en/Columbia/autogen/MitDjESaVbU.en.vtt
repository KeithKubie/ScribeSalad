is still in many ways virgin territory

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.130
is still in many ways virgin territory
 

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.060
is still in many ways virgin territory
and even more virgin than that is the

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.070
and even more virgin than that is the

area of software and most of the what's

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:29.980
area of software and most of the what's
 

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.920
area of software and most of the what's
interesting is that our ability to

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:31.930
interesting is that our ability to
 

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.230
interesting is that our ability to
preserve the web depends on our ability

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240
preserve the web depends on our ability
 

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.269
preserve the web depends on our ability
to deal with software because a lot of

and I think you know there's a desperate

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:38.890
and I think you know there's a desperate
 

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.220
and I think you know there's a desperate
need in the modern University in the

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.230
need in the modern University in the
 

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.110
need in the modern University in the
modern sort of knowledge landscape for

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120
modern sort of knowledge landscape for
 

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.260
modern sort of knowledge landscape for
libraries to really embrace that role

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:48.270
 

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:52.170
donmar I anything to add on that use

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:52.180
donmar I anything to add on that use
 

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.300
donmar I anything to add on that use
just thinking of that in terms of cities

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:54.310
just thinking of that in terms of cities
 

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.100
just thinking of that in terms of cities
again because we found all types of

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
again because we found all types of
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.960
again because we found all types of
libraries so we think about that in

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:57.970
libraries so we think about that in
 

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.810
libraries so we think about that in
terms of how a library relates to all of

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:00.820
terms of how a library relates to all of
 

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.820
terms of how a library relates to all of
the different institutions in a city and

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:02.830
the different institutions in a city and
 

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.330
the different institutions in a city and
can bring all of those together we we're

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:06.340
can bring all of those together we we're
 

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.490
can bring all of those together we we're
encouraged libraries to be much more

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:08.500
encouraged libraries to be much more
 

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.590
encouraged libraries to be much more
engaged to go outside their walls to

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600
engaged to go outside their walls to
 

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.720
engaged to go outside their walls to
bring institutions together so yeah

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:12.730
bring institutions together so yeah
 

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.920
bring institutions together so yeah
right okay let's get to some questions

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:16.930
right okay let's get to some questions
 

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:21.300
right okay let's get to some questions
um so we'll have our microphone asst

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:21.310
um so we'll have our microphone asst
 

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.200
um so we'll have our microphone asst
vanda we can keep talking amongst

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.210
vanda we can keep talking amongst
 

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.460
vanda we can keep talking amongst
ourselves up here if you'd rather but

ourselves up here if you'd rather but
 

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.290
ourselves up here if you'd rather but
it's more fun if you talk to us and with

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.300
it's more fun if you talk to us and with
 

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:34.050
it's more fun if you talk to us and with
absolutely so following up on some of

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.060
absolutely so following up on some of
 

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.210
absolutely so following up on some of
the things that Don was saying idea of

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:36.220
the things that Don was saying idea of
 

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.880
the things that Don was saying idea of
coherence in digital preservation it's a

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:38.890
coherence in digital preservation it's a
 

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.250
coherence in digital preservation it's a
very important one to work toward

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:41.260
very important one to work toward
 

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.780
very important one to work toward
because they're all of these initiatives

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:42.790
because they're all of these initiatives
 

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.400
because they're all of these initiatives
going on not really talking to each

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:44.410
going on not really talking to each
 

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.750
going on not really talking to each
other and I think it would be really

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760
other and I think it would be really
 

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.970
other and I think it would be really
great to have sort of national

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:47.980
great to have sort of national
 

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.250
great to have sort of national
discussion about how to move forward in

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:50.260
discussion about how to move forward in
 

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.730
discussion about how to move forward in
these the next thing is that in fact the

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:53.740
these the next thing is that in fact the
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.770
these the next thing is that in fact the
concept of a trusted digital repository

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:55.780
concept of a trusted digital repository
 

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.330
concept of a trusted digital repository
that we've been hanging on to for a

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:57.340
that we've been hanging on to for a
 

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.780
that we've been hanging on to for a
while I think I'm interested in when you

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:00.790
while I think I'm interested in when you
 

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.430
while I think I'm interested in when you
know how you all are viewing that now

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440
know how you all are viewing that now
 

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.290
know how you all are viewing that now
and whether there's any help that you

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:04.300
and whether there's any help that you
 

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.150
and whether there's any help that you
can give us and actually keeping that

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:06.160
can give us and actually keeping that
 

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.990
can give us and actually keeping that
concept alive in face of Amazon you know

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000
concept alive in face of Amazon you know
 

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.970

finally I guess the storage question I'm

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.130
finally I guess the storage question I'm
 

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.010
finally I guess the storage question I'm
interested in to see how whether you

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.020
interested in to see how whether you
 

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.420
interested in to see how whether you
have leadership that you could give us

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:18.430
have leadership that you could give us
 

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.730
have leadership that you could give us
or opportunities you could give us to

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:20.740
or opportunities you could give us to
 

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.250
or opportunities you could give us to
think about this gigantic expensive need

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:23.260
think about this gigantic expensive need
 

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.680
think about this gigantic expensive need
that underlies all digital preservation

thanks for that no I don't think I can

thanks for that no I don't think I can
elaborate more on the coherence question

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:45.500
elaborate more on the coherence question

repositories that Jim erased it this
 

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.860
repositories that Jim erased it this
morning that there's a proliferation of

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:14.870
morning that there's a proliferation of
 

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.020
morning that there's a proliferation of
types and kinds of repositories and

types and kinds of repositories and
 

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.170
types and kinds of repositories and
there isn't a lot of coherence in that

there isn't a lot of coherence in that
 

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.180
there isn't a lot of coherence in that
there's a lot of proliferation of them

there's a lot of proliferation of them
certainly diversity is a good thing in

certainly diversity is a good thing in
some ways and in other ways it becomes a

funding ended in this area with the

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.390
funding ended in this area with the
 

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.380
funding ended in this area with the
development of fedora and D space so we

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:50.390
development of fedora and D space so we
 

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:54.280
development of fedora and D space so we
created the tools and now I think we

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.290
created the tools and now I think we
 

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.040
created the tools and now I think we
need certainly as a funding agency we

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.050
need certainly as a funding agency we

going on in the press community where

going on in the press community where
 

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.410

that question now too and I think your

third question about storage relates
 

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.840
third question about storage relates
directly to that about ways in which you

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:52.850
directly to that about ways in which you

standards is that there's so many of

that this is partly a a policy question
 

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.880
that this is partly a a policy question
and it's a big part of it is policy and
