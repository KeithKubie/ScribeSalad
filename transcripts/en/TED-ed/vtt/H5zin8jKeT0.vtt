00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:12.816
If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line,

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:16.155
it would form a tube 
spanning nearly ten meters.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.916
The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:25.226
Cells in this organ's lining 
constantly renew themselves,

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:29.617
but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry,

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:33.355
leading to the excessive growth 
of new cells.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:39.068
That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps.

00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:41.742
The majority of these polyps 
won't do any harm,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:45.518
but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:47.465
and divide rapidly,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.787
projecting further into the colon.

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:53.308
At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer,

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:58.477
one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world.

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:00.013
That's a slow process:

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:01.757
though growth times vary,

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:05.092
it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:09.137
to grow and develop into a cancerous one.

00:01:09.137 --> 00:01:11.027
We don't know exactly what causes

00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:14.347
the majority of colon polyps 
and colon cancers.

00:01:14.347 --> 00:01:18.513
We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation

00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:21.518
of what's called oncogenes in the polyp,

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:27.278
and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:31.199
Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow.

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.779
When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it,

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:37.689
it can become a permanently 
active oncogene

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.628
with cells that grow out of control.

00:01:40.628 --> 00:01:45.370
While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.600
experts suspect a combination
of both environmental

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.142
and inherited genetic factors.

00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:56.748
In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked,

00:01:56.748 --> 00:02:00.062
they eventually break through
the lining of the colon.

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:04.160
Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.969
and they can go on to form tumors.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.651
Despite these challenges,
there's a solution.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:14.330
We've become extremely good at
detecting and removing offending polyps

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.422
before they can cause cancer.

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:18.901
This happens through a process
called screening,

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.823
and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer.

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:25.551
So, who's at risk?

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.512
Most cases occur in people 
aged 50 years or older.

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:35.040
This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.701
There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.270
or family histories 
of colon polyps or cancer,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.601
and those who suffer 
from inherited genetic syndromes,

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:47.852
or inflammatory diseases,

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:51.293
like Crohnâ€™s disease 
and ulcerative colitis.

00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:55.752
So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:57.452
If you have access to healthcare,

00:02:57.452 --> 00:03:02.013
it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin.

00:03:02.013 --> 00:03:04.482
Screening can be done with various tests.

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:08.463
Colonoscopy involves 
a long, thin, flexible tube

00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:12.033
that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.923
and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps.

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:19.422
If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy,

00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:22.754
a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall.

00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:27.033
Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells.

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:32.574
Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps.

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:35.774
There are, however, 
other useful screening tests,

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:36.935
including imaging

00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:39.495
and at-home tests that can allow patients

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:42.915
to examine their stool 
for small amounts of blood.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:48.047
Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy,

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:50.795
in which case, the next step is surgery.

00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:53.332
If blood and imaging tests then reveal

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:56.377
that cancerous cells 
have spread outside the colon,

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:58.976
then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy,

00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:03.515
may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating.

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.528
We can also take on certain habits

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:09.816
to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.327
There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight,

00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:13.275
not smoking,

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.935
and being physically active can help.

00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:18.205
But most importantly, 
access to healthcare

00:04:18.205 --> 00:04:21.137
and regular screenings 
at crucial times in life

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:23.937
are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.
