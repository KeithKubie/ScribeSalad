00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is that you're on the moon.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now there are many ways you can solve this question, but the one that I think is the most fun

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and probably the most useful is figuring out how range, the distance you can throw an object,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
scales with the acceleration on the planet. What do I mean by that?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I mean figuring out its proportionality.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is the range proportional to the acceleration in the planet? Is it proportional to the square?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Is it proportional to something else? Let's see if we can find that out.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So this has become a question of, "How does range scale with acceleration?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The reason why we're looking at proportionality sorts of our units is because these two numbers

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the range on earth and the range on this unknown planet how far we can throw these rocks.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So we also know the ratio and ratios are used whenever we have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this proportionality sorts of our units.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What we already shown from the previous problem that the optimal range occurs at 45°

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So if we can set at an initial velocity of this zero--these are the horizontal and vertical components.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, when we're calculating range the first thing we want to know is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
how much time does the object spent in the air.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we think of measuring to the top of the trajectory and then multiplying by two.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Have we find the time it takes to get to the top?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What we used is equation, we plugged in our known values and solve for t.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I noticed I have been using numbers, I have been keeping

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
everything in terms of variables except for this 45°.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This could be an intimidating tactic to use when you're first solving physics problems.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Often you tend to want to plug everything in, but actually you could often get more interesting results

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if you leave the variables in place and don't plug until the very, very end.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Anyways, this is the time to the top of the trajectory but we know

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the full time is twice that so I'll just put a 2 here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Once we know the time, how do we find the range?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We'll we used this equation and now I've plugged in for the initial velocity

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the initial x velocity V₀ cosine of 45.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I've multiplied by the time that we just calculated because remember

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in the x direction the acceleration is always zero.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Okay, let's simplify--well, I've multiplied the V₀ together to get this V₀² and actually

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
if I carry out cosine of 45 times 945, I find it's just equal to one half.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This part the one half cancelled with the 2, I've find that my

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
maximum range is equal to my initial V²/a.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, I do not really care about V₀².

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I want to know how range scales with a and it turns out well it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
proportional to 1/a or R is proportional to a⁻¹.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Well so what, how do I use that--just like we did early in the unit, we found out using a lot of ratio

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and the ratio of the range on earth to the range of this unknown planet is going to be equal

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to the ratios of the accelerations taken to the -1 power.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
A -1 power just means flip what you have inside.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I can solve this for the unknown acceleration and I get this equation.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The acceleration on our unknown planet is equal to the ratios of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the ranges times the acceleration on earth.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
When I found what we know, I find that the acceleration on our unknown planet must be

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
1.6 m/s², which is exactly the acceleration on the moon and we've figured out where we are.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Amazing work--there were other ways to solve this--equally valid--

00:03:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but this is one tool that you should try to familiarize yourself with.
