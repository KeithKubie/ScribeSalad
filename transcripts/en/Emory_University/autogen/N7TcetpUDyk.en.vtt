internationally so if we made the list
 

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.390
internationally so if we made the list
and then we reached into the pocket in

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400
and then we reached into the pocket in
 

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.060
and then we reached into the pocket in
the plane seat in front of us pulled out

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:39.070
the plane seat in front of us pulled out
 

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.080
the plane seat in front of us pulled out
a map and we picked out five southern

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.090
a map and we picked out five southern
 

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:46.740
a map and we picked out five southern
cities and then we line the five cities

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:46.750
cities and then we line the five cities
 

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:50.490
cities and then we line the five cities
up against our list and we decided who

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:50.500
up against our list and we decided who
 

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.980
up against our list and we decided who
was obvious Emory was where we wanted to

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:52.990
