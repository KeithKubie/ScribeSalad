00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.340
There’s a lot that can go wrong during a
spacecraft launch.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.040
And shortly after Apollo 12 left the ground, the
mission was struck with an electrifying complication.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.280
Not once… but twice.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.300
[Astronauts] I don't know what happened here. We had everything in the world drop out.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.820
I’m not sure we didn’t get hit by lighting.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
1969 was a milestone year for NASA.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.040
[Armstrong] The Eagle has landed.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.420
The space agency achieved its goal of getting
to the moon and back by the end of the decade.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.360
But Apollo 11 almost didn’t make it there.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
During their descent to the moon, the Lunar Module threw a fit and the astronauts missed their target

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.940
landing spot by a good six kilometers.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.200
So the next mission, Apollo 12, would have
to prove that a precision lunar landing was possible.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.300
The crew consisted of close friends: commander
Pete Conrad, command module pilot Dick Gordon

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.530
and lunar module pilot Al Bean.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.149
Aside from perfecting landing techniques,
their primary objectives were to perform detailed

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.090
scientific lunar exploration and deploy the
Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package or

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.920
ALSEP for short.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.060
This was a collection of geophysical instruments
designed to monitor the environment of each

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.580
Apollo landing site for the period of at least
a year.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.440
Conrad and Bean would be the astronauts to
put this science into action in the moon’s

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.189
mysterious region known as the Ocean of Storms.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.340
On the morning of the launch, ominous clouds
blanketed the sky above the Kennedy Space Center.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.000
But the rain was dying down and conditions were within the minimums of what was considered adverse.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.980
So Apollo 12 took off.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.380
About 36 seconds in, things got weird.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.160
The crew didn’t realize it, but a powerful
electrical surge had shot through the Saturn V.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.560
And about 20 seconds later, mother nature
would prove that lightning can and will strike

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.120
the same place twice.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.940
The crew was in the dark.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.640
Several major systems went offline, including
all three fuel cells,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.340
the spacecraft’s main source of power.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.540
If they didn’t find a solution in the next
90 seconds, Apollo 12 would have to abort.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.220
On the ground at the Manned Spacecraft Center
in Houston, mission control was just as confused.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.460
The flight controller consuls were reading nonsensical telemetry data from the spacecraft, giving the team

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.560
no sign of a solution.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.240
This was a nightmare scenario for flight director
Gerry Griffin.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.040
Just over a minute into his first mission
as lead flight director, he was facing a potential disaster.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080
But if Griffin learned anything from his mentors,
there were a lot of options

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.740
and failure wasn't one of them.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.270
Throughout the Apollo Program, the mission
control team was faced with do or die decisions.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.580
It was by no means a low stress work environment.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.820
Many of the Apollo flight
controllers joined NASA with no relevant

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.300
experience and some were fresh out of college.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.120
But in a very short period of time, they had
to become masters of spaceflight.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.600
NASA’s first flight director, Chris Kraft,
was essentially the brainchild

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.000
of Apollo’s mission control system.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.680
At the helm of each crewed mission was a flight director.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.080
He was supported by a team of flight controllers
who were responsible for specific spacecraft functions.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.040
For example, GUIDO watched over the
primary guidance, navigation and control systems,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.640
while EECOM handled the electrical, environmental
and communications systems.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.120
The Apollo mission control teams ran thousands
of flight simulations to anticipate every

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.020
possible scenario that could unfold in space.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.360
And during Apollo 12, a memory from one of
these simulations saved the team from an abort.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.560
SCE to Aux was the answer to their problems,
and 24-year old EECOM John Aaron was the only

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:03.569
one who knew it.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.630
A year earlier, he was in Mission Control
during a simulation in which the spacecraft’s

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.060
voltage was accidentally dropped.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.319
The change affected the Signal Conditioning
Equipment or SCE which was a small power supply

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.120
that provided voltage to critical instrumentation
points in various systems

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.360
including the fuel cells.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.580
If the power supply failed, an auxiliary supply
could be switched on.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.340
All the crew had to do was find the right
switch, which wasn’t a simple task given

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.360
the complexity of the spacecraft’s display.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.860
Astronaut Al Bean was the only member of the
crew who knew which switch to flip.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.120
And just like that, the spacecraft's systems
came back online and the flight controllers

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.090
were able to read the data again.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.320
Rookie Flight Director Gerry Griffin escaped
the near abort.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320
They found no other damage from the lightning strike,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.200
so Griffin decided to continue to the Moon.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.560
The astronauts, still in disbelief, laughed
uncontrollably until they reached orbit.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.560
Once settled in lunar orbit, Conrad and Bean
embarked on the most crucial part of the mission.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.280
They had to perfect a pinpoint landing on
the lunar surface.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.480
But first, they had to find their targeted touchdown point.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.100
As they approached, Conrad recognized a familiar
crater from a map of their landing site.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.800
He steadied the Lunar Module and touched down
in a cloud of dust within close range of their

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.240
target, demonstrating that a precision lunar
landing with the Apollo system was possible.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.240
Once on the surface, the astronauts conducted
several experiments and deployed the ALSEP.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.730
They also collected and returned components
from the nearby Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.440
landed on the Moon in 1967.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.880
After over 30 hours, Conrad and Bean flew
back to the Command-Service Module where their

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.740
buddy Dick Gordon was waiting.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.480
Apollo’s three best friends splashed down
in the Pacific just 62 seconds later than planned.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.480
Apollo 12 didn’t get as much attention as
Apollo 11, in part, because it wasn’t televised.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.640
Shortly after landing on the moon, Bean fried the camera when he pointed it directly at the Sun.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.960
But all that aside, Apollo 12 turned out to
be a pioneering mission for the Apollo Program.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.020
The pinpoint touchdown of the Lunar Module
enabled all of the targeted landings to follow.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.001
And the near abort showed the capabilities
of mission control, proving that the team

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.600
was prepared to work through unexpected problems
under extreme pressure.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.600
And that would become incredibly important
for the next mission - Apollo 13.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.040
Like Mission Control, the Apollo astronauts
went through extensive training, learning

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.730
how to do a job that had never been done before.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.100

spaceflight preparations, check out this video.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.660
And, if you want more, be sure to watch the
entire Apollo series.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.580
Thanks for watching!
