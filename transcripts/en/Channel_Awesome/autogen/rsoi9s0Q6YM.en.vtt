00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like that thing where when
 

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like that thing where when
you<00:09:03.509><c> have</c><00:09:03.779><c> one</c><00:09:04.170><c> line</c><00:09:04.410><c> or</c><00:09:04.709><c> just</c><00:09:04.740><c> a</c><00:09:04.980><c> couple</c><00:09:05.189><c> lies</c>

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.490 align:start position:0%
you have one line or just a couple lies
 

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.949 align:start position:0%
you have one line or just a couple lies
you<00:09:05.670><c> can</c><00:09:05.790><c> put</c><00:09:05.939><c> a</c><00:09:05.970><c> lot</c><00:09:06.089><c> more</c><00:09:06.149><c> emphasis</c><00:09:06.509><c> and</c>

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
you can put a lot more emphasis and
 

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.290 align:start position:0%
you can put a lot more emphasis and
focus<00:09:07.019><c> out</c><00:09:07.470><c> to</c><00:09:07.620><c> make</c><00:09:07.740><c> them</c><00:09:07.889><c> sound</c><00:09:08.100><c> funny</c><00:09:08.579><c> yeah</c>

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
focus out to make them sound funny yeah
 

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
focus out to make them sound funny yeah
but<00:09:09.689><c> we</c><00:09:09.779><c> have</c><00:09:10.019><c> a</c><00:09:10.050><c> whole</c><00:09:10.259><c> episode</c><00:09:10.410><c> it's</c><00:09:10.920><c> much</c>

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:11.129 align:start position:0%
but we have a whole episode it's much
 

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:13.340 align:start position:0%
but we have a whole episode it's much
harder<00:09:11.639><c> to</c><00:09:12.480><c> make</c><00:09:12.660><c> the</c><00:09:12.779><c> deliveries</c><00:09:13.170><c> fine</c>

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
harder to make the deliveries fine
 

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.780 align:start position:0%
harder to make the deliveries fine
because<00:09:13.439><c> you</c><00:09:13.589><c> don't</c><00:09:13.769><c> have</c><00:09:13.829><c> as</c><00:09:14.009><c> much</c><00:09:14.189><c> time</c><00:09:14.459><c> it's</c>

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
because you don't have as much time it's
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.910 align:start position:0%
because you don't have as much time it's
