00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt;Mr. Manager: Good afternoon everyone, I'm
Mr. Manager.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.330
There are certain truths in life, truths that
you should always keep a lookout for.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.000
First of all always watch for out hop-ons,
you got to know what is and what is not a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.110
scar dot com.
And above all you must remember there's always

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.690
money in the banana stand.
Now, philosophy is on a pretty similar quest,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.350
it seeks to separate the difference between
illusion, the illusion of life, from what

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.710
is just a common trick.
In this vein, scholars have united philosophy

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.440
and popular culture, we are pleased to host
for the third time for the authors at Google

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.411
show a segment from that book in this case
Arrested Development and Philosophy.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.750
Today we are joined by Tyler Shores and Kris
Phillips.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.590
And they are speaking to us today about the
wisdom that they wrote in several chapters

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.600
from that book.
Tyler Shores is a former Googler, he later

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.500
received his graduate degree in English literature
from the University at Oxford.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.149
He is a frequent contributor to this philosophy
and pop-culture series.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.450
You may remember him from the 'Hero' show
and the 'Inception in Popular Culture' show.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.909
Also, and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo',
how could I forget.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.240
Kris Phillips is an ABD graduate and a student
in philosophy at the University of Iowa.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.360
He is a frequent editor to the series as well.
He's a metaphysics man, also contributed to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.990
the book of 'Coffee, Grounds for Debate'.
So without further ado, we'll use the mikes

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.630
for Q&amp;A.
So please join me as we together explore this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.229
tiny town of big ideas this Arrested Development
and philosophy.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.450
[Applause]

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.870
&gt;&gt;Kris: Thank you, thank you.
So what we're going to do today is going to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.670
be a little bit informal.
We're going to discuss some the philosophical

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.630
issues that arise over the three very short
seasons of Arrested Development.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.310
And we're gonna have sort of a general theme
that we think comes up in the show.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.290
That theme being, in fact, that it may well
be worse to know things than to not know them.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.149
[laughter]
Sort of contrary to the theme of philosophy,

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.259
philosophers are always looking for knowledge
and truth and wisdom.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.919
We're gonna see if the Arrested Development
can maybe teach us that that's maybe not the

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:17.430
best way and then it looks like we're gonna
end up concluding that it is in fact not the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
way you ought to live.
So we're going to look at what Arrested Development

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.540
can teach us about how we shouldn't live life.
[Chuckling]

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.849
But before we can really engage in that discussion,
we need to sort of get it clear on what exactly

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.620
is the philosophical life?
What is philosophy?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.790
And what does it mean to engage in this sort
of life.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.379
Well, Plato, way back in the day, said that
the unexamined life is not worth living.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.170
But this raises, I think, two distinct questions.
The first one is a fairly important question,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.969
that question is, what exactly is the examined
life?

00:02:52.969 --> 00:03:01.379
And to answer that question, we need to appeal
to the mythos.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.199
Plato discusses the mythos, he says this is
the sort of unquestioning ignorance that we

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.779
all have of the way the world actually is.
He says that throughout life we sort of grow

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.579
up and were told you're supposed to do certain
things in your lifetime.

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.319
You're supposed to get a job, you're supposed
to go to college, get married, have 2.4 kids,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.439
live in a house with a white picket fence
and all this kind of stuff.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.449
And that's what will make you happy.
This is what you're told.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.319
And you're told never to question this.
You're never supposed to question it, but

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.199
we as philosophers do.
We think, you know what maybe that isn't what

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.349
makes us happy, do you even know what happiness
is?

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:41.950
So the second question is, why exactly would
such a life not be worth living?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.260
Well, Socrates thought that just going through
the motions was terrible.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.669
And he gave all sorts of reasons, there are
a bunch of dialogues and things, you can read

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.019
knows, I'm not going to bore you with all
the details of Plato here.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.109
We have Arrested Development talk about, after
all.

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.439
So instead we are going to ask, why, well
we seek happiness of course.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.419
But were going to ask, was Plato right? Was
Plato right that the unexamined life isn't

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.579
worth living?
And we're explore that through issues that

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.060
come up in Arrested Development, so at this
point I would like to turn it over to Tyler

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.060
for our first section

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.460
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Thanks, Kris .
So, I thought, considering where we are and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.560
our audience at Google, we're all familiar
at Mountain View specifically with informal

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.760
corporate motto of "don't be evil".
So it seemed like a good place to start, of

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.289
talking about Arrested Development.
Ethics in the Bluths, there's a couple things

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.729
we should talk about here.
One of them certainly would be capitalism,

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.460
we have a couple of interesting chapters which
talk about the class system and Marxism and

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.110
what kind of representative population the
Bluths have for this kind of capitalism and

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.610
really this kind of cartoonish caricature
version of like wealthy capitalists that you

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.220
know where everything is for sale and anything
can be for sale even if it's not.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.780
Anything can be twisted to make a buck.
So were talking about business ethics or the

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.289
lack thereof in this case.
And what happens between like, you know, one

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.721
of the things that we see in the show especially
when we're talking about George Senior. What

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:19.310
happens when something gets in the way of
wanting that money and you know actually getting

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.830
that money.
There are a lot of examples; we got the cornballer

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.870
of course, which is legally not for sale anywhere
including Mexico. [laughter]

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.710
The thing is dangerous if you, it'll burn
your fingerprints off.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.879
There is, one of the other topics that we
talk about and you see throughout the show

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.590
would be commodification.
Everything is for sale, like everything has

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.449
its price.
It's one of those things that we see again

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.000
and again as you know like crass commercialism
of George Bluth, Senior, whether it's religion,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.659
religion can be used to make a quick buck.
Exploitation has a lot to do with this too.

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:59.949
Whether it's selling boy fights videos, which
are extremely popular in Latin America. [laughter]

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.409
Or also under capitalism as philosophers would
want to point out, everything has its price

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.560
including people and relationships between
one person and another.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.629
This comes up again and again.
One of the things that Marx talks about is

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:18.290
this, you know, the primary characteristic
of Marxian capitalism is this sort of exploitation,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.980
this sort of like, you know, dollar amount
or this quantifying of human relations which

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.249
you know it sounds terrible, but it is something
that we engage with more often than were comfortable

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.069
to admit.
A really good example, because I think it's

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.349
funny, is Gob's suit.
This is a good example here, I think.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.180
This was from, what episode was this from,
people know was it 'afternoon delight'?

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.240
Banana [indistinct], I think, yeah.
Anyways, like the running gag with this one

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.999
was that Gob has a suit that that you know
kind of increases in price.

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.639
Like, you know, it's first, on the first scene
there it's like he's gonna spill his coffee

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.629
but, you know, I'm not can spill coffee over
my $3000 suit, come on.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.780
You know, not gonna help the guy who doesn't
make this much money in four months.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.490
Not gonna take a whiz in the $5000 suit.
Anyways, the point is, yeah, this is a good

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.949
example I think of like you know putting a
dollar amount on things, like you know in

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:22.250
this, as Marxian proponents might say, putting
a certain capitalistic values on things.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.389
Like you know does having more money make
someone better than another person?

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:30.139
We'd like to say no; but for Gob's case clearly
yes.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:36.159
That's a good example, I think.
That leads to the next point, I think, which

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.830
were talking about family values it
One of the values I want to talk about is

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.250
family values.
Or yeah, Bluth family values have an interesting,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:52.909
, I don't even know what she called them.
An interesting lack thereof of family values.

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:58.669
Annyong, of course, was only adopted by Lucille
Bluth in order to teach Buster a lesson for

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.560
not finishing his cottage cheese.
[laughter]

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.870
So, that kind of shows something, I think,
about using people.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.430
Another thing that Marxian's like to talk
about, you know, this sort of capitalist critique

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.889
is like treating people as means to an end
instead of like ends to themselves so this

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:19.009
is an example, like you know you adopt a kid
in order to teach another very old man-child

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:24.879
a lesson.
So it's interesting to think about this actually.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:29.870
The family first motto, right, we see this
in the very first episode of, you know, Arrested

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.820
Development.
You know, Michael and George Michael are having

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.090
breakfast and Michael says, "what's the most
important thing?"

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.940
"Breakfast".
George Michael is confused, he thought you

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.339
were talking about things you eat.
But family, family is the thing that you know

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:50.529
ostensibly one of the goals, one of the underlying
themes of Arrested Development is sort of

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:53.380
family first.
But family first actually means something

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:59.160
different when we're thinking of the Bluth
universe.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.760
A lot of things, there's complicated examples,
like I mentioned Lucille.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.620
A lot of Lucille's relationships are defined
in terms of power and control.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.170
There's a lot of manipulation, a lot of lying
, a lot of, you know, playing against each

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:16.139
other and as Buster says, "She gets off on
withholding", and these sort of things.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:21.820
So, yeah, there's that and, you know, there's
certainly, it's a very unique version of family

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.290
values and family first in this case kind
of means like, you know, yeah, family first

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.279
in the sense that this is a resource that
can be exploited for our own ends.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:35.850
So there is that. Oops, excuse me.
Lastly, I guess the point to finish up this

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:42.959
thought is, basically the Bluths are, I remember
in one of my favorite episodes "Save Our Bluths",

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.960
Michael give this great speech, right.
He says that, you know, "Well I was really

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.230
only give this speech about how we had an
unlucky break and you know there's this great

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.750
injustice, but I'm not sure that is true.
That's not the truth, we've been given plenty

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.180
of chances and maybe the Bluths just aren't
worth saving.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.910
Maybe were not that likable, you know, were
very self-centered."

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.480
And, I guess, that's kind of the point, like
one of the things that we talked about in

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.190
the book is that, yeah in this sense the Bluths
are putting their own, you know, individual

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.060
desires before community, before their shareholders,
before their own family members there is that.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.850
And like these, we're talking about ethics,
and ethical decisions, but a lot of times

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.410
you know these ethical decisions seem to be
very convenient decisions for Bluth family

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.930
members.
But that leads to our next part, which is

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.070
when you talk about ethics one of the things
that's really important for philosophers and

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.571
all of us are philosophers to some extent
because we all do these things, is self-knowledge.

00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:36.500
And self-knowledge is the next thing that
Kris is going to talk about.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.089
&gt;&gt;Kris: Great, yeah and I just had one more
point to may be tack on to the end thereof

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.089
the thing.

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:43.089
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Mm hmm

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:45.600
&gt;&gt;Kris: It seems like this discussion is absolutely
perfect to illustrate the point I tried to

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.420
make it the very beginning.
In the introduction.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:53.810
Seems like the Bluth family has bought wholesale
into this sort of story that were told in

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.680
America.
What makes you great is owning cool stuff.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:05.100
You know Gob is maybe the best example of
that with his 3, 4, 5 and $6000 suit, come

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.980
on.
[Laughter]

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.650
So there's that.
But moving on, as Tyler was saying, one of

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.410
the really important things we need to do
is sort of get clear on who we are and who

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.100
we expect ourselves to be.
And that's actually a surprisingly complicated

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.170
question.
Which I think the Bluth characters in particular

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:30.519
Gob and Tobias Fünke maybe illustrate just
how difficult this can be.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:36.010
So, we were talking about self-knowledge.
We need to sort of get it clear on what the

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:41.139
self is first.
And there, this raises a number of different

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:46.980
issues, I think there are four or maybe five
interconnected issues when we're talking about

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.850
the self and how we define it.
So there are these different questions of

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.060
self-identity.
And the first one is going to be what I'm

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.519
calling the metaphysical question.
What makes somebody who they are as opposed

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:03.820
to somebody else?
So here for example we have the Richter quintuplets,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:10.670
we have Andy who is the showoff, we have Donnie
who is the smart one, Chareth on the end over

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.680
there is the flirt.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.990
&gt;&gt;Tyler:Rocky is the tough one.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.130
&gt;&gt;Kris: Rocky is the tough one, and the stunt
doubles.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.620
And we can show Emmitt's face presumably because
he is shy or something.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:27.519
But in any case, they all look the same, they're
all, I'll give it away here, played by the

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:32.800
same actor, sorry to break that to you. [laughter]
And so we might wonder what exactly is it

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.240
that makes them different from one another?
Why are they different people? How are they

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.019
different people?
And what is doing the work of making them

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.829
different people?
We see this throughout the entire show.

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:45.720
We see it with Anne who's played by two different
actresses.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.759
We see it with George Senior and Oscar, two
different characters played by the same person.

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:57.690
And a lot sort of hinges on mistaken identity
throughout the show especially if you're watching

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.640
closely with George and Oscar.
And so one answer to the metaphysical question

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.560
is to sort of deal with essences.
Essential character traits and things like

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.620
this, but that can kind of get us into trouble
depending on how we go about trying to respond

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.830
to that.
So that's one issue.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:20.680
The next issue as an epistemological issue.
Epistemology is the philosophical view that,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.220
or the area philosophy where were concerned
with knowledge, how we attain knowledge, what

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.160
the nature of knowledge is, what's the nature
of justification and evidence.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.579
And so there are these questions, how exactly
do we know who we are, either in a social

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:40.620
sense or in a sort of this deeper or broader
metaphysical sense, I shouldn't say deeper.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.589
And so this actually gives rise to first and
third person questions.

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:47.940
The first person question is how do I know
who I am, how do I know that I'm the same

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.339
person I used to be?
And the third person question is the one that

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:55.170
we see played out with the cops constantly
throughout the show.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:01.720
How do we know that this is in fact not Oscar?
And we have George Senior as we've been trying

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.990
to get him for so long.
So these are sort of important relevant questions

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:12.990
as well.
And then we also have this persistence question.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.420
How do I know that I'm the same person from
one moment to the next?

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.139
What connects me to my past and future selves?
If I'm concerned with living the good life,

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:23.820
I'm concerned with living a good life not
just right this minute but probably also into

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.680
the future and continuing to do the right
thing.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.740
So what connects me to that person and this
is sort of, this is tied closely with the

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.560
metaphysical issues as well.
Then there's one last question that's important

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.970
and we have an entire chapter on this very
last question of personal identity.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.649
And it's the social issue.
In what way is society sort of defining who

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:48.571
we are and how much power do we let them have
or is it that were letting them have it at

00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:50.620
all in the first place?
It's not really clear.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.650
All of these things are absolutely important,
and they're critical to sort of get a clear

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:00.750
idea of how you might want to respond to it
or what exactly it is that's doing this before

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:06.129
we can even try make sense of how we can be
happy or know ourselves.

00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:12.180
So this is sort of background information.
I mentioned Ann a moment ago by way of the

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.920
metaphysical question.
She's a particularly nice [laughter] particularly

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.649
nice example of someone who has essential
characteristics and all we're given in the

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:30.290
show is a basic description of Ann.
That she's bland, that she is sort of ambiguously

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:37.819
Christian somehow, she lives on Bethlehem
time, engages in hours of silent prayer and

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:38.819
we know that.

00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:41.899
&gt;&gt;Tyler: She does this really adorable thing
with an egg where she puts in an egg in her

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:44.540
mouth and squirts a packet of mayonnaise and
mmmm.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.209
&gt;&gt;Kris: I think she calls it a mayonegg.
[laughter]

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:48.610
&gt;&gt;Tyler: It is a mayonegg
[laughter]

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:55.750
&gt;&gt;Kris: But as a result, we find that she
in fact gets sort of lumped in with this.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:16:00.019
And I bet, I've given talks about this before
in the fact most people haven't even recognize

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:04.050
that she was played by two different actresses,
that's how bland she is.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.840
[Laughter]
Avid fans of the show don't even recognize

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.870
this.
And so people end up sort of, they call her

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.009
different names, they call her Bland, they
call her Ann.

00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:20.380
They say it's as Ann on the nose on plain's
face.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.560
And so you might not think that this is doing
the metaphysical work of making her who she

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.649
is, but it does seem like, as far as the character
goes, that does play a very important role.

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:36.680
And so that's one example of the metaphysical
issues, or a response to them. [laughter]

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:44.000
What do we do with Tobias.
Tobias stands in a peculiar relationship to

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.279
himself.
We'll put it that way.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:50.889
He claims to have just well he says he just
blew himself.

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:52.889
That's a strange relationship as far as I
can tell.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:54.880
&gt;&gt;Tyler:
Isn't it amazing what you can find on Google?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.560
[laughter]
That's not an actual ice cream flavor, sorry.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560
But it looks really cool

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.490
&gt;&gt;Kris: So what can

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.490
&gt;&gt;Tyler: [whispers] lets switch places

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.970
&gt;&gt;Kris: Yeah, let's switch places.
So what can Gob teach us, or I'm sorry ,Tobias

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:12.680
teach us about sort of self-awareness, or
self-knowledge?Well, he believes all sorts

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.900
of things about himself.
He believes that he is an outstanding actor.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.780
This is obviously false.
He also believes that he is an accomplished

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.950
analrapist.
[laughter]

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:29.330
And it's okay it's pronounced analrapist,
not the way you might be thinking.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.410
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Important for people on Google to,
I mean

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.410
&gt;&gt;Kris:Yes

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.410
&gt;&gt;Tyler: I mean YouTube know that

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:38.630
&gt;&gt;Kris:Don't go googling analrapist.
It's supposed to be a combination of analyst

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.750
and therapist, a professional twice over.
But unfortunately really the business cards

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:49.520
got him in trouble for that one.
And so everybody else sort of recognizes that

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.730
Tobias is this total disaster, but he's living
in this fantasy world.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.870
And insofar as he is living in this fantasy
world, he doesn't seem to be living a very

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.580
good life.
He's convinced himself that he's this great

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:06.130
actor; he even misses out on subtle social
clues during a job interview, during the tryout

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:12.770
for the commercial for the fire sale.
He thinks it's actually a fire, and so he

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:19.700
acts in a manner that, I guess, only Tobias
would fire, but anyway you get the idea.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.200
He's rolling around on the ground singing
Amazing Grace.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.750
[laughter]
This sort of demonstrates a ridiculous amount

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:34.910
of, I guess, a ridiculous lack of self-knowledge.
So it seems like this is one of the ways that

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.250
you don't want to try and structure your life
if you're trying to live the good life.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:46.460
His sexual identity is unclear to everyone.
Probably also himself, we have an article

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:53.470
specifically about how he identifies with
both genders in various situations and he

00:18:53.470 --> 00:19:00.190
acts out both male and female character traits.
And obviously then there's the double entendres

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:07.160
and issues that we will return to momentarily.
But these sort of things seem like they're

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.770
the kind of things that you need to have a
grip on before you can really be happy.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.590
&gt;&gt;Tyler: One of my favorite Tobias quotes,
just to interject is from the Family Ties

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.400
episode, where the long-lost Bluth sister
apparently comes and Tobias has this great

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.860
quote where they're talking about, 'oh the
sibling, is it a he, is it a she'?

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.600
He she what's the difference.
And Tobias says, "Oh here, here, in the dark

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600
it all looks the same."
[laughter]

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.810
That's a good one, that kind of, that's it
in a nutshell actually.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.270
&gt;&gt;Kris: That's right.
And so we have a really nice quote from one

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:43.300
of our contributors here. We're perplexed
by Tobias in general and his sexual orientation

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.590
in particular.
Tobias possesses and acts upon both feminine

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.790
and masculine traits.
In the case of Tobias we can say he's an enigma

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:55.800
because he has an ambiguous gender.
It's just a little teaser for the book that

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:02.330
you should all read immediately.
What about Gob?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.820
Gob is deluded in any number of ways as well,
obviously he's also convinced that he's an

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.970
outstanding Magician even though he continuously
gives away the secrets to all of the tricks

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:20.040
that he vowed to protect forever by creating
the magicians alliance.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:28.180
He constantly and intentionally loses memories.
He carries around what he calls 'forget me

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.130
nows' but we of course all know them as roofies.
[laughter]

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:38.710
Because he wants to protect, he thinks, himself
and others from giving away the secrets of

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.500
his craft.
But he ends up, it seems, taking them more

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.320
often than giving them.
He'll witnessed things that he doesn't really

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.960
want to see, for example, for example his
parents being intimate in a conjugal trailer.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.160
And he will then wipe out his own memory.
Well, there's this philosopher, 17th century

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.750
philosopher, English guy John Locke, very
important guy.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.390
And he maintained that when we're talking
about identity over time, you actually have

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.790
to have a direct memory connection to a previous
self in order to be the same person.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.059
Without it, were talking different people.
Now I don't mean different bodies, and I don't

00:21:14.059 --> 00:21:17.780
mean anything like that, but he thinks, Locke
things that there can be different persons

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.880
understood in a morally relevant sense that
exist within one body.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.260
And with Gob, it seems like there are hundreds
of people inhabiting his body over the course

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.250
of his lifetime.
Precisely because he keeps trying to forget

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.440
things.
Because he finds them disturbing, or otherwise.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:41.540
And so when you remind him, or when we don't
remind him, when Michael reminds him of the

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:46.680
terrible things that he seen that are terrible,
he freaks out and engages in this discussion

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.120
of the first person.
He says, "I've done no such thing, That was

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.680
not me, I could, what is wrong with you where
you getting this and why are you trying to

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.980
make me think about that, I have a sense of
propriety, Michael."

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.720
&gt;&gt;Tyler:That's an interesting question though,
you know, like that is not me, okay then who

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.160
was that, what Gob was that?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.160
&gt;&gt;Kris: Exactly

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.460
&gt;&gt;Tyler:The forgotten Gob, the one without
memories?

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.460
&gt;&gt;Kris: Right

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.210
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Interesting questions about memory,
and like that's one of my favorite topics

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.020
and one of my favorite movies was Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, if you haven't

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.130
seen it's excellent.
With Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet? Right?

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.790
Okay, anyways, that question of continuity
of the memory and if you start forgetting

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.320
memories which constitute your core self,
like who are you?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.740
And if you're not that person that you were
5 minutes Ago, then who is that person that

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.130
it's gonna be 5 minutes from now?
Anyways.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.730
&gt;&gt;Kris: Exactly.
But Gob illustrates self-knowledge and other

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.840
ways that, that are helpful.
We have this excellent chapter on Sartrian

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:43.620
bad faith.
Sartre has this sense of what makes us different

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:51.880
from other beings is that we have a radical
freedom to do whatever it is that we set ourselves

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.630
to do.
And we don't allow social roles or factors

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.030
to define who we are and what we are.
And so living in good faith is an exercise

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.990
of that radical freedom.
To not sort of fall into that sort of social

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.650
roles and let them define you or your actions
or things like this.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.660
And so he has this example, Sartre does, of
a waiter.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.190
And he says of the waiter that his movement
is too quick and too forward, little too precise,

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.470
little too rapid.
He comes towards the patrons with a step little

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.450
too quick, he bends forward a little too eagerly,
his voice, his eyes express an interest a

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.480
little too solicitous for the order of the
customer.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:38.550
Well, this sounds an awful lot like Gob right
before the Save Our Bluths benefit.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:44.520
Gob takes on the role of a waiter, for a little
bit.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.930
Because he thinks it's hilarious.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.230
&gt;&gt;Tyler:With club sauce

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:53.650
&gt;&gt;Kris: Right with club sauce.
He does this because Gob is exercising this

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:58.590
sort of ironic notion that he would ever work
for a living.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.240
This is not the kind a role that he would
ever enter into.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.520
He's not subservient to anyone.
And so he is, has this moment of radical self-awareness

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.100
when he's pretending to serve food to his
mother at the, at the [pause]

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.940
&gt;&gt;Tyler:The country club, I forget the name
of it

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.080
&gt;&gt;Kris: The country club, right, while they're
pitching to try and get people to donate money

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.400
to save the Bluths.
And so even though he's acting ironically,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.260
he's acting in good faith because he's not
letting this role that he's taking on define

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.780
him and define who he is and what he is, in
fact, he's making fun of the role itself and

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.840
performing it.
And so it continues on, and he does this,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:47.380
and so ultimately as is what often happens,
Gob ends up falling into the role and letting

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.580
the role sort of take over for him.
Yes?

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.860
&gt;&gt;male#1: [indistinct]
Wasn't he being subservient to his mother?

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.170
&gt;&gt;Kris: Yes, he's always subservient to his
mother, that's for sure.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.591
That's a fair point.
But not to the role itself, not to the role

00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:04.640
of being a waiter.
This is, he thinks, hilarious.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.420
And ironic.
But he does end up buying into it, and in

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.900
fact gets very upset when at the save our
Bluths benefit, people start leaving because

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.600
the food was inedible and he realized he wasn't
ever make the money that he was supposed to

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.150
make as a server.
And he let the role sort of take over for

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.160
him, or take him over.
And so of course we have him and perhaps the

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:32.200
best role that he ever is, as a magician.
And so that's, that's where I'm going to leave

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.420
off here on the identity issue.
There's a lot of, sort of, rich philosophical

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.000
issues that happen here.
There's a lot to continue talking about, but

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
we have more.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.930
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Mmm Hmm
Yeah, that's a good question you, thanks for

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.780
the question about like different roles, it's
something were gonna be talking about hopefully

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.340
chat about with you guys even more with question
and answers.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.410
But to continue, to move onwards, our third
point in how not to live the philosophical

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.920
life according to Arrested Development, is
say exactly what you mean.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.580
I'm a word nerd, so I love the wordplay and
then the use and abuse of language in Arrested

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.720
Development.
I think that to me, personally, like my personal

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.320
theory is it's one of those things that makes
the show just so funny is the fact that there

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.610
is this kind of twisting and playfulness with
language for sure.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.010
We got an example of the literal Doctor, I'll
get to that in the second.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.210
We have an excellent chapter on that where
we talk about language in the book.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:30.550
And there's a good example if you remember
from the wedding when George Michael and Maeby

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.580
get pretend married.
But then they actually get married even though

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.460
they thought it was a fake wedding so that's
a good example because it says a lot about

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.210
language.
One of the things that I'm interested in is

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.300
it something that J L Austin this philosopher
of language called performative speech.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.840
And performative a speech is basically not
just language that describes something, like

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.760
I am standing here. Performative speech is
more like something that does something that

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.750
is actually, it's performing the action that
it's talking about.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.100
That happens when you say 'I pronounce you
man and wife'.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.970
It happens when you're saying something like
'I promise, I swear, I bet'.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.910
These are all kind of examples of performative
speech.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.000
There is something, if we have time at the
end I'd like to talk about is, just like what

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.760
language is.
Like what effects does language have, you

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.550
know like what makes something real like I
don't know Kris maybe you have, it's a big

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.550
question.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.550
&gt;&gt;Kris: It's a huge question

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.530
&gt;&gt;Tyler: You know like for example like to
part to use a wedding example even more, so

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.950
like I'm an ordained minister according to
my like thing that I got from the Internet.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.260
And that's a fair question I think about you
know like what is real, what makes something

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:41.400
actually real, like how do we understand these
rules.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.640
The point is, I guess, if I'm trying to make
is that language sometimes has a very real

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.400
effect in the world.
Specifically for us, what we're interested

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.430
in is that language has humorous effects.
Context is absolutely everything.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.890
When we're talking about you know like how
a joke happens, like you know obviously it

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.390
needs at least two parties, the speaker and
the hearer.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.110
But it also like, you know, we have to incorporate
a lot of things that were talking about, the

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.370
humorous effects of language; it's a context,
it's the role the speaker, the role of the

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.520
audience.
The historical period, and kind of the cultural

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.610
you know milieu that the speaker and the audience
inhabit.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:21.650
So in order to, like you know, we have to
be at a certain place in a certain time in

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.070
order to, like, understand certain jokes.
And I think Arrested Development does that

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.710
extremely well.
Like here's one my favorite examples right,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:33.760
the literal Doctor.
So when Tobias is hit by car,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.330
[laughter[
He was also blue at the time so like no one

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:44.101
could see him in the dark.
When Lindsay says, "how's my husband?" literal

00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:50.490
Doctor says, "it looks like he's dead", which
everyone is horrified to read about or hear

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.860
about.
And then Michael is like this isn't the first

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.000
encounter with the literal Doctor. So at this
point Michael says, "Wait, you looks like

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.320
he's dead or he is dead?"
And literal Doctor says, "It looks like he's

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:05.310
dead, he's covered in blue paint or something."
And you know like so literally speaking, like

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:10.720
when you're reading on a paper like yeah,
it's not entirely unreasonable to understand

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.150
what the literal Doctor was trying to say,
but that's why it's funny is the fact that

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.690
you know they play with language in this sort
of way.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.220
And there's tons of examples like this of
you know one person saying one thing and actually

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.450
taking that unintended meaning to mean something
else.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.830
This is probably my second favorite related
Gob Bluth clip.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.190
This was when Gob was apparently married for
a little while to his Amy Fuller is that her

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:35.190
name?

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.190
&gt;&gt;Kris: Yes

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:40.550
&gt;&gt;Tyler: His real-life wife played this role
of Gob's wife in this episode.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.150
[Pause]
I really have to read this, like I wish we

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.920
could do, we could even do a staged reading
of this.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920
I'll just --

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.700
&gt;&gt;Kris: Do you want to, I'd be happy to--

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.810
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yes, lets actually.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.030
&gt;&gt;Kris: Oh this will be fantastic, I'm excited.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.260
&gt;&gt;Tyler: I'll play Gob's wife

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.350
&gt;&gt;Kris: OK

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:01.100
&gt;&gt;Tyler: So like, just to give this little
more context, like, I'm saying, so much of

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.580
the, what's funny about Arrested Development
has to do with what the hearer interprets

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.940
or misinterprets.
And in this case Gob and Gob's wife are playing

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.330
the role of speaker and hearer in this case.
So when Gob's wife says, "I'm in love with

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.710
your Brother in Law"

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.730
&gt;&gt;Kris: You're in love with your own brother,
the one in the army

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.890
&gt;&gt;Tyler: No, I'm in love with your sister's
husband.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.320
&gt;&gt;Kris: Michael?
Michael.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.160
&gt;&gt;Tyler: No, that's your sister's brother

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.670
&gt;&gt;Kris: No, I'm my sister's brother, me, you're
in love with me.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.510
&gt;&gt;Tyler: No, I'm in love with Tobias

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.140
&gt;&gt;Kris: My Brother in Law?

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.140
[Laughter]

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.580
&gt;&gt;Tyler: So anyways we have this really good,
one of our contributors really broke down

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.100
this section and literally speaking if you
take it from word to word, there are ways

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.840
in which this isn't entirely inaccurate.
You could if you were Gob or someone like

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.380
Gob read it this way.
But most people don't, like again, context

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.090
has a lot to do with it.
Like it should've been clear, based on the

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:00.250
roles involved that this is a fairly straightforward,
non-confusing conversation.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.710
But it's really funny this way.
And again like the point I'm trying to make

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.860
is that words are never uttered in a vacuum
right?

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.510
So meaning is never understood outside of
the context of where does this thing happen,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:19.150
so in this case it's the context of speaker
and hearer, and the context of our dramatic

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.890
reading here which is sort of like the context
of husband, wife and very confused husband

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.460
who also has brothers and has brothers in
law and these sort of things.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.010
So a perfect use of humor through language
in Arrested Development.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:36.510
One of the things that I like to kind of elaborate
on the theory I have that language is one

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.720
of the things that makes Arrested Development
so funny for us is the use of abusive language.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.760
Because it reveals interesting things about
how normal language works like the fact of

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.850
how a particular utterance, what it means
in these sort of things.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.810
But basically when Arrested Development plays
with language in this sort of way, it takes

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.430
it out of its normal everyday use and it actually
makes us pay attention if you go back and

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.930
re-watch episodes or right philosophy chapters
on these sort of things.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.180
It makes you think about how normal language
works by seeing how normal language doesn't

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.600
work.
So I think that's one of the values of the

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.110
show.
Whoops, didn't see that one for a second.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.160
[Laughter]
I guess, here's another, I'll read this one,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.080
we don't have to do a dramatic reading of
this one but this is a Tobias quote that I

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.750
rather liked.
I don't remember what episode, maybe someone

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:28.060
out there will know.
But, he's talking to Lucille, and he says,

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.940
"You know, Mother Lucille, there's a psychological
concept known as denial, that I believe you're

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:38.330
evincing. It's when a thought is so hateful
that the mind literally rejects it."

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.720
Lucille Lynch says, "You are a worse psychiatrist
than you are a son-in-law, and you will never

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.450
get work as an actor because you have no talent."
And Tobias says "Well, if she's not going

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.380
to say anything, I certainly can't help her."
[Laughter]

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:53.611
So it's a good example of communication, communication
takes two roles it needs a speaker and the

00:32:53.611 --> 00:32:58.350
hearer in this case we have like what ostensibly
should've been a successful communication

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:02.680
act, one person saying something another person
saying something but in this case it doesn't

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.860
work if the hearer is just Tobias and completely
oblivious.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:12.360
But I've thought about this because we are
here at authors I've Google and I've been

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.680
on both ends of these talks a lot and it kind
of made me think about what is it a speaker

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.940
does?
Like what is communication?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.410
And a lot of it has to do with not so much
what a speaker says so much because a lot

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.150
of these things, were not presenting so many
new ideas, as we are were taking ideas that

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.440
a lot of us are already familiar with and
saying them in a different way.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.950
I think that that's a lot of what communication
is, and maybe even like a fair description

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.810
of philosophy sometimes, you know like saying
things in totally different way I guess to

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:42.930
think about these things.
So anyways.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:48.710
The last quote I wanted to read is, do we
have the Freud one up here, no.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.870
There's a Freud quote about, Freud's definition
of a joke like what a joke is. I actually

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.870
think it's a good one.
Freud says and I quote, "The pleasure of a

00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.250
joke lies in a kind of economy, at all times
we are expending energy and monitoring our

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.890
subconscious so as to ensure that our conscious
perceptions come through a filtering control.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.440
The joke because it breaks down the control
gives the monitoring system a holiday."

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:15.669
So that's a very long-winded way of saying
that is what we like about and enjoy about

00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:19.580
humor and sitcoms in these sort of things
is it gives us a break.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.839
It's that belief of how the world normally
should be, even if for a second a split second

00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:30.240
I like to laugh and joke, that is one of the
things that we enjoy, the pleasure of comedy.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.070
So moving on to point number four which Kris
is going to talk about.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:39.050
&gt;&gt;Kris: Absolutely.
So the fourth way that you're not supposed

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:44.450
to live is to ignore the value of experience,
previous experiences for knowledge.

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:52.389
And I think this is a jarring shift from technical
discussion of language to knowledge generally.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:56.289
But knowledge is, I think, naturally imparted
through language.

00:34:56.289 --> 00:34:58.980
That's how we sort of, that's what we're doing
right now.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:04.359
When it's written, when it's spoken there's
all sorts of ways that you can muck things

00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:07.450
up.
And of course, another way that you can sort

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:12.579
of ruin things is by ignoring your past.
We mentioned this before with Gob and the

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:17.779
roofies he keeps taking.
There are other times where he takes them

00:35:17.779 --> 00:35:23.150
that we'll see strategically so that he doesn't
have to learn from his mistakes.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:27.460
The huge mistakes that he keeps making.
[Laughter]

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:36.400
Sorry, this one cracks me up.
So we value the role of experience generally

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.900
in knowledge.
We want to, we always say you should learn

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.460
from your past through seeking knowledge or
seeking self-knowledge, self-awareness from

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.339
the world around us; we take knowledge to
be something that's valuable.

00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:51.470
But what exactly is knowledge?
This is something with them and discuss a

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.880
little bit here we have a couple chapters
on this.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:02.190
And experience plays a fairly important role,
but exactly how do we cash out experience,

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:07.390
what role does it play?
One of the issues is that the Bluth's tend

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:11.869
to ignore all past experiences.
Gob especially as I mentioned continually

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:16.759
makes huge mistakes and he continually makes
the same huge mistake over and over and over

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:19.509
again.
It's almost always based on some lame character

00:36:19.509 --> 00:36:25.140
trait.
But Buster here can help us illustrate another

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.619
point about knowledge.
About how tricky knowledge can actually be.

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:36.079
So there's this classic problem, and it takes
an academic to come up with something like

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:41.010
this.
And Buster is something of an academic; he

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.180
certainly had plenty of graduate school, as
have I.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.900
I hope that what I'm doing is a little bit
more practical than 18th century agrarian

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.460
business theory, or cartography.
But you know, then again, I do philosophy

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.430
and so to my parents it's all the same.
So in any case, he's an academic, he seems

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.210
to know all sorts of things but does he really
know much of anything?

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:10.140
And does he know anything that actually matters?
We see here he's a little bit frightened by

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:17.250
Oscar, maybe with good reason.
And we also have found out through some sort

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:22.900
of interesting experiences that Oscar is,
in fact, Buster's real father.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.960
But does Buster know that?
The way in which he comes to know it seems

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.160
to be sort of problematic.
He hits all the sort of classic requirements

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.700
for knowledge.
Buster, in fact, believes that Oscar is his

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.490
father, he has good reason to believe it in
fact a guy who looks just like his uncle came

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:45.670
to him in the middle of the night and said
I'm not your uncle, I'm your father.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:49.430
And it turns out that it's, in fact, true
that Oscar is his father, but what's crazy

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.900
about this and what seems to make it a problem
is that the man who said I'm not your uncle,

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.349
I'm your father was George Senior in a wig.
[pause]

00:37:58.349 --> 00:38:07.730
Right so he has evidence for this true belief,
but it seems like the evidence is bad evidence.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.819
Because if he had gotten clear about who was
telling him that it was his father he would've

00:38:10.819 --> 00:38:15.779
never come across this what's actually true
belief.

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:20.930
So does he really know?
I'm not sure, there's all kinds of philosophers

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.420
who are really concerned with this, primarily
epistemologists.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:34.980
I have a chapter on that with one of my friends.
But so what, maybe Buster doesn't know in

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:40.380
this sort of ridiculous, convoluted, philosophical
sense, all that matters is that he was able

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.210
to confront Lucille and then she confirmed
it and that's good enough.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.809
We're off and running.
But consider Wayne Jarvis.

00:38:47.809 --> 00:38:52.950
This is the replacement for Barry Zuckerkorn
who then turned around and started prosecuting

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:57.430
the Bluth family.
So he seemed to know a bunch of things too.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.279
And he certainly thought he knew what he was
seeing, right?

00:39:00.279 --> 00:39:04.710
So we're talking about experience and how
experience plays an important role in knowledge.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:09.940
And we take visual experience, or the senses
to be a pretty good indicator that we are

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.579
learning something.
But Wayne Jarvis was looking at a photograph

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:18.980
that he got off the Bluth company server.
Does anybody remember what the photograph

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.380
was?
Or what he thought it was?

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.369
I won't make you say anything crude.

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:24.510
&gt;&gt;female #1: Iraqi landscape

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:29.240
&gt;&gt;Kris: They thought it was Iraqi landscape.
Because George was being charged with having

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:37.599
built houses on, in Iraq.
So what he thought was that he saw a picture

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:44.150
of Iraqi landscape which was where they were
building houses to hide weapons of mass distraction.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:49.920
And he saw this precisely because, you might
say, he's a prosecutor, he's looking for incriminating

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.530
evidence so when he comes across a photograph
that might look like landscape, he's gonna

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:58.130
to see it exactly as that.
And this is an issue in philosophy and the

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:01.690
philosophy of science in particular, but in
epistemology and generally called the theory

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.799
ladeness of observation.
That is, we see certain things, not just sort

00:40:06.799 --> 00:40:11.690
of for what they are but we interpret them
and our sort of background theories are informing

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.859
the way that we experience the world.
All the time.

00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:21.619
And so part of the problem is that, as we
saw in the first slide, Barry was able to

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:27.470
point out that what it was in fact not an
Iraqi landscape but was Tobias's balls.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:31.260
[Laughter]
So I'm not going to subject you to the actual

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:39.369
photo, were not gonna do that.
But unlike, so Wayne Jarvis is unlike Gob

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:44.509
in that he probably learned from this.
He probably got a little bit embarrassed;

00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:52.400
almost started a war on the basis of this.
So it's pretty bad evidence, pretty flimsy.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.619
But the Bluths show us what not to do.
Jarvis sort of points us at something that

00:40:57.619 --> 00:41:03.309
we need to be aware of in order to not make
the same huge mistake.

00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:07.779
But Gob on the other hand here, you want to
do another reenactment?

00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:08.779
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yes.

00:41:08.779 --> 00:41:09.779
&gt;&gt;Kris: OK.

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:10.779
&gt;&gt;Tyler:
I call Steve Holt.

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:11.779
[Laughter]

00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:12.779
&gt;&gt;Kris: Steve Holt, OK

00:41:12.779 --> 00:41:14.900
&gt;&gt;Tyler: "I've made a huge mistake"

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.930
&gt;&gt;Kris: "I know the feeling; I had you. I'm
your father, Steve Holt, I can't hide from

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.930
it anymore."

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.589
&gt;&gt;Tyler: "I won't forget this, Dad."

00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:30.820
&gt;&gt;Kris: "I will" and then he pops a roofie,
drinks it and then in a tender moments says

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.270
"I will" crying a little bit.
So again, we have this situation where Gob

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:40.109
is sort of forced to be aware of his own mistakes.
He's self-aware and forced to be, and confronted

00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:45.079
with it in the most impassioned way possible.
And yet he decides, nope, I'm out; I don't

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:50.049
want this, I don't want to learn from it,
I don't want real-life experiences, going

00:41:50.049 --> 00:41:53.730
back to the previous discussion, somebody
else can have it.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.049
&gt;&gt;Tyler:
Wrapping things up this brings us to point

00:41:56.049 --> 00:42:00.360
number five about how not to live, or how
to live a philosophical life according to

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.880
Arrested Development.
This one would be about telling good stories,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.859
and I think narrative is like you know, the
story structure of Arrested Development is

00:42:09.859 --> 00:42:11.630
very unique.
And it's certainly one of the things that

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:16.220
I'm most interested in.
This was the chapter that I wrote, you should

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.170
check it out it's awesome.
But there's a lot to say about Arrested Development

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.869
as a, as an actual sitcom.
In a lot of ways I think you could even understand

00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:30.249
Arrested Development as a show about television.
Think about it as this pseudodocumentary with

00:42:30.249 --> 00:42:35.250
a voice-over narrative, constant cut forwards
and flashbacks and these sort of things.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.230
So it kind of place with the conventions of
like what a documentary is and what can or

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.950
can't be done on television.
Let me take a step back and talk about, in

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:51.280
the chapter I talk about, in the poetics Aristotle
a Greek philosopher from 380 BC, talks about

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.140
what a story is.
A story is a thing that it has to have a beginning,

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.210
middle and an ending.
Like it has to have some sort of structure,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:01.809
it has to have or provide us as story receivers
or readers with some sort of sense of like

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:05.459
how things are going to get from one place
to another.

00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:09.319
We create stories because we want to explain
why things are the way they are, how they

00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:14.780
relate and how they began and how they end.
Otherwise we're left was something like a

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.230
Samuel Beckett play where's just sort of a
lot of nothingness.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:23.720
But if you think about what television is,
specifically like the narration in Arrested

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.559
Development, I think it helps us, you know,
not unlike what I was talking about before

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:32.010
with language, how it plays with language.
It helps us kind of think about the ways that

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.820
we, how we relate to stories the way we do,
why we find meaning in the world through stories.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.519
We really do like narrative, we really do
like stories. There's a certain pleasure that

00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:47.509
we get from how we make sense of events in
a lot of ways a lot of philosophers think

00:43:47.509 --> 00:43:53.039
that narrative, thinking in terms of narrative
is actually at the root of human thought.

00:43:53.039 --> 00:43:57.380
We tend to like a lot of things we do, whether
it's gossiping, telling stories or dreaming

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.619
or whatever.
These all have some sort of structure with

00:44:00.619 --> 00:44:04.599
it, someone doing something's going somewhere
or some variation of that.

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:09.920
So narrative is kind of like, it certainly
is an important means for us to find how we

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.299
learn about the world and how we learn about
ourselves, I think.

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:16.470
I mean think about when you're a kid for a
second, all right.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.999
So like think about the kind of delight that
you get when you reach the end of the story,

00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:24.829
reach like the end.
Where that delight comes from is kind of like

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:30.359
something that I write about in this chapter
and it gives us hope basically that there's

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:33.670
an underlying structure to things.
That in real life things don't happen that

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.980
way, there is no beginning, middle, and end.
Like things don't usually happen on time,

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.430
or there's not usually like to clear tidy
sense of resolution.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.790
That's how life is, so narrative is our way
of kind of imposing meaning on things.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:49.099
When we tell the stories about things, we
like the things to make sense, we like them

00:44:49.099 --> 00:44:54.390
to lead from one thing to another.
Narrative asks us not only questions of why,

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.200
but what.
There's an example and I'm gonna skip this

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.549
one, we'll come back to it, I promise.
In the chapter I talk about how stories can

00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:03.750
be used.
Stories can be used for pretty much anything,

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:11.089
just like statistics or you know, many other
types of things like the bad news, the good

00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:14.119
news is that we can use stories for whatever
purposes we want, the bad news is that we

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.730
can use stories for whatever purposes that
we want.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:21.180
In this case there's the J Walter weatherman,
the one armed man.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:26.130
This was certainly one of my favorite things
when, you know like the point of these were

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.900
like, George Senior was trying to teach the
kids a lesson.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.420
That's why you don't leave a note, that's
why you don't yell.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.990
And like you know he's always doing this and
when Michael says, 'I want the guy with the

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:41.720
fake arm and the fake blood, I want Walter
Weatherman, how do I get a hold of him'.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:47.040
And then George Senior says like, 'yeah he's
dead, you killed him when you left the door

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.839
open on the air-conditioner'.
[Laughter]

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:53.950
So it's kind of, this is a good example I
think of sort of like appropriating stories

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:58.520
for a lot of different meanings, like George
Senior does this easily like slipping without

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.109
even a second thought.
So that's kind of a good example, I think,

00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:03.960
of what this does.
Like this is a way that we sort of twist stories

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.820
to fit our own means.
Anyways one of the most important characters

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.550
I want to talk about as we're sort of wrapping
things up, and then we'll get to everyone's

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:15.349
questions is the narrator, of course. Ron
Howard is the narrator, who is one of my favorite

00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:20.769
characters and I think he has some of the
best lines in the show.

00:46:20.769 --> 00:46:24.009
Narration storytelling basically entails a
certain act of interpretation.

00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:28.299
There's always some sort of interpreting,
some sort of moral choice about meaning.

00:46:28.299 --> 00:46:31.779
What you include in the story and what you
leave out and what that says about you for

00:46:31.779 --> 00:46:36.619
telling stories about yourself.
And again this kind of like, this narrative

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:40.329
convention in Arrested Development kind of
gives us a luxury we don't normally have.

00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:46.980
My favorite example, and it seemed apropos
for today's talk is when Lindsay is, Maeby's

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:52.450
of shooting a movie somewhere, and Lindsay
guesses that Maeby is in Sacramindy for her

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:56.079
debate club semi-finals.
And the narrator very quickly jumps in and

00:46:56.079 --> 00:47:02.309
says, "There is no, she was not in, there
was no debate club and a quick Google search

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:05.749
of the word Sacramindy him up with zero results
and the following helpful question did you

00:47:05.749 --> 00:47:09.720
mean Sacramento?"
So it's a quick like one second thing, but

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.260
the idea behind that is that there's this
built-in narrative safety net of like we don't

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.799
always, like I said, when we talk about narrative
interpretation we don't always get things

00:47:17.799 --> 00:47:20.730
right.
The Bluths rarely get things right, and that's

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:25.079
where the narrative, the narrator's role comes
in to kind of put things you know in the right

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:27.279
place.
And I guess the kind of wrap up my thoughts

00:47:27.279 --> 00:47:33.329
on this, I want to leave you with, a quote
from Friedrich Nietzsche where he says basically,

00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:36.270
and this is a good model not only for understanding
Arrested Development, but something for us

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:42.369
to just think about.
Nietzsche wants us to be more like the artist

00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:47.819
who can kind of see an object as sort of you
know attention pay attention to both but the

00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:51.359
big and small details.
So basically what Nietzsche is saying is that

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:55.690
an artist has the capability of framing things
in a certain way so you're looking at only

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.710
certain parts.
The analogy that were trying to use here is

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:02.789
that that's basically what we do not only
in watching Arrested Development, but kind

00:48:02.789 --> 00:48:06.610
of what we're doing when we're talking about
all the things within our life.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.519
Like were picking selective moments; we're
picture framing things, and putting things

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:12.160
in a certain context.
So Nietzsche says we need to be more like

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:17.529
poets and you know, realize were making kind
of art out of our own lives.

00:48:17.529 --> 00:48:21.140
And you have any closing thoughts to add before
the wrap things up?

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:27.049
&gt;&gt;Kris: I was going to say I guess just as
with any good story, were going to have to

00:48:27.049 --> 00:48:30.569
call it a day here and leave you hopefully
wanting more.

00:48:30.569 --> 00:48:36.619
The book, of course, is an attempt to sort
of introduce you too ways to avoid making

00:48:36.619 --> 00:48:43.540
huge mistakes.
And I hope that we've been able to point out

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:48.140
some of the ways that you in fact ought not
to live according to the Bluths.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.549
So thank you for being here and thank you
for listening.

00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:52.559
[Applause]

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:59.609
&gt;&gt; Mr. Manager: So do we have questions that
the mike and at these roving microphones.&gt;&gt;male

00:48:59.609 --> 00:49:03.380
#2:
If you could pick a favorite episode Kris

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:08.860
which episode would you pick?

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860
&gt;&gt;Kris: [Sigh]
[Pause]

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.860
It might be peer pressure.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Okay. Pressure is good.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.210
&gt;&gt;Kris: I think peer pressure might be.

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:19.150
&gt;&gt;Tyler: I go with SOBs, that's very meta-humor
is of course where they're making all the

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:26.309
jokes about Arrested Development getting canceled
and you know like 'yes save our show' and

00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:30.220
the homebuyers, homebuyers what does the O
stand for?

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.829
&gt;&gt;Kris: Home builder's Organization

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:33.049
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yeah, they don't want us

00:49:33.049 --> 00:49:34.049
&gt;&gt;Kris: That's right.

00:49:34.049 --> 00:49:35.049
&gt;&gt;Tyler: So it's showtime for us.

00:49:35.049 --> 00:49:36.049
&gt;&gt;Kris: So it's showtime, yeah.

00:49:36.049 --> 00:49:37.049
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yeah.

00:49:37.049 --> 00:49:38.470
&gt;&gt;Kris: If you showtime, let's put on a show.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.470
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yeah.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:46.430
&gt;&gt;male #3: So how would you comment on the
use and the metaphor of the OC and like the

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:50.749
culture of life down there throughout the
show?

00:49:50.749 --> 00:49:58.390
&gt;&gt;Tyler: That's an interesting question.
I mean there's certainly kind of like a fantasyland

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:01.309
aspect to it.
It kind of reminds me of like the Simpsons

00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:04.230
in a lot of ways where like Springfield, where
is Springfield?

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:07.460
You know like everywhere and nowhere.
The OC is kind of like that to where they

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.549
have like, and they conveniently have a little
England, Little Britain, there is no little

00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:13.670
Britain in the OC.
Right?

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.829
I mean, I googled it once, there's not.
[Laughter]

00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:20.809
But you know like they kind of have these
things to kind of suit the conventions and

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:25.200
the conveniences of the show.
So there's something about that.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.180
I don't know, it's a good question because
you know I don't really know what to think

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.490
about the, and what's with the whole don't
call it that thing.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.119
Like is it just.

00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:35.440
&gt;&gt;Kris: It's just a reference to the TV show,
I think.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.530
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Yeah, OK.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:42.119
&gt;&gt;Kris: No, I was gonna say also just added
adding on, we do have a chapter in the book

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:49.900
on the sort of upscale culture or trying to
fake it into the upscale culture.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:56.839
And so I think a part of that is both a send-up
of this sort of American dream, and then also

00:50:56.839 --> 00:51:04.180
maybe a critique of putting yourself into
really awful situations in order to fulfill

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:11.670
this dream that's itself kind of a joke.
And that's another one of the chapters, that's

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.030
worth considering.
And so I think that that's one of the same

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:16.869
issues is going on there.

00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:18.590
&gt;&gt;female#2: Great presentation thank you.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:19.590
&lt;Kris and Tyler&gt;
Thank you

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:23.690
&gt;&gt;female #2:
I wanted to ask what was, what has been the

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:31.119
perception of a work like this within the
broader field of film studies and philosophy?

00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:33.970
And in kind of the academic community?

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:38.630
&gt;&gt;Kris: By and large philosophers, I think,
are a fickle bunch.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:44.059
And so I think that there's sort of a mixed
reception in the philosophical community about

00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:50.739
the way these kinds of works are received.
I think that the right way to view them is

00:51:50.739 --> 00:51:54.470
introducing core philosophical issues to a
broader audience.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:52:01.779
Trying to take ourselves out of, so to speak,
the ivory tower and break it right down next

00:52:01.779 --> 00:52:07.770
to the banana stand on the boardwalk in the
OC and sort of spread the word.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.890
I couldn't think to the film community, I'm
not really sure.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:16.480
I do have a cool anecdote though, I met David
Cross last week in Iowa.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.339
Weird right?
I met David Cross in a bar, and I presented

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:26.059
him a copy of the book and he was so excited
he actually started reading it out loud to

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:28.820
other members, or other people who were at
the bar.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.050
So that was pretty much the highlight of my
life.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.809
[Laughter]
Forget the degrees, you know those don't matter

00:52:34.809 --> 00:52:36.099
compared to this.

00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:43.890
&gt;&gt;male #4: And what about the idea of narrator
as character and as omniscient in person and

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:44.890
as Ron Howard.

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:52.119
&gt;&gt;Tyler: Well I mean that's a good question
two, because I mean the narrator is certainly

00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:58.739
in a unique position in the show where you
remember the one where Kitty is at the bar

00:52:58.739 --> 00:53:02.690
and she's threatening Michael and she says
like, "Did you hear that everyone Michael

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.029
Bluth is threatening me."
And then she, you know, like she flashes everyone

00:53:06.029 --> 00:53:12.950
and John Beard who is actually a Los Angeles
Fox News anchor, he was in that, and he was

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.410
like you know I got a get out of here I can't
be part of the script; I can't be part of

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.790
the story, I can't be seen.
And then he's on the news later with this

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.920
thing that says eyewitness which is clever
because it says 'I' instead of eyewitness,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:28.160
and he's saying like you know a local woman
bares all at local, at a bar, news at 11,

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.769
sources say.
The source he's talking about is himself.

00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:34.789
So that kind of like, the John Beard appearance
was sort of like a, sort of like a surrogate

00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:38.170
for the narrator character.
I mean, the problem with the narrator like

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:42.460
that is that they are both character, they're
both narrator and participant sometimes.

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.829
And that's basically I guess one of things
I talk about in my book is that were always

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:47.880
in that role.
Like when we're telling, were always telling

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.170
stories about ourselves, we are both our narrators
and main characters.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:55.529
So that's hard, like how do you separate yourself
from being the person telling the story but

00:53:55.529 --> 00:53:59.029
also the one telling the story about yourself.
So those are the kind of questions I'm always

00:53:59.029 --> 00:54:01.579
interested in, and I think it's, you know,
well worth thinking about.

00:54:01.579 --> 00:54:05.440
Because these are things that we engage with
every day, whether we realize it or not.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.940
Manager: Alright well, Tyler and Kris , thank
you for stopping by and speaking with us for

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.940
authors at Google.
[Applause]

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:10.944
&gt;&gt;Kris and Tyler: Thanks
