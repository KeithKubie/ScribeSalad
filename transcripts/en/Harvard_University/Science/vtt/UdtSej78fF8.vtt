00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.980
we the medical profession are absolutely

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.200
tied

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.289
to knowing the name tumor and its
position

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.219
its anatomical position before we can treat it.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.599
But we no longer do that with Lipitor
where we treat

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.210
or prevent heart attacks and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.920
we really don't have to know the anatomical
position of the plaques

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.210
but we did, not now.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.340
And we are no longer tied to knowing that

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.239
position or the type of infection

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.470
we often just treat the white blood count 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.510
and so forth.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.410
So the question is can you treat cancer like
that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.220
and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.539
it's not clear but we

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:49.539
think there's a way to do that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.270
when tumors switch on angiogenesis
that was that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.250
that idea came in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.980
the nineties when they switch on angiogenesis

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.230
having been non angiogenic for years

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.659
we have all everyone's assumed that that's
permanent

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.470
and now we found that about five percent can switch
it off and go backwards

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.570
and they're doing it all the time

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.690
but you can't tell because most of the tumor cells
are angiogenic so the tumor goes on

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.240
growing sixty seventy eighty percent of cells
are angiogenic, but small group is switching

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.870
backwards

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.510
going to non angiogenic

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.470
so that's a very important

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.630
finding the reversal of angiogenesis

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.230
so if nature can do it

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.230
we would just like to increase the percentage.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.579
Well I think they'll be used

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.579
first of all

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.110
more, more widely in combination right now
of course have to be tested alone

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.070
with chemotherapy and without it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.420
and gradually they're being combined

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.800
because the inhibitors we have are

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.620
very very tremendous breakthroughs

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.750
but they generally are very narrow

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.490
so they treat like

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.950
VEGF or one angiogenic factor but
tumors

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.959
keep adding things they keep

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.039
using different angiogenic factors

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.019
proteins

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.309
and it will be useful to

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.219
combine these

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.969
and after

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.179
we, the profession learns that experience, 
like we used to use

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.920
in the forties we used to use penicillin by itself

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.810
you wouldn't do that today

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.450
you'd have penicillin plus something else

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.149
or three drugs

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.639
then the next step will be this to
move over to the very broad

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.339
angiogenesis inhibitors

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:39.409
none of them are in a clinic yet but they've
been discovered.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.930
and we have calreticulin is one
and endostatin is another

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.839
and there are twenty six others in the body. 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:54.579
The angiogenesis inhibitors are approved in
twenty eight countries now besides the US

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.649
so we're learning first of all that

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.930
there's very little, very few side effects

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.260
so the patients find it very comfortable to
be treated for cancer

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.589
that's the first

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.609
huge change

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.130
and they do not want to go back another other 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.799
treatments

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.409
so we have patients who to play golf

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.859
get their strength back, go back to work and yet
are being treated every day with an angiogenesis 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.680
inhibitor.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.059
The second thing we found is that

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.180
there's less drug resistance

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.969
with standard chemotherapy so they can

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.830
keep taking these drugs

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.639
patients have on

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.689
thalidomide five years for multiple biloma

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.569
on endostatin for three and a half years
for other tumors

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.549
so that, that's 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.159
very exciting to the oncologists.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.409
And then the third

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.400
thing is that when you have treatment that's nontoxic,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.719
or relatively nontoxic

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.749
so that you can give it for a long time like
tamoxifen,

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.650
that raises a question of whether

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.259
if you could diagnose the tumor

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.649
really early

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:58.459
by a

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.189
blood test,

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.959
a bowel marker or urine test 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.529
then maybe you could 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.849
treat the blood tests

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.639
and never see the tumor.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.160
This is all in the future

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.679
but that's what

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:13.760
scientists have to 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.599
to

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.979
you have to actually

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.769
imagine what it might be if you can get there.
