00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.760
Sometimes people ask me how do I feel about black holes, whether I find them scary or intimidating

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.540
Well they, they are a bit, but they can be cuddly too

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.060
These are two cuddly toy black holes that I got as a present for my sister-in-law. I just I just like them

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.709
They're just little cuddly. There's a little baby one, and there's a slightly bigger, you know, mummy black hole, if you like

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.240
Oh, well, a black hole is a [um] region of space

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.980
in which light can't escape from

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.360
Material comes together under the force of gravity

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.080
tries to fight that [uh] if you get too much material you can't overcome that Force and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.560
eventually mathematics and the laws of physics

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.220
take us into this strange regime.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.700
Well, it's an object which which forms when a star dies.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.280
It's something hat's got many masses of the sun, has collapsed, and its own gravitational pull

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.480
It's got a lot of mass packed in a very small region

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.380
Eventually it collapses to the point where not even light can escape from it and it forms something called an event Horizon

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.420
But it's like a shell, if you like

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.600
and that event Horizon is the, within that event Horizon, light can't escape, so that's why it's black

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.720
At the center it has this mathematical impossibility called a singularity

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.240
So they say black holes can't have hair well these ones do, and eyes.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.500
Brady: Do you know what I'd like--to make the earth into a black hole you'd actually have to make it about that size

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.200
Professor: Yeah yeah, that's right

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.959
Yeah
so if that really was a black hole it would be probably more massive than the Earth contained within a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.420
Little tiny region

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.289
Here on Earth if you throw something up in the air

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.200
It comes back down again, okay, and if you throw it a bit harder

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.060
It goes a bit higher, but it will tend to come back down again. If you throw something hard enough

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380
It'll actually escape from the Earth entirely

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.540
[Sounds of a rocket engine firing]

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.430
A rocket [uh] doesn't have to be

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.649
I mean, you know you could fire a projectile up anything as long as it's traveling at this escape velocity, escape speed, it will escape from the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.650
Earth's Gravity keep going and going and going off to infinity

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.249
Rather than eventually turning around and coming back. If you were to make the earth a bit more

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.550
Compressed then the gravitational pull would get a bit more intense

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.200
And so actually you'd have to throw something a bit harder to get it to escape from the Earth's pull of gravity

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.280
And if you kept squishing the Earth and squishing the Earth

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.300
eventually you'd reach a point where the gravitational pull was so strong that that escape velocity became equal to the speed of light and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.780
Because we can't get anything to go at the speed of light apart from light, and in particular

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.180
we definitely can't get anything to go faster than light, that means if you then squish it a tiny bit more then nothing can escape

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.810
not even light can escape

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.540
nothing can escape from it because suddenly in order to escape from it you have to make something travel faster than light in order to do so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.060
But a black hole in general relativity is actually more sinister than that

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.000
It's not just that light can't escape, a black hole in G.R., there is literally no way to get out of it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.120
[um] If it was just a matter of the escape velocity being high you could always build a ladder

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.620
Climb out of it and with a sufficiently powerful rocket get away

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.940
[uh] But there's actually more to that space and time

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.280
Collapses in on itself as you enter the event Horizon of a black hole in G.R.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.340
And there's literally no way to escape from it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.500
Brady: Now, we all know black holes involve these things called singularities, but from what you're saying

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.440
it sounds like you don't have to get as far as a singularity

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.780
to get to a point where light can't escape. It could be quite a lot bigger than a singularity.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.880
Professor: Indeed and in fact, so these the kind of the thought experiment I've just gone through predates general relativity by a long time

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.779
I think probably laplace or someone was the first people who--person--who actually thought this through and realized there was a point

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.460
where you would create a thing called a black hole and in, you know, if you, just dealing with Newtonian Gravity

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.040
you still have a black, you can create black holes

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.200
It's only when you then say okay

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.500
So what, when you try and solve the set of equations as to what's going on within general relativity

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.440
When you've gone through this process that's when you realize that you actually create a singularity by doing that.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.920
In G.R. space and time becomes compressed such that any movement you make in time or space

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.740
Takes you towards that center of the thing and actually that's what led

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.960
[uh] Hawking and penrose(?) in the late 60s to suggest that you have to have a singularity at the center of a black hole essentially.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.040
And then eventually your equations inevitably break down and so you have to repeat, the very existence of black holes and the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.040
singularity that you've seemed

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.480
It looks like you have at the center of them, tells you that Einstein's theory is not a complete theory

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.040
It's at best an effective theory that needs to be replaced by something else when you start talking about, you know, high energies, strong

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.980
gravitational fields, and so on and so forth

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.720
Even when you get to photons, things with no

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.180
mass at all, they still get pulled by gravity, and we can see that directly through this phenomenon called gravitational lensing

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.030
That way you've got like light from something passing a massive body, like a galaxy or something like that,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.580
you can actually see that the path of light has been bent

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.960
by gravity and so actually gravity is affecting even light its path is being diverted by it so it's being pulled by the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.260
Gravitational field so even lights not immune to gravity. Now the thing that's different

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.420
is that light doesn't slow down because light always travels at the speed of light,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.880
so if you think about, you know, you're on one of these incredibly compact objects

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.519
and you're shining a light upwards and so, what happens?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.970
It's not like throwing a rock in the air that it comes back down again, with light

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.279
it will keep traveling away from you at the speed of light,

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.369
but it's using up energy. Might be another way to think about these things is the energy that you're turning the kinetic energy of something

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.510
If it's a rock into its potential energy as it goes away from the surface is the same with light,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.610
but the way that light loses its energy

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.280
isn't by slowing down, the way that light loses energy is by changing color.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.480
It would lose its energy by changing color by,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.400
you know, starting at the the blue end of the spectrum and ending up at the red end of the spectrum

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.989
and then beyond red it would turn into infrared, radio waves, and actually, before it escaped, it

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.430
would have used up all its energy and kind of red shifted to nothingness, there'll be no energy left to escape

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.489
So little lone black holes, which we call stellar-Mass black holes, can be one of

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.060
the several end points to the evolution of a star

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.940
They're by no means the most common end point so most stars like our own sun

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.300
Will turn into a white dwarf at the end of their life, and then fade into basically nothingness. If you have a star

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.540
that's massive enough, and the mass of the star governs pretty much its entire life, it will either turn into a neutron star

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.720
through a Supernova, or if it's even more massive, it'll turn into an even denser object.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.200
which is the black hole, and so, you know, there are a lot of stars out there

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200
so there are a lot of black holes out there

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.340
[um] but they're by no means sort of ubiquitous and and littering the Galaxy

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.260
we know there's always gravity, so there's always something pulling things together

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.600
so the

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.920
sort of sometimes the more salient question is what stops everything collapsing into black holes and

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.790
so, for example, in something like the sun, you've got the nuclear fusion in the middle

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.149
which is producing the energy, which is heating things up, which is kind of keeping it puffed up,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.950
but if you were to turn off that nuclear fusion, then the sun would start to collapse down and

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.270
gravity would pull it and pull it and pull it and then you say, okay, so what else could stop it?

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.800
I'm no longer got my source of fusion, and it turns out there are few things that might help out.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.340
[um] So this thing called Electron degeneracy pressure

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.300
[um] Which is, you know, which is a very electrons basically don't like being squashed close together

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.360
And so Electron Degeneracy pressure will stop something like the sun from collapsing all the way to a black hole

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.160
It'll turn it into a thing called a white dwarf, which is held up by Electron degeneracy pressure. Turns out

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.809
if it was a bit more massive than even electron degeneracy pressure wouldn't do it, gravity would win again,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.959
so it would say 'to hell with this' squash all the electrons together

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.000
And then it will collapse down further, to kind of nuclear density, at that point you create a thing called a neutron star

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.480
And there's a thing called neutron degeneracy pressure, which is that neutrons don't like being squashed very close together either

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.000
[um] And so that will halt the collapsing and end up with a neutron star, but then it's a little bit more massive than that,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.519
so maybe about twice the mass of the sun, bit more than that,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.690
then even electron, even the neutron degeneracy pressure won't stop it

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.429
and then it will keep collapsing, and then, as far as we know, there's nothing that will stop that collapse. Now

00:07:54.429 --> 00:07:57.060
maybe we're missing some physics. Maybe there is some process

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.100
we don't know about which would actually halt that collapse, but we don't know what it is

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.449
but they're the boring ones, let me tell you about the interesting ones, the interesting ones are the ones that live in the middle of

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.840
Galaxies which are enormous they're very very massive

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:19.900
