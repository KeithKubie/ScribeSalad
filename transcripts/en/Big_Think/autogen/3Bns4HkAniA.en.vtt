planet this was something that this

planet this was something that this
incredibly powerful and it was not

incredibly powerful and it was not
 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.650
incredibly powerful and it was not
possible and we started how to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660
possible and we started how to
 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.550
possible and we started how to
programming then we had to store

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
programming then we had to store
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.170
programming then we had to store
everything in our own brains

I think consciousness is a very

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190
I think consciousness is a very
 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.580
I think consciousness is a very
difficult concept to understand because

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590
difficult concept to understand because
 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.680
difficult concept to understand because
we mostly know it by a reference you can

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690
we mostly know it by a reference you can
 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.870
we mostly know it by a reference you can
point at it but it's very hard for us to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
point at it but it's very hard for us to
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.420
point at it but it's very hard for us to
understand what it actually is and I

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
understand what it actually is and I
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.250
understand what it actually is and I
think at this point the best model that

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260
think at this point the best model that
 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.590
think at this point the best model that
I've come up is what what we mean by

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600
I've come up is what what we mean by
 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.740
I've come up is what what we mean by
consciousness it is a model of a model

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
consciousness it is a model of a model
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.310
consciousness it is a model of a model
of a model that is our new cortex makes

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320
of a model that is our new cortex makes
 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.230
of a model that is our new cortex makes
a model of our interactions is the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
a model of our interactions is the
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.870
a model of our interactions is the
environment and part of our neocortex

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880
environment and part of our neocortex
 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.270
environment and part of our neocortex
makes a model of our of that model that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
makes a model of our of that model that
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.430
makes a model of our of that model that
is it tries to find out how we interact

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440
is it tries to find out how we interact
 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.110
is it tries to find out how we interact
with the environment so we can take this

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
with the environment so we can take this
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.360
with the environment so we can take this
in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
in
 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.559
in
to account when you interact with the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569
to account when you interact with the
 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.690
to account when you interact with the
environment and then we have a model of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
environment and then we have a model of
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.940
environment and then we have a model of
this model of our model which means we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
this model of our model which means we
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.729
this model of our model which means we
have something that represents the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
have something that represents the
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.320
have something that represents the
features of that model and we call this

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
features of that model and we call this
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.070
features of that model and we call this
the self and the self is integrated with

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
the self and the self is integrated with
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.750
the self and the self is integrated with
something like an attentional protocol

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
something like an attentional protocol
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430
something like an attentional protocol
so we have a model of the things that we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
so we have a model of the things that we
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.899
so we have a model of the things that we
attended to the things that we became

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909
attended to the things that we became
 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.210
attended to the things that we became
aware of well the process things that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
aware of well the process things that
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.380
aware of well the process things that
might be interacted with the environment

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
might be interacted with the environment
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.020
might be interacted with the environment
and this protocol this memory of what we

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
and this protocol this memory of what we
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.520
and this protocol this memory of what we
attend the tour's would be typically

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
attend the tour's would be typically
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770
attend the tour's would be typically
associated with consciousness so in some

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
associated with consciousness so in some
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.210
associated with consciousness so in some
sense you are not conscious and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
sense you are not conscious and
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.220
sense you are not conscious and

actuality in the here-and-now because
that's not really possible for a process

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
that's not really possible for a process
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360
that's not really possible for a process
that needs to do many things over time

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
that needs to do many things over time
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.979
that needs to do many things over time
in order to retrieve items from memory

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989
in order to retrieve items from memory
 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.809
in order to retrieve items from memory
and process them and do something with

and process them and do something with
 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.509

them consciousness is actually a memory

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
them consciousness is actually a memory

our brain several times a minute and
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.970
our brain several times a minute and
then we think about being conscious of

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
then we think about being conscious of
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.619
then we think about being conscious of
something it means that we have a model

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629
something it means that we have a model

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690
going to build in the future are
 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.390
going to build in the future are
probably not going to be humanoid robots

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400
probably not going to be humanoid robots
 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.130
probably not going to be humanoid robots
for the most parts it's going to be

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140
for the most parts it's going to be
 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.770
for the most parts it's going to be
intelligent systems so a eyes are not

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780
intelligent systems so a eyes are not
 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.450
intelligent systems so a eyes are not
going to be something that lives next to

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460
going to be something that lives next to
 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.690
going to be something that lives next to
us like household robot or something

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700

that then tries to get uman rights and

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880
that then tries to get uman rights and
 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.190
that then tries to get uman rights and
throw off the joke of its oppression

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200
throw off the joke of its oppression
 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.840
throw off the joke of its oppression
it's a household slave or something

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850
it's a household slave or something
 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.390
it's a household slave or something
instead it's going to be for instance

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400
instead it's going to be for instance
 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.000
instead it's going to be for instance
corporations nation state and so on that

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010
corporations nation state and so on that
 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.010
corporations nation state and so on that
are going to use for the intelligent

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020
are going to use for the intelligent
 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.260
are going to use for the intelligent
task machine learning and computer

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270
task machine learning and computer
 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.480
task machine learning and computer
models that are more more intricate and

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490
models that are more more intricate and
 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.730
models that are more more intricate and
self modeling and become aware of what

they are doing so we are going to live

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660
they are doing so we are going to live
 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.420
they are doing so we are going to live
inside of these intelligent systems not

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430
inside of these intelligent systems not
 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.830
inside of these intelligent systems not
next to them you're going to have a

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840
next to them you're going to have a
 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.600
next to them you're going to have a
relationship to them that's similar to

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610
relationship to them that's similar to
 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.570
relationship to them that's similar to
the gut flora has to our organism and to

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580
the gut flora has to our organism and to
 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.000
the gut flora has to our organism and to
our mind you're going to be a small part

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.010
our mind you're going to be a small part
 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.700
our mind you're going to be a small part
of it in some sense so it's very hard to

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:37.710
of it in some sense so it's very hard to
 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.710
of it in some sense so it's very hard to
map this to a human experience because

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720
map this to a human experience because
 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.230
map this to a human experience because
the environment that these AIS are going

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240
the environment that these AIS are going
 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.550
the environment that these AIS are going
to interact this is going to be very

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560
to interact this is going to be very
 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.400
to interact this is going to be very
different from ours also I don't think

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410
different from ours also I don't think
 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.920
different from ours also I don't think
that these AIS will be conscious of

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:48.930
that these AIS will be conscious of
 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.330
that these AIS will be conscious of
things in the same sense as we are

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340
things in the same sense as we are
 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.920
things in the same sense as we are
because you're only conscious of things

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930
because you're only conscious of things
 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.500
because you're only conscious of things
that require our attention and you are

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510
that require our attention and you are
 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.300
that require our attention and you are
only aware of the things that you cannot

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310
only aware of the things that you cannot
 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.340
only aware of the things that you cannot
do automatically most of the things that

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.350
do automatically most of the things that
 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.500
do automatically most of the things that
we do don't require our attention most

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.510
we do don't require our attention most
 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.970
we do don't require our attention most
of the simple stuff in our body is

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:01.980
of the simple stuff in our body is
 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.220
of the simple stuff in our body is
regulated this feedback loops and most

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.230
regulated this feedback loops and most
 

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.900
regulated this feedback loops and most
of the other stuff is just going on by

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910
of the other stuff is just going on by
 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.550
of the other stuff is just going on by
itself because we haven't trained our

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560
itself because we haven't trained our
 

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.890
itself because we haven't trained our
brain with useful routines to deal with

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900
brain with useful routines to deal with
 

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.660
brain with useful routines to deal with
them and only when there is a conflict

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.670
them and only when there is a conflict
 

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.580
them and only when there is a conflict
between these routines then we become

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.590
between these routines then we become
 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.470
between these routines then we become
aware then something gets our attention

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:15.480
aware then something gets our attention
 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.660
aware then something gets our attention
and Prestage experiencing it integrating

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.670
and Prestage experiencing it integrating
 

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.700
and Prestage experiencing it integrating
it in our protocol and I think there's

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.710
it in our protocol and I think there's
 

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.430
it in our protocol and I think there's
an argument to be made that even as we

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440
an argument to be made that even as we
 

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.200
an argument to be made that even as we
build human-like intelligence if that is

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.210
build human-like intelligence if that is
 

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.050
build human-like intelligence if that is
just perfecting that it might become so

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060
just perfecting that it might become so
 

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.610
just perfecting that it might become so
good at its task that it's really going

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620
good at its task that it's really going
 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.660
good at its task that it's really going
to be conscious of what it's doing

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:29.670
to be conscious of what it's doing
 

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.330
to be conscious of what it's doing
because it can you do all automatically

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.340
because it can you do all automatically
 

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.529
because it can you do all automatically
you

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539
