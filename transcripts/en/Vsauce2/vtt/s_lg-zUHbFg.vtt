00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
Clean your clothes in the future by simply
dropping this electrostatic spherical washing

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.640
machine into your laundry basket.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.240
And this new vibrating pill has a tiny motor
that begins vibrating 6 to 8 hours after being

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.660
consumed and it produces contractions in the
intestines that help relieve chronic constipation.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.660
Vsauce!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.900
Kevin here.... this is Mind Blow

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.050
A Dutch designer has created wearable technology
that turns your clothes into an MP3 player.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.370
The 3-D printed fabrics that make up the BB
suit give the user Wi-Fi, GPS, and bluetooth

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.370
components.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.160
And the idea is to provide wearable as opposed
to carryable technology but producing these

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.060
on even a small scale is difficult right now
especially due to questions regarding durability

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.060
and washing.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.829
SCiO is a pocket molecular sensor that can
detect the chemical makeup of objects.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.561
Use it to get nutritional facts about food,
analyze soil, authenticate medications, see

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:07.080
how ripe an avocado is through the skin or
know which watermelon is sweeter.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080
Spectrometer technology isn't new but shrinking
one down to the palm of your hand is and it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.440
could allow us to build a database of matter.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.740
Professor Scott White and his team have developed
self-healing and regenerating plastic.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.229
In the past self-healing and regenerating
materials were only able to fix small damages,

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.490
but this new technology has the ability to
regenerate materials to fill in large cracks

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.490
and holes.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.159
The future of this breakthrough has a range
of applications including a car bumper repairing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.970
itself within minutes of an accident.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.630
CleverPet is a Wi-Fi-connected feeding dish
that teaches and entertains your dog while

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.700
you're away.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.340
Your dog learns how to play with the cleverpet
by hitting different buttons to receive treats

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.510
and as the dog learns the challenges get harder.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.200
It's basically like video games for dogs.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.619
The Hive Inn is a hotel concept from Hong
Kong where the rooms are built out of shipping

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.630
containers.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.880
And that's now a thing that you know!

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.720
Mink is a 3D printer that prints makeup.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.560
It allows users to choose any color from any
image online and turn it into a wide array

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.980
of makeup products from eye shadow to lip
gloss because most makeup products are created

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.250
from the same basic substrates.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.890
This new technology could provide access to
any makeup at an affordable price since many

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.290
products and colors are not available in chain
stores.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.370
The University of Engineering and Technology
in Peru has created a billboard that purifies

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.300
air as efficiently as 1,200 trees.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.201
It creates 100,000 cubic meters of clean air
by filtering polluted air through a water

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.010
system and releasing clean air back out to
a radius of 5 blocks.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.590
And it's in response to the pollution created
as a result of Peru's booming construction

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.590
industry.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.280
The LIX is a pen that writes in 3D allowing
you to doodle in air.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.599
It melts and cools colored plastic as you
write which creates the rigid freestanding

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.599
structures.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.420
All you have to do is plug it in for power
to heat the material as it flows through the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.420
pen.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.180
And it could lead to a whole new way of crafting.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.690
This is the world's smallest comic that was
microfabricated with an ion beam onto a human

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.820
hair.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.710
Microsoft is developing a keyboard that eliminates
the need for a mouse.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.440
The Type-Hover-Swipe has gesture control sensors
between its keys and allows you to swipe and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.500
pinch mid air to navigate through web pages.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.340
And even claims to have gaming functions including
an invisible steering wheel.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
Solar Roadways is a concept for replacing
roads and parking lots with a modular solar

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.760
paving system to power the world around them.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.739
The panels would be heated to keep roads clear
of ice and snow as well as smart to alert

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.100
drivers if something is in the road.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.550
The roads would also be marked with LED lights
instead of painted markings and parking lots

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.320
would be able to reconfigure parking in an
instant.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.600
A researcher at the MIT media lab has created
super shoes.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.299
A pair of flexible soles can be placed into
any shoes making them smart.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.510
They work in conjunction with your smart phone
and can act as a navigation device sending

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.410
vibrations in your feet telling you when and
where to turn.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.250
The shoes learn your regular patterns as well
as likes and dislikes and can navigate you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.650
through different routes for variety or lead
you to a great restaurant you might not know

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.960
about nearby.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.720
Finally Technicolour Alaska is a time lapse
capturing the Northern Lights as seen from

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.319
Alaska..

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:49.520
I'm going to leave you with a camouflaged
robotic snake.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:05:30.239
And as always thanks for watching!
