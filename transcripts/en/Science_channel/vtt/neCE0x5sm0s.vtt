00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:06.406
Narrator:
THE GREEN'S CREEK MINE

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.809
IS THE LARGEST SILVER MINE
IN THE LAST FRONTIER,

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.312
PRODUCING MORE
THAN 8 MILLION OUNCES

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.714
OF SILVER IN 2015.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.386
BUT TURNING THESE ROCKS
INTO RICHES IS RISKY WORK.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.492
MINERS AT GREEN'S CREEK
HAVE TO CHIP AWAY

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:29.795
AT THE MOUNTAIN'S FOUNDATION
12 FEET AT A TIME,

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:33.066
USING HUNDREDS
OF POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.235
BUT GENERATING A BLAST
ISN'T AS SIMPLE

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.537
AS LIGHTING A STICK OF DYNAMITE.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.972
THEY HAVE TO SET
LIQUID EXPLOSIVES SEVERAL FEET

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.675
INTO THE ROCK
IN A PERFECT ARCH PATTERN.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:49.015
THE NATURAL ARCH IS INHERENTLY
A SAFER GEOMETRIC FORM.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.585 line:0%
SO IN THE PRIMARY DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE ORE ACCESSES,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.053 line:0%
WE WANT AN ARCH.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.423
Narrator: PLACING THE EXPLOSIVE
REQUIRES PRECISION

00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:01.627
<i> AND</i> ONE OF THE MINE'S
MIGHTIEST MACHINES --

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.764
THE TWO BOOM JUMBO DRILL.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.635
Man: DOUBLE BOOM JUMBO
IS LIKE A TRANSFORMER.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.672 align:start size:34% position:66% line:0%
♪♪

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.715
Narrator: THIS 23-TON MACHINE
CAN BORE 12 FEET

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.451
INTO THE TOUGHEST ROCK,
USING NOT ONE,

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.054
BUT TWO HYDRAULIC ARMS.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.459
FORTY-FIVE HOLES LATER,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.497
THE CREW HAS SET
THE EXPLOSION PATTERN.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.499
THEY'VE PLACED EACH HOLE
SPECIFICALLY

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.735
TO CREATE A CHAIN REACTION.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.169 size:63% position:69%
SO, THIS
IS OUR FIRST HOLE,

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.607 align:start size:81% position:19%
WHICH IS GONNA MAKE A HOLE
FROM THIS BIG TO THAT BIG.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.309 size:78% position:61%
AND WE'RE
JUST MAKING A LITTLE HOLE

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.110 align:start size:59% position:41%
INTO A BIGGER HOLE
ALL THE WAY AROUND

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.713 align:end position:100%
TILL WE GET THIS BIG HOLE
THAT WE'RE STANDING IN.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.717
NOW THEY'RE READY
FOR THE POWDERMAN.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.921
THE POWDERMAN
PUMPS LIQUID EXPLOSIVE

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.692
INTO EACH OF THE 45 HOLES
DRILLED INTO THE ROCK.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:11.130
HE USES A DANGEROUS MIXTURE
OF FERTILIZER AND DIESEL.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.734
Satre:
IT'S ALL LINKED TO A CENTRALIZED
BLASTING SYSTEM.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:16.169
IT'S VERY SENSITIVE.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.038
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT
ANY EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.740
AND WE DON'T WANNA PUT
ANYBODY AT RISK

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.808
FOR HAVING EXPLOSIVES
GO OFF PREMATURELY.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.277
Narrator:
THE TEAM HAS SET THE EXPLOSIVES

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.480
AND EVACUATED THE TUNNEL.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.717
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
FOR THE MINERS.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.352
LET'S GO AHEAD
AND CONFIRM.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.021
Narrator: AND WITH THE CLICK
OF A BUTTON...

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.562
...A POWERFUL EXPLOSION
BLASTS THE ORE.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.030 size:63% position:31%
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
GOOD JOB.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.664 align:start size:97% position:3%
OKAY.

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:49.168
THE BLAST WAS SUCCESSFUL.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:53.138
THE EXPLOSIVES
BROKE FREE 300 TONS OF ROCK.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.608
IT'S A POTENTIALLY
PROSPEROUS HAUL.
