00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 Our perspective on the world around us is very much about our vision 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.980
 But how do you know if you really see it? 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.740
 Can you really trust your eyes? 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.680
 For example, these two rectangles are gray 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.780
 Each has a distinctive gray color. 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.020
 Or are they really? 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.120
 They seem to be exactly alike 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.980
 Even after you know there is a trick, your eyes refuse to see them as identical. 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 The color input causes the same result 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.880
 I swear no scams or modifications have been applied 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.720
 Fact, if you look at (they are white paint) munker-white illusion 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 You will find many examples 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.980
 Check them through Photoshop and you'll see that the colors are exactly the same 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.400
 A similar effect can be seen in this chessboard 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.060
 Box A appears to be significantly darker than B 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.300
 But you know more now, right? 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.740
 Though your eyes can not see it 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.980
 You know that when the surrounding image is removed 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.060
 The two blocks will be the same color 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.980
 So, what's going on here? 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.200
 The fact that scientists do not fully understand this phenomenon 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.140
 There are many complex biological factors 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.120
 And nerve agents occur during it 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.980
 At the end, our brain governs the colors and brightness by contrast 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 In other words, our brain compares the environment in an attempt to create our perspective 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 The goal of our senses or in this case our eyes 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.260
 Not providing us with absolute physical colors or physical properties of our external reality 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.460
 But explain what we see as effectively as possible 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.160
 In order to interact with our environment in the most appropriate way 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380
 The trick of the box takes advantage of this phenomenon 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.620
 Our brain knows that shadows make things seem darker 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.500
 As a result, the brain balances by making the box appear lighter than it is 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 Until we shave the shadow out 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 Perhaps the most obvious examples of this gradient 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.400
 Simply strip the middle of one color 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.720
 They were removed in the background and it would seem obvious 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.980
 Again, dark background effect on our perspective of the color of the tape 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.920
 Relative perspective 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 So, do you still trust your eyes ?! 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.620
 Have a question and you want to answer? 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.100
