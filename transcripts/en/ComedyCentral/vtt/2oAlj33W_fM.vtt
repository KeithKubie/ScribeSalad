- And I turn back
and I'm not kidding.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.075
The deer is up
on its back legs,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.544
like a man.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.180
It is chasing us like a man.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.382
- The baby's coming!
It's coming!

- This is a story about why
you shouldn't smoke pot

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.835
when you're ten years old.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.940
I was ten years old,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.910
and I come
from a large Italian family,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.812
and I'm one
of 21 grandchildren,

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:23.783
and when I was ten
we started having weddings,

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.519
because the older kids
were older

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.954
and starting to get married,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.655
so we started to go
to these weddings,

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:33.159
which, when you're ten,
is a pretty kick-ass party.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.662
Up to that point, you're going
to birthday parties

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.097
and you're just
eating cake

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.599
and you're pinning a tail
on a donkey,

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.169
and once you realize
everyone cheats anyway,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.439
the luster comes off and you're
like, "It's time to move on,"

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.674
but you've got
a ways to go

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.509
before some really good parties
come,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.345
and then the weddings
started kicking in,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.946
and we're like,
"This is good."

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.717
We're seeing grown-ups,
like, wasted,

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.885
and people are
falling over,

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.555
and we're seeing girls
we never saw before.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.156
These are good.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.992
And we noticed
that the older kids,

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.694
who we wanted
to hang out with desperately,

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:12.365
would all sneak out
of the wedding with Uncle Al.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:17.203
At some point in the wedding,
they'd just kind of sneak away,

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.704
And we never got asked,

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.174
and we were bummed out
'cause Uncle Al,

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:25.078
his nickname was
"Uncle Al, All the Kids' Pal."

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.381
And when you're ten
you think

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.416
it's just 'cause
he's fun to be with,

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.253
but the older kids were like,
"No, he's really your pal."

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.722
And we were like, "All right,
well, we--well, we want to go,

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:39.392
"like, how do we--
no one's asking us to go.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.726
What are they doing?

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.195
So this wedding came,
and we were like,

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.731
"All right, we gotta
up our game."

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:49.435
So we wore our little
ten-year-old businessman suits,

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.770
me and my cousin Kenny,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.039
and we had
our little Shirley Temples,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.707
and we're leaning
against the bar.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.843
We had combs in our pockets,

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.278
we were--we were--
we were working it.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.614
And pulling it off.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.049
Totally p--
just--

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.351
A Shirley Temple in your hand
when you're ten,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.254
using the straw.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.358
And our cousins, the two older
cousins we really admired,

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.227
they were looking at us
and they started laughing,

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.795
and we're like, "Oh,
maybe it's not gonna happen."

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.863
But then they approached
and they're like, "Hey,

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:20.799
you want to go outside
and see Uncle Al?"

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.868
We're like, "Yeah.
Yeah, we do.

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:24.303
Yeah, what do we do?"
They're like,

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.105
"Just go out front and
we'll meet you out there

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.807
and we'll take you over
and we'll go see Uncle Al."

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.542
We're like, "All right, cool."
And they split.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.910
And we start walking.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.278
And then my aunt comes up
and she's like,

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.946
"Where are you two going?"

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.248
We straighten our little ties.
We're like, "Uh, nowhere."

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:38.317
She's like, "Stay away
from your Uncle Al.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:41.287
He'll ruin your life."

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:50.396
And we're like,
"Now we really want to go."

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.999
So we walk outside,
and they take us to a car,

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.300
and Uncle Al is
sitting in the car.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.837
And they get in the car and
they don't let us in the car.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.805
They roll down the windows
and we lean in

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:01.274
with our little ties
hanging down,

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:03.109
and they put the window up
to like, catch us,

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.011
like, we're just stuck
in the car.

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:10.649
And Uncle Al has weed out
on his lap on a magazine.

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.085
I mean, I'm a man now.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.754
I am not ten.
I am a man.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.656
I have seen weed.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.958
I have--I went
to college.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.196
I-I used to see Dead shows.
I've seen weed.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.832
I'm a man.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.669
But to this day I never saw
one person have a bud

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.307
that was so big
as what Uncle Al had

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:38.611
on his lap
at his niece's wedding.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.812
And we didn't even know
it was weed.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.014
He just started
breaking it up.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.281
We thought they were
just gonna,

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.116
like, smoke a cigarette.
We didn't know.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.018
That was badass enough if you
were to just smoke anything.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:48.054
So he rolls it up
and they start smoking it,

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.022
and we're stuck
in the window.

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:53.025
They just start blowing it
in our faces

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:56.162
like we're a pet.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.297
Like, you ever get a pet high?
And you just blow it

00:04:58.297 --> 00:05:00.866
in their face,
and they kind of--

00:05:00.866 --> 00:05:02.702
We were the pets
in our little suits,

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.403
and they just--
blowing it on us,

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.072
and we're getting--
you know, we're not--

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.807
we don't know
we're getting high,

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.208
we're just trying to be cool,
and like, "Okay,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.845
guess this is what you do
with Uncle Al."

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.246
And they're done,
they roll down the window

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.015
and we kinda fall out
and they come out,

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.084
And I remember it was windy,
and Uncle Al's bald

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.818
except for the side hair,

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:23.222
and the wind is blowing and
his hair's all out like this,

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:26.859
and he just starts going,
"Look at me, I'm Bozo the Clown.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.929
I'm Bozo." He just starts
dancing around.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.532
And we're like, "This is why
everyone loves Uncle Al,

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.835
he's a clown."

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.703
He's amazing.

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:39.772
"So, like, all right, well,
you guys can't walk in with us.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.740
You guys gotta go
around the back. Be cool."

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.909
We're like, "All right.
We'll be cool."

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.011
And they walk in and
we walk around the back,

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.014
and as soon as we walk
around the back, we're lost,

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:51.451
'cause we're high,

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.086
and we're ten.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.454
We don't even remember

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:58.291
there's a wedding
we have to get back to.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:03.128
We're just wandering in our
little businessman attire,

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:04.597
and we come around the back,
and there's, like,

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.898
a golf course there
and there's these little woods.

00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:08.868
You know, like, little woods
in New Jersey.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.870
Probably three trees,
but woods.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.405
And there's a deer.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:14.974
There's a deer just sitting
there eating the grass.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.642
And if you've ever been high
in nature,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:21.079
you feel, for some reason,
like you're one with nature.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.048
Like, there is--
like, it speaks to you,

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.783
whatever it is,
a rock or an animal,

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.552
and this deer
just kind of looked at us,

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.722
and we looked at the deer and
then we looked at each other,

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.290
and made the decision
of what

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.427
two ten-year-old kids in Jersey
would decide,

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:38.263
which is,
"We've got to catch it."

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:40.967
Now, if you're a man and
you're in your business attire,

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.968
you don't just run
into the woods.

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:44.670
Even if it was
something great.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.074
If it was a bag of money,
you're like, "Let's change,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.976
and then we'll go back
and run into the woods,"

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.112
but when you're ten,
you just start running

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.147
in your businessman suit.

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.149
And the deer took off
and went into the woods,

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:58.851
we're in the woods,
and we're laughing.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.153
Now we're start--you know,
this is the first time ever.

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:03.989
Ten? First of all, everything's
funny when you're ten,

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:07.126
then get Uncle Al's crazy weed
on top,

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:11.830
and now you're chasing a deer
in the jungle.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.333
We're just laughing
our asses off.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:16.469
We go running in there,
the deer's, like, running,

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.137
and I turned to my cousin,
I'm like, "Kenny,

00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:21.941
"at what point--
like, if we catch it,

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.143
what do we do with it?"

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:26.879
And he just looks at me, like,
crazy, like, in his crazy eyes,

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.016
he goes,
"We're gonna eat it."

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:36.321
That's a disturbing thing
to hear your cousin say.

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.557
We don't have tools,
we don't have cooking--

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:41.127
we have nothing,
no weapons.

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.563
His idea is we're just
gonna start biting it

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.332
like another animal.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.701
But I couldn't even focus
on that because I'm looking--

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.469
I look over at the deer,
the deer,

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.706
it's like a New Jersey deer that
just heard what we were saying,

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:57.510
and he's stopped now and looking
at us like, "What did you say?

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.881
You're gonna eat me?"

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.349
And he takes a step
towards us,

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.751
and we're, like, laughing
and we take a step back.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.086
Then he takes two steps
towards us,

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:09.054
and we take
two more steps back.

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:11.223
And all of a sudden,
there's, like, that moment

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:14.993
where you know
you're under attack.

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:16.895
And we just start--
well, we're laughing.

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.397
Like, remember
when you were a kid,

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:21.533
you would be so filled with joy
sometimes with laughter

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:24.337
that your legs
physically don't work?

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.272
Like, that doesn't happen
as an adult.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:32.077
You never laugh so hard
that you can't even--

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:36.916
So picture
two little lawyers.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:40.686
Just--run--
[laughing]

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:44.423
So we got--
he's picking up speed.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.125
We gotta get outta here,
and--

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.427
I'm starting to get
a little further than Kenny,

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.596
and then I hear Kenny
let out a scream.

00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:53.198
Like, a high--
like, there's a reason

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:57.269
they put ten-year-old boys
in the choir,

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:00.472
because they can hit
a volume and a pitch

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:04.443
that only angels can hit.
It's a--it's higher than girls.

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.445
It's a--
[high-pitched scream]

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.113
So much higher
than I can even do.

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:09.314
[high-pitched squeal]

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.783
In the woods,
and I hear that scream,

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:15.487
it's fear and
it's just, like, death

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:18.223
and angelic
and I'm laughing,

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:20.293
and I turn back,
and I'm not kidding,

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:23.061
The deer is
up on its back legs,

00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:25.764
like a man.

00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:29.068
It is chasing us
like a man.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.238
I come in with my scream.

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:36.341
[high-pitched squeal]

00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:39.144
Our suits,
our little businessman suits,

00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:43.248
and this thing is
just coming at us.

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:47.153
Like, "You're not eating me."

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.454
We just gotta get
outta the woods.

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:50.355
We just gotta get the hell
outta the woods.

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:51.957
And we kind of make our way--
it's like,

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:53.592
he could have,
like, attacked us,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:55.627
but in his head, like,
if I could read a deer's mind,

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:58.330
which when I was that high
I kind of did.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.533
He was like, "I'm just gonna
scare these little guys.

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:06.505
"These are the smallest
businessmen I've ever seen.

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.173
"I don't even know
why they're in the woods,

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:10.309
"but I'm just gonna do
the back leg thing

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.878
and get 'em out of here."

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.681
[high-pitched scream]

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.716
So we make our way out
of the woods, we're crawling,

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:20.885
we're mud-covered, we're crying,
we're not laughing anymore.

00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:23.556
We're crying.
We're lost.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:26.559
And we see up, "Oh, there's
the windows of the party,

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:30.028
of the wedding, and we come up
and we're just, like, so out--

00:10:30.028 --> 00:10:31.997
we're--like,
we are wrecked.

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:33.665
I don't know what--
I don't--

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:38.504
I don't know I'm high,
but I know this is a weird day.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.739
This is a day
I'm gonna remember.

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:43.308
I don't know what
they blew in our faces,

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:45.378
but I don't want to be
at a wedding,

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:48.413
I don't want to be
a businessman.

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:52.385
I don't want to hunt deer
with my face.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.521
We see Uncle Al,
he's in there

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.055
in the middle
of all the parents,

00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:59.258
and he's telling
some animated story

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.160
and they're all looking
really pissed off.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.528
And he's laughing
with his Bozo hair.

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:04.763
And we're like,
"We can't"--

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:06.565
we gotta sit down
and catch our breath,

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:08.167
and we sit
on these lounge chairs

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.835
and we're just like,
"We are wrecked."

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.103
And all of a sudden my aunt,
the same aunt, comes--

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:14.273
I remember the sky was blue,
and then all--

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:15.607
we're just finally
chilling out,

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:17.442
it was just peaceful
for a minute,

00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:20.246
and then her face just came
in the middle of that scene

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.713
and went,
"What did I tell you?

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:25.551
Your uncle's in there
ruining your life."

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:30.622
And we never got high again
until, uh, we were 11.

00:11:30.622 --> 00:11:32.624
Thank you guys so much.
