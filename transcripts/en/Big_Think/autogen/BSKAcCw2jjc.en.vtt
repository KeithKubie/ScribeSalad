of these factors probably drove the

you're copying it by hand staying up
 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.949
you're copying it by hand staying up
late at night and you're very very

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959
late at night and you're very very
 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.420

careful but occasionally you're going to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430
careful but occasionally you're going to

often at the genetic level they're

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310
often at the genetic level they're
 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.890
often at the genetic level they're
called mutations when they do occur and

called mutations when they do occur and

they've become markers of descent and

they've become markers of descent and

that's how we place people into these

that's how we place people into these

that's how we place people into these
lineages so again if you share one of

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359
lineages so again if you share one of
 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.179

these markers with someone you share an

change in their DNA now because we know

the rate at which they occur by looking

the rate at which they occur by looking
 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.110
the rate at which they occur by looking
at the number of changes that have

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
at the number of changes that have
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.969
at the number of changes that have
accumulated on a lineage we can estimate

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979
accumulated on a lineage we can estimate
 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.939
accumulated on a lineage we can estimate
the age of that lineage and by comparing

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949
the age of that lineage and by comparing
 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.159
the age of that lineage and by comparing
the distribution of the lineage two

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169
the distribution of the lineage two

period of time give us an insight into

their ancestors genetic patterns by

their ancestors genetic patterns by
 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.219
their ancestors genetic patterns by
looking at the distribution in those

looking at the distribution in those

actually map where it originated and how

actually map where it originated and how

actually map where it originated and how
it spread around the planet
