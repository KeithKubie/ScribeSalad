1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,060
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,860
It's bill burn his time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday. Uh,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,240
June 25th, 2018 what's going on? Oh, whoa.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,100
Yo, how you doing? How are you doing with
the summer? The summer's here, right?

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,160
We're in the, we're in the twenties
of June. Somewhere along the lines.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,960
The first day of summer, you know, back
in the day you used to know it, right?

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,490
Because there wasn't as many channels
and you would watch the local news and

8
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,210
they'd bring it up. Today's the
first day of summer. Tell us, Jack,

9
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:37,830
what can people look forward to weather
wise? While I'll tell you a bike.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,930
We got a low pressure system.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,640
[inaudible] don't inflate those
fucking above ground pools. Yes. Yep.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,880
Um, and then they'd laugh for no
reason. Your weekend's going to suck.

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,940
Um, anyways, uh, it's gotta be a
summertime, right? To fucking son's out.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,170
There you go right there.
Global warming. Um,

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,130
what'd you do this weekend?
I have a couple of cores.

16
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,210
Like that's this generation's Budweiser.
Right? Cause like they're crushing it.

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,570
You know,
Peyton Manning's fucked up.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,420
You notice the second Peyton
manning fucking bought Budweiser.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,990
Now it's second place. You
know, you didn't buy it.

20
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,000
He bought into it the
second he fucking got it.

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,650
I bet he started pointing fingers
at everybody. You know, we, we, we,

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,280
we had some hops issues,
right. And all of a sudden,

23
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,430
nobody's getting along over there.
And of course life now cause lights ahead.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,590
Right? I Bet Tom Brady invested in
course light. Sorry. Why would I do this?

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,710
I like Peyton manning now
that he's retired. You know,

26
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,360
I could look back and be like,
you know what?

27
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,730
That fellow was said quite a quarterback,

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,490
but when they're playing against your
team, you hate him. It's stupid. You know,

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,800
you don't hate them. You just
hate him. It's weird. Um,

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,720
anyways,
uh,

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,510
the summers here I am back
from vacay shawl and a,

32
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm getting ready this weekend. Oh,
freckles. Shaking off the cobwebs.

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,820
I'm going to be in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, in Detroit,

34
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,820
Michigan. Okay. Couple, uh,
Joe, six pack towns. You know,

35
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,830
where they put their pets
on one leg at a thought. Uh,

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,660
looking forward to that and a,

37
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,630
so I'm going to be around
La doing a bunch of spots,

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,670
shaking off the dust among the
elliptical work enough to Crosol

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,620
panel shock a lot. I never
had any of those, you know,

40
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,510
my wife's into those
fucking things. I, I like,

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,000
I like the plain old
boring white guy croissant.

42
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,500
I don't need any flavor.
Uh,

43
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,840
anyways. Oh my God. Um,

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,120
I don't want to talk about this early on,
but I have to out of respect, uh, to sad,

45
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,910
sad, sad, sad day. Uh, the passing of

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,650
the Great Vinnie Paul,
um,

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,160
drummer of obviously Pantera damage
blend and hell yeah, good Lord.

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,200
What a, what a loss. Can't even,
can't even put it into words.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,180
And I was lucky enough to meet him.

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,470
He was a big comedy fan and I
remember the first time I met him,

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,920
I was opening for the
late Great Charlie Murphy.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,950
This is what happens when you get older.

53
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,040
Like half of your stories is like pap
the people in a moment like fucking dead.

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,520
It's sucks. Um, but anyways, yeah, me,

55
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:32,560
Charlie and don l or on tour.
And we did the Addison Improv

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,420
and, uh, I remember that that was one of
those shows, one of the few times I ever,

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,390
I went over without even realizing it.
I always knew when I was going over,

58
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,000
but I did like 40 minutes and
I was supposed to like 25.

59
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,900
It just one of those stages where
there was talking and I don't know what

60
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:50,740
happened and, um,
Charlie was cool with it,

61
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,740
but I was embarrassed
because I never do that shit.

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,090
And it's a real country thing to
do and it's something, you know,

63
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,240
makes the headliners job more difficult
because you ate up all of that extra

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,030
time where an amount and
all of that shit. So, uh,

65
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,510
I do remember that from that weekend,
but one of those shows,

66
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,340
it wasn't the show when
I went over, but, uh,

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,810
I was standing after
the show selling my cds.

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,790
This is how long ago this was. It
was right around, uh, was 2004.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,360
His brother was still alive.
Um,

70
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,610
and I was just standing there
and I just looked up and he,

71
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,080
and he was standing right there.
Finney fucking Paul. And, you know,

72
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,850
it wasn't like he was Vinnie Paul
offstage. He just was Vinnie Paul.

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,360
He had the fucking cowboy hat on,
you know,

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,010
this shirt with flames on it and shit,
these crazy cowboy boots.

75
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,400
And he was just standing there with a big
smile on his face. And I was just like,

76
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,040
oh, I mean this guy, he's like, guys
saw on the cover of modern drummer.

77
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:52,450
I couldn't believe it. I was like, I was
like, Holy Shit, you fucking Vinny Foley.

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,320
He just started laughing and you know,

79
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,890
was super complimentary
about the show and all that.

80
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,850
And then he invited us out. Uh,
he had his own club out there,

81
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,350
gentleman's club,

82
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,640
then we all went out there
and he was nice enough,

83
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,670
I actually sat with him in
his club for like 45 minutes,

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
like a total drum nerd and asked
them all of these questions about,

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,820
um, drum parts that he
did. And, and, um, like,

86
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,560
who were the guys that he listened
to? And, uh, and you know,

87
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,401
I asked, I was like, you know,

88
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,280
who do you think only one
of the underrated drummers
out there? And he was like,

89
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, Alex van Halen, you know, and
we went, went on and on about him.

90
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,970
And it's kind of ironic because I really
feel that Vinnie and Dimebag worthy,

91
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,860
Eddie and Alex, I should say Alex and
Eddie of their generation. And um,

92
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,320
it just sucks man. He was just such
a nice guy. And then after that, uh,

93
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,830
he probably came out to two or
three other shows and he always was,

94
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,000
always was just the greatest,
nicest guy. And, um,

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,921
it's,
I don't know,

96
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,920
one of the reasons why I never got into
double bass playing was because so many

97
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:11,210
people, I just felt like once,
like they all live, fills,

98
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,600
everything was just the,
their fucking feet in their hands stunk.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,570
And it didn't groove. It just was going
nine zillion miles an hour. And, you know,

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,480
it was impressive to look at,
but it didn't, it didn't give me,

101
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,580
the chills did make me want to do it.

102
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,870
And he was a guy that changed that.
And I,

103
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:34,790
when I listened to him play,
um, my younger brothers
who were independent, Tara,

104
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,290
I fucked up. I never saw
him. Um, a member, one of my
brothers went to go see him,

105
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,350
was telling me how amazing the show is.
But to be honest with you, like I, I just,

106
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,750
you know,
concerts with different,

107
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,751
back then you could get fucked up at
a concert and there was no cell phone

108
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:54,110
footage, you just got fucked up and that
was it. And there was like mosh pits.

109
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,630
Like it just, it had changed
and I got a little bit older.

110
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,800
I was in my mid twenties,

111
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:01,820
basically when they came around and I had
already started doing standup and shit.

112
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,560
And um, you know, I remember
going to a couple of, uh,

113
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:11,090
you know, concerts like ACDC and shit
and people were doing blow and it was,

114
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,100
you know, it was a little
fucking, you know, there was,

115
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,410
you had to be like a certain level of
fucked up just so you could stay relaxed

116
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,240
so you could kind of navigate it,
you know what I mean?

117
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,870
You couldn't be sitting there looking
fucking nervous. And I want, you know,

118
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,260
and that was just like ACTC,
which was always like a fun show.

119
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:31,490
So like put this pan, Tara came in, it
was a new level of aggression and anger.

120
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,210
Certainly, you know, with Phil singing,
I had never heard anything like that.

121
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,160
And um, you know, just the way I was just,

122
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,560
I just had this feeling my, I
was, I was too afraid I was,

123
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm like fucking got to go down there,

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,200
my fucking orange hair trying to grow it
out and it just gets bigger and bigger

125
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,140
and it looked like Bernie from
room to 22 and there's a mosh pit,

126
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:51,974
I'm going to get the Sh,

127
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,550
you know how I always got over with people
was making them laugh and the show is

128
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,810
going to be too fucking loud.

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,950
So if they would just kind of look
at me the way I looked, I mean, I,

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,060
I just felt like it
wasn't going to go well.

131
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,350
So I was a fan from afar and I really
fucked up by not seeing those guys.

132
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,400
And um, I remember when Vinny came down
on the show, he said, hey, you know,

133
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,900
I got this, this new, uh, this new
band. I think it was. Yeah, it was,

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,580
it was damaged plan. He said would play in
New York. And he said, he goes, he goes,

135
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,230
I'll hook you up. I said,
really? He said, dude, he goes,

136
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:28,490
you can fucking stand right
behind me while I play the
whole show. And of course,

137
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,440
um, I had some fucking road
gig when they came to town.

138
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:38,330
I think Florentine went cause I remember
talking to him about it and I was so

139
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:41,120
fucking envious that he got
to go and I didn't get to go.

140
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,230
So I never saw him play
live. But, um, you know,

141
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,670
since doing that Dean del ratio or I had
to learn how to play a butcher the song

142
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,890
, but I tried to learn how to play
that song by Molly crew livewire,

143
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,830
which had the double bass, you know,
basic thing in there. Since then,

144
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,480
I've just kinda gotten addicted to it.

145
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,480
And I was listening to all of the pan
terrorists stuff in a whole nother like

146
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,430
level and um,
you know,

147
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:12,000
cowboys from Hell and fucking, um, um,

148
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,550
broken and this love,
just loving the,

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,360
the drum parts are just so
fucking perfect in all of those.

150
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,200
And I was just talking,

151
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:24,180
I was talking to my drum teacher
literally that day of how great, um,

152
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,200
Vinnie Paul was, um, with his work in
that band and, and then like, fuck,

153
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,490
it was so weird that night.
Then all of a sudden I got that text,

154
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,630
I couldn't fucking believe
it. And I'm Super Sad. But,

155
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,900
um,
I don't know.

156
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:44,550
Like the only good thing I could say is
the got the mark that the guy left his,

157
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:49,470
he, he won't be forgotten. And obviously
his brother hasn't been. So anyways,

158
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,820
that's my little,

159
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
my little point of view on a truly one
of the great artists that I ever heard of

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,370
or got to, I don't know, listen to
whatever hang out with or anything. So,

161
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,350
so that sucks. And that's sad. So I don't
know where the fuck to go from here.

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,910
How do you, how do you turn it
back to being funny? You know? Um,

163
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,390
can I talk about the Germans playing
the Swedes in the fucking, uh,

164
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,710
do they play Sweden? Is that
what it was at by the, the,

165
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:22,260
the shirts for the same colors if
flagged. So, um, I always fucked that up.

166
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,500
Sweden and Switzerland because
I'm an American and we never,

167
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,220
they never taught us geography like that.

168
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:30,150
And I remember one time I did a
Gig in Sweden and I said, hey,

169
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,950
it's great to be here in Switzerland.

170
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,360
And they all laughed thinking I was
joking and I honestly fucked it up and I

171
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:39,540
just rolled with it. I was just
like, Hey, just fucking with you.

172
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,650
They both start with sw, but I did
that the whole, thank you Cleveland.

173
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,010
Whatever the fuck it
was a spinal tap thing.

174
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,710
I gotta get back there.
I haven't done, um,

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,040
what would you call that? Hitler's ranch
up there. Norway, Sweden and Finland.

176
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,400
All those places when he used to look
across the was at the Baltic Sea.

177
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:05,100
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It's just looked across that water.

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,900
They're on disaster is what
people should look like. Yeah.

179
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,930
Frolicking in the garage. Um, anyways,

180
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,640
um, fellow swing, did
you know, they, they,

181
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,000
they were noncommittal a World War II
ended up being a great fucking move.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Not socially. It wasn't a good move, but
it was a great fucking move financially.

183
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,770
Cause just for the fact that they were
still standing after World War II and

184
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:34,320
never got bombed, you
know, let the, let the,

185
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,910
let the crowds fucking use their
trades that go into Norway. Um,

186
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,680
they stood there, they're
fucking Applebee's was
still open at the end of it,

187
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:48,480
you know? So, I mean, I, if I guess
you can learn something from Sweden

188
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,311
when,

189
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:55,311
when shit is hitting the fan and you
need to stand up and make a stand,

190
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,860
don't let other people do it.
Just kind of sit back and see who wins it.

191
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,590
Add a carry on.

192
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,790
Anyways, so the Swedes have
play in Germany. All right.

193
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,730
I'm mostly German,
so I usually root for Germany.

194
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,603
MMM.

195
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,080
But whatever. Or I just root for
an underdog like Iceland. I mean,

196
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:23,960
I ain't fucking roof Iceland and
Poland and shit like that. You know,

197
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm rooting for all any anybody other
than the powerhouses that always seem to

198
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,730
be in and I don't know shit
about soccer, so this is, boy,

199
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,260
it's going to make it funny.
But anyway,

200
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:37,720
so I'm watching this fucking game
and this Swedish dude, right? Yeah.

201
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,170
He's on a fucking break away. Once
you going, God, he's all alone.

202
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,140
Right. And then there's Jay guy
in the German team, a black dude,

203
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,970
which is hilarious. You know what I
mean? I was always just sitting like,

204
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,530
like how conflicted would
Hitler be Germany one,

205
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:58,120
but the lots of foods is that outsell.
Um,

206
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,030
okay.

207
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,010
He comes down and goes to not
only went to like trip the guy,

208
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,873
he also cut,

209
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:11,210
like just pushed him from behind and
like a fucking referee and the WWE,

210
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:17,380
somehow this guy didn't see it. I mean, I,

211
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,480
I think it happened in the box,
in the painted area,

212
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,370
whatever the fuck they
call it in that sport.

213
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:26,630
And I think that that should've just
been one of those fucking penalty kicks

214
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,740
with a goalie.
Just dives and guesses one side.

215
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,780
Um, but anyways, the Swedes ended up going
up one nothing than Germans tied it up.

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,700
And then this guy, he did the old bend.
It like Beckham. You did the old fucking,

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,230
uh, around about there. I don't know
how to talk about the sport. Uh,

218
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,620
but I gotta tell you something.
I actually,

219
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,970
I love making fun of soccer, but I have
to watch it. No, didn't make fun of it.

220
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:56,040
And now having watched it,
I'm actually,

221
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,090
I kind of love it now and I kind of
understand the beauty of the game.

222
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,580
Finally.
I'm starting to get it.

223
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,560
And it is really cool that it is so
hard to score that when it happens that

224
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,920
people absolutely lose their
fucking minds. So I am on board.

225
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,540
I'm going to continue to make fun of it.

226
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,520
I had it on in the
background and you know,

227
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,630
I had like fucking two weeks a male
here that I was going through and um,

228
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,260
and I,

229
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,700
the amount of times that I just kept
looking over at the TV because he knows

230
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,170
he'd be like,

231
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,430
I already fucking, yeah. Oh,

232
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,020
oh,

233
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,450
he's going to be shit.

234
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,340
So I was sitting at the table
going like, oh my God, hey,

235
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,950
something almost happened. That's
what it just seemed like. Um,

236
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,580
okay.

237
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,030
But it really is a great game. Uh, GI
bill. Yeah. You really, uh, you know, you,

238
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,020
the rest of the world is right, Bill.
And you might be wrong on this one. Um,

239
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
but I missed it today.

240
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:01,361
A good friend of mine wrote in a Protean
sent me a text and I'm in podcast mode.

241
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:05,430
She sent me a text message and
asked me if I had saw the, um,

242
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,570
England played today.
I guess they played a great game.

243
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,340
And I heard Mexico had a pretty
scrappy game with the Koreans.

244
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,400
I heard it was getting a little nasty.
They're like, the Koreans would desperate.

245
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:19,580
Like, we don't give a fuck. You know,
we can't score unless we have the ball.

246
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,260
And uh, you know, I guess
Mexico's fast. That's what I know.

247
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,210
And I promise you this week I'm going to
neglect all my responsibilities and I'm

248
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,430
going to try to watch some of this
shit cause uh, it is, it is fun.

249
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,710
Go once every four years,

250
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,600
the entire world gets together to play
for an actual world championship is

251
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:42,320
pretty, that's pretty sick. You know,
I just wish I could use their hands.

252
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,490
You just see that one Connie
fucking jumped over the
guy and accidentally kicked

253
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:49,130
him in the face.
I mean that's gotta be like,

254
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:50,980
yeah,

255
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,170
kicking a guy on the ground in the face,

256
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,740
in the realm of like losing
your man card forever.

257
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,830
Like who fucked,
who does that?

258
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,170
Yeah.

259
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,180
With your shoes on,
Alicia could be barefoot,

260
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:06,200
so maybe make you foot
staying a little bit. Um,

261
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,450
I would be so disappointed
if I had a fucking son and
he ended up playing soccer.

262
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:13,260
First of all, I'd be happy for his brain,
but you know, if that's what he did,

263
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,850
you're going to frolic down the field
and jump in the air like some baby deer

264
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:23,160
and then kick somebody
in the face. Um, no,

265
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:23,921
only the guy does.

266
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:26,690
He takes out a yellow card to hit the
way they take it out and the guy just

267
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,470
stands up in front of the guy,
the stupid thing up in the air,

268
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:34,150
like he's bidding on a
fucking Shelby. Um, anyways,

269
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,700
congratulations to anybody
who won a, I got to get into
it. Sorry. I did watch the,

270
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,160
uh, the F one. Finally I was in town.
I got to watch her watch the French GP.

271
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,900
Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

272
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,550
Max for stabbing was fucking hilarious
in the press conference afterwards. Uh,

273
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,840
cause federal slammed into botox back.
She's going, you know, I think he needs,

274
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,170
you guys should tell him he needs to
adjust his style because they would given

275
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,780
Max Shit, you know, beginning of the
year, I forget. He took out his own teeth,

276
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:08,170
took out a, what's his face there? Um,

277
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,930
Daniel Ricardo and they gave
them all this shit. This does,

278
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:13,060
he need to adjust his style.

279
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,310
All these fucking assholes
who don't drive for a living.

280
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,070
So he was trashing all of them
going, you should tell Vettel. Yeah,

281
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,070
you should tell him he needs to adjust
his style and then he shouldn't adjusted

282
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,370
at all the way I didn't adjust my style
and now here I sit three races in a row

283
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,760
or whatever on the fucking podium.
You fucking cunts Kimmy regulated.

284
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,780
They kept bringing up the,

285
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:36,781
this is his 25th to 26 podium
without wedding or race.

286
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,690
It's like this cause fucking
Lewis Hamilton went because
Louis had was something

287
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,670
my kids sleeping. It's cause fucking
Lewis Hamilton winds every God damn week.

288
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,310
Okay.
That's like giving somebody shit.

289
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:51,810
Who played when Michael Jordan was at the
height, his powers. He never got a ring.

290
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,770
Nobody got a ring. You know, I've got
to ring Elijah. One would fucking,

291
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,730
Jordan was playing basketball and then
when he was a little out of shape the

292
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,260
next year, other than that,
everybody got shut the fuck down.

293
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,930
All right. That's what happens.
So what, what, what needs
to happen is the next, uh,

294
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,240
the next street great driver has to
come around. And also for one of my,

295
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,320
what I little know about this sport is
they got fucking get with either Mercedes

296
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,210
of Ferrari,
basically Mercedes,

297
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:26,100
it seems to have the fastest car out
there. Cause I think, what's this?

298
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,800
I think Daniel Ricardo's gonna fucking,
he's going to jump somewhere, right?

299
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,300
That's what they said. Um, by like both
those drives. Hey and I'll put the yanks.

300
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,490
How'd the Americans will
be in like six to seventh?

301
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,910
We've got some points and our gray cars

302
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,680
are overcast cars. Um,
what else did I do here?

303
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,930
Oh, I get back on my fucking
diet. This has been tough.

304
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,370
It's been tough to get back on the Diet.

305
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,790
I felt the cakes I fucking
eat over in France, you know,

306
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,210
had a couple of slip ups.
But at back to the keen wa

307
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,650
I'm hitting the elliptical.
Oh God.

308
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:04,950
The first two minutes of getting on
the elliptical at my age, Jesus Christ.

309
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,800
After that I just kind of
go numb and then it's fine.

310
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,940
I listen to my fucking songs
and then it's over. But, um,

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,840
I finally got the shoulder thing B and uh,
I have,

312
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,400
I think I have to join a
gym though because in order
to rehab my shoulder where

313
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:23,460
I can do pull ups again,
I got to do those,

314
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,320
those fucking lat pull downs with like
20 pounds and then 30 and work my way up

315
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:32,670
to my body weight and then I can attempt
to do like a pull up because what I did

316
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,260
last time when I rehabbed it was I then
got these like those help or bands,

317
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,700
you know, that you stand on and make the
pull up easier. But I was still, you know,

318
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,380
trying to pull up,
you know,

319
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,680
9,100 pounds with the weight and I
fucking Jack my shoulder against,

320
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:50,580
so I get to do what I don't want to do.
I've got to go join a fucking gym,

321
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:54,330
so I got to find a local
gym, not a fucking, uh,

322
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,490
a chain one.

323
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,460
Cause those are the ones that they get
your credit card and then you can't

324
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,970
fucking get out of it.
Ever tell you that Tamar went to Bally's.

325
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,460
I joined Bally's and there was
like trying to fucking lead AOL.

326
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,770
He just couldn't do it. They go,
okay, send in a $100 cancellation fee.

327
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,270
And then I sent it in and then they
go, oh yeah, yeah. But there's another,

328
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,960
there's another gym within
like a five mile radius.

329
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,370
So you can't cancel like, oh, and
I was to put the fucking, you just,

330
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:30,450
you just took $100 from me. I should have
sued the fucking shit out of him. And I,

331
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,480
and I didn't. So I just didn't
pay him. I just, you know, I did,

332
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:38,070
I cancelled the credit card. That
was the only way up. And it was,

333
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,590
it was quiet for months.
I didn't hear from anybody.

334
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:44,030
And then all of a sudden this collection
agency called me up. He was like, yeah,

335
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,160
and can I use William Bernie here, please.
[inaudible] Mike this, hey. They're like,

336
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:51,730
Hey, this is showing show from the
show and show collection agency. Uh,

337
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,450
we bought your debt from Bally's total
fitness and would like to discuss it with

338
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:59,260
you. And I just just like, well, I don't
know what the hell you did that for.

339
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,690
You know, I didn't pay them. What,
what the hell, but why would I pay you?

340
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,800
I don't even know you,

341
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,003
you know,

342
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,980
this is your business.

343
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,300
You actually earn a
living doing this shit,

344
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:19,160
buying debt that other
people can't fucking collect.
And then, so she was like,

345
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:22,770
you know, giving me Shit, telling me I
had to click. I'm not doing it. You know,

346
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,610
I go, I go, I have perfect credit.
I've paid everything. Okay.

347
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:30,611
I really don't think that someday in
the future when I go to buy a house,

348
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,230
they're going to be like, you know
what? We really want to let you know,

349
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:36,410
give you a couple of hundred
thousand dollars a loan here,

350
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:40,550
but you owe $300 to a gym.
And she's like, oh my God.

351
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,260
You know, we just had a client who just
called us up and said, please, please,

352
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,350
please, I have to pay off. You know,

353
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,300
this $400 that I owe you
because I'm trying to buy a
house and they won't let me.

354
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,910
And I was like, wow. I
go, that's incredible.

355
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,480
That's almost the exact same scenario
that I just presented to you.

356
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,880
It's almost like you made it up.
Right.

357
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:06,080
And then she got fucking mad at me and
then I just started hitting on her and

358
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:09,410
she started saying it was harassment and
I just gay. How old are you? You know,

359
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,770
you live around here, you know, you
got a boyfriend right thing. And she,

360
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,600
she ended up page. She got so
mad, she hung up on me. You know,

361
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,350
I'll probably get me to get over that.

362
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,580
And ever since then I've
been afraid of the phone.

363
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:27,740
Every tiny rings when shake

364
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,530
my cell phone's always on styling.

365
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,310
Um,
anyways,

366
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,020
what do we got 22 minutes in here?
Is it time to fucking say? And,

367
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,550
and you know what I gotta admit, they
just kept harassing me, harassing me.

368
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:47,040
I just got sick of it. It was only
300 bucks, so I just fucking paid him.

369
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,420
And,
um,

370
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,710
I shouldn't have, there's a couple people
that I shouldn't have paid and I did,

371
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:59,030
but I just, I didn't like
the, uh, the stress, you know,

372
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,760
I couldn't put it into perspective and I
just got sick of them calling me and I,

373
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,230
you know, I had fun with them. Shit.

374
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,163
Okay.

375
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,110
Hitting on them or are saying that I'd
gotten into some horrible accident.

376
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,330
That was another big one that I just said.

377
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,240
I don't know how many times I have to
tell you I lost my leg in a car accident.

378
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,660
What kind of Pete went? Oh my God, sir.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, are you,

379
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,760
this is like the third time.

380
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:27,500
I'm literally sitting here right now with
my stump elevated so I don't bleed out

381
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,250
because the sutures have come loose
again and here you are harassing.

382
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,630
This is what you do. And then they
would, you know, it was that thing. Um,

383
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,760
and I just ran out of ways
to have fun with them.

384
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,793
Uh,

385
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,350
and then I, I think I just finally
fucking paid him. Okay. Yeah,

386
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:48,370
I've done that a couple of times.

387
00:23:48,371 --> 00:23:52,660
I gotta fucking landlord that stole
from my apartment or manage your stuff.

388
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:56,500
My pubs on the road and I came back and
uh, was on the road for three weeks.

389
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,940
I was on the road for so
long when I came back,

390
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,190
like most of the water had
evaporated on the toilet

391
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,760
and they had this check the smoke alarm.

392
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:07,070
So legally they could go into my
apartment when I wasn't there without my

393
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,350
consent because if there was a fire
it could affect the other units.

394
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,140
That's what they said. And uh,

395
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,200
all of a sudden I noticed
there was a camera missing.

396
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:19,370
They picked through my cds
was a hip hop fan. And um,

397
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,420
so I went down and I talked to the guy
about it thinking that the manager was

398
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,990
going to be like, oh my God sir, we got
to get to the bottom of this. Agent says,

399
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,720
I don't appreciate you coming
down to exceed you accusing me.

400
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,760
And he started saying all this shit,
I have the power.

401
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:36,230
He kept saying I have the power. So it
was like, oh yeah, you got the power.

402
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,060
I buddy. And I just stood outside the
office in anytime anybody new came.

403
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:44,270
I stood out to you for two hours. I was
like, yeah, don't run from these people.

404
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,680
They, uh, they stole from my apartment
and all that. That's just like, dude,

405
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm a comedian.
I can do this all day.

406
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,000
I will be down here
every single fucking day.

407
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,720
And it was bullshit because the next
day I went on the road and I just,

408
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,820
I just didn't have it in me and um,
I should have get a,

409
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,990
hey, come on in here. The
lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh,

410
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,500
we will know. Come here. Okay.

411
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,900
What's going on? No, I
was just talking to them,

412
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,540
Bob collection agencies and all of that
type of stuff and all the crap I've gone

413
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:24,830
through. Um, I haven't had a lot of that
stuff, but you know, David's, I that I,

414
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,230
that time that woman called me up, they
know, knows bally total fitness and they,

415
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,460
and I just started hitting on her and she
got mad at me, said it was harassment.

416
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:36,830
I ended up, I ended up getting
her to hang out those up on me.

417
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,030
There was like the highlight. What's
the matter with you? I as Amazon,

418
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,070
they might teeth. Oh,
you do? Um, all right,

419
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,990
well I got to like
another 35 minutes here.

420
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,160
I'm just gonna read some advertising and
I got some great questions from people

421
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,260
this week.
All right.

422
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,240
Do you want to go get some floss instead
of just staring at me with the lick

423
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,060
your fingers in your mouth.
Oh, is that not sexy? Huh?

424
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,460
You know what? Sexy to me. You
know, it's sexy to me at my age.

425
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:09,230
Eight hours sleep that, that turns me
on. All right. All right. Listen to you.

426
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:11,090
I'd love to talk to you
while you pick your teeth.

427
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:14,270
I got to keep the momentum going.
Here we have floss.

428
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,350
You think you can get your fingers
between your teeth? Get out of here.

429
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,120
I got it. There you go.
Tenacity. Oh, we got to know a,

430
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,770
yeah. Okay. All right. Here we go. Jesus.

431
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,530
They always want to go somewhere.
You know what I mean?

432
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,040
He wants to fucking house and then you
get a one and then only want to do is

433
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,400
leave. Yeah. Boy,

434
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,770
fucking believable. I, when is the,

435
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,080
when is the guy me too thing going to
fucking happen. You know what I mean?

436
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,200
Reverse me too. You know, I take a lot of
these feminists a little more seriously.

437
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:54,960
If they ever bitched about something
that didn't affect their life,

438
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,770
you know what I mean? Yeah.
We need to fix, let me guess.

439
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:02,430
Something that affects you
is self centered. Fucking

440
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,860
um, all right, let's uh,
let's move on here. Oh,

441
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,030
and then I'm going to tell you about this,

442
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,190
this music festival I went to yesterday.

443
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,510
Definitely feeling my
age at a music festival.

444
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,350
Just having to stand standing too long.

445
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:23,620
Throws out my back at this
point. I know. It's my posture.

446
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:27,740
I don't need all you non
doctors out there. Just save
me. You're fucking remedies.

447
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,600
All right. All right. Oh, here's
something from a friend of mine. Um,

448
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,551
a buddy of mine,

449
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:38,020
he actually died a
couple years ago and uh,

450
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,840
his widow is trying to finish
a project that he started,

451
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:47,370
which is a really great idea. It's called
the, uh, the untold legends of hip hop.

452
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,870
And my buddy Pete coming rest his soul.

453
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,930
He was out there interviewing all of
these legends from the early days of a rap

454
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:03,340
music. Curtis blow, Russell
Simmons spliffs star.

455
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,330
And I say that right. Um, and he,

456
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,270
they would do these two minute little
stories talking about the early days of

457
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:15,430
hip hop and then they were animating it
and I saw some of the clips in it looked

458
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:19,540
fucking incredible and they
want to finish this thing. Um,

459
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,650
so they have a startup.
If you're a fan of hip hop music,

460
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:26,830
animation and all that stuff, just cool
stuff you'd like to learn about music.

461
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,750
The way I do the website is halo boost,

462
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,230
h a l o B o s t.com.

463
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,910
And uh, the project is the
untold legends of hip hop.

464
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,650
People can go to halo boosts and click
on the featured project and then you go

465
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:45,860
to the untold legends of hip hop campaign.
They donate a dollar,

466
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:49,340
whatever you can do to try and get
this thing made. It's a really,

467
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:51,770
really cool project.
And um,

468
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,860
from one of the great people that I've
met in this business. MMM, okay. I'll,

469
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,050
I'll definitely retweet the Lincoln, all
that type of stuff, so I appreciate it.

470
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:02,900
You know, if you're, you know, if you're
into it, I'm not, it's no pressure here.

471
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,310
All right. All right, here we go.
Ah, butcher box. Everybody. Ah,

472
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,650
these guys, these guys, these
guys know what they're doing here.

473
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,490
Put your box delivers healthy.

474
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:17,491
100% grass fed and grass
finished beef free range.

475
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,240
Yeah. Range. Organic chicken

476
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,980
and heritage breed pork
bread, bread, pork. Yeah.

477
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,430
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment of

478
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:33,431
raising animals humanely before they
kill them and free of antibiotics and

479
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:34,850
hormones.
I gotta tell you something.

480
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,360
I can not say enough about
their heritage breed pork.

481
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,460
You got to get it all right.
You to do it in a skillet.

482
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,550
Sear it on both sides.
Finish the finish to the other.

483
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,890
Come out a little fucking
garlic butter bath.

484
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,250
I don't give a fuck where your
wife wants to go the next day.

485
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:55,690
You're gonna have a smile on your face.
It is fucking delish.

486
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,500
Each box comes with at least
nine to 11 pounds of meat,

487
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,620
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

488
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,090
You can choose from five different box
types. I swear to God, this was around,

489
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:10,180
there'd be, you know, back in the day that
there would've been no Jeffrey Dahmer,

490
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,160
all beef beef and chicken, beef
and pork, mixed pork custom box.

491
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,940
I'm just saying because there's so much
of it, you know, I'm sorry. You know I,

492
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,490
I used that serial killer reference and
I know they're going to give me shit

493
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:25,540
about it was I was thinking
24 pounds of meat. Oh, Oh,

494
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,710
2011 pounds of meat. I was just thinking
like, you know, double up the order.

495
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,330
You get one of those meat freezers
in your fucking garage, you know,

496
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,530
you know those getting people.

497
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,300
So they've got all that meeting
up [inaudible] you know,

498
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,870
everybody else is starving to death and
you're just sitting there going like,

499
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:43,780
yeah, I don't know when helps coming.
And they're looking at you like, well,

500
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:47,980
how come you're not getting skinny like
us? Right? They're like, he's got food.

501
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:51,340
But by then the two week and you've got
all that fucking heritage breed pork and

502
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,930
you're all that protein, you fucking
knocked their asses out. Right?

503
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,140
I Dunno. And then just whenever
you think of a giant meat freezer,

504
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,880
you just always think of a fee.
I don't know.

505
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,850
You just think of somebody
chopping up a body.

506

nice tight Greg Louganis
pair of underwears. Um,

as good as they look to those of you

540
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,850
haven't tried them yet.
Listen Up.

541
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,380
There's a reason your balls are crying
cause all the other balls are walking

542
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,580
around bragging about it.

543
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,690
You can get incredible underwear sent

more hunting around for perfect,

545
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:38,270
for a perfect pair at a crowded store
in eventually settling for good enough.

546
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,110
I guess these don't make
my balls to achieve me.

547
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:46,040
Undies are made with sustainably
sourced material from beechwood trees.

548
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:50,630
How they make their underwear on a trees.
I have no idea. They're naturally soft.

549
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,860
Fiber makes a fabric that won't Sag.
You know,

550
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,250
we can your balls hanging there like
the beginning of an action movie.

551
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,350
Sebesta Stallone trying to reach down
and grab them or they don't ride up.

552
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,940
You know, like in some claustrophobic
relationship. Where is this killing?

553
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:12,110
My biological clock is ticking. He
twisted my nuts there. Trust me.

554
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,700
Once you put on a pair you'll get at me.

555
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,490
UNDIES is so sure you'll love the
first pair that if you're not happy,

556
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:20,150
well fuck they'll do whatever they
can. Hey guys, don't get look,

557

They can to get it right. Uh,

558
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,840
get you into the right pair and if they
can't keep them and they'll refund you.

559
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,290
So it really is risk free to
tell your best underwear ever.

560
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,420
And if you're already part

but I'm going to give you guys a break.
All right.

616
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:58,530
Yesterday I went to a music festival.
All right.

617
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,400
I went to go see the pretenders
when I was in England.

618
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,560
Um, the great Chrissy hine came
down with some of her friends,

619
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:10,020
some of the band members and
stuff that came down to my show.

620
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,960
That's the second time she's come to one
of my shows over there. So I was like,

621
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:16,830
next time you come to the u s I'm
going to your show. You got me.

622
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,050
I'm going and she said, cool, guess what?

623
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:21,750
I'm going to be there a few days after
he come back. So I was like, all right,

624
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,700
done,
done deal.

625
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,760
So I figured they're going to be playing
like some theater or some shit out here.

626
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:31,260
You know, I'm an old band. I'll sit down
in his seat, get myself assessed Barilla.

627
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,580
That'd be once in a while,

628
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:36,430
stand up and wave my fist and feel like
I've contributed as an audience member.

629
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:41,431
But now they were doing a music festival
and I get the email from her manager

630
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,800
and there's a map and it's to the
rose bowl. I'm like, Holy Shit.

631
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,750
Who the fuck is on this bill? And it
was, it was Neil Young, Jack White,

632
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,940
the pretenders,
the smiths,

633
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,140
and a bunch of other people that I'm sure
I missed in that will fucking amazing,

634
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:03,430
right? So I'm like, wow, this is going
to be, I never saw a concert at uh,

635
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,110
at the fucking Rosebowl. This is going to
be amazing. So, you know, I walk in there,

636
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,690
I walked right where it's,
you know, the Rosebowl logo.

637
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,710
I'm having all of these flashbacks of how
many times have been they're hammered.

638
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:17,830
Going to the rose bowl game kind of
struck me as funny to be walking the golf

639
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,140
course. It's a big golf course
outside the stadium, by the way.

640
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,840
I'm finally doing it sober.

641
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,220
So I'm walking in there and the first
thing I try to go into the main entrance

642
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,070
into the, uh, the Rose Bowl stadium.
They're like, Nah, you gotta go around,

643
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,120
you've got to go around. And I'm like,
well of course she got to go around.

644
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,510
They always make you go the
longest fucking possible way.

645
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,590
Why do I gotta go around?
Why don't fuck do I gotta do that?

646
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,030
You fucking assholes.

647
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,720
And then I go in there and then we
got to make a left turn and then a,

648
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,370
right now I'm going to
cut across the bridge,

649
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:52,150
the stadiums right fucking there and I
go to go cross bitch guns. Sorry sir.

650
00:39:52,151 --> 00:39:55,750
This is one way. It's a,
it's one way for walking.

651
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,470
Are you worried there's going to be a
head on collision with the fuck do I have

652
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:02,350
to judge guy? You've got to go up
there right now, I'm losing my shit.

653
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,120
And then I'm looking around,

654
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,880
there's all these tents and all this shit
and all of a sudden he finally fucking

655
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:10,190
dawns on me that the concert
is not in the rose bowl.

656
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,180
It's all over this giant golf course.

657
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,150
So the whole time I'm
trying to go in the stadium,

658
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:20,140
there's nothing going on in the
stadium fucking moron. Right. And uh,

659
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,860
and also I'm trying to keep
my cool because somebody
told me the other day said

660
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,990
like, dude, you do not handle stress well.

661
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,130
And that of course hurt my ego. I'm
like, what are you talking about?

662
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,050
I don't handle stress. Well,
I'm a standup comedian.

663
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,640
I've performed at Madison Square Garden.

664
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,630
I dealt with doing five
minutes of stand up on,

665
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,140
on the Dave Letterman show when it was
like 30 below with the air conditioner.

666
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,010
Okay.
One of the most intimidating things ever.

667
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:49,510
And I was able to set aside that fucking
stress and get through it. And uh,

668
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,790
then the person's like, all
right, all right, Geez. You
know, just saying, you know,

669
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,690
and then I realized it's like,
you know,

670
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,190
thinking about it the next day actually
snapping again over something fucking

671
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,650
stupid. That of course, five
minutes later I figured out,

672
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:06,400
probably three minutes later I actually
realized that this person was right.

673
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,100
That I,
it's not,

674
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,130
I don't handle inconvenience.
Well, and then I turn it into like,

675
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,520
what's going on in Hawaii right now with
the lava pouring out and all this shit.

676
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,340
So I don't know. I've
done this so many times.

677
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,730
The last couple of days, you know,
except for the festival when they,

678
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,910
I was doing well with the stress until
they told me the bridge where people were

679
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,880
walking was one way.
You know,

680
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,490
I just all right. I mean if I even
taught, say that one more time you guys,

681
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:44,700
I'm going to lose my shit again. So
anyways, I drove in traffic yesterday.

682
00:41:44,701 --> 00:41:47,430
I was completely relaxed, but I've
done this a million fucking times.

683
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,360
1 million times is somebody
says something to me about it.

684
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,420
It makes me want to change. And
then for two, three days I'm okay.

685
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,950
And then gradually I just go
back to the way I was, you know,

686
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,020
flipping the fuck out. So, uh,

687
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,640
I think I want to start talking about
it on the podcast the way I do with my

688
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,400
booze and cause that keeps my booze in
and check to tell you guys if I'm on the

689
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:14,460
wagon, I'm off or whatever. And then you
guys give me shit, a Billy booze bag,

690
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:16,980
a Billy fucking fat tits and all
that Shit. It makes me, all right,

691
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:20,940
fuck these people. I'm going
back to crushing waters. Um,

692
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,340
so anyways, I'm s I finally, I
figured out that this festival is,

693
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,620
uh, outside and now, you know,

694
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,950
I don't know where the fuck I'm going
and the pretenders are going to be on.

695
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,140
They were on in the
afternoon, five 25. Right.

696
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,180
Right at dusk or should've been dusk.

697
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,480
Different time of year would
have been dusk. Right. And, um,

698
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,560
I was looking like, what the fuck do I do
here? I've got to get some booze. Right?

699
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,010
So, you know, they're doing
these little fucking, you know,

700
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,300
they're not pulling home port.

701
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:57,010
So I got like two whiskeys and I'm walking
around one of my stupid Little Cup,

702
00:42:57,011 --> 00:43:00,460
right. And I see this fucking
guy even older than me.

703
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,030
He must've been like 63.
It's actually still in pretty good shape.

704
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,600
But he had the long gray hair.
He had his shirt off, you know,

705
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,390
just that guys been going to
concerts forever, you know,

706
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,480
and the pretenders start up and I'm
trying to find where the uh, you know,

707
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:20,110
the best place where I can watch it.
And he starts doing like that, you know,

708
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,950
that like that,
that fucking hippie surfer,

709
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:28,750
spiritual white guy dancing.
It was a touch a Tai Chi in there,

710
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,140
you know,
he's doing that fucking dance

711
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,960
and you know,
it's the same dance he does to all music.

712
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,530
I don't even know what it is. And they
always have like this look on their face.

713
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:42,850
When you look in this smiling,

714
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,540
they always look at you like they have
life figured out. Like they know what,

715
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,570
what makes they like,
hey man, like, you know,

716
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,510
they going to say all this spiritual
bullshit to you that you could find on the

717
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:55,720
side of a fucking Dixie Cup. You know? Um,

718
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:01,180
then whoever that guy is, I want to thank
you. I fucking was laughing my ass off.

719
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,100
Uh, just a faggy had his shirt off. I got
to sit. He was still doing the, I got him,

720
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,660
he was still doing the pushups
so he didn't have the man boobs.

721
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:14,100
But still it's like, come on
man, these young people here,

722
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,600
they don't want to see
that cover yourself up.

723
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:22,390
This whole fucking pride in your
age and everything, you know,

724
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:24,700
or how you look is all well and good,
but you know,

725
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,900
you know what it's Kinda disappeared is
common fucking courtesy for your fellow

726
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:33,480
man. Good Lord. You know, I
just, it just blows my mind.

727
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,760
It really doesn't. It
doesn't. Cause you know what?

728
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,290
I think that guy was a baby boomer,

729
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,090
you know, and there's never, you know,
you know, right before the baby boomers,

730
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:45,350
sorry,

731
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,350
you gotta plug my headphones back in
right before the baby boomers was the

732
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,770
greatest generation according to Tom
Broka, they're the greatest generation.

733
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,770
Like I think the baby boomers in like
the most selfish and like maybe cause

734
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,440
there's so many of them that they had
such an influence on the culture and they

735
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:08,100
think every fucking thing that happened
during their time was just so God damn

736
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:10,170
important. They're just, I dunno, I think,

737
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:15,171
and I think that there were just so up
their own ass about themselves that now

738
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:18,390
that they're old and all wrinkly,
they just can't, they can't,

739
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:23,270
they just can't let it go. Can't
let it go. You know? I mean,

740
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,791
I'm not gonna lie to you.

741
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:28,560
I'm fighting aging by trying to work out
and stay in shape and eat right and all

742
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,660
that type of stuff. But
yeah, I stay covered up.

743
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,050
I have empathy for people in their
twenties. They don't want to see it.

744
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,130
So anyways,
um,

745
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,530
I go by the spiritual dancing guy and I
worked my way up as close to the stage

746
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:49,380
as I possibly can and I have
to tell you something, man,

747
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,620
have Chrissy hine and the
paternity is fucking murdered.

748
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,250
She sounded like she once
again, two weeks in a row.

749
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,360
I've seen great concerts.

750
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:04,650
She sounded is great as the albums
that I grew up listening to.

751
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:09,840
And um, the song she opened
with was on her, her new album.

752
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,500
It was just about being a loner and liking
not being in a relationship and shit.

753
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:16,500
And uh,

754
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,120
the lyrics are hilarious and I'm almost
a little ashamed that like how much I

755
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:24,000
relate to the song. I told her afterwards,
I was like, I fucking love that song.

756
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,753
Okay.

757
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:28,700
Um,

758
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,370
but they just fucking murdered and
she's such a Badass total rock star,

759
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,350
like the real deal paid her dues,
all that shit.

760
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:41,351
You just see all of that when you watch
your performance was tremendous and she

761
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:46,220
gets off stage and then next up
was Jack White. Jack fucking white.

762
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,180
Right. I get to see him come
out with this new lineup.

763
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,550
The new sound that he has. He was
fucking unbelievable day. You know,

764
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,220
there's another guy, if
you go see him, it's like,

765
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:03,260
when have you ever seen that guy even
remotely take a show of like half a second

766
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:04,910
off during the show?
Forget about a show.

767
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:08,570
That guy never is the
antithesis of phoning it in.

768
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,340
Whenever I see that guy perform live,
I always get inspired as a comedian.

769
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:16,400
Like I could be working a little harder.

770
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,890
I can be trying to give people
a better show here. So, um,

771
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,140
his set ended and um,
I walked over

772
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,970
to go see the smiths who I remember my,
one of my brothers listened to them.

773
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,990
Everybody I knew listen to better
music than I listened to in the 80s.

774
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:40,720
I just was listening to like,
I mean I listened to some good shit,

775
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:43,810
but I was listening to a lot of
fucking hair metal, you know,

776
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:47,890
which is why I missed out on Pantera and
fucking all those bands that came out

777
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,680
like I was, I was, I was
too far the other direction,

778
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:56,110
like a role who's has it stored
and all this. I was like,

779
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,390
Pauly Paul Shad, right? I'm just like,
what the fuck is this? This is, you know,

780
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,040
I'm as cynical as the next guy, but
Jesus Christ, that's another thing.

781
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:09,220
I started listening to that Iowa
album that slipped not shit. And like

782
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,330
I always liked the, uh, the heretic
day. People leave. We'll shit. I was,

783
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,090
it was kind of funny.
Um,

784
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,310
but I never like, I don't know,
it was just too much going on.

785
00:48:22,311 --> 00:48:26,000
And now I'm listening to a fucking 20
years after it came out going like,

786
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:30,940
this fucking album is
unbelievable. Um, but I mean,

787
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,980
have, you know, there's only so
much fucking music he can lead.

788
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,590
You gonna miss something, right? I got
to figure out myself on some level.

789
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,480
So anyways, uh, I went over and I saw
the smiths and I remember that one,

790
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,010
that one song that crossed over that even
like a fucking mainstream Charlie like

791
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:50,570
me heard where it was a, that
stopped the med Zuno Rab, uh,

792
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,990
that stuff. It's up to your
future, right? Anyways,

793
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:58,991
I watched those guys that band fucking
murdered and did the impossible.

794
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,660
I felt it had like 10,000 white people
all dancing for their entire fucking set.

795
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,070
It was ridiculous. Um, how
hard they killed. And then
they ended their stair set.

796
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,550
Such a cool way they had this crowd do,
was sing along

797
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,110
as the band was started playing a
little more quiet, a little more quiet,

798
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:20,890
a little more quiet.

799
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,970
And the lead singer was like roasting
people in the crowd go, great job,

800
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:28,090
great job. You don't sound like good,
you sound like you've got bronchitis.

801
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,100
And everybody's laughing.
And then the band just sorta,

802
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:37,660
just gradually stopped playing
and the crowd one more time sang,

803
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,330
uh, or does it the chorus. And then
they said, thanks a lot. Good night.

804
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:46,630
It was so fucking cool.
And um,

805
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,570
and then Neil young starts playing.

806
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,990
I got to walk across the golf course
again and my back was fucking killing me

807
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,510
and I was jet lagged and all of that
shit. And I just, I hate to say this,

808
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:02,950
I've never seen Neil young and concert.
I just, I couldn't make it, you know,

809
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,000
and I had to get home,
you know,

810
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,550
I got a kids getting up and shit and
it's just like, I don't want to fuck it.

811
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,930
See Neil young standing outside
with my backbone, fucking

812
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,733
okay.

813
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,063
You know,

814
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:18,330
talking to me next to some fucking
60 year old guy doing his tight.

815
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:22,680
She fucking, hey man, dance. I
want to see this guy in a theater.

816
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:27,120
So I stood there and I
watched him play one song.

817
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,260
Um, so I could say, or at least most of
the first songs, he didn't even sing.

818
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:37,640
It was just like him playing guitar and
Shit. I think his experience was like,

819
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:37,911
all right,

820
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:41,240
I got to get all those people that were
just over at the Smith's time to come

821
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,720
over. I'm sure people's feet
hurt, their backs hurt. I mean,

822
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:49,640
he's probably doing me a favor,
but I just, you know, I dunno.

823
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,660
I just said to my friends,
I was like, guys, I gotta, I
gotta go home. I can't, um,

824
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,790
and I ubered here and it's just going
to be a thousand fucking people too.

825
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,420
And I just know how I'm wired.

826
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,320
I have to find that one way bridge
that's going to allow me to get the fuck

827
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,700
outta here. And I actually left, um,

828
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,920
during one of my favorite singers of
all time during his fucking set. Um,

829
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,500
but anyways, it's a great show
and all that. If you're younger,

830
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,830
definitely check it out. If you're
older, definitely stretch, you know,

831
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:25,730
try to keep your shirt on. Um, I
saw these two people on my God,

832
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:27,860
these two fucking whales,
these two fed people,

833
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:32,480
like one of those fat couples and they
were just asleep on their picnic blanket.

834
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,970
Like both in like the spooning position,
but faced opposite.

835
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,680
It was like a fat Yang Yang.

836
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,810
They would just lay in there. You
know what they look like, you know,

837
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:48,470
like at the zoo when they tranquilize
like, uh, one of those big cats,

838
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,530
one of those predators. And
then it's just like, all right,

839
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:52,610
now that we knocked it out,

840
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:55,280
we need to bring a fucking machine
over here to pick this thing up.

841
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:58,490
It weighs like 600 fucking pounds.
Um,

842
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:03,050
and I don't know. They,
they were oddly adorable,

843
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,600
like goes way like it must be fun.
You know what I mean?

844
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:12,470
Like you like those commercials
come out and you see like

845
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,780
dominoes or like Papa Ginos we'll
have like a fucking some deal,

846
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:21,680
like get two pizzas for seven bucks
and if you get that we'll throw in the

847
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:26,300
fucking chocolate chip cookie pie with
the whip cream and ice cream. Right.

848
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,540
And I always make fun of that Shit and
I always make fun of it because this a

849
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:33,470
big part of me that just wants
to order that it take the ride,

850
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,030
you know, have the salt fucking
take me down to the ground. Right.

851
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,940
And that thought is, I think
I'm going to fucking, you know,

852
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,660
sink into the rug like that
dude and trainspotting.

853
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,140
Then he started eating the fucking
cookie pie and you start coming back like

854
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,370
Hulk Hogan.
You know when he,

855
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,700
when they went to drop his hand that last
time and it didn't go down and all of

856
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,100
a sudden you eat the cookie thing
and you start shaking your head,

857
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:59,330
you start strutting around.
Right? But you don't,

858
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,710
you don't. And they get,
they get to live that life.

859
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,570
They get to sit there like I bet they
get one of those, you know those,

860
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:14,450
you know those big fucking couches that
on either side there's the recliner but

861
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,110
it's still like a sofa. I bet
they got one of those, right.

862
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,930
And then in the middle of it,
the thing comes down.

863
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,510
Remember that it was basically,
it was a fat fuck couch.

864
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,070
They used to make this thing before,

865
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,840
like the biggest loser
and everything came out.

866
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:31,590
It was like catering for people
who were fat fucks or were,

867
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,650
their goal in life was to become a fat
fuck because on either side of this big

868
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,140
couch like you,

869
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,490
you could pull a lever and your feet
could go up and then in the middle of this

870
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,390
thing would come down.

871
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:46,890
There's a place for you drinks and like
a fucking pizza and you just sit there

872
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:50,340
with you, with your girlfriend, you know,

873
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:52,410
watching the TV with your feet up,

874
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,940
get the AC crank and just destroy,

875
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,960
like just destroying the fucking
planet in your absolute like Utopia.

876
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,981
I mean,

877
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:08,220
I don't know if you guys believe in an
afterlife and which I've thought about,

878
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:13,470
but a lot when Vinnie past, you
know, there was all that talk about,

879
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,360
now he's reunited, reunited with his
brother. And I was definitely thinking,

880
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:23,070
you know, I really hope that
that happens, you know? Um,

881
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,700
so let's say that it does.
Okay.

882
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,930
If you're a fat couple and you have one
of those couches and you're watching one

883
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:36,460
of your favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu,
whatever the fuck you do,

884
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,340
and you sitting there with your feet
reclined eating a pizza and he got that

885
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:43,850
cookie fucking pizza thing coming next,

886
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,180
drinking your favorite drink,
it's just like,

887
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:52,181
what could the afterlife offer you that's
going to be any better than that if

888
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:57,530
you truly love one another. You know,
when you got the AC going, you know,

889
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,180
you've got your toes out. I mean, I dunno,

890
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,170
I think I'm selling a
lifestyle right now here.

891
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:08,280
I think it was selling
some couches. Um, anyways,

892
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:11,610
but I had a great time and uh, if you
get a chance, you know, like I said,

893
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:14,700
definitely check out that festival. And
I feel really bad that I had to leave to.

894
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,880
I left during Neil Young. The
fuck is wrong with me. I have to,

895
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,780
I have to fix that in the future
by seeing him. But like, you know,

896
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,390
I want to see that guy. Like,
did you ever see when he,

897
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,810
he did that film was at the Ryman. That's
what you want to see fucking deal yet.

898
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,780
Yeah. You see him at this, I'm not
trying to not sell this festival,

899
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,830
but I'm just saying, look, I'm old.
I need a chair. Okay. There I set it.

900
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:38,280
All right.
I used to be able to stand.

901
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,260
Evidently I can't any longer.
I was able to kind of work with,

902
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:48,030
work my way out of it. I know it's my
fucking posture. Posture stinks. You know,

903
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,460
it's all those years from fucking hate
yourself. You don't fucking slinking down.

904
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,590
I'm an albino. Stop
looking at me. Alright.

905
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,660
Indochino Indochino talk about how
every man looks better in a suit.

906
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:07,030
Well, you know, when I'm
out there trolling for cock,
you know, it's just like,

907
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,950
I hate to be picky,
but guys,

908
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,820
the sweatpants and the lazy look
isn't doing it for me. All right,

909
00:56:12,821 --> 00:56:16,210
if I'm going to give it up,
I want a nice meal. Okay.

910
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:17,860
So when a guy in a suit comes along,

911
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:23,220
Indochino is the world's largest made
to measure men's wear company and as

912
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,520
featured in many publications,
including Gq,

913
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,890
Forbes and fast company,

914
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,350
fast company sounds like a bad sitcom.
They are old,

915
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:38,650
but they're still fucking snappy.
Uh,

916
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,270
they make suits and shirts made to your
exact measurements for a great fit.

917
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,200

high quality fabrics and the option to

918

lapel lining and monogram all that's,

919
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,480
that's, that was, that was the sign
of a bad ass dude when I was a kid.

920
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,410
If you had your initials on your
sleeve of your suit, you know,

921
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,340
they had a company car, you know, came
home, your wife looked at the ground,

922
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:07,000
she knew who was running
shit. I mean that, that was
success. Here's how it looks,

923
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,953

All right, we got some great emails
this week. The first one, Vinnie Paul.

971
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,000
Hey Bill.
By now,

972
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:55,760
I'm sure that you heard that Vinnie
Paul passed away last Friday. Uh,

973
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:59,240
much like you talked about
Malcolm Young after his death.

974
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,570
I feel like Vinny was another one
who just lived an amazing life.

975
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,590
One of the great drummers to ever get
behind the kid. I got to tell you,

976
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,600
like all everything that I saw on Twitter
from all these big time rockstars,

977
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,940
it over and over and over again.

978
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:19,040
Other than stating the obvious what
a monster, amazing drummer he was.

979
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:22,850
Everybody just talks about what a,
what a nice guy he was. Um, anyways,

980
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:23,910
he said I was too young and Penn.

981
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,810
Tara was leaving their mark on
the metal scene through the 90s,

982
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:30,530
so I never got to see pat terra played
live before they disbanded. However,

983
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:33,800
I did get to see Vinny play
with hell yeah, back in the day,

984
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,600
back in 2016 at, uh, Rockville
festival in Jacksonville, Florida.

985
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,420
He was quite simply incredible. Oh, this
is a cool story. I read this before, um,

986
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,760
the podcast, something I never
do, but I saw it said, Vinnie.

987
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:48,860
Paul said I wanted to read it.
I said,

988
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,830
I remember being pretty close to the front
of the stage and Vinnie was the first

989
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:54,050
band member to come up
before the show started.

990
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,590
When he stood up behind the drum kit,
he had this smile on his face.

991
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,900
Like he was just really happy to be there.

992
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,210
He twirled his drum
stick at the whole crowd.

993
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,310
A crowd saluted by putting his fist
in the air and then the madness begin.

994
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:08,540
But for most of the show,

995
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:12,980
I couldn't take my eyes off of him because
of how good he was. Oh, that's awesome.

996
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,810
And even though he was that good,

997
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:18,290
the biggest memory I have of him was
that he was smiling the whole show.

998
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,330
Like he just loved playing and see,

999
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,090
seeing people enjoy
themselves as much as he was.

1000
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,040
He will be missed by more.
You will be missed by more than we know.

1001
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,990
I don't know if that sentence
makes sense. Um, if you remember,

1002
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:37,040
please crank a pan terrorists song as
loud as you can today. I'm sure Vinnie,

1003
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,720
we'll hear it best,
which is, um, a, I, um,

1004
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,570
best wishes in competent it said,
um,

1005
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,100
they'll hours already listened to the
fucking shit every day and he was,

1006
01:01:48,101 --> 01:01:51,710
you know what, you know, it's
a great album, great live
album. Is there 101 proof?

1007
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,640
I'm such a bad sl.

1008
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,730
One of my favorite things
is when they play on broken.

1009
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,800
And Phil as Phil's doing the intro video.
Vinnie's already counting in the song,

1010
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:04,820
just how tight they were.

1011
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,720
Always our world shore route
or north called our broker.

1012
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,290
[inaudible] of course job brown
Al Bag. I get paid. Oh, alright.

1013
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,880
Coco the gorilla.
Oh,

1014
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:18,881
I saw this too at fucking
sweetheart of a gorilla.

1015
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,970
Um, did I did the bit above
a hey bill, I saw you,

1016
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,010
you live last year and I love you special.

1017
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:28,230
We talk about teaching
gorilla sign language.

1018
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,440
I was watching clips of cocoa interacting
with people like with flee from the

1019
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,180
Chili peppers and Robin Williams.
I watched those.

1020
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:40,350
I was still nervous and I just saw a flea
laying down and there's like a fucking

1021
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:44,550
gorilla right next to him. Um, I dunno,

1022
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:49,350
I get you're shooting the shit with it.
You can kind of, I dunno. Um, um, the,

1023
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,230
it made me nervous.
You know,

1024
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,450
I wonder if it made me nervous just
because I'm such a big fan of flee and I

1025
01:02:57,451 --> 01:03:00,270
didn't want to see anything happen to him.
Like it was a bass player from a band.

1026
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:02,700
I didn't give a shit about them.
And if they go, look at this guy,

1027
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:07,500
this could get interesting. Um, anyways,
it was, it was charming as hell.

1028
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:11,760
I was wondering if you ever set down with
cocoa, if ever given a chance. Well, no,

1029
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:15,330
not after the bid I did. They
probably, this guy's a fucking asshole.

1030
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,980
You could have asked him why the chicken
crossed the road and wait for a chuckle

1031
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:21,960
or tried to explain humor to him.

1032
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,123
MMM.

1033
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,310
Five a sat down with that gorilla.
I in that thing, actually,

1034
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:32,370
if that wasn't a party trick, if it
actually knew how to do sign language,

1035
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,160
I imagine it would sign to me.
You seem nervous.

1036
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,230
Okay.

1037
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,270
And hours and back. Yeah.
Well you're a fucking gorilla.

1038
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,360
Um, anyways, kids show recommendation.

1039
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,750
Um, hey there Billy barnacle
balls. I want you to, I want,

1040
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,080
if you want a show to watch with
your girlfriend, checkout. Okay.

1041
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,010
I thought it said octo nuts, like
something with eight balls. Octo nuts.

1042
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,320
Is it an octopus in outer space?

1043
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,480
I watched it with my girls and kids and
I actually learned some stuff. All right,

1044
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:12,710
well that was about as vague as the,
uh,

1045
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:17,830
what was it that was that movie way back
in the game, the silent game or the,

1046
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,160
there's something game or
the something or other.

1047
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,230
Remember David Spade had that joke?
I'm going to tell the time.

1048
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:32,231
I'm going to tell you guys the secret of
the crying game and he goes over rated.

1049
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:35,813
Yeah.

1050
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,950
All right. Hair transplant, depression.
Oh No. Hey old freckled Dick.

1051
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:45,410
I'm a 21 year old man. I recently
got a hair transplant surgery. Well,

1052
01:04:45,411 --> 01:04:50,100
you must be a hairy motherfucker,
man. You went bald that are soon. Um,

1053
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,520
the surgery went great.
Good. Good for you.

1054
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,720
But I now hate that I have a
huge scar in the back of my head.

1055
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:02,460
I don't they do it now where they just
vacuum the shit out so you don't have to

1056
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:06,210
have that smile on the back of your head.
He goes,

1057
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:08,520
every time I cut my hair,
you can see it.

1058
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,740
Could you give me some advice
on what I should do? Well,

1059
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:15,660
yeah,
don't cut your hair so fucking short.

1060
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,660
Now that you've get back on top of your
head, grow your hair out, you'll be fine.

1061
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,200
That was an easy one.
What are you doing?

1062
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:28,440
You got hair plugs yet?
I'm hacked the back of your head.

1063
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:32,010
Then he got fucking hair plugs and now
you're shaving your head down to the

1064
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:35,760
point where you can fucking see it
anyways. What was the point? Um,

1065
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,340
I don't know. I would just, I guess I
would just grow my hair out a little bit.

1066
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,790
I don't think it has to be
that long to cover the scar.

1067
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,210
As long as it's long enough
that you can't see your scalp,

1068
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,470
I think he should be all
right. Right. Anyways,

1069
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:57,720
pit bull problems,
dear g OBA RSF Hasif oh,

1070
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:02,770
Billy. Easy shave butter. Oh,
facilities face right now.

1071
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,730
That's easy. Facilities easy. I Dunno,

1072
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,150
I have no idea. I suck at that
shit. As he former pitbull owner,

1073
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:15,520
I'd like to ask your advice on a problem
I'm having. My wife comes home from, uh,

1074
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,760
my wife comes from a large family and
they get together at her parents every

1075
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:23,300
month for Sunday dinner and family
hangouts. The last two times.

1076
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:28,630
My brother in law has brought is recently
a duck is recently adopted pitbull.

1077
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,760
It's a rescue dog and he doesn't think
it was abused or used to fight because

1078
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:38,630
it's so good with kids. According to
him it's a large family. So there,

1079
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:42,380
there are about 50 kids ages
three to 11 running around.

1080
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:43,970
And my four year old daughters,
one of them,

1081
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,790
she loves dogs and likes
this one in particular,

1082
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,740
but both times he brought my dog.

1083
01:06:48,741 --> 01:06:53,360
My daughter has come running to me in
tears because it got over excited and

1084
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:56,750
jumped onto her too rough.
Well that's the thing about pities man,

1085
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:00,890
they just a big fucking
awesome ball of muscle.

1086
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,380
And when I used to wrestle with my dog,

1087
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:06,980
I used to have to lay my neck
over the top of his neck.

1088
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:12,130
He had to get inside because she was
lightening quick and she would turn around

1089
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:17,250
and hit her head was like a wrecking ball,
godliness,

1090
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,180
that fucking dog. I still get to
see her every couple of months,

1091
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:24,890
but I really miss that.
Um, anyways, he goes,

1092
01:07:24,891 --> 01:07:28,910
I don't hate dogs, but I don't love them
either. And I don't trust pitbulls. Well,

1093
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,850
you have to validate all of
that. Okay. To be quite honest,

1094
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:32,990
I'm kind of afraid of them.

1095
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,720
I'd never forgive myself if
something happened to my daughter.

1096
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:39,530
If I say something to my inlaws,
I looked like a killjoy asshole,

1097
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:43,110
but I'm too stressed out to enjoy the
family gathering because I'm hovering over

1098
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:43,940
a constantly.

1099
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,770
So my wife's response has been to treat
me like I'm overreacting and dismissed

1100
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:49,910
my concerns.
It's bothering me so much.

1101
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:52,490
I've considered just keeping
my daughter home next time.

1102
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,700
But am I making too big a deal about this?

1103
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,830
I think it's a recipe for disaster.

1104
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:01,820
I don't feel like it's my place to tell
my brother in law to keep it at home and

1105
01:08:01,821 --> 01:08:03,670
my wife's not supporting me.
Please tell,

1106
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,140
please let me know if you have
any ideas. Uh, may see ava.

1107
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:13,850
Got to fair for two. Thank you. Thank you.

1108
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:17,780
And I imagine that
saying go fuck yourself.

1109
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:19,783
Um,

1110
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,480
I know advise and go to is
you [inaudible] all right.

1111
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,650
Anyways. Uh, I would say this dude,

1112
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,870
you have to like,
if that's what you're feeling,

1113
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,250
you don't have to tell anybody
to leave a dog home on it.

1114
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:42,110
You just have to communicate
this to people. All right?
Say you don't hate dogs,

1115
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:46,970
you don't love him either and you
don't, I don't trust pitbulls. Okay.

1116
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:50,140
And just tell them that rather than
be like, keep the fucking lunatic.

1117
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,480
Just tell them that.
All right.

1118
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:57,470
And I would sit down with
your wife and say that,

1119
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,860
you know,
I don't feel like you're

1120
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:05,030
hearing me all right.

1121
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:08,000
She's my daughter and I'm concerned
and I have to be honest, you know,

1122
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,410
if you had these concerns,

1123
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:13,850
I would listen to them and you're not
validating what I'm feeling and it's

1124
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:17,150
really bothering me and I can't
enjoy when I go over there.

1125
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:21,080
I don't want to be this killed joy,
but I'm hovering over our kid and I just,

1126
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,460
you know, it's bothering me.
You married me, you love me.

1127
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,170
I'm telling you something's bothering me.
We need to talk about it.

1128
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,800
You can't go there because that'd be up
and you fucking talk to me about this.

1129
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,800
That's what I would do.
Keep it in the register.

1130
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:36,020
I was just in all right.

1131
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:42,130
And don't stop having the conversation
until there's a solution that you're

1132
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:47,300
satisfied with. It should
daughter. Okay. And uh,

1133
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:52,010
you know, dogs are abused, right?

1134
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:56,680
And if a dog snaps, you know,
it's a bad thing around a kid.

1135
01:09:56,681 --> 01:10:00,190
And then when you have a pit bull, the
thing about a pitbull is its capability.

1136
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:05,140
You know what I mean? Some dogs that like
a little water pistol and other dogs,

1137
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,480
or like a fucking bazooka.
That dog is a bazooka.

1138
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,450
So not saying the breed is bad,

1139
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:14,410
I'm just saying if somebody fuck
that dog up and it does snap,

1140
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:16,610
the results are,
you know,

1141
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:21,910
gonna be really bad. So, and you
have to address that that's being,

1142
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:26,590
or you're being a responsible parent and
these people need to listen to you and

1143
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:29,590
a, you need to speak up. You've got to
stand up for yourself there, buddy. Boy,

1144
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:35,170
it's my advice. All right, good
luck. Okay, lady, lady manager.

1145
01:10:35,171 --> 01:10:38,260
Crossing the line.
Dear bill or William Butler,

1146
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:42,590
will you call yourself below?
Hello Wall?

1147
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:47,920
I'm a 23 or 23 year old lady who
just started working in an office.

1148
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:51,730
I love when women write in. It's always
guys, God bless you for right now,

1149
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:56,020
who just started working in an office
for a big company. It's a boring job.

1150
01:10:56,021 --> 01:11:00,400
But while I figure out what to do with
my life after graduating, it's all right.

1151
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,580
Well there you go. That's not bad. You're
23. You get your whole life ahead of you.

1152
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,410
Uh, I got promoted with the recommendation
from my former manager at this 40

1153
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:12,730
something year old woman who
I thought was quite nice. Uh,

1154
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,590
now she's not my manager anymore,
although she still senior to me.

1155
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:21,480
She has been a little inappropriate with
me. And after an office Christmas party,

1156
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,870
me and my colleagues went to a club.
Uh,

1157
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:27,990
I came out of the club
bathrooms and she was waiting.

1158
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,260
She didn't even come with
us. Well, that's weird.

1159
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,790
She waved me over to sit next to her
and asked me if I was gay. I said, no,

1160
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:40,260
I'm not. And she went fine. It didn't
speak to me for the rest of the night.

1161
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:45,870
All right, well she needs a better
opening line that she's a little blunt.

1162
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,730
You know, she's in business. She
got right down to brass tacks. Uh,

1163
01:11:50,731 --> 01:11:54,660
she said I was a bit uncomfortable with
the question because what business is it

1164
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:58,880
of hers? Oh, I thought she was gay.
She wanted to hook up with you.

1165
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,890
Cause what business is it of her?

1166
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:06,500
So I told one of my work
pals what had happened. Uh,

1167
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:10,970
they had been at the company longer than
me went. Wow, you're her new one then.

1168
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:14,510
Oh boy.
Oh,

1169
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,770
G G.

1170
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:22,250
I asked them what they meant and a guy
said, well, I may look at her right now.

1171
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:26,990
She's filming you and
she, Sarah enough. What?

1172
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,870
Ensure enough she was, she
was, when I turned around,

1173
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:33,890
she hid her phone as I was a little
bit too drunk and under the influence.

1174
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,640
I was already paranoid. So I decided
to leave because I felt so gross.

1175
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:38,901
Since then,

1176
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:43,901
she's pulled me aside to say that I
looked delicious and scrumptious oh,

1177
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:47,810
what a crape. Whenever she
sees me at the end of the day,

1178
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:51,170
she taps her cheek and demands that kiss.

1179
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,680
Oh yeah, what the fuck is this per
she and, oh, that's [inaudible].

1180
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,250
That's like a gross relative.

1181
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:06,580
She asked a girl who works for me to
take pictures of me and to send it to her

1182
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,110
when we're at a pub.

1183
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,970
I consider myself and assertive girl,

1184
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:17,990
but there's something about
how public about her actions,

1185
01:13:17,991 --> 01:13:20,900
which makes me so timid,
so I go along with it.

1186
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,280
Now I'll do that.

1187
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,610
You think you would think that
because she's not my manager anymore.

1188
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,260
Now that I've been promoted,
it wouldn't be a problem,

1189
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:31,510
but it is because my new
manager is their best friend.

1190
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,650
I don't want to cause a riff in this new
job, but it's really stressing me out.

1191
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:40,000
Am I within my rights to tell her to stop?
Absolutely. You are. How do I tell it?

1192
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:41,590
Is that no,

1193
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:44,740
I don't want to kiss her on the cheek
every time I see you without looking like

1194
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:47,080
a bitch.
Listen,

1195
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:52,180
the way you're looking
at this is fucking crazy.

1196
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:57,420
You're, you're sitting here looking at
like how like you're being an asshole.

1197
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:01,860
You're not. This person is
completely out of line. She said,

1198
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:05,700
a few of my friends thinks it's a funny
situation, but I don't, and if you don't,

1199
01:14:05,701 --> 01:14:09,660
then it isn't. You've got to validate
that if this was a male manager,

1200
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:13,390
he'd be reported. I love your stuff
so much and I wish I could come back.

1201
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:17,680
You'd come back to Glasgow someday
from a fellow fellow pasty redhead.

1202
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,390
Um, all right, dear
fellow fucking pasty. Um,

1203
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,710
yeah,

1204
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:29,660
this is what you gotta do. She
asked for a kiss. You tell him no,

1205
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,270
and I just stare at, I mean, listen,

1206
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,900
you have all the fucking power in the
world or if you just want to go to the

1207
01:14:36,901 --> 01:14:38,340
manager and say,
listen,

1208
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:41,970
I don't want to cause some me
to scandal or any of that shit.

1209
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:46,800
Can You keep this weird old fucking
bag away from me and tell her to be

1210
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:50,280
professional? I mean, that's
the proper way to do it.

1211
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,910
Those are the proper channels,
but I have to

1212
01:14:55,860 --> 01:15:00,720
do it that way. Do it that way. Okay.

1213
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:06,390
Do it that way. And, and, and
document that this has been happening.

1214
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:10,140
You have all these witnesses about them
filming her and all of this type of shit.

1215
01:15:10,141 --> 01:15:14,430
If they ever tried to fire you, I mean
that you don't have a problem at this.

1216
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,420
This kind of thing needs to stop and uh,
you know,

1217
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,160
in a perfect world you'd go to her,

1218
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,940
cause I don't like that
whole telling on a thing,

1219
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,980
but that's how the business
world works. Um, you know,

1220
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:29,000
in a perfect world when she fucking
goes like pointed to or cheek. Yeah,

1221
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:30,300
that's right where you should punch her.

1222
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah.

1223
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,550
Fucking blast or right in fucking face.

1224
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,353
Yeah.

1225
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,530
Yeah. I mean if you're ever at a
bar again and she's doing that Shit,

1226
01:15:42,531 --> 01:15:45,110
I would fucking dump a drink
right over her fucking head.

1227
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:49,600
Like that's just creepy
behave. I would just, mmm,

1228
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,000
you got to stop this Timothy. Cause if
you're timid someone like that, it's,

1229
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:56,660
it's gonna. It's like a magnet.
They're going to go right towards you.

1230
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:59,660
You've got to step up to her and
tell her what a fucking creep she is.

1231
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,100
And if I catch you take
a video or, or, or, uh,

1232
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:06,790
pictures of me or any of this
other fucking creepy sexual
shit that you're doing,

1233
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,620
I'm going to report you,
okay?

1234
01:16:09,621 --> 01:16:12,380
And you think you're going to get together
with you, fucking manage your friend.

1235
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:16,490
Okay? All I gotta do is go on social
media and your fucking world is over.

1236
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,660
The fuck is my phone.

1237
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,310
What the fuck is mine anyways, but don't
do that. That's all anger. Listen you,

1238
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:29,810
but you know,
you are,

1239
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:34,620
you seem like a really like overly
nice people pleasing person at 23,

1240
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:38,970
which I was where you're like, is
it me? That the way I'm dressing,

1241
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:42,570
that's attracting this, it's
not you. It's that person. Okay?

1242
01:16:42,571 --> 01:16:46,320
So whatever the fuck I said
before I got upset, uh,

1243
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,960
just go, listen, I got an
issue and don't be listening.

1244
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,050
I don't want to come to the family.

1245
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:58,260
They go in there fucking flat footed
and look right at that person and say,

1246
01:16:58,261 --> 01:16:59,670
listen,
I got an issue with her.

1247
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,060
She's coming at me in weird sexual ways
and I'm getting sick of it and I'm sick

1248
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:09,470
of it. I want to come here and go to work
and do a great job. I don't need that.

1249
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,180
Okay. I would like to file an
official report on her harassing me.

1250
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,610
Okay. And that's the deal. And I
want it to stop. It stops right now.

1251
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:23,180
Are we clear?
That's it.

1252
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,510
That's it. There's no, don't go
in there fucking hat in hand.

1253
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:32,600
You don't have to be a, can't
just go in and just say, look,

1254
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,480
this is happening and it
needs to stop immediately.

1255
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,090
Okay. Well, I mean,

1256
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:46,250
what if she just flashes your
kitchen? You, I mean, what
