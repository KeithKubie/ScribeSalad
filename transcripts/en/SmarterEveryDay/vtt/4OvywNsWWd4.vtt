Hey it's me, Destin.

00:00:01.946 --> 00:00:04.657
So, um... we don't have
really awseome accents

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:06.238
and we don't have a lot of money,

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:07.857
but we do know our guns.

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:09.719
And we are rocket scientists.

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:13.312
So, we're gonna start a new web
series called Smarter Every Day.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:18.095
[Music]

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:21.750
Uh, we're gonna try to teach you
something about twice a week.

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.666
Today we have the Saiga-12
with a 20-round mag.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.933
So we're going to teach you the difference
between a detonation and a deflagration.

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:32.061
A detonation is something that is sonic.

00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:35.134
You have a shockwave or a
disturbance in the air.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.965
A deflagration is something
that is subsonic.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.949
So basically it's just a rapid
oxidation, but there's no shockwave.

00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:44.833
So that's what we're going to demonstrate.

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:46.841
Let's make this science official.

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.230
With Goggles.

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:53.093
Here we go.
[Cocking]

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:54.745
Alright.

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.502
[Successive gunshots]

00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:13.396
[Successive gunshots]

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:21.640
[Slow motion gunshots]

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:39.483
Well, looks like our flame went out on one.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.252
[Successive gunshots]

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.044
But it's still pretty fun.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.967
Saiga-12, 20-round mag, double-ought buck.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.586
It's worth the price of admission.
[Unloading]

00:01:56.106 --> 00:02:00.680
Anyway, just remember: in the
end, it's all gonna burn.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:06.104
Or... at least deflagrate. Now that you
know the word, right? Have a good one.

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:32.968
