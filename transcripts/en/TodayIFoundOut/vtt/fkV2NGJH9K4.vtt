00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.490
Whether it’s two-strokes or four, one cylinder
or eight, most of the engines we use today

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.789
are powered by the internal combustion of
fuel and air; however, mixing gasoline and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.970
oxygen isn’t the only way to generate the
energy needed to propel a craft, and in fact,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.860
sometimes it’s the least efficacious choice.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.860
In the typical gasoline-fueled car engine,
power is produced in the cylinders, each of

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
which is comprised of a shaft with a tightly-fitted
piston that moves down to draw in air and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.860
gasoline.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.860
As the intake valve closes, the piston moves
back up, compressing the mixture and increasing

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.860
its temperature (and thereby, efficiency).

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
When the plug sparks, the gasoline is ignited,
and the released heat and energy in the ensuing

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.860
explosion drives the piston back down.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860
On the other end of the piston (opposite the
intake valve and spark plug) is a connecting

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.860
rod that is attached to the crankshaft.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
Thus, when the piston is forced down, it pushes
the rod, which moves the rotating crankshaft.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860
This process works so well that it has been
replicated hundreds of millions of times in

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.860
everything from chainsaws to Ford F-150s.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.860
However, this method of producing energy relies
on oxygen present in the atmosphere to combine

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.860
with the carbon in the gasoline.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860
In space, of course, the reason no one can
hear you scream is because there’s no air

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.860
(or oxygen).

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
Enter rockets.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.860
A rocket doesn’t rely on a crankshaft, but
rather on the expulsion of something, be it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.860
gas, liquid, solid or simply radiant energy,
through a small opening (nozzle).

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860
Therefore, unlike a truck that doesn’t need
to carry its oxidizer since it can draw air

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860
from its surrounding environment, ships with
rocket engines have to carry all of their

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.790
propellant with them.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.580
Of course, it would be impractical (if not
impossible) to haul enough gaseous oxygen

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.970
up into space to have a meaningful flight.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.439
To get around this problem, alternatives have
been developed, primarily in the forms of

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.729
solid and liquid propellants.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.670
Solid propellants come in two main types – homogenous
and composite.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.170
With both, the fuel and the oxidizer are stored
together, and power is produced when the two

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.770
are ignited.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.820
Homogenous solid propellants are unique in
that both the oxidizer and the fuel exist

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.960
together as a single, unstable compound, either
as simply nitrocellulose or together with

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.030
nitroglycerine.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.080
On the other hand, with composite solid propellants,
the fuel and the oxidizer are distinct materials

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.550
that have been combined into a powdery or
crystallized mixture, which is commonly comprised

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.229
of ammonium nitrate or chlorate, or potassium
chlorate (as the oxidizer), and some type

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.640
of solid hydrocarbon fuel (similar to asphalt
or plastic).

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.020
Solid propellants have long been used with
launch vehicles, including the Space Shuttle’s

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.530
launch boosters that each produced 3.3 million
pounds of thrust.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.670
With liquid propellants, there are three main
types: petroleum-based, cryogenic and hypergolic.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.300
All three of these propulsion methods store
their oxidizers and fuels separately until

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.700
thrust is needed.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.290
When rockets fueled with a liquid propellant
are fired, a bit of each (fuel and oxidizer)

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.950
is introduced into a combustion chamber where
they combine and ultimately explode – producing

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.260
the necessary power.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.349
Petroleum-based liquid propellants, as the
name implies, mix together a petroleum product

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.540
(like kerosene) with liquid oxygen, which,
being highly-concentrated, renders it an efficient

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.060
and powerful propellant.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.840
As such, this method was widely used for many
rockets, including the first stages of Saturn

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.680
I, IB and V, as well as Soyuz.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.609
Another liquid propellant relies on cryogenic
(super low temperature) liquefied gases; one

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.879
common method mixes liquefied hydrogen (the
fuel) with liquefied oxygen (the oxidizer).

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.519
Highly efficient but difficult to store for
long because of the need to keep both so cold

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:05.720
(hydrogen stays a liquid at -423F, and oxygen
at -297F), cryogenic propellants have been

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.090
used only in limited applications, although
those include the main engines of the Space

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.980
Shuttle and certain stages of the Delta IV
and some of the Saturn rockets.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.709
With both petroleum-based and cryogenic propellants,
some type of ignition is required, either

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.950
via pyrotechnic, chemical or electrical means;
however, with the third type of liquid propellant,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.939
hypergolic, no ignition is necessary.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.319
Common hypergolic fuels include different
forms of hydrazine (including unsymmetrical

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.590
dimethylhydrazine and monomethylhydrazine),
while nitrogen tetroxide is often used as

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.970
the oxidizer.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.010
Liquid even at room temperature, hypergolic
propellants are easy to store, which together

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.209
with their spontaneous combustibility make
them highly desirable for a number of applications,

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.989
such as in maneuvering systems.

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.639
Therefore, even though the materials involved
are highly toxic and corrosive, hyperbolic

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.090
fuels have been frequently used, including
in the Space Shuttle’s orbital maneuvering

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.980
system and, pertinent to the question at hand,
the Apollo lunar module (LM).

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.999
Four subcontractors worked under the lead
contractor, Grumman Corporation, to build

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:15.379
the LM, with Bell Aerosystems Company selected
for the development of its ascent propulsion.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.020
Work began on the project in January 1963,
yet engineers were still tinkering with the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.600
ascent engine as late as September 1968, when
Bell’s initial propellant injector was switched

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.560
out for one designed by Rocketdyne, the subcontractor
that also built the descent engine.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.900
Driven by a non-gimbaled, fixed-thrust engine
and powered by Aerozine 50 fuel and nitrogen

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.569
tetroxide oxidizer, the hypergolic materials
that provided the thrust necessary to get

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.320
the LM off the Moon’s surface were so corrosive
that they burned through the engine each time

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.509
they were fired (requiring the engine be rebuilt).

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.990
As a result, none of the ascent engines for
any of the LMs were tested or fired prior

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:14.039
to lifting the Apollo astronauts off of 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.839
the Moon.
