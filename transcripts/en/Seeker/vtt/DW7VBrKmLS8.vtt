00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.340
By definition, mass is the quantity of matter
that a body contains.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.380
But, could there be negative mass?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.420
That seems counterintuitive right?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.760
How can you have negative two kilograms of
something...

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.860
Negative mass seems to violate the laws of
our universe…

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.359
But, in 2014 a couple of excited researchers
did some calculations and found it was A-OKAY.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
The Universe is fine with negative mass as
long as that mass isn't’ solid.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.509
If it’s a fluid, you’re cool.Science pun.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.800
So…

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.050
Negative mass can exist.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.489
According to their calculations, a perfect
fluid -- which doesn’t exist -- would allow

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.160
negative mass to exist and wouldn’t defy
the laws of general relativity!

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.329
I know that’s complicated, but put a pin
in that for a second.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.660
Because just recently in 2017…

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.520
Researchers used a superfluid to create something
with “effectively” negative mass.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.969
In spite of what the media is saying (even
in the university's own press release)

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.309
the researchers never said they created negative
mass.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.620
Instead, the actual paper says they created
“negative effective mass”

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.010
What really happened, as I understand it,
they created a Bose-Einstein condensate that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.010
behaves unexpectedly,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.010
k

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.470
moving in a way that makes it seem like or
that is similar to something with negative

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.000
mass -- but it doesn’t actually have negative
mass.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Sidebar:

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.150
This is a problem in science journalism, it’s
easy to get excited and miss a key detail.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.220
In science (and journalism) details matter.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.400
This has been said by you all in the comments,
by other science communicators, and even John

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.640
Oliver.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.080
Science is hard.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080
End sidebar.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.420
With that in mind, again.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.320
This isn’t negative mass, it’s a Bose-Einstein
condensate that behaves as if it had negative

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320
mass.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.300
As in when this superfluid moves it does so
in an unexpected way.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.970
But it does have mass, the superfluid was
made of 10,000 rubidium 87 isotopes -- so

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.980
it has the mass of that.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.200
Get it?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200
Totally.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.660
But c’mon, I know you’re all nerds out
there, but you didn’t tune in to learn about

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.420
how a trapped supercooled superfluid behaved
weirdly... so that closes that.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.060
Now, remember that pin… let’s snag it.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.230
What if they had created negative mass?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.230
What would it be like?

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.970
What would it look like?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.970
ALL THE WHAT?!

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.060
To be honest, no one really knows.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.140
Negative mass was first theorized by Einstein
early in the last century while coming up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.500
with general relativity.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.590
A handful of essays published in the 1950s
coined the idea of negative mass, as an opposite

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.620
to positive mass.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.470
So, scientifically, it’s a relatively new
concept.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.110
Some of the papers say something made of negative
mass would still have momentum, and be subject

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.210
to some limits of physics, but would also
violate Newton’s Third Law of motion, the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.510
equal and opposite reaction one.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.610
If you pushed a weight made of negative mass,
it would move toward you.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.990
But, I read one 1986 article by John G. Cramer,
a physics professor at the University of Washington

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.390
-- and he described it like this:

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.380
“Consider a pair of equal and opposite positive
and negative mass[es] placed close to each

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.460
other,” he wrote.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.600
“The negative mass is attracted to the positive
mass, while the positive mass is repelled

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.970
by the negative mass.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.320
Thus, the two masses will experience equal
forces and accelerations in the same direction

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.410
(in violation of Newton's third law) and the
system of two particles will accelerate, seemingly

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.920
without limit.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.590
The negative mass will chase the positive
mass with constant acceleration.”

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.640
In either scenario, shiz is gettin’ weird.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.720
If you’re being pedantic, negative mass
would be impossible, because no mass equals

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.569
no matter at all; but pedantry aside, what
negative mass seems to mean is matter out

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.390
of the constraints of one of the bonds of
the universe.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.750
It makes sense that something like this would
excite science journalists, I just hope we

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.660
are positive next time.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.230
Okay, i’ll stop.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.400
The more we understand about particle physics,
the better we're gonna understand the universe

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400
itself.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.790
To that end, we do have a video about how
black holes and gravitational waves could

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.930
potentially help us find dark matter and you
can watch it here.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.171
Does this video hurt your brain?

00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:11.770
Cause it totally hurt my brain while I was
making it.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.330
Let us know down in the comments, make sure
you subscribe for more Seeker and thanks for

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.500
