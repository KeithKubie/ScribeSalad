00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.682
Hello, and welcome back. In the previous

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:07.160
mini course we covered software design, discussed the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.020
UML and the unified software process, and worked

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.160
on a complex project in which we developed

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.020
a distributed software system. In this mini course,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.900
which is the last one for this class,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.080
we will cover my very favorite topic, software

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.850
testing or more generally, software verification and validation.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.850
So why do I love software testing? Well,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.430
I love it because it is extremely important. It

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.330
is very challenging and it is fun but only if you do it in the right way.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.900
In the upcoming lessons we will discuss why

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.710
software verification is important, why software testing, which is

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.730
a specific type of verification, is important, and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
what are the main techniques for performing software testing.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.866
We will also discuss test-driven development and agile methods,

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.780
in which we'll lose some of the rigidity of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.340
the earlier processes and turn things around by writing

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.260
tests before we write the code and then writing

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.280
code that makes the test pass. Finally, we will

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.750
perform a project, in which you get to apply

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.010
most of the principles and practices of agile development

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.430
in a realistic scenario. So let's jump right in.
