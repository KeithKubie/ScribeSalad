00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:01.018
Here's my answer.

00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:04.188
My code does exactly what I've shown you before.

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:06.566
It first considers the possibility of cancer,

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.130
multiplies it with the test sensitivity p1

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.869
and then it observes the opposite possibility

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.849
and of the course the specitivity over here refers to a negative test result

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.581
so we take 1 minus this to get the positive one.

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.833
Adding these two products up gives us the desired result.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:26.542
So let's try this. It gives me a function f with the parameters we just assumed

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:30.558
and if I hit run, I get 0.27.

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:33.102
Obviously I can change these parameters,

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:38.501
so, suppose I make it much less likely to have cancer in the prior from 0.1 to 0.01

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:44.668
then my 0.27 changes to 0.207.

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:47.700
Now I realise it's not the posterior in Bayes' Rule.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.702
It's just the probability of getting a positive test result.

00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:54.518
You can see this if you change the prior probability of cancer to 0

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:57.117
which means we don't have cancer, no matter what the test result says.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:01:01.426
But there still is 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result

00:01:01.426 --> 00:01:05.183
and the reason is our test has a specitivity of 0.8

00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:07.267
that is, even in the absence of cancer,

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.817
there is a 0.2 chance of getting a positive test result.
