00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.810
So, given the input series of examples, and the background knowledge,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.195
this is the final concept definition for [UNKNOWN] that this particular

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.454
[UNKNOWN] agent will learn. Notice, that there are no must support lengths here,

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:16.650
because input [UNKNOWN] of examples did not require them.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.920
Now it is also, that we did not generalize this bricks into something else, or

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.180
further generalize these blocks into something else,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.520
because there was no background knowledge to do that.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.070
So the result of learning here, depends not just on the input examples, but

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.160
on the background knowledge that the AI agent has. This method of incremental

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
concept learning differs quite a bit from some of these standard algorithms in

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.800
machine learning. Often in machine learning, the AI agent is a given

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.570
a large number of examples to begin with and the learning begins with those

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.700
large number of examples where the number of examples could be in thousands or

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.700
millions or more. When you have a large number of examples to begin with,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.360
then one can apply statistical machine learning methods to find patterns of

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.319
regularity in the input data. But if the number of examples is very small,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.280
and if the examples come one at a time, the learning is incremental.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.450
Then it becomes harder to apply those statistical methods to detect patterns of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.040
the [INAUDIBLE] input data. Instead, in that case, the algorithm must make

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.980
use of its background knowledge to decide what to learn and how to learn it.
