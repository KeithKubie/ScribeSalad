00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
I figure it never hurts getting
as much practice as

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.010
possible solving systems of
linear equations, so let's

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.770
solve this one.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.930
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to solve it using an

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.310
augmented matrix, and I'm going
to put it in reduced row

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.130
echelon form.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
So what's the augmented matrix
for this system of equations?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.405
Three unknowns with
three equations.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.990
I just have to do
the coefficents.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.010
So the coefficients of x
terms are just 1, 1, 1.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.590
Coefficients of the y terms
are 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.920
Coefficients of the z terms
are 1, 3, and 4.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.280
And let me show that
it's augmented.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.030
And then they equal
3, 0, and minus 2.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.330
Now, I want to get this
augmented matrix into reduced

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.570
row echelon form.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840
So the first thing, I have
a leading 1 here

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.240
that's a pivot entry.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.550
Let me make everything else in
that column equal to a 0.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.320
So I'm not going to change
my first row.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.740
So it will just be a 1, a 1, a
1, and then my dividing line,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.450
and then I have a 3.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.770
Now, to zero this out, let me
just replace the second row

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670
with the first row minus
the second row.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.170
1 minus 2 is-- actually, a
better thing to do, because I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.670
eventually want this to be 1
anyway, let me replace this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.230
row with this row, with the
second row minus the first row

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.620
instead of the first row
minus the second row.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.910
I can do it either way.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.220
So the second row minus
the first row.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.760
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.230
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.510
3 minus 1 is 2.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.930
And then 0 minus 3 is minus 3.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.550
Now I want to also
zero this out.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.220
So let me replace this
guy with this

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.200
equation minus that equation.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.170
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.800
3 minus 1 is 2.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.910
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.860
Minus 2 minus 3 is minus 5.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.490
Fair enough.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.900
So I got my pivot entry here.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.200
I have another pivot
entry here.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.710
It's to the right of this one,
which is what I want for

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.460
reduced row echelon form.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.710
Now, I need to target this
entry and that entry.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.960
I need to zero them out.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.500
So let's do it.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800
So I'm going to keep my
second row the same.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.720
My second row is 0, 1, 2, and
then I have a minus 3, the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.650
augmented part of it.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.420
And to zero this guy out, what
I can do is I can replace the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.640
first row with the first row
minus the second row.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.770
So I get 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.700
1 minus 1-- there's
a bird outside.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.720
Let me close my window.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.280
So where was I?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.410
I'm replacing the first row with
the first row minus the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.050
second row.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.800
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.240
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.780
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.130
And then 3 minus minus 3, so
that's equal to 3 plus 3, so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.340
that's equal to 6.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.680
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.510
1 minus 1 is 0, negative 1.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.930
And then 3 minus negative
3, that's 6.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.390
I always want to make sure I
don't make a careless mistake.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.230
Now, let me get rid of this
entry right here.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.590
Let me zero that out.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.780
So let me replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.880
times the second row.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.980
So we have 0 minus--
well, 2 times 0.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.760
That's just going to be 0.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.790
2 minus 2 times 1, that's
2 minus 2, that's 0.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.980
3 minus 2 times 2, that's
3 minus 4, or minus 1.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.130
And then finally, minus 5
minus 2 times minus 3.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.380
Let me write that down.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.390
That's minus 5, minus minus 6.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.089
That's minus 5 plus
6 is equal to 1.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.680
I really wanted to make
sure I didn't make a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.220
careless mistake there.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.110
So that is equal to 1.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.540
So I'm almost done, but I'm
still not in reduced row

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.760
echelon form.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.260
This has to be a positive
1 in order to get there.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.670
It can't be anything
other than a 1.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.980
That's just the style of reduced
row echelon form.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.390
And then these guys up here
have to be zeroed out.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.990
Well, the easy thing to do,
let me just multiply this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.130
equation by minus 1.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.490
So then this becomes a plus 1
and that becomes a minus 1.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.120
And then I just need to zero
out these two guys up here.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.810
So let's do it.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.980
So my equation, I'm going to
keep my third row the same.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.410
My third row is now
0, 0, 1, minus 1.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.330
And now I want to zero
this guy out.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.420
So what I can do is I could set
my first row equal to my

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.970
first row plus my last row,
because if these two add up,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.730
they're going to
be equal to 0.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.580
So what do I get?

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.590
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.680
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.050
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.390
6 plus minus 1 is 5.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.300
Now, I want to zero
this row out.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.560
And to zero this row out, what
I can do is I'll replace it

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.490
with the second row minus
2 times the first row.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.580
So 0 minus 2 times
0 is just 0.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.990
1 minus 2 times 0 is just 1.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.320
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.180
Minus 3 minus 2 times
negative 1.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.040
Let me write that down.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.060
Minus 3 minus 2 times minus 1.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.960
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.070
So what is that equal to?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:14.390
This is equal to minus 3 minus
minus 2, or minus 3 plus 2,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.790
which is equal to minus 1.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.830
So that's equal to minus 1.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.220
And now I have my augmented
matrix in

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.990
reduced row echelon form.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.290
My pivot entries are the only
entries in their columns.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.690
Each pivot entry in each
successive row is to the right

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.190
of the pivot entry before it.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.040
And actually, I have
no free variables.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.000
Every column has
a pivot entry.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.780
So let's go back from the
augmented matrix world and

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.550
kind of put back our
variables there.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.440
So what do we get?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:59.980
We get x plus 0y plus
0z is equal to 5.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.050
That's that row right there.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:10.230
We get 0x plus 1y plus 0z
is equal to minus 1.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.260
That's that row right there.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.000
And then finally, we have
0x plus 0y plus 1z is

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.740
equal to minus 1.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.590
That's that row right there.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.510
And just like that, we've
actually solved our system of

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.600
three equations with
three unknowns.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.570
That's the solution
right there.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.570
I just wrote it in this way
just so you can see the

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.610
corresponding, but obviously,
I could have written them

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.875
closer to their equal sign.

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:36.260
So hopefully, you found
that vaguely useful.
