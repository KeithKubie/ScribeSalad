NATE BROOLING: So, hi, guys.

00:00:01.287 --> 00:00:02.328
My name is Nate Brooling.

00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:03.960
I sit across the
street over in sales,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.630
look after the
Microsoft business.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.600
So nice to meet you.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.410
We're here today because of a
good friend of mine, Erik Fay,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.800
was talking to me
about this fantastic

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.810
story and this incredible woman
and team behind her as well.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.630
So he asked, you
know, hey, would

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.130
be possible to have a chat at
Google, and I said absolutely.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.910
Let's do this.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060
So I have the pleasure
of introducing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.500
Barbara Arrowsmith-Young today.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.470
And today's talk is going to
be about a personal journey

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.050
into the world of the
brain, shaping the mind.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.220
Such a cool title, right?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.670
Very exciting.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.612
I've got three kids, so I'm
watching my kids develop over

00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:41.570
the years, and it's just
been incredible to me.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.670
And I cannot wait to see
what we're about to see.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.299
So I'm going to be quick.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.340
But before I bring her
up, a bit more about her--

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.220
she holds a bachelor in
applied science, child studies,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.280
a masters in school psychology
from the University of Toronto.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.150
Her work began in 1978,
and it's been recognized

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.460
as one of the first examples
of practical application

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.250
of neural plasticity,
which simply means

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.390
the ability of the brain
to change and rewire itself

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.470
over one's lifetime.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.210
It's fantastic.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.980
The genesis of the program
lies in Barbara's own journey

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.850
of discovery and innovation
to overcome her learning

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.459
disabilities, a description
of which appears in her book

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:23.250
that you guys have.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.060
So thank you for
bringing those today.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.750
And there will be a
signing afterwards.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840
And the name of the book
is titled "The Woman

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.420
Who Changed Her Brain."

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.519
Many reviewers have
written about her book.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.060
To share one of the
quotes-- I really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.080
like this one-- "It will open
your mind to new possibilities

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.580
and how to deal with
traffic jams in the brain."

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.740
So I know a lot of us,
especially at Google, we

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.440
have a lot of traffic
jams, sounds fitting.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.520
Her life has been a quest
to help individuals address

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.650
learning difficulties
so they can

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.100
experience the ease
and joy of learning

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.650
as well as achieve their dreams.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.740
This program is
in over 91 schools

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.010
across several countries,
Canada, USA, Australia, New

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.226
Zealand, Malaysia,
Thailand, and South Korea.

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:10.850
So I'm really excited
to have her here.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.101
Let's give her a warm welcome.

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:12.600
Thank you.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.284
Thank

00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:16.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.470
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG:
And I'm sorry, guys,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.761
one more thing before we start.

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.470
Please silence your phones.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470
Thank you.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.540
Well, I want to thank Erik Fay
for making the introduction

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.370
and thank you Nate for
providing me the opportunity

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.390
to speak about what I'm
most passionate about,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.120
which is our human
brain is incredible

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.760
complexity and the
possibility for change.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.820
It's sort of what
I'm probably most

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.510
passionate about in the world.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.390
And my life and
my work has really

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.170
been an exploration of the
territory of the human brain,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.067
how it makes us
uniquely who we are.

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:52.650
Because when we think
about our brain,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.477
it filters our
perceptions of ourselves

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:55.935
and our understanding
of ourselves,

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:57.680
our understanding
of other people,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.888
our understanding of the
world, and our understanding

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.100
of our relationship to that.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.280
So really, really
critical in terms

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.190
of mediating our experience.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.680
And to me, what's really
promising is not only

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.140
does our brain shape
who we are, but now

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.450
we know with this concept
of neuroplasticity

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.690
that we can actually
shape our brain

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.449
if we can understand how we
can harness those principles.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.240
And also I think what's
really interesting,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.990
we often hear the
comment about he

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.580
or she is just not good at that.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.390
And we often attribute not
being good at something

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.640
as coming out of maybe
an emotional base.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.070
You know, that
person is just rude

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.100
or they're not good socially.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.670
And I would like
to encourage people

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.560
to start to look at behavior
through a cognitive lens.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.390
I mean, behavior's
multiply determined.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.860
It's not just cognitive.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.860
But I think we
ignore the cognitive.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.790
If there's any part
of our brain that

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.230
isn't fully operational
or functioning,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.130
it will have an impact
in terms of our behavior.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.810
And I'm going to take you a
little bit into that world

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.270
today.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.830
So science has taught
us that, as I said,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.740
our brain really does shape us.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.670
And if we think about
how complex it is,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.550
we have something on the
order of 86 billion neurons

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.226
that we're carrying
around in our head.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.100
And to put that into
perspective, the world's

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.800
population is somewhere
between 7 and 8 billion,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.660
so incredible complexity.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.630
And we have several hundred
trillion connections

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.079
or superhighways in the brain,
connecting different regions

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.390
for neural transmission
and communication.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.510
And again, to put
that into perspective,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.150
we have more
connections in our brain

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.280
than all the stars in the Milky
Way galaxy-- so incredibly

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.250
complex.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.960
And we can't really
escape our brain,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.690
because we carry it
everywhere we go.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.670
Also what I find
really fascinating

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.909
is no two brains
are exactly alike.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.950
So if you think about
somebody that you know well

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.784
or you look at somebody
sitting next to you,

00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:48.783
and you note that there
are physical differences

00:04:48.783 --> 00:04:49.916
between the two of you.

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:52.040
You may have different eye
color or different shape

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.370
of your nose, different
shape of your ears.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.460
There are actually
more differences

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.050
between your two brains than all
of those physical differences

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.860
combined.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.500
So our brain really does
make us uniquely who we are.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.520
And to me, as I said what's
really, really promising

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.560
is this concept of
neuroplasticity.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.847
We now know that we can actually
grow new neurons in the brain,

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.180
in the hippocampus, which is
really important for memory

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.600
and for learning.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.580
We know that we can
increase neurotransmitters.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.440
We know that we can increase
the branches, the dendrites,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.990
on the neurons to enhance
neural transmission.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.770
So we can actually
change our brain.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.910
So my story begins
with my brain.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.380
And it's really a
story of a quest

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.470
and a hunt for a solution
to my very severe learning

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.350
disabilities that were
identified in grade 1.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.720
So it's a very personal
story, but it's also

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.730
universal in that each
and every one of us

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.879
has a brain that
impacts our functioning.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.670
And if we think about
having a brain that's

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.300
capable and incapable
at the same time,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.070
that's the experience of someone
with a learning difficulty.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.270
There are things that
we can do very easily,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.353
and then there are other
things that with the best

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:03.320
will in the world they're
really incredibly challenging.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.870
And that certainly
was my experience.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.710
So for me growing up,
I lived in a world

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.260
that was about as intelligible
as Lewis Carroll's poem

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.050
"The Jabberwocky."

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.880
I didn't understand
it at the time

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.860
that I couldn't
process language.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.750
It was almost like
I heard the words.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.020
I mean, I knew what
the words were,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.400
but I struggled
to interpret them,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.100
to attach meaning to them.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.384
So for me, I could understand
things very concretely.

00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:30.300
I mean, if somebody said
it's raining outside,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.230
which I understand it does
quite a bit here in Seattle,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.920
I could understand that
because I could conjure up

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.720
a visual image of rain.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.000
But as soon as it got
abstract, conceptual, it

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.520
was impossible to me.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.350
Something as simple
as-- you know,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.560
I couldn't understand
how my aunt could also

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.862
be my mother's sister.

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:48.820
I could not understand.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.360
How could somebody
have two relationships?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.790
In terms of numbers, I
mean, I could understand 1

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.180
because I could put
one object up here.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.870
I could understand 4 because
I could line up four objects.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.040
You put that 1 over
top of a 4, which

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.350
is a relationship of a part to
a whole, it meant nothing to me.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.230
Bigger than, greater
than, less than, under,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.070
over, anything that had
a relational connotation

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.600
was incredibly difficult
or impossible for me

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.670
to understand.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.840
My notebooks were
filled with diagrams.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.890
I used my right hemisphere
to try to interpret language

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.880
by making drawings to try to
connect the relationships.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.230
Things as simple as
jokes-- I didn't understand

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.960
jokes because it
depends on irony.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.764
So not wanting to feel left
out as a child, what I would do

00:07:35.764 --> 00:07:37.680
is I would laugh as much
as everybody else was

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.440
laughing because I didn't
want to feel left out.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.300
But I had no idea what
they were laughing at.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.089
I was really vulnerable
to con artists

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.380
because how do you understand
that you're being conned?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.750
You hear logical inconsistency
is what somebody was saying.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.260
Well, for me, there was
no logic in my world

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.640
so there were no
logical inconsistency.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.450
So, you know, I easily
believed what people told me.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.970
And something as simple
as telling time-- I

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.520
couldn't read an analog clock.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.970
In fact, I couldn't read an
analog clock until I was 26

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.000
and created my first
exercise for myself

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.182
because to interpret
time, you have

00:08:12.182 --> 00:08:14.140
to understand the
relationship between the hour

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.806
hand and the minute
hand, and I couldn't

00:08:15.806 --> 00:08:18.620
understand that relationship.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.010
So any kind of abstract
ideas, concepts were hard.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.080
I got identified in grade 1
as being rigid and stubborn.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.180
And I really was rigid
and stubborn, but again,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.950
not coming from an
emotional place.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.150
It was a cognitive difficulty.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.650
Because for me, any kind of
understanding was so hard won.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.760
So if I came to
understand something,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.970
I wanted to hold onto
it for dear life.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.479
And if somebody
said, well, think

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:46.020
about another way
of doing something,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.870
think about an
alternative, it felt

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.800
like I had to let go of
this that was so hard for me

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.070
to grasp to integrate
something else.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.770
And I just felt my whole
world would fall apart.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.490
So maybe in your lives
you know somebody

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.110
that's really
rigid and stubborn,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.940
and it might be because they
can't compare and contrast.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.270
They can't see alternatives or
weigh decisions or differences.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.830
And what ended up
happening in my life

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.180
was that very fragmented and
fractured view of my world--

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.680
because nothing connected.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.540
There was no cause and
effect in my world.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.873
In fact, I thought there was
some puppet master up there

00:09:19.873 --> 00:09:21.300
pulling strings
because I couldn't

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.110
understand why things happened.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.480
It led to an incredibly
fractured and fragmented sense

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.360
of myself.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.920
And I described
my world as living

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.130
in a fog where meaning
was just ephemeral,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.210
and it would disappear into
a mist of just uncertainty,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.410
and kind of joke that I
lived in amygdala hell.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.290
I was terrified all
the time because I

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.350
didn't understand the meaning
of what was happening around me.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.700
And if that wasn't enough,
I had another difficulty.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.040
So I had what would be
considered multiple learning

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.120
disabilities.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.660
So I struggled to register
the location of sensation

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.940
on the left side of my body.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.550
So most people, if you go to
put your hand on a hot burner,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.450
your brain is going
to tell you pain.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.850
It's going to tell you
pain in your left hand.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.480
Pull it up.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.590
And I mean, it's going to be
just an automatic process.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.423
You're not going to
stop and think about it.

00:10:08.423 --> 00:10:10.467
Well for me, my brain
would tell me pain,

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:12.800
but it wouldn't register where
the pain was coming from.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.300
So I'd leave my hand on
the hot burner, which

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.070
really wasn't a very good idea.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.630
So I learned, probably
around age three or four,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.836
that I had to watch the
left side of my body

00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:23.960
because it would do things.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.380
It was almost like
an alien being.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.590
It would do things.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.950
I slammed a car door on my
head once with my left hand

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.740
and shattered a tooth.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.440
My mother was convinced
by probably about age 5

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.750
that I would not live
very long because I

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.030
was so accident-prone.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.090
But it was a cognitive area
that just wouldn't register

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.880
the location of sensation.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.910
And imagine me on a sports team.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.400
I mean, I struggled
academically.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.490
Nobody wanted me on their
sports team in school,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.630
and I understood why.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.330
Like, I truly wasn't an
asset because I was so clumsy

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.550
and ended up being bruised and
banged and kind of battered.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.190
And then imagine
me driving a car.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.460
If I didn't know where
the left side of my body

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.967
was, once I started
to drive a car,

00:11:05.967 --> 00:11:08.050
I didn't know where the
left side of that car was.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.900
So not only was my body
bruised and banged--

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.640
it was actually my parents'
car, because when I first

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.670
started driving, their car was
bruised and banged and dented

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.620
on the left side by extension.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.260
And then there was another
area that wasn't working,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.920
the area that allows
you to represent

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.080
three dimensional
space inside your head.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.930
I couldn't do that.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.130
So I couldn't create
maps inside my head.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.020
Geography, geometry
any activity-- chess,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.330
checkers-- that involved
a spatial component was

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.940
really, really hard for me.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.100
And again, things that
we take for granted

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.690
like crossing the street was
really terrifying because when

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.430
you cross the street,
what you actually

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.070
do, kind of
automatically, is you

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.320
create a mental map of where
you are relative to that car

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.930
coming at you.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.680
I couldn't do that,
so I had no idea where

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.380
I was relative to that car.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.790
So my compensation
was to walk blocks out

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.040
of my way to find a stop
sign or a stop light

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.230
where I knew cars had
to stop and then would

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.740
be relatively safe crossing.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.050
Or my other strategy was to
wait by the side of the road

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.717
until somebody else
came along to cross,

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:12.216
and I would follow
them, and I would

00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:14.800
pray that they didn't have
the same difficulty that I did

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.000
and that we'd get across safely.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.800
And I used to joke that I
would be as safe crossing

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.311
the street with my eyes
closed as with my eyes open,

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.560
which was probably pretty
accurate, because I couldn't

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.740
do that spatial representation.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.130
And I would always get
lost because for me, there

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.320
were no maps.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.500
I didn't even understand
that streets connected.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.620
So I couldn't hold any kind
of spatial representation

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.210
in my head.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.770
So any time I went
somewhere, I had to calculate

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.100
in what I called "lost time."

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.210
So I would always
give myself extra time

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.420
because I knew I would get lost
several times before I finally

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.330
found my way.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.530
And so those were some of
the areas, the main ones,

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.820
that I struggled with.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.536
And so for me, when I began
my schooling in the 1950s,

00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:01.910
it was in the time
of what I call

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.890
the pre-neuroplastic paradigm.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.640
So when I started in grade
1, the traditional belief

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.580
was, if you have
a learning problem

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.264
or there's a problem
in your brain,

00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:12.430
nothing you can do about it.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.210
Basically the brain you're born
with is the brain you die with.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.210
There was no concept
of neuroplasticity.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.770
In fact, people
believed there was

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.060
no such thing as
neuroplasticity-- most people.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.310
So in grade 1, I overheard
my teacher tell my mother

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.940
that I had a mental
block, because this

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.230
was before the term "learning
disability" had even

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.330
been invented.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.450
And being very concrete,
I just actually

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.950
imagined that I had
a piece of wood,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.940
like a nice wooden cube,
lodged in my head that

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.260
made learning really
difficult. And later I

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.580
learned I didn't have a
wooden cube, but in a sense,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.962
I had blockages.

00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:45.420
There were parts of my brain
that weren't working properly.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.550
But imagine, like in grade 1,
I was given a life sentence,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.210
told that I would never
learn like other children,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.110
that all of my
academic career would

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.180
be an incredible struggle,
and that I was really

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.150
condemned to living in that
world of disconnected elements

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.180
and confusion and fog.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.860
And that really
was my experience

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.650
going through school.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.480
I did eventually learn how
to read and to write and do

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.210
kind of simple numeracy.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.540
I used my strengths.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.122
I have a verbatim
auditory memory.

00:14:14.122 --> 00:14:16.580
I can listen to things and just
like a little tape recorder

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.140
remember them.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.240
And I have a photographic visual
memory, so I can look at print

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.829
and remember.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:23.120
And that's what got me through.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.720
And I had incredible
drive and determination.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.080
So I never understood anything.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.000
I could memorize it and then
match it up on the exam.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.010
And I would get anywhere
from 10% on an exam to 100%,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.610
depending if I made
the right match.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.944
The 10%, you know, I
made a really bad match

00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:39.360
because I didn't
really understand

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.390
what was being asked.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.820
The 100%, I made a better
match, probably really

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.320
didn't understand
what was going on,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.760
but I just was lucky
to make a better match.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.630
But what my teachers
would conclude,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.800
if I could get 100% at
one point and I got 10%,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.470
I must not have worked
very hard for that 10%.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.090
And I worked as hard for the
10% as I did for the 100%.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:03.630
So certainly, it was a
confusing picture for teachers.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.310
So I was very, very lucky.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.922
My father was a scientist
and an inventor,

00:15:07.922 --> 00:15:09.630
had something on the
order of 40 patents.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.500
He conditioned electricity.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.301
And I kind of caught that
creative passion from him.

00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:16.550
I really didn't understand
anything that he was doing,

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.770
but I felt that
desire to create.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.360
And he told me as
I was growing up,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.082
he said, if there's a
problem in your life,

00:15:25.082 --> 00:15:27.040
and there's no solution
out there in the world,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.414
he said, it's your
responsibility

00:15:28.414 --> 00:15:32.122
to go out and find a solution
to the problem, kind of probably

00:15:32.122 --> 00:15:33.330
like what all of you do here.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.360
You find solutions to problems.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.390
And he also said
something really wise

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.810
that I've taken with
me through my life.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.129
He said, don't be limited
by conventional wisdom.

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:44.920
He said, if the rest
of the world tells you

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.290
you can't do this,
he said, ignore them.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.220
Don't listen.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.540
Go out and do it.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.580
So I set on a quest
to try to find

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.660
a solution to my difficulties.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:00.000
And for me, the solution came--
two brilliant researchers.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.080
The first one, Alexander Luria,
a Russian neuropsychologist

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.744
doing a lot of work in Russia
after World War II, where

00:16:05.744 --> 00:16:07.660
there were a lot of
Russian soldiers with very

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.090
localized head wounds.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.050
And what he would do was
investigate, clinically,

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.790
by giving them tests to try
to understand if there's

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.390
damage to this part of the
brain, what can the person no

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.120
longer do?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.980
Therefore by inference, what
does that part of the brain do?

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.150
And he's really one of
the seminal thinkers

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.150
in neuropsychology
and neuroscience

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.630
that started to map the
brain many, many years ago.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.260
So he helped with
identification of the function

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.970
of different parts of the brain.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.780
And I came across a
book that he had written

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.620
called "The Man with
the Shattered World,"

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.730
and it was a story of
a Russian soldier who,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.680
in 1943 in the
battle of Smolensk,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.380
had a shrapnel wound
to a part of his brain

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.200
in the left hemisphere,
very localized wound.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.020
And as I read this
man's story, I thought,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.150
this man is living my life
several decades earlier

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.250
and halfway around
the world in Russia.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.660
He was using the same
language in his journal,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.140
talking about living
in a fog where

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.070
meaning was ephemeral
and would disappear

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.900
that I was using
in my journal, you

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.680
know, decades later
and in Canada.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.376
So I had an epiphany
at that point

00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:12.000
because I knew I had
terrible problems,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.890
but I had no idea what the
source of the problems were.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.400
And to solve a
problem, you kind of

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.230
have to get an idea of what
the nature of the problem is.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.339
So now into the nature.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.730
I knew it was part of my brain
that wasn't working properly.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.480
So that was great.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.240
But then what do
I do about that?

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.730
The next piece of
the puzzle came

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.440
in the work of Mark Rosenzweig.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.170
And he was in Berkeley
working with rats

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.350
because they're a lot easier
to work with the people.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.990
And what he was
doing was putting

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.910
rats in a really
enriched environment,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.890
with a lot of
stimulation, then he

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.900
would compare them
to rats in a normal

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.600
or an unenriched environment.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.240
And he would put them in little
rat intelligence tests, which

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.770
is running a maze, and
he found those rats

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.140
that had had the
enriched experience were

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.107
able to learn the maze much more
efficiently and effectively.

00:17:57.107 --> 00:17:59.440
And then because they were
rats, he cut their heads open

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.565
and looked at their brains.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.640
And what he found was the brains
had changed physiologically

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.960
for those rats that
had the enrichment.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.410
There were more
neurotransmitters.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.826
There were more-- you can see
you the slide of the neuron,

00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:15.680
more dendrite, so more
synaptic connections

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.930
if there are more dendritic
branches, more glial

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.740
cells, enlarged capillaries,
so more blood flowing

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.110
to the regions.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.220
I think there are something like
12 physiological variables that

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.620
had changed with
the enrichment that

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.270
led to-- he inferred--
the improved

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.990
performance on the mazes.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.790
So I had to infer, even
though nobody was looking

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.960
at it at that time, or
believe, that if rats

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.130
had neuroplasticity, humans like
we must have neuroplasticity,

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.880
and I kind of thought
that we probably had

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.110
more neuroplasticity than rats.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.900
So I thought if, you know,
I can take Lurie's work

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.070
and understand the nature of
what that part of the brain

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.740
is supposed to do,
like what's its job

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.660
and what's its
function, maybe I could

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.660
find an activity or
a task that would

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.280
stimulate it to make it work.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.270
And I figured, it might not
work, because the rest of world

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.010
was saying it
couldn't, but what did

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.450
I have to lose other than time?

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.362
And I was 25, 26.

00:19:10.362 --> 00:19:11.820
I couldn't tell
time, so I figured,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.150
what does it really matter?

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.180
Let me try it.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.769
So at the age of 26, I set
out with the first exercise,

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:20.560
and what did I use?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.700
I used clocks-- not that
I wanted to get better

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.960
at telling time,
but the concept is,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.740
you need to force the brain
to do what it's designed to do

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.040
but what is really
difficult. And I

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.640
couldn't do the
relational piece, so used

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.980
the clocks to force
processing relationships.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.480
And I got really fast at reading
a two-handed clock really

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:41.980
accurate.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.509
I mean, I was pretty
abysmal at the beginning,

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:45.300
and that was great.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.883
So now I could tell
time, but I didn't

00:19:46.883 --> 00:19:48.480
feel any cognitive change.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.790
And to drive
neuroplastic change,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.370
you have to increase
novelty and complexity.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.510
So what I did is I kept adding
more hands, more relationships.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.560
And now we have a
10-handed clock,

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.332
which anybody can benefit.

00:20:01.332 --> 00:20:03.290
The only two people that
have ever looked at it

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.540
and interpreted it, one
had discovered quasars,

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.590
radio-emitting galaxies.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.600
He was an astronomer.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.480
And the other was a
physicist from Harvard.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.000
So I knew I was on to something
with this really advanced

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.770
level.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.540
And in fact, right
now I'm talking

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.080
to a university in
Spain, and they're

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.780
looking at putting
that reasoning exercise

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.930
into their universities,
so every student

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.850
will go into a cognitive lab
and work on that exercise four

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:28.730
hours a week.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.460
And over a 10-month
span, we'll supercharge

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.400
that cognitive function in
terms of being able to reason.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.510
And it's that ability to process
relationships simultaneously.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.967
It's insight, like
all this information,

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:42.300
disparate information, comes
together, and you say, aha.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.370
That's what that means.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.220
That's what this function is.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.250
And also what I
found interesting

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.835
is I've worked with a
number of psychiatrists.

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.260
My head school's in Toronto,
and as Nate mentioned,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.843
there are schools
all around the world

00:20:56.843 --> 00:20:58.210
that implement this program.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.970
And if somebody
has this problem,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.180
they can't benefit
from insight therapy.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.241
Because insight
therapy means that you

00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:05.490
have to make cause and effect.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.615
You have to see relationships
between your behavior

00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:10.130
and emotions and other
people's actions.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.630
And as students work
on this exercise,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.400
if they're in a therapeutic
process, what the psychiatrist

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.270
or psychologist always
reports is at the level-- it's

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.550
about the four relationship
level of the exercise

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.710
they start to benefit
from insight therapy.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.620
So really very profound
capacity, not that's

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.940
just going to affect
the person in school

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.500
but in their whole life.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.070
And I've had some
students that have

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.160
come to me that have
been misdiagnosed

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.000
as having Asperger's, which
is a high functioning autism,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.660
because they have a severe
difficulty in this function.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.410
And as we address this function,
it's very clear that they

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.370
don't have Asperger's.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.570
It was just they couldn't
connect meaning to situations.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.810
So they walked around totally
disengaged and not able

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.260
to relate to the world.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.940
So pretty important area.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.470
And as I worked on this
and saw the change,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.030
for me, what happened
was I could now

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.090
start to live in what
I call real time.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.540
Whereas before, I lived
in what I called lag time.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.210
Because if I listened
to a conversation,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.250
I would memorize it.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.150
I would have that little
tape recorder going,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.460
and I would walk away and maybe
go over and over and over it

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.830
for two, three hours
to try to understand

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.390
what were those people saying.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.860
And in some cases, I could,
and in some cases I couldn't.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.080
But even if I could,
it was three hours

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.860
after the conversation,
so I couldn't be

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.979
part of that human discourse.

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.270
Now I could listen to somebody.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.960
I could understand
as they were talking.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.710
I could actually make a
comment and interject,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.310
understand what
they said back to me

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.510
I was actually part
of human discourse,

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.180
and it was very, very profound.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.412
I could also now
grasp math concepts.

00:22:48.412 --> 00:22:49.620
I could understand fractions.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.190
I went back and taught myself
all of elementary, high school,

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.880
and college mathematics.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.200
And now I could understand
it from first principles

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.800
rather than just
memorizing formulas

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.730
and plugging in numbers.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.880
I was no longer
rigid because I could

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.520
contrast and compare and weigh
decisions and see alternatives.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.380
I could understand jokes.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.330
I could tell time.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.530
And I was no longer
vulnerable to con artists.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.200
So all of that changed as
a result of one cognitive

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.220
exercise.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.140
So then I thought, can
I create an exercise

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.460
to address the two other
problems that I talked about?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.400
The first one, the
somatosensory cortex,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.480
which you have two strips on
either side of your brain,

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.810
the somatosensory
cortex here controls

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.210
registering and location of
sensation on your left side,

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.650
and then this one
controls the right side.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.740
So I knew there to
create an exercise,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.890
I had to do something
with my eyes closed

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.850
because my compensation was
with my eyes watching what

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.350
that side of my body was doing
and really regulate movement

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.750
through vision not
through sensory feedback.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.220
So I created a whole complex
exercise of doing movements

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.030
with that side of
my body with my eyes

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.710
closed and overcame
that problem.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.380
I can now register sensation
on the left side of my body,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.409
the location of sensation.

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:04.450
I don't bump into things.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.460
I don't trip over my
feet, all of that,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.710
because I didn't know-- if
I went to walk out a door,

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.974
I'd just as likely hit
the door frame as go

00:24:11.974 --> 00:24:14.140
through the middle of the
door because I didn't know

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.930
where the side of my body was.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.430
So address that.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.340
Also, if I picked up
something in my left hand,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.740
the first row in the audience
might end up wearing it,

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.430
because I couldn't
regulate movement.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.200
So I would over move or
under move or drop things.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.730
I can do all that now.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.160
And to me what's powerful
if we can understand

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.446
this concept of neuroplasticity
is we're not teaching skills.

00:24:34.446 --> 00:24:35.570
We're not teaching content.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:41.800
We're not teaching the person
how to do or learn an activity.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.290
We're changing the
brain's capacity

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.090
to then learn, to learn
content, to learn strategies,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.370
to learn information.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.600
And given that we carry our
brain with us everywhere,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.200
it's incredibly powerful
to go under the content,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.380
into the brain, and
stimulate that function.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.870
And then the other
area, in the parietal,

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.410
this is a spatial area.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.610
And again, I knew to
create an exercise there

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.770
that I had to do something
with a spatial component

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.020
and do it over and over again.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.070
So I created an exercise
and saw the change.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.780
And now I think in
the last three years

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.810
I've gone around the world a few
times talking about this work,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.310
and I don't get lost.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.950
I can actually read maps.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.650
And I can navigate.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:32.000
I can actually go to IKEA and
buy one of those bookcases

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.770
or cupboards and go from a
two dimensional representation

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.350
and build a three
dimensional representation,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.380
which before I couldn't.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.880
I would put the
back of the bookcase

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.380
on upside down and backwards
because you can't translate

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.020
two dimensional representation
into three dimensional space.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.680
I can do that now.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.910
And for me, those words
"some assembly required"

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.940
before would strike
terror into my heart.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.920
I mean now, I know I
can assemble things.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.910
And interestingly, some of
these are genetic, inherited.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.980
My mother and I both
had severe difficulty.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.650
And these things
work on a continuum.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.475
You can be exceptionally
strong in an area.

00:26:09.475 --> 00:26:10.850
You can have
average functioning.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.766
You can have a mild
problem, moderate problem,

00:26:12.766 --> 00:26:15.482
severe problem, so
anywhere on the continuum.

00:26:15.482 --> 00:26:17.440
My mother and I were at
the severe end of this.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.937
And as a child, getting into
the car with my mother--

00:26:19.937 --> 00:26:21.270
I mean, she had a good attitude.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.600
She said it's going to be an
adventure because neither of us

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.880
had any maps in our head.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.630
So we kind of knew
where we were starting.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.380
We knew sort of where
we wanted to end up,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.970
but it was like a
black hole in between.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.390
And she said, we'll always get
there, which we always did.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.450
And we never got there
the same way twice.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.220
But, you know, it
was an adventure.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.330
But as I got older and
kind of understood more

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.870
about these cognitive
functions, I asked her,

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.690
did this ever have an impact
other than it took you

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.140
longer to get anywhere?

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.820
And so she shared with me
when she'd gone to university,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.180
she'd wanted to be a chemist,
but in her first year

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.550
I was encouraged
to drop chemistry

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.780
and she went into
home economics.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.640
She couldn't construct
those molecules,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.360
like that spatial
representation inside your head.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.950
It was just impossible for her.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.490
And I really struggled
also with organic chemistry

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.630
because of this
difficulty in university.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.200
Interestingly again, as
they work on a continuum,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.210
I have four brothers.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.410
And my oldest brother
has this at a mild level,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.480
not enough to interfere
with him becoming

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.970
a chemist, which he did, at
the University of Toronto.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.890
But he became a physical
chemist because it still

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.496
was hard for him to
construct those molecules.

00:27:28.496 --> 00:27:29.870
So what I've
learned in this work

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.660
is that there's no
free ride, in a sense.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.900
If there's a cognitive
area of difficulty,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.250
it will have some impact.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.330
It just depends on what it is,
the degree that it's there,

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.920
and what you're
doing in your life

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.210
in terms of whether
it limits you.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.160
So in the work
that I've created,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.491
I currently can identify
19 cognitive functions.

00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:55.740
And if people are interested,
on our website down here

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.390
at the bottom, there's
a cognitive profile

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.090
questionnaire.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.410
I think there's about
250 questions on it.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.620
You can go in and
answer these questions.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.950
It's all confidential.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.360
And at the end, based
on your responses,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.259
it'll give you a profile
of where, by your answers,

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:14.300
suggesting that there
might be some difficulties.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.790
And then you go on the website
and read more information,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.380
if somebody is interested.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.335
So currently we have programs
for 18 cognitive functions.

00:28:21.335 --> 00:28:23.210
And I'm very clear that
this isn't everything

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.050
that can go wrong with learning,
but it's a really broad range

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.060
from the person that struggles
with nonverbal interpretation

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.080
of situations.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.380
Face blindness I
have a program for,

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.710
a person that can't
recognize landmarks

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.030
so can't navigate because
they don't remember

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.230
the look of a place;
spatial, the person that gets

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.430
lost because they can't
hold maps or three

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.240
dimensional representation;
auditory memory, the person

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.220
that just can't
hold information;

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.090
numeracy, the person that
doesn't understand number--

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.590
so a broad range of
different cognitive deficits.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.950
And for me, you know, if
you're working on an area,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.120
you first need to identify
where the problem is.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.067
And if anybody
hears somebody say,

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:06.900
this one program is
going to fix everything,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.921
I would say run as quickly as
you can in the other direction.

00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:12.420
Because in terms of the brain,
there's no one size fits all.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.000
We have an incredibly
complex organ here,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.800
and I believe for something
to work effectively,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.860
it has to be differentiated,
targeted stimulation

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.149
to that function.

00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:24.940
And for example, if we
think about reading,

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.220
this is blood flow study
looking at all the brain

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.100
areas that come together
when somebody is reading.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.060
So there is no reading
area in the brain.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.120
The brain works in what
Luria called a functional

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.290
system, what we now call
a neural network, where

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:40.640
multiple areas come together,
each one having its own task.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.760
So there's eye tracking.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.990
There's phonemic awareness.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.600
There's sound symbol
correspondence

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.070
to hear the speech sounds.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.210
There's visual memory to
hold the speech pattern, eye

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.190
tracking to learn
kind of a motor plan

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.290
for the eye for reading.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.726
All of these are critical.

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:57.100
So if a child or an individual's
struggling with reading,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.600
it might be any
combination of these.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.250
The individuals we work with
may have different components.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.720
The individuals we see that
really are probably never going

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.800
to get past a grade 2 or
3 level reading, unless we

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.880
do this cognitive work, have
all of these areas impacted.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.420
So there's no
piece that they can

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.040
use to compensate for
their difficulties

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.060
because every single one related
to reading is problematic.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.060
So if you want to
see where you are

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.560
in one of these
cognitive functions,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.417
and you can keep
it confidential,

00:30:27.417 --> 00:30:29.000
I think probably
everybody in the room

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.541
here has seen a cat at some
point in their existence.

00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:34.290
So this is an area in
the right hemisphere

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.694
that holds the look of things.

00:30:35.694 --> 00:30:37.360
So if you want to
just close your eyes--

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.500
you don't have to
do it-- and see.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.480
Can you actually see
in your mind's eye

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.670
or call up on the screen an
image or a picture of a cat, so

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.660
whoever wants to try it.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.170
And then if you want to open
up your eyes and kind of

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:53.992
see how you did.

00:30:53.992 --> 00:30:56.450
So some people are going to
see like a really, vivid, clear

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.342
image of the cat.

00:30:59.342 --> 00:31:00.800
Some people it
would be less clear.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.640
And some individuals
are just going

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.090
to see the back
of their eyelids.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.010
And I often call this the
refrigerator dysfunction.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.400
This is where the
person just doesn't hold

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.932
the visual details of objects.

00:31:13.932 --> 00:31:16.140
So they open the fridge
door, and they say, you know,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.110
where's the mustard?

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.339
Where's the ketchup?

00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:19.880
I think you like
ketchup better here.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.882
We like mustard more in Canada.

00:31:21.882 --> 00:31:24.460
[CHUCKLING]

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.210
Because you don't hold
the picture of what

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.740
you're looking for, or
you don't like shopping--

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.790
if somebody has trouble here--
because you walk by what you're

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.150
looking for multiple
times before you just

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.250
recognize, OK, yeah, that the
Cheerios or whatever it is.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.280
You miss details.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.820
This will be the person
that their wife maybe

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.580
goes and gets a
make over and they

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.480
don't notice that
something is different,

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.620
because they're not holding
the visual look of what

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.210
was there before and comparing
it to what's there now.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.500
If someone's strong here,
they'll navigate by landmarks.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.800
They'll go someplace once
and they'll remember vividly

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.000
what it looks like and
where they have to turn

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.740
or they're really good
with visual imagery.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.930
I worked with a student
who was studying

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.380
to be an illustrator in Canada,
and she had this difficulty--

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.020
not massively but enough that
when she would draw a cat,

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.460
she'd leave off the whiskers.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.980
Or when she'd draw a coat,
she'd leave off the buttons.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.340
And that was kind of
a problem if you're

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.230
going to be an
Illustrator because you

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.740
need to get the details down.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.960
So actually she was
one of the first people

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.500
I created this exercise
for, and we worked on it.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.810
She improved this function.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.450
And now she's won awards in
Canada for her illustrations.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.910
So she doesn't miss
details anymore.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.290
One person I worked
with shared with me

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.380
that she really
hated to meditate.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.754
She had this difficulty.

00:32:39.754 --> 00:32:41.670
And I mean, she could
do breathing meditation,

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.590
but she couldn't do
visual imagery meditation.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.381
So someone would tell
her to close her eyes

00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:48.650
and go to her happy place, well,
she just saw a black screen.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.590
So it definitely
doesn't necessarily

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.800
impact the person in school,
per se, in academic learning

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.560
but definitely in life.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.312
If people know
Oliver Sacks's book,

00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:02.020
"The Man Who Mistook
His Wife for a Hat."

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.020
That's this cognitive function.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.520
I have worked with some people
that have had traumatic brain

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.340
injury.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.620
And one of the students
I work with here

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.070
had massive right
hemisphere damage.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.990
He'd been hit by a
truck when he was 12,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.650
and I saw him when he
was in his early 30s.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.500
And the first day he
came into my school,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.760
he tried to exit
through a filing cabinet

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.350
because it was rectangular.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.450
It had a handle.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.250
To him, it looked like a door.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.200
We worked on this.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.100
And what was so amazing,
not only could he

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.630
eventually recognize
objects and landmarks,

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.500
but he developed a
visual sense of humor

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.050
because the whole visual
world became alive for him,

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.550
and he could see irony.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.290
This area is also related
to face blindness and face

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.180
recognition.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.500
So somebody that has
a difficulty here,

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.820
if they see somebody in context,
so they see their neighbor

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.590
on the porch in the
front house, they'll

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.299
know who that person is.

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:56.090
Five minutes later,
they'll see that person

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.680
in the grocery store,
no idea who they are.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.960
So I have a program
that addresses that.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.670
And these people often get
labeled as rude or standoffish,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.830
and that isn't the case.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.960
They just don't
recognize the person.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.957
A good friend of mine
had this difficulty,

00:34:12.957 --> 00:34:13.790
and we worked on it.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.373
And she was a reporter
at the "Toronto

00:34:15.373 --> 00:34:17.750
Star," which is the second
largest newspaper in Toronto.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.510
And for 20 years, she rode
the elevator up and down

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.024
up and down.

00:34:22.024 --> 00:34:23.440
She had no idea
every day that she

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.814
went into that
elevator-- did she

00:34:24.814 --> 00:34:26.290
know anybody on that elevator?

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.070
So she said she had two
options-- one to just assume

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.810
she knew nobody.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.080
And if she offended
somebody, so be it,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.639
or pretend she knew everybody.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.840
And if she got labeled
as being overly friendly,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.580
so that was the
option she chose.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:44.690
But at one point she got
accused of being prejudicial.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.760
A friend said to her,
you know, oh, Linda, you

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.060
think all brown
people look alike.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.830
And Linda said to her actually,
it's much worse than that.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.350
All people look alike.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.110
But because she didn't
recognize people and make

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.050
that discrimination, somebody
interpreted her behavior

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:05.540
as being prejudiced,
which was not accurate.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.300
So that's this function.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.370
This is the same
part of the brain

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.620
but now in the left hemisphere.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.560
So one is holding the
look of the thing, which

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.850
is in your right hemisphere.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.660
This is holding
the symbol pattern.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.680
So, again, if you want
to just think of the word

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.796
"cat," so the three letters,
and if you want to try it,

00:35:22.796 --> 00:35:23.840
you can close your eyes.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.610
And can you conjure
up those three letters

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.750
on the blackboard?

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.910
And again, some people
see it really crisply.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.280
Some people it will
be kind of fuzzy.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.780
And a lot of the students
that we work with

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.130
don't see anything.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.820
They can't hold the
visual look of a word.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.130
Some researchers call this
the brain's letter box

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.320
or visual word formary.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.870
I call it symbol recognition.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.850
But it's critical for
spelling, for word recognition,

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.010
even learning visual
symbol templates like math

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.510
formulas, chemical equations.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.010
We know that you can
just learn them visually.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.075
If somebody has this
difficulty, they don't.

00:35:57.075 --> 00:35:59.270
And I'll just give you an
example of the exercise

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.160
that we use for this area.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.890
So for every single one
of the 19 functions,

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.350
we have very different exercises
because we're targeting

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.920
very different functions.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.640
And this language that
the student is looking at

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.490
is Amharic from Ethiopia.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.390
And often people
say, well, you know,

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.770
Nick is struggling
with reading English.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.360
Why are you giving him Amharic?

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.510
The concept is
that we don't want

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.470
the child or the individual to
compensate for the difficulty.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.400
So if we used English letters,
they could put sound to.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.220
They could put meaning to it.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.800
If we use Amharic or Burmese
or Sinhalese or Telugu,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.372
they can't put sound to it.

00:36:40.372 --> 00:36:42.080
They can't put meaning
to it because they

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.360
don't know this language.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360
So the idea of any
of the exercises,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.430
we're trying to go in and target
that differentiated stimulation

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:53.740
right to the area, removing any
possibility of compensation.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.890
Now you can never fully
remove compensation

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.797
because the brain
doesn't work that way.

00:36:57.797 --> 00:36:59.630
So the student goes
through a whole process.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:04.490
There's thousands of levels
in each of the exercises.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.310
And by the end of
this exercise, they're

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:10.580
holding eight Chinese
characters in their mind's eye.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.120
And after that, English
actually looks pretty easy.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.490
But again, it's not that
we're teaching a skill.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.130
We're changing the
brain's capacity

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.130
to hold simple patterns.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.530
So what you see
changes with this

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.950
is word recognition,
spelling, visual matching,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:30.810
visual tracking, anything
related to learning

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.200
visual symbol patterns.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.170
And just really quickly,
if anybody is interested,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.200
we have a number
of outcome studies

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.690
on our website, which
is arrowsmithschool.org.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.680
So we've had studies done
in different schools,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.763
different researchers,
different research designs,

00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:46.400
all looking at
outcomes, so looking

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.450
at outcomes on
academic measures,

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.810
looking at outcomes in
schools with rate of learning,

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.907
looking at outcomes
on cognitive measures.

00:37:52.907 --> 00:37:54.490
They're all summarized
on the website,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.440
so I'm not going to
spend a lot of time

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.940
on those because
you can look at it.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.731
But this was a study
done at the University

00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:03.999
of Calgary, looking
at academic changes.

00:38:03.999 --> 00:38:06.540
The one I really like-- this
was done in the Toronto Catholic

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.290
District School Board,
obviously in Toronto.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.470
And it is a publicly
funded board.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.640
We know that students
with learning difficulties

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.710
aren't learning a
year for a year.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.510
So these students were learning
about 2/3 of a year per year

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.009
because they fall further and
further behind because they're

00:38:21.009 --> 00:38:22.880
struggling with
their difficulties.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.860
We took this group of students.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.270
I think there were 60 students,
and we put them half a day

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.850
doing cognitive exercises.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.670
So they're actually
getting less curriculum

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.410
than they were getting the
previous several years where

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.610
they were learning 2/3
of a year per year.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:42.480
So now we're reducing their
curriculum exposure by half.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.930
And what we found a year
after the intervention,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.350
they were doubling and
tripling their rate

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.470
of learning having
had less academics

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.190
because we changed the
brain's capacity to learn.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.440
I mean, again, I keep saying
this over and over again.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.898
But this is the
power of the brain.

00:38:57.898 --> 00:39:00.930
You change the opacity
of it to learn,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.310
the learning just starts
to go forward even

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.950
when it had less exposure.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.490
These students could have
sat in those English classes

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.592
and those math classes for
year after year after year,

00:39:11.592 --> 00:39:13.550
and they were still going
to be learning at 2/3

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.830
of a year per year.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.120
It needed the cognitive
intervention to shift that.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.274
And then we've looked
at cognitive measures.

00:39:20.274 --> 00:39:21.690
Again, this was
another study done

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.590
at the University of Calgary
in the BrainGain Lab,

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.140
seeing changes on memory,
auditory processing,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.060
fluid reasoning as a result
of the students working

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.130
on these cognitive exercises.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.840
And to me, what's most exciting
is the research studies

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:41.020
that we started the last
year, year and a half,

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.400
two years ago, imaging research.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.320
Because my hypothesis all
the way through this work

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.640
has been it's the
brain that's changing.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.270
It made sense.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.561
That was the inference I made
when I started this work,

00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:57.810
but I didn't have access to this
kind of research to do imaging.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:59.609
It's actually quite expensive.

00:39:59.609 --> 00:40:02.150
So we have a researcher at the
University of British Columbia

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.150
just north of here in
Vancouver, Dr. Laura Boyd

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:09.130
and at the University of
Southern Illinois, Dr. Greg

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.290
Rose.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.410
And we're doing similar
studies looking at students

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.230
with learning difficulties
and the intervention.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.120
And we're seeing
very similar results,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.970
which hopefully
within the next year

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.630
will be published in
peer reviewed journals.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.150
So we had to adapt the reasoning
exercise for the scanner,

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.050
because if you've ever been
an fMRI, you can barely move.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:33.290
You have to lie.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.330
But what I wanted
the researcher to do

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.160
was scan the students
prior to intervention

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.220
and scan them three months in.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.120
Because what we see
with students all around

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.260
the world in this program
is at about the two

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.510
to three-month mark, they start
to experience cognitive change.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.230
They start to be able to do
things they couldn't do before.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.000
And parents start
to notice that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.280
Teachers start to notice that.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.046
People around them
start to notice that.

00:40:55.046 --> 00:40:56.420
So I wanted to
see, was something

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.040
actually happening in the
brain at the three month mark?

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.172
So we can see a time point zero,
with the reasoning exercise,

00:41:02.172 --> 00:41:04.005
the brain is processing
quite inefficiently.

00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:07.450
It's taking up a lot of real
estate to do that activity.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.890
And again, this is
very preliminary data,

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.610
and we've got more data.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.317
We've got, I think, 10-month
data now that's being analyzed.

00:41:16.317 --> 00:41:18.400
But what we were seeing
at three months, much more

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.450
efficient processing,
less real estate taken up

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:25.410
to do that reasoning activity
as a result of the intervention.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.870
And another thing
that we're finding

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:31.290
in this preliminary data is
if we look at the first-- you

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.530
take the time activity at
one, time activity at two,

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.510
subtract the two,
and see, is there

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.770
something different
between the two time

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:39.160
points that's consistent?

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.400
And what we're seeing is
the insula is changing.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.990
It's that little area in
the bottom slide that's

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.690
kind of lit up on
the left hand side

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.310
all the way across in all the
students doing the reasoning

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.047
exercise.

00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:51.630
And to me, it makes
sense, because one

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.040
of the jobs of the insula is
to attach meaning to things.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.860
It's to process information
and make sense out

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.530
of it, which is what
I had difficulty with

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:04.090
and what that exercise
shifted for me.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.510
And then what is
also really positive

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.917
is we're seeing a change
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:42:09.917 --> 00:42:11.125
the front parts of the brain.

00:42:14.257 --> 00:42:15.840
So here you can see
a time point zero.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.440
There's very little
prefrontal cortex activation.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.650
And here at three
months, significant--

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.504
this is the most important
part of our brain.

00:42:24.504 --> 00:42:25.920
This is the part
that you probably

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.320
use every day in your job.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.430
This is thinking, problem
solving, strategizing.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.840
It's analyzing a situation.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.719
You've got a problem in front of
you to solve, and what happens

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.260
is this is the part
of the brain that

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.734
activates first to start to
call in resources of how am I

00:42:40.734 --> 00:42:41.900
going to solve that problem?

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.852
What am I going to do?

00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:44.810
And then as you're trying
to solve the problem,

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.560
this is the area that allows
you to reflect on the results.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.050
So, you know, this isn't working
here, what do I have to do?

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.450
How do I have to modify it?

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:57.480
It's that constant feedback loop
as you're solving a problem.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.570
We know students with
learning difficulties struggle

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.170
with that, and that's what we're
seeing at the zero time point

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.710
is they're not using
that part of the brain

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.350
very efficiently or effectively.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.040
At time point three, they're
starting to use that.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.230
And that's what we
see behaviorally.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.790
We see these students become
better problem solvers,

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.717
better executive functioning.

00:43:18.717 --> 00:43:21.300
So to me, it's really exciting
that we're seeing the behavior,

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.510
and now we're actually seeing
the most important part

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.930
of the brain shifting.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:30.980
We're also doing another study
at UBC with this researcher.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.070
And this is working with
people traumatic brain injury.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.500
And we're just finishing nine
months of data collection.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.620
These are individuals that
were in car accidents, pretty

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.980
significant trauma.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.010
I mean, a lot of them
had been in comas.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:50.670
We got them several years
after the traumatic event,

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.110
which means any spontaneous
remission would happen.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.990
I mean, my work is
designed for people

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.530
with learning difficulties,
but over the years,

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.363
we had people come in--
because the brain is

00:43:59.363 --> 00:44:02.580
the brain-- with traumatic
injury and we saw the results.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.990
So we thought, let's study this.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.110
You can't open the newspaper
now without reading

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.830
about concussion injuries,
even blast injuries, people

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:16.520
coming back from the
various war situations.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.000
And what we're
finding, the research

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.640
actually was just presented
last week in the Netherlands.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.310
The researchers
are really excited.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.724
They've got the
three-month data analyzed.

00:44:26.724 --> 00:44:28.890
They're just starting to
analyze the six-month data.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.930
The end of March will
be the nine month data.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.412
So by July, we should
have publications.

00:44:34.412 --> 00:44:35.870
The research has
just been accepted

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.770
in "The Journal for the
Frontiers of Neuroscience."

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.160
But we're seeing
changes in connectivity,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.780
the same similar
kinds of changes

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.630
that we're seeing
in the students

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.838
with learning difficulties,
so change in connectivity

00:44:46.838 --> 00:44:48.180
in the brain.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.000
Some change in myelin which
is, again, that connectivity,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.010
and we're seeing change in
what's called fluid cognition.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.500
So the first kind
of striped section

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.680
are the people with a
traumatic brain injury,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.700
prior to intervention.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.430
The blue are just normal
students or individuals

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.020
without traumatic brain injury.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.650
And the red, in the
middle, is where

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.970
they are three months after.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.553
So you can see they're starting,
and it's a significant change

00:45:13.553 --> 00:45:14.880
starting to move up to normal.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.990
And why is fluid
cognition important?

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.930
This is that thinking,
problem solving,

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.780
being able to step
into a situation,

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.620
figure it out, and
operate in that situation

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.540
critical for life.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.400
And we're seeing changes
in other measures.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:34.270
So really I'm very
excited because you

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.440
know the work can now
be a benefit for people

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.030
not just with
learning difficulties

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.030
but with people with
traumatic injury.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.830
And again, what are some of
the areas like auditory memory?

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.972
This is the person that
goes to the grocery store,

00:45:46.972 --> 00:45:49.180
like you send them out--
can you buy me three things?

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.920
You don't write it down.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.711
You just tell them.

00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:53.220
They come back with only one
thing because they can't hold

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.960
the information, or the
child that comes home

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.480
and knows they have
homework but kind

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.688
of no idea exactly what that
homework is because they

00:45:58.688 --> 00:46:00.300
can't hold the information.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.910
And often they get
labeled as being

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.090
irresponsible because they don't
do what you ask them to do.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.840
And truly, if they
have a difficulty here,

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.923
they're not irresponsible.

00:46:08.923 --> 00:46:12.220
They just can't hold
the information.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.629
I know people that have Post-it
notes all up around their house

00:46:15.629 --> 00:46:16.920
because they have this problem.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.540
If they don't have their
notes or their to-do lists,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.730
they aren't going to remember
what they have to do.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.850
Then number sense or
quantity blindness,

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.430
I've worked with
a lot of people,

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:29.076
but one that kind of stands out
was a psychiatrist in Toronto.

00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:30.450
And she would
double book clients

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.490
because she kind of had
no idea of like really

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.251
what was 60 minutes.

00:46:34.251 --> 00:46:36.500
It wasn't that she wanted
to make more money by having

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.140
two clients in the
same time period,

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.600
but she just
struggled with that.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.839
She struggled with
balancing her checkbook.

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:46.380
I worked with an opera singer
that couldn't do time signature

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.230
in music because of this area.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.730
We addressed the
cognitive function.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.750
She was able to do her
musical theory exam.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.250
You know, the individual that
struggles with motor planning,

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.880
this was a student that
couldn't put their thoughts down

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.470
on paper.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.150
So we've probably
met people like this.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.410
They tell you a story.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.990
It can be really elaborate.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.720
You put a pen in their
hand, nothing much

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.539
goes down on paper.

00:47:07.539 --> 00:47:09.080
It's because they've
got the thoughts

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.390
and the ideational content.

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:11.800
There's nothing wrong
with their thoughts.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.330
It's just the
motor system that's

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.090
translating the thoughts
into a motor plan for writing

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.850
isn't working properly.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.810
This was the same student 11
months later, same 10 minutes,

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.570
went on for three pages.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.750
We didn't teach him
how to hand write.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.500
We changed his brain's ability
to get his thoughts down

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.110
on paper.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:35.490
Just really quickly,
another area, this

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:37.300
is in the right hemisphere.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.070
This is what one researcher
calls cognitive Goldilocks.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.390
We've all met people
with this difficulty.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:45.320
It's where they look at
a situation, nonverbal,

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.100
a social situation.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.660
They kind of take one clue
or cue from that situation.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.560
They don't look at
everything going on.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.080
They make an
interpretation, which

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.890
isn't the full interpretation,
and then they act on that.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.960
So they get into
trouble socially.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.320
They're considered sort
of inept or awkward

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.850
because they haven't
read all the information

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.910
and interpreted it correctly.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.026
A good negotiator has
to be really strong here

00:48:08.026 --> 00:48:09.900
because they have to
walk into a negotiation,

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.180
and they have to do that
minute by minute reading

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.710
of what effect am I getting?

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:18.150
Am I getting the situation
to move in the direction I

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.320
want it to move?

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.070
An example is if we
look at this picture,

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.860
I gave it to a
12-year-old girl who

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.112
had really significant
social problems.

00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:30.070
Nobody in her neighborhood
would play with her.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.702
In fact, everybody said
she lies all the time.

00:48:32.702 --> 00:48:34.660
I asked her what was
happening in this picture,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.200
and she told me they
were playing badminton.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.835
And I asked her why
she thought that,

00:48:38.835 --> 00:48:40.710
and it's sort of hard
to see in this picture,

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.350
but this woman has
netting on her hat.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:44.967
And this is severe
premature closure.

00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:46.050
She looked at the netting.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:48.517
It triggered an association--
badminton, net, badminton.

00:48:48.517 --> 00:48:49.600
They're playing badminton.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.410
She didn't look at all the
rest of the information.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.490
So in her non-verbal
world, her social world,

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:56.660
it wasn't she was lying.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.230
She just misinterpreted
things all the time.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.194
And there are lots of examples.

00:49:01.194 --> 00:49:02.360
Another girl looked at this.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.550
She was 18.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.940
And she told me they were
at city hall in Toronto.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.540
And I'd been to City
Hall many times,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.450
and I didn't really think
it looked quite like that.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.500
And she pointed to the
rope in the foreground.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.392
And she'd been to City
Hall the week before,

00:49:14.392 --> 00:49:16.350
and there was an area
cordoned off with a rope.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:17.724
So again, that
premature closure.

00:49:17.724 --> 00:49:20.090
She looked at one
element, interpreted it,

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.080
and ran with that
interpretation.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.280
In both cases, we addressed
this cognitive function.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.020
The 12-year-old is now 30.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.670
She's successful in the world.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.400
She can read nonverbal
interpretation

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.890
and so is the other individual.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.077
So again, we're
not teaching them

00:49:36.077 --> 00:49:38.410
skills or rules, because there
is no rule book for life.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.350
You've got to go into
all these situations

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:44.260
and be able to handle the
situations in real time,

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.940
and that's what we're giving
the brain's ability to do.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.160
I'm just going to kind
of cover this and then

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.250
open for questions.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.200
I work with a lot of adults
in my school in Toronto

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.140
and a number of the schools.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:01.010
Here there's a school in
Redmond, Eaton Arrowsmith

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.730
Academy, that works
with adults as well.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.590
And I see a lot of
adults that have

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:07.870
what I call a
cognitive mismatch.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.780
This is where the
demands of their job

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.020
aren't quite aligned with
their cognitive profile.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.540
So if we think about
that auditory memory,

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.210
I worked with a pilot,
an airline pilot, once.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.030
And he couldn't hold
all of the instructions

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:24.790
from the air traffic controller.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.644
And I found that a
little worrisome.

00:50:26.644 --> 00:50:29.060
His strategy was to have the
air traffic controller repeat

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.740
the instructions over
and over, but I thought,

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.280
like, what if you're flying
into Chicago O'Hare or Atlanta

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.567
that are really busy airports?

00:50:34.567 --> 00:50:36.150
And that air traffic
controller really

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.330
doesn't have time to
repeat those instructions,

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:39.830
and he can't remember them.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.900
So my joke was, if
I was ever flying,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.410
I wanted to know what airspace
he was flying in so I didn't

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.280
fly in the same airspace.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.800
But the better
strategy was address

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.170
the problem, which we did.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:53.390
And now he can listen to the
information once and hold it.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.330
If we think about that
object recognition, what

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.890
I call the refrigerator
dysfunction,

00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.520
I worked with the
pathologist, or he

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.750
was in doing his
residency in pathology,

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:04.810
at a teaching
hospital in the US.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.310
He had that difficulty.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.180
And he didn't really know
he had that difficulty.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.930
He was examining breast tissue.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:13.500
It was somebody that had
had cancer, breast cancer,

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.099
and she'd gone through
traditional treatments.

00:51:16.099 --> 00:51:18.140
So she'd gone through
chemotherapy and radiation,

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:19.973
and now it was to see,
was she in remission?

00:51:19.973 --> 00:51:23.230
And he knew how important this
was, so he was really careful.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.290
He was diligent.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.636
He was looking at that slide.

00:51:26.636 --> 00:51:28.010
And he was just
about to sign off

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:29.551
that the person was
in remission when

00:51:29.551 --> 00:51:31.530
his supervisor came
and said, didn't you

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:32.740
see these cells up here?

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.050
This is cancer.

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.200
And it's not that
he hadn't seen them.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.650
He hadn't recognized them
because he hadn't held the look

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.699
to match it up to that.

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.240
So he knew he was
in serious trouble.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.330
He exited out of his
residency program.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.020
We worked on that
cognitive function.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.940
He now will never
make that mistake.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.640
But I think there are a lot
of what we call human error.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.760
And some of it can be explained
by these cognitive mismatches.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.410
That kinesthetic,
that problem I had,

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:04.240
where you don't interpret
sensation or register sensation

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.410
on your left side
of your body, I've

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.630
had some students that
think it's a great idea

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.380
to get a motorcycle and they
can't register sensation

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.980
and don't kind of regulate
their body movement

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.670
and have a number of
accidents on that motorcycle

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:22.830
because it plays
into that difficulty.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.821
So, I mean, what have I learned?

00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:26.320
Every part of the
brain is critical.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.490
If anybody says you only use
10% of your brain, tell them,

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.230
well, I'm not going to swear.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.820
Tell them that
they're not accurate

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.195
because over the
course of a day,

00:52:35.195 --> 00:52:36.851
you use every part
of your brain.

00:52:36.851 --> 00:52:39.100
And if there's something
that's not working in the way

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.410
that it's designed to work,
it will have some impact.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.100
Most of us can compensate.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.396
Or we just avoid those
things that are hard for us.

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.020
Obviously, a lot of
the students that I

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.090
work with, I mean from
age 6-- the oldest

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.920
person I've worked
with is 81-- these

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.600
are things where they pile up.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.360
They have multiple areas that
are coming together that cause

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.590
difficulty and where they cannot
really effectively compensate.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:06.590
My vision is to get this
work-- starting in grade 1,

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:09.630
every child coming to
school learns curriculum,

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:10.630
which is what we all do.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:11.565
But what do we learn with?

00:53:11.565 --> 00:53:12.590
We learn with out brain.

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:15.780
So part of their day is
devoted to cognitive exercises,

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.210
to stimulate function.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.420
And what would that do?

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.550
It would mean the students
now that by grade 3 or 4

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.550
would get identified,
will never get identified.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.679
Because by grade 3 or 4, these
problems will be addressed.

00:53:26.679 --> 00:53:28.470
It will become a normal
part of curriculum,

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.540
so there'll be no stigma.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.270
Because there's
tremendous stigma still

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:33.600
attached to having a
learning difficulty.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.284
Students with unevenness
in their profile-- I

00:53:36.284 --> 00:53:37.200
worked with a student.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.572
His mechanical reasoning
was at the 50th percentile,

00:53:39.572 --> 00:53:40.280
which is average.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.820
He wanted to be an architect.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.750
You need to be at
the 90th percentile.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.370
I created my mechanical
reasoning exercise for him,

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.150
got him to the 90th percentile.

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.650
He's now been an
architect for 15 years.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:54.400
That would get addressed
in those early grades.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.800
Any child can benefit from
cognitive stimulation.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.230
And when I wrote my book,
I put that as my vision

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.270
at the end of the book.

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:04.160
And I was convinced I would
never see that in my lifetime.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.160
Well, we're in a school
in South Carolina.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.160
I called my whole cohort
model-- the whole grade

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.610
2 class is doing two of
my cognitive exercises.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:14.200
This is their second year,
seeing really good results.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.640
We're just starting in a public
school just north of Sydney

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.120
in Australia.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.320
They're taking their
whole grade 1 class.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.210
These are just
regular grade 1 kids.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.750
We're doing that motor
planning exercise.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.570
If we go into the
university in Spain,

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:34.400
we'll just have all the students
working on that reasoning

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.430
exercise.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:39.730
So the vision is
gradually happening,

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.710
and it just has huge
applications for changing

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.990
the face of education.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.920
And that's what I'm passionate
about-- giving children

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.850
and young adults and adults
a different possibility

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:55.540
in their life, having many
more doors open to them

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.487
and where they can
make choice of what

00:54:57.487 --> 00:54:59.070
door do I want to
walk through, rather

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:02.660
than having most doors closed
and only one possibility.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.100
So I just want to thank you.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.364
And I'm happy to take questions.

00:55:06.364 --> 00:55:09.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:10.614 --> 00:55:12.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have
a microphone over here

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.505
for anybody who wants
to ask questions.

00:55:14.505 --> 00:55:15.380
Just raise your hand.

00:55:20.125 --> 00:55:21.500
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.260
That was really interesting.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.830
So you emphasize that
most of your work

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:30.600
focuses on people who have
learning disabilities.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.914
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: Mhm.

00:55:31.914 --> 00:55:33.580
AUDIENCE: Have you
tested this same kind

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:38.870
of techniques on patients with
Alzheimer's or other sorts

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.190
of, you know, degenerative
diseases of the brain?

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.660
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: No.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.159
That's a really good question,
and I think a lot about that.

00:55:44.159 --> 00:55:45.970
The answer is really
no, I haven't.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:48.920
My concern is if there's a
neurodegenerative process,

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.289
I don't believe we know enough
yet to be able to reverse that.

00:55:53.289 --> 00:55:54.830
There's certainly
research coming out

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:58.530
that good cognitive
stimulation maybe can stave off

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.551
the onset by a number of years.

00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:02.300
And there's a lot of
good research looking

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.990
at people that have
dual language, which

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.494
adds cognitive load,
cognitive complexity.

00:56:08.494 --> 00:56:10.910
And the research is suggesting
maybe it's five years later

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.040
that they show the signs,
if they're going to get

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.430
Alzheimer's.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:19.730
So I think good cognitive
stimulation is positive.

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.730
I just don't think we
know enough at this point

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:26.250
to say that it's
going to prevent that.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.430
AUDIENCE: Have you have you
come across any examples

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:32.220
where a learning disability
has manifested itself

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.885
as a learning superability
in some other context?

00:56:35.885 --> 00:56:37.260
BARBARA
ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: I have,

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.480
and I mean, I've seen really
unevenness in profiles,

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.300
where somebody can be
exceptional in one area

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.242
and have significant
difficulty in another.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.280
I mean, there is this
concept that I've

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.300
heard of there that there's
a gift of having a learning

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:54.839
disability.

00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:57.380
I've talked to a lot of people
that have learning disability.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.110
Nobody considers that a gift.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.510
I mean, it doesn't
mean that maybe it

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:05.480
teaches you, if you can, ways
to compensate and work around.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.760
But I myself do not
see the giftedness

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.210
in having a learning disability.

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:11.510
It's a struggle.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:14.170
It causes suffering.

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.620
You just have to work so
much harder than everybody

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.930
else to function.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.490
Now, I have seen
some students where

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:25.320
because they have a difficulty
here, they have a strength

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.369
here, and if they
rely on that strength

00:57:28.369 --> 00:57:29.910
over and over and
over again, they're

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.760
probably creating their
own cognitive stimulation.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.460
And they actually
improve that strength.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.550
It doesn't change the
learning difficulty.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:37.830
It improves the
strength that they have.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.470
I mean, for me, I
think I always had

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.970
a good auditory
and visual memory,

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:45.050
but I supercharged them.

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:48.080
I mean, my way of studying,
I'd lay my books out on my bed.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.090
As a child, I would cry from
the depths of my soul, which

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.150
I was putting my brain
in kind of a Zen state,

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:55.970
which I didn't know at the time.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.771
And then I would read the
first sentence, close my eyes,

00:57:58.771 --> 00:58:01.020
see it, read the next sentence,
close my eyes, see it.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.460
By the end, I could look
at the first sentence.

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.876
I could close my
eyes, and I could

00:58:03.876 --> 00:58:06.970
see 50 pages of my notebook.

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:08.760
I had a good ability there.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.990
I think I enhanced that ability
through using it all the time

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.141
and over-using it.

00:58:15.141 --> 00:58:16.640
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.250
I was just wondering, even
in your personal example,

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:22.540
like you go through these
training curriculums,

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.160
and you try to identify the
problem and find a solution.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.500
After the person kind
of enhances that ability

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.599
wherever they were
weak, is there

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:33.390
something they have to
do to continue that?

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.230
Or is it kind of like
if you don't use it,

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.490
you lose it, kind of thing?

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.020
BARBARA ARROWSMITH YOUNG:
Interestingly what we see,

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.603
because that's a
really good question,

00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.160
is there's no drop off.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.200
I've tracked myself and other
people of over 30 years out

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.024
of the program.

00:58:45.024 --> 00:58:46.440
And I think why--
because, I mean,

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.400
we know if we stop going to
gym, our muscles atrophy.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.035
But I think what
happens is if we think

00:58:51.035 --> 00:58:53.410
about that functional system,
like all these areas coming

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.140
together in a neural network,
if there's some weak areas,

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.850
they're acting as a drag
on that whole system.

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.020
Once you see you improve them,
enhance them, they come up.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:04.590
And then they get
their own stimulation

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:07.490
by being engaged in
that neural network.

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:08.692
That's my theory.

00:59:08.692 --> 00:59:10.030
It make sense to me.

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:14.220
Practically, what I see is
once they've achieved the gain,

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.590
there's no drop off in function.

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:18.180
Because I believe they're
starting to use it

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.645
in everyday functioning.

00:59:20.645 --> 00:59:23.020
AUDIENCE: Have you noticed an
difference between children

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.480
and adults or how
neuroplasticity

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.400
changes with age?

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.500
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: Yeah,
when I first started this work,

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.666
there was all this research.

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.670
There's this beautiful
window of neuroplasticity

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.280
that starts to close at age 12.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.950
And you know, it's kind
of all over at age 12.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.480
So I thought I would
see a big difference

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:45.380
in the rate of progress in
children versus adolescents,

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.010
adults, young adults.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:48.240
I haven't seen that.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.020
It really was probably the
biggest surprise that I found.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.360
I've seen variability in
plasticity, which makes sense.

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.280
There's individual
variability in everything.

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.590
And there's a lot of research
now looking at genetics,

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:03.260
looking at what goes into
different rates of plasticity.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.160
I mean, I've got lots
of examples in my work

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.600
where two people come in.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.140
They look very similar in the
profile, same gender, same age,

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.710
do the same amount of work.

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.615
They both make progress, but
one goes four times faster

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:15.240
than the other.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.030
And there's probably just more
plasticity in that individual.

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:24.499
But I think about the
74-year-old retired professor

01:00:24.499 --> 01:00:26.540
from the medical school
at University of Toronto.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.090
She came in.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.120
She had face blindness.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.900
It had always bothered
her, worked on it.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.140
She made the same
progress as a 15-year-old.

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.010
So to me, as I'm getting
older, it's really encouraging.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:39.250
There's neuroplasticity
over the lifespan.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:42.574
MALE SPEAKER: Big shout out
to Google for the tool kit

01:00:42.574 --> 01:00:43.490
that you've developed.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:48.440
It's really enabled us to
provide solutions for Barbara

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.750
and her team that
are very effective.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.360
We use the App Engine.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.980
All of our software
runs in the App Engine.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.860
Barbara's team is
not technologists.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.000
They're educators.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.100
They're scientists.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.130
They're neuroscientists.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.650
They don't run IT shops.

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:07.180
The cloud has enabled
them to deliver

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:13.500
7/24 solutions around the world
to many different countries.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.740
What we've worked
on with them is

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.990
capturing all that data
from those students

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:21.670
that we talked about earlier
and analyzing it and coming up

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.270
with individual programs for
every kid, every student,

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.310
be them adults,
whatever, and then

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:31.570
also tracking their progress
through those exercises

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:34.300
as they're working on it
and stimulating their brain,

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.530
registering the data
from year to year,

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.500
and keeping track of that
and producing reports

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.320
and report cards.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.070
And it's your platform
that enables that.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.770
As the next phase, we're going
to get into the classroom.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.370
And as we get into
the classroom,

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:52.750
there's interactions with
the students and interactions

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.870
with the teachers, the teachers
and student interactions.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:01.300
We're going to use the Android
tablet for that and the Android

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:05.370
operating system to connect
between the browser which

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.360
we use GWT, the GWT toolkit,
running an App Engine,

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.950
and the Android solutions
that are running on the tablet

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.810
to talk between the
teacher and the student

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.560
in the same classroom.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.630
So big shout out, we're
using a lot of your tools,

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:24.450
not to mention the
Chrome browser.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.660
And it's working out really
well for Barbara and her team.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.371
Thank you.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.870
AUDIENCE: If Americans are more
into ketchup than Canadians,

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:36.172
then why do they only sell
ketchup potato chips in Canada?

01:02:36.172 --> 01:02:37.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.430
Sorry, just kidding.

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.860
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG:
Oh really?

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.350
You don't have
ketchup potato chips?

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:41.480
AUDIENCE: We do not
have those here.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:41.840
BARBARA ARROWSMITH
YOUNG: Oh really?

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.000
Well, no loss.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.305
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:44.305 --> 01:02:46.180
AUDIENCE: I do actually
have a real questions

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.260
that I'm curious about.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.930
You mentioned that
you didn't learn

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.140
how to read an analog
clock until you're 26,

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.500
and similarly you
didn't understand

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.179
different sorts of abstract
relationships until that point.

01:02:57.179 --> 01:02:58.470
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: Yeah.

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.310
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering, where
were you in life at that point?

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.520
Had you had you graduated
from college at that point?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.920
Had you already gone to school?

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.960
Did you drop out and then
do it after you kind of

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.800
figured things out?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.300
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG:
No, I managed to get up.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.030
I was in graduate school.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.760
But incredible struggle.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.659
In my undergraduate, I learned
the routines of the security

01:03:20.659 --> 01:03:22.200
guards in the library
because I would

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.500
spend all night in the library.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.280
So I would know when they were
coming to do their walkabout.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.040
I would hide out
in the washroom.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.770
I worked seven days a week,
20 hours every single day

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:36.734
just to tread water.

01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:37.900
I mean, that's what it took.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.910
Because I wasn't
understanding conceptually.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:44.220
I was having to rely on memory,
which is really brute force.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.676
I compromised my immune system.

01:03:45.676 --> 01:03:47.050
I have an immune
system disorder.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.470
There's a lot of
research now looking

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.553
into the field of learning
disabilities and seeing

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:51.220
a connection.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:58.180
It's all the stressors that
affect your endocrine system.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.460
So it wasn't just a
learning disability.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.010
It affected all sorts
of things in my life.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:06.280
And just before I came
across the book that

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.430
was given to me-- when I
was 13, I attempted suicide.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:10.740
It wasn't successful.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.680
It was kind of that
two-edged sword--

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.730
the despair of having
a learning difficulty,

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.476
thinking I've got to
go to high school.

01:04:16.476 --> 01:04:18.350
I could barely get
through elementary school.

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:20.220
How can I do this?

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.681
So that despair led me
to try to end my life.

01:04:22.681 --> 01:04:24.680
But my learning disability
meant I didn't really

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.790
understand the instructions
of how you did that.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.370
And I can laugh at it now.

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.389
So I wasn't successful.

01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:32.430
But when I woke up the
next morning, as I thought

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:33.040
you did something.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.710
You went to bed.

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.957
You just didn't wake up.

01:04:34.957 --> 01:04:36.415
When I woke up the
next morning, it

01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:38.190
was another opportunity
to attack myself,

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:40.000
like I just couldn't
even get that right.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.470
But just before I
came across this work,

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.310
this time I was planning again.

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.101
And this time I would
have gotten it right,

01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:48.910
because I knew what I had to do.

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:53.300
So that's why I feel like I
owe a life debt to Luria's work

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.167
because that turned
my life around.

01:04:56.167 --> 01:04:57.000
There was no future.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.510
Yes, I was in graduate school,
maybe I would have got through.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.300
I'm not sure whether
I would've or not.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.220
There was no life.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.970
I didn't have relationships.

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.430
If I got on an elevator
in my university

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.130
and one of my
professors got on, I

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.420
was terrified that they
would ask me a question

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.916
because I wouldn't understand
what they were asking

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:23.920
and be able to have
a conversation.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.020
Like, I lived in
terror all the time.

01:05:30.954 --> 01:05:33.120
AUDIENCE: Just kind of, I
guess in all your research

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.800
and with working with so
many different clients,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.640
any tips that you
would provide just

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.237
in general for the overall
cognitive well-being?

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.570
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: A few.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.990
I do have slides in here,
but I didn't get to them.

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:47.430
One of the best
things you can do--

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:49.440
exercise, aerobic exercise.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.140
There's tons of research now.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.610
I know you've got bikes here.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:54.080
You've got walking trails.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.630
It doesn't have to
be more than go out

01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:01.950
and walk 30 minutes a day,
a good, nice, brisk walk.

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:03.620
Aerobic exercise,
the rule is kind

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.786
of it's good for your heart.

01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:06.060
It's good for your brain.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.610
It stimulates.

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:10.600
It's called BDNF-- brain
derived neurotrophic factor.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.240
And that generates neurogenesis,
creating new neurons.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.140
Also it repair cells,
like all that damage

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.244
that happens over time.

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:23.160
So if you can only do
one thing, get out there

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.050
and at least five days a
week do some good exercise.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:30.180
Another thing, reduce stress.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.010
I mean, all the
research is showing now

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.810
that stress actually is
almost like an acid bath

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:36.480
for your brain.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.370
I mean, short term
stress, not a problem.

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:41.210
It's that long term
chronic stress,

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:46.367
which actually creates
negative neuroplasticity.

01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:48.200
When those dendrites
are starting to branch,

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.080
it actually eats
up the dendrites.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.355
So anything, whether
it's meditation, again,

01:06:55.355 --> 01:06:56.480
sometimes going for a walk.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.580
Whatever you can do to
reduce stress in your life

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.550
is good for brain health.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.420
Whatever you can do to
increase aerobic activity

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.850
is good for brain health.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:10.330
And then the other thing is
sort of novelty and cognitive

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:12.490
complexity, which I
talked a little bit about.

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:14.840
So let's say you want
to learn something new.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:21.650
What you should do is calibrate
the level of the challenge.

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.920
So let's say you
want to learn chess.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.500
But you're not going to start
at the grandmaster level.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.875
Because if you do, like let's
say you're functioning here

01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:32.297
and you try to start the
activity way up here,

01:07:32.297 --> 01:07:33.880
you aren't going to
be able to engage.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.780
It's not going to drive
neuroplastic change.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.240
If you make it so easy,
as your brain goes

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.312
on automatic pilot--
I mean, there's

01:07:40.312 --> 01:07:42.520
lots of times when you want
to be on automatic pilot.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.820
But if you're trying to
drive neuroplastic change,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.550
automatic pilot doesn't do it.

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.370
So if you're making
something too simple,

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:49.600
it's not engaging the brain.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.266
So it's kind of finding
that sweet spot,

01:07:51.266 --> 01:07:53.093
just like in exercise.

01:07:53.093 --> 01:07:57.380
If this is where it starts
to hurt a little bit,

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.150
make it just a little
bit more difficult.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:02.320
Then do the activity,
and then you'll

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.552
find it'll little step up.

01:08:03.552 --> 01:08:05.260
And then make it a
little more difficult.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.690
It's calibrating the
level of complexity.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.960
And you can do that
in any activity

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960
that you're engaging in.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.020
And that will be the best thing
to drive neuroplastic change.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.170
So exercise, reduce stress,
and calibrate the level

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:21.119
of difficulty in your learning.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.215
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

01:08:25.215 --> 01:08:26.710
BARBARA ARROWSMITH-YOUNG: OK.

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:27.790
Thank you.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:32.299
[APPLAUSE]
