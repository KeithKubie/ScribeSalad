00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.150
So we have these two versions of
the equation of the same line and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.170
they're both written
in point-slope form.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.910
I want to know,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.880
can you write the equation of this line
in slope intercept form y = mx + b form?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.725
Enter your answer in this box.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.539
