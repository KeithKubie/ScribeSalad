00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.734 line:0%
Now, many have wondered

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.836 line:0%
why I've yet to weigh in
on the Super Bowl.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:06.939
The truth is, unless I'm
getting paid a lot of money,

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:10.243
I don't really care to share
my thoughts with you people.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.613
Here is how Belichick's Patriots
will be remembered:

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.883
the tuck rule, spygate,
and deflategate.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.718
Forgive me if I don't put stock

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.586
in what all these
concussed Neanderthals

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.687
say about their legacy.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.023
If football is a game of inches,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:27.493
then anyone in your organization
cheating, even a single time,

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.762
taints everything
from that point on.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.131
Of course it helps
that there are no repercussions

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.866
because your
cradle-robbing owner

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.169
has a weekly slumber party
with the commissioner.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.671
And if you believe Tom Brady

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.807
is the greatest quarterback
of all time,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.710
you deserve to get butt-[bleep]
by Aaron Hernandez in prison.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.580
Brady had one good year
of lobbing it up to Randy Moss,

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.349
and every other season he's been
a game manager.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.718
He's Trent Dilfer
with hair plugs.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.120
He's a Men's Warehouse model

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.956
who's married
to a talking horse model.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.059
"Oh yeah, well, that horse model
is worth a billion dollars."

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:04.497
Yeah, that's because she's
a horse that can talk.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.433
And how did that "class"
organization

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.835
celebrate their big win?

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.137
By all banging the same chick
on Tinder.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.540
You're the Super Bowl champs,
swipe left once in a while.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.709
I know,
I'm a bitter Dolphins fan.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.377
You owe the Dolphins.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.214
If the Patriots weren't in such
a [bleep] division,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.615
you wouldn't have
such a cakewalk

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.083
to get into the playoffs
every year.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.184
You need us.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.487
Not as much as you need the Jets
and Bills.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.921
But you need us.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.490
And if you're a Pats fan
thinking,

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.158
"He doesn't have
the balls to say that

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.961
to my blotchy, alcoholic,
racist face,"

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.195
you are wrong.

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:37.864
I will be touring exclusively

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.832
in the New England area
this summer.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:44.003
The Great Nor'easter Tour
of 2015 goes on sale tomorrow.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:46.272
From Halifax to Hershey.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.406
Why don't you go to Miami?

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.839
[bleep] those losers.
