00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.259
 For centuries the shadow of hypnosis belief as a cure or amusement tool, however 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.139
 The prevailing reputation was false and ambiguous. So what does science say? 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.880
 Is hypnosis a fact? 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.990
 For a moment, close your eyes and imagine a lemon. Imagine the smell of those lemons, 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.340
 Imagine its color and shape. Imagine the feel of the lemon and feel the touch of your skin. Now take it 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.099
 Slowly and slowly cut her, and brought out her juice. Take a slice of it 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.329
 And put them in your mouth. Now open your eyes. 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.070
 Do you have saliva? It is seen, regardless of its being presented in the media as a form 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.329
 Control of the mind, researchers describe hypnosis differently. Hypnosis is a state of 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.760
 Awareness requires high attention and a center that reduces the appearance of competing ideas 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.170
 Allows enhanced ability to respond to suggestions. So hypnosis is from a scientific point of view 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.579
 The type of focus your brain feels when you read or read a book 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.190
 A television program while the rest of the world seems far away, "a metaphor for your intense focus on seeing or reading and separating from the world" 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.000
 The research also showed that hypnosis is a fact that can disrupt our spontaneous response 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 Such as reading the words directly in front of us. In this test, try pronouncing the color name 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.220
 The name on the screen is not "Tested". In this case you will say that the color is "blue" 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:29.060
 As fast as you can, try it yourself. This is deceptive, is not it? This is known as the strobe effect. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.710
 It is difficult because the automatic process of wanting to read words has stumbled our ability 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 On the color label quickly. On each if the words in another language such as 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.619
 Dutch You will not have a problem naming the color because the words have no meaning in your mind 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.850
 ..But if you speak Dutch 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.149
 In one study the hypnotic participants experimented with a strobe test after being told 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.070
 They will see vague and meaningless words. As a result, Strobe's effect is temporarily suspended 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.890
 Participants were able to call the color without errors or delay. When this test was conducted 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.219
 Using MRI, participants showed lower activity in the frontal cortex 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.649
 An area in the brain involved in solving contradictions and competitive requirements in addition to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.620
 Decrease in the visual cortex, which is an important area to distinguish words 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.760
 The Harvard Group Measure for Hypnosis Sensitivity showed that the process of hypnosis is distributed 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.610
 In a natural gypsy curve. Very few people did not feel anything during hypnosis, the number of people 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.050
 Respond to the feelings and intellectual movements and suggestions of guidance, such as raise your hands involuntarily 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.620
 A few of them responded to cognitive suggestions that affect memory 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.569
 Perception and were able to create hallucinations and memory loss 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.599
 You can also change the pain. In a study during hypnosis 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.750
 The participants were given a painful thermal stimulus on their right hands and asked them to assess their pain. 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.640
 They were then told that they would give the same heat catalyst as the new catalyst at a painless temperature 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.230
 They were asked to assess their pain and assessed it with their first assessment. In truth it is their minds that have shown them 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.400
 Same level of activity in frontal cortex. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.269
 Scientists have also examined the brains of people who falsely call leg palsy as if they are magnetically hypnotized 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.050
 Their brains were later examined again after hypnotizing them to find an increase in brain activity 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.659
 In the right region of the dorsal frontal cortex and in the right cerebellum and in the left area of ​​the thalamus and in the stump 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.920
 People who claim to have false leg palsy did not show any change in their brain regions. This suggests that hypnosis is another neurotic basis 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.269
 For those who are wrestling with him. 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.709
 If many hypnotic hypnotists may be hypnotizing, under the brain scan 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.379
 Where it clearly shows who lies and who is hypnotically hypnotized. 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.310
 If you want our vision hypnotized by a professional first time watch 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.220
