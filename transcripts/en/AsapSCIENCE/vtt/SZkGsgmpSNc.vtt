00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:05.661
With work, studying or a stressful schedule,
it can be *hard* to find the time or energy

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:10.631
for that extra edge in the bedroom. But, could
science have a solution to our sexual woes?

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.021
It just might...

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:16.550
Sexual desire in both men and women is controlled
by your hormones. When something triggers

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.980
you to be ‘turned on’, the brain and nervous
system send signals to your pelvis, causing

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.431
blood vessels to dilate. You experience an
increased heart rate, while your brain releases

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.790
norepinephrine, dopamine and other pleasurable
neurotransmitters which make it clear to your

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.821
body that you’re having a good time.

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:37.011
And humans have long tried to enhance this
biological response throughout history. Unfortunately,

00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:41.531
there is no real scientific evidence to the
pop culture myth that oysters, chocolate or

00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:46.211
other so called ‘aphrodisiacs’ will make
you horny. And while Viagra may prolong an

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:51.181
erection, contrary to popular belief, it actually
doesn’t make you more aroused. It works

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:55.891
solely to inhibit an enzyme so blood flow
to the penis is increased, and only acts on

00:00:55.891 --> 00:01:00.501
the peripheral nervous system. So popping
the blue pill won’t increase libido, nor

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:06.471
will an erection occur without initial stimulation.
Not to mention, it has no effect on women.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:11.051
But it turns out that scientists may have
mistakenly stumbled upon a new sex secret...

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.771
In an effort to create sunless tanning agents,
scientists were researching melanocortin - a

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:21.611
specific protein in the brain which can control
skin pigmentation. Except, when 10mg of the

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:27.151
synthetic version called melanotan-II were
injected in a male, an immediate and unstimulated

00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:33.921
erection lasting 8 full hours occurred along
with nausea and vomiting. At 2.5 mg the erection

00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:40.001
lasted 2-3 hours with minimal nausea. But
after bringing the dose to 1.25 mg, the males

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.781
were aroused and had consistent erections
without any nausea. Surprisingly, this drug

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:49.091
is now being effectively administered as a
nasal spray - ‘sniff-a-stiff’ anyone?

00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:52.791
On top of which, the drug works on females
too.

00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.841
When female rats were injected, along with
other hormones such as β-estradiol-3-benzoate

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:02.861
and progesterone, they increased hops, darts,
and ear wiggling in front of their male counterparts.

00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:07.330
These are all actions designed to cause sexual
arousal, and invite male rats for sex.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.130
But, before you run out to find this seemingly
miraculous love elixir, just know that it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.240
hasn’t been approved or regulated anywhere
in the world yet. However, its derivative

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.111
called bremelanotide, is currently undergoing
human clinical trials as a potential treatment

00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:26.021
for a myriad of sexual disorders, such as
female sexual arousal disorder. And since

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.011
the main mode of action occurs directly in
the central nervous system, it works on both

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:31.061
sexes.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:35.871
So eat your avocados, oysters and chocolate
for sustenance...and let science handle the

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:36.811
sex.

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.281
