00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.232
Problem 133.

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:09.330
A certain country had a total
annual expenditure of 1.2

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.570
times 10 to the 1/12
power last year.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.810
If the population of the country
was 240 million last

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:25.470
year, what was the per
capita expenditure?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.420
240 million, what is that?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.840
A million is 10 to
the sixth power.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.920
So this is 240 times
10 to the sixth.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.840
And that's the same thing as
24 times 10 to the seventh.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.910
I just took 10 from here
and multiply 10 there.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.690
And that is equal to 2.4 times
10 to the eighth power.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.590
Divide this by 10 and
multiply this by 10.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.410
You get the same number.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.030
So 2.4 times 10 to the eighth.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.120
So the per capita income is
going to be equal to the total

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.250
annual expenditure, so 1.2 times
10 to the 12th, divided

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.160
by the population, 2.4 times
10 to the eighth.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.720
1.2 divided by 2.4, that's equal
to 0.5, that's exactly

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.710
half of that, times 10
to the 12th divided

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.490
by 10 to the eighth.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.515
You just subtract the
exponents, so

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.720
that's 10 to the fourth.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.810
And that's not one of the
answers, so we can multiply

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.650
this 10 and divide this by 10.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.505
So this becomes 5 times
10 to the third.

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:39.570
Ten to the third is 1,000, so
5 times 1,000 is equal to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.390
$5,000 in annual expenditure
per capita.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870
And that's choice E.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:56.010
Problem 134.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.370
A certain rectangular
window is twice as

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.620
long as it is wide.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.840
So if this is the width, its
length is 2 times the width.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.160
If its perimeter is 10 feet, and
its dimensions are, so its

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.220
perimeter going to be w plus
w plus the 2 lengths.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.490
So its perimeter is going to be
2w plus 2w plus w plus w.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.110
And that's going to
be equal to 10.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.840
If we add up all the w's,
that's 2, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.350
So we get 6w is equal to 10.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.440
w is equal to 10/6, which
is equal to 5/3 feet.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.630
And so its dimensions are
5/3 and then the 2w.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.240
So the length is 2 times
that, which is 10/3.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.180
So it's 10/3 by 5/3.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.110
And that's choice B.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.750
They say 5/3 by 10/3,
but same thing.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.540
So choice B.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.900
Problem 135.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.892
This is interesting.

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.810
Let's see if I can draw
this diagram.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.370
So to start, this is x, then
it goes there and has a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.910
diamond like that, and
it goes like that.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.390
And we have another diamond.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.170
I don't know what this is all
for yet, but it looks

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.956
interesting.

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:41.290
It goes like that, then
goes like that.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.960
There's a diamond there, looks
like there, looks like there.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.980
There's a line that goes like
that, goes like that, like

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.970
that, and like that.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.160
And then finally, we're at y.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.560
The diagram above shows of
various paths along which a

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.340
mouse can travel from point x
where does it lead to point y,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.140
where there's a reward
with a food pellet.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.360
How many different paths from
x to y can the mouse take if

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.980
it goes directly from x to y
without retracing any point

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.610
along the path?

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.829
There's only one way.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.709
It has to go here.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.840
So we're only at 1
path right now.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.630
And it can either go this
way to get here, or it

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.560
could go this way.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.580
So to get here, there's how
many different paths?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.940
Like that, or like that.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.360
So at this point there's 2
ways to get right there.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.510
There's 1 way to get here,
2 ways to get here.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.110
Now, if there's 2 ways to get
here, that means that there's

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.840
2 ways to get here.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.560
Now how many ways are
there to get here?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.360
There's each of the 2 ways to
get there, and now we each of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.610
those in combination with each
of these 2 ways, so there's 4

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.840
ways to get here.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.220
You could think of
it like this.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.120
You could go to the top 1
and the top, that's 1.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.940
Top and the bottom, 2.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.820
Bottom and the bottom, 3.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.520
Bottom and the top, 4.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.620
So you could just multiply how
many ways it takes to get

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.130
here, and then how many more
ways to get from here to here.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.610
From here to here, there's 2
possible ways, and there's

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.490
already 2 ways to get here, so
you could multiply the 2.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.580
So there's 4 ways to get here,
4 ways to get here.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.650
To get from here to here, there
are 3 ways, 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.880
But since there are already 4
ways to get here, with each of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.245
those 4 ways you can go
in 3 different ways.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:38.660
So we multiply by 4 times 3,
so there's 12 ways to get

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.400
right here.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.460
If there's 12 ways to
get here, there's 12

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.060
ways to get to y.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.900
So the answer is C, 12.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.770
Problem 136.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.610
If the operation circle with
a dot in it is defined by x

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.620
circle with a dot y, is equal to
the square root of xy, for

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.580
all positive numbers x and y.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.920
So they're saying x and
y are greater than 0.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.990
That's good, because that
ensures we have a positive

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.890
under the square root sign.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:22.190
Then they want to know what 5
circle with a dot 45 circle

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.770
with a dot 60 is equal to.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.290
5 circle 45 five, that's
equal to the square

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.540
root of 5 times 45.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.880
That's that, and whatever that
is we're circling with that.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.330
So what you do when you have x
circle y, you multiply the 2

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.430
and then you take
the square root.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.150
So we would multiply 60 times
this and take the square root

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.400
of the whole thing.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.490
Let's just simplify this.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.490
This right here is equal to the
square root of 5 times 45,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.200
which doesn't look simplifiable
at face value.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.440
But if you think about,
45 is 9 times 5.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.910
You just want to take
out any perfect

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.820
squares you have there.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.260
So that's equal to 5
times 9 times 5.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.590
And that's equal to square
root of 25 times 9.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.120
And that is equal to the square
root of 25 times the

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.390
square root of 9, and that's
equal to 5 times 3, which is

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.560
equal to 15.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.290
So this simplifies to 15.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.340
And 15 dot circle, whatever you
want to call it, 60, is

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.310
equal to the square root
of 15 times 60.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.810
And let's see if we can somehow
turn this into some

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.070
type of a perfect square.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:54.840
Let's rewrite this as-- 60 is
the same thing as 15 times 4.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.890
So this is equal to the square
root of 15 times 15 times the

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.390
square root of 4.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.055
The square root of 15 times 15
is going to be 15 times 2,

00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:08.260
which is equal to 30.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.960
And that's choice A.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.970
Problem 137.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.220
I'll do it in yellow.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.900
A bar over a sequence of digits
in a decimal indicates

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.050
that the sequence repeats
indefinitely.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:35.620
What is the value of 10 to the
fourth minus 10 to the 12

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:43.159
times 0.0012, and then this 12
will just keep repeating over

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.780
and over again.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.810
So let's see what we can do.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.330
What's 10 to the fourth?

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.530
Let's think about it this way.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.140
Let's distribute this.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.830
So what's 10 to the fourth?

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.242
That's 10,000.

00:08:55.242 --> 00:09:11.440
So what's 10,000 times
this number, 0.0012?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.270
This 12 keeps repeating,
so we'll think

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.080
about that in a second.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.910
So what's 12 times 10,000?

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.370
It's 120,000.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.360
It's 12 with four
0's, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.900
And we have 4 numbers behind
the decimal point,

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.280
so it gets us there.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.230
You might say OK, we're done.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.770
It's 12.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.070
But it's actually
not 12, because

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.320
it's actually 12121212.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.280
The 12's just keep going.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:51.430
It would actually be 121212, and
then 12's keep repeating

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.580
on like that.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.420
I think you understand
why, right?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.760
This would be if we just had 1
12 times 10,000, but if the

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.870
12's kept going, then these
wouldn't be 0's,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.170
these would be 12's.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.430
Hopefully that make sense to
you, maybe there's an easy way

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.950
to think about it.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.580
So what's 100?

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.400
We'll use the same logic.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:21.060
What's 100 times 0.0012?

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.630
Actually, I probably could have
done it a simpler way,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.230
but let's just continue
this way.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:29.060
So 12 times 100 1,200, and we
have 4 numbers behind the

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.310
decimal point, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.310
And of course, it's not just
0.12, it'll just keep going.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.420
0.1212 will just keep going.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.450
So we have this times
this, which is this

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.840
minus this times this.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.700
I'm just distributing it.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:59.320
So if I just subtract this
from that, minus 0.12-- I

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.980
wrote this right.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:05.120
This was 12, because we said
12 times 10,000 is 120,000.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.760
We had 1, 2, 3, 4 behind
the decimal.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.355
So it's 12.

00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:15.230
But since we had multiple 12's
behind it, it becomes 12.12.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.710
I don't know what I was doing
with this right here.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.190
So let me write that again.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.590
Sorry I'm doing this
a little bit messy.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:28.750
So 0.0012 repeating times 10 to
the fourth is going to be

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.470
equal to 12.12 repeating.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:36.550
And then we're going to subtract
0.0012 repeating

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:42.870
times 10 squared, and that is
equal to 0.12 repeating.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.970
So if I subtract out the 0.12
repeating from 12.12

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.540
repeating, I'm just going
to be left with 12.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.310
And hopefully that's
one of the answers.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.140
It is.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.020
Choice E.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.020
See you in the next video.
