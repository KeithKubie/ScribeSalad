under the skin to affect our health is
 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.889
under the skin to affect our health is
through affecting what we put in our

we're stressed we mobilize a lot of
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.160
we're stressed we mobilize a lot of
energy and we secrete this stress

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

caloric food and that's because it's
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200

fat leaks into the blood so that you
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130
fat leaks into the blood so that you
have a lot of lipids in the blood so

relationship between stress and eating
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.990
relationship between stress and eating
is just asking yourself well how do you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
is just asking yourself well how do you
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490
is just asking yourself well how do you
eat under stress are you a stress eater

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
eat under stress are you a stress eater
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830
eat under stress are you a stress eater
and remarkably people tend to know they

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
and remarkably people tend to know they
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560
and remarkably people tend to know they
they know their own tendency and when we

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
they know their own tendency and when we
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179
they know their own tendency and when we
do research on this we just simply ask

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
do research on this we just simply ask
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590
do research on this we just simply ask
people do eat more when you're under

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
people do eat more when you're under
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.670
people do eat more when you're under
stress do eat less when you're under

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
stress do eat less when you're under
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590
stress do eat less when you're under
stress and the people who eat more are

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
stress and the people who eat more are
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.429
stress and the people who eat more are
at tremendous risk of weight gain and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439
at tremendous risk of weight gain and
 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.539
at tremendous risk of weight gain and
what we call metabolic syndrome

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
what we call metabolic syndrome
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999
what we call metabolic syndrome
increases in their cholesterol and their

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
increases in their cholesterol and their
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249
increases in their cholesterol and their
insulin when they're under stress so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
insulin when they're under stress so
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679
insulin when they're under stress so
stress for them is is more dangerous

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
stress for them is is more dangerous
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.380
stress for them is is more dangerous
than for the people who don't tend to go

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
than for the people who don't tend to go
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880
than for the people who don't tend to go
for the donuts etc when they're under

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
for the donuts etc when they're under
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.200
for the donuts etc when they're under
stress so one of the things that we are

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210
stress so one of the things that we are
 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.280
stress so one of the things that we are
we really don't know how to tackle

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
we really don't know how to tackle
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310
we really don't know how to tackle
stress eating and we know that people

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
stress eating and we know that people
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200
stress eating and we know that people
are using it it has a functional role

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
are using it it has a functional role
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.490
are using it it has a functional role
they're using it to make themselves feel

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
they're using it to make themselves feel
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170
they're using it to make themselves feel
better so you can't just simply take it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
better so you can't just simply take it
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330
better so you can't just simply take it
away you need to provide other

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
away you need to provide other
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090
away you need to provide other
strategies for coping with stress so the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
strategies for coping with stress so the
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.180
strategies for coping with stress so the
the one that we're testing right now is

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190
the one that we're testing right now is
 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.650
the one that we're testing right now is
testing whether we can teach people the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
testing whether we can teach people the
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.480
testing whether we can teach people the
skill of mindfulness

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490
skill of mindfulness
 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.700
skill of mindfulness
being in the present moment can serve as

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710
being in the present moment can serve as
 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.300
being in the present moment can serve as
a filter to change their everyday

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
a filter to change their everyday
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.580
a filter to change their everyday
experience and their every their their

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
experience and their every their their
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440
experience and their every their their
experience in the moment with stress so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450
experience in the moment with stress so
 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390
experience in the moment with stress so
that they're not reacting as much so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
that they're not reacting as much so
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.620
that they're not reacting as much so
there are adrenals not secreting all

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
there are adrenals not secreting all
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.020
there are adrenals not secreting all
that cortisol so it can help them be

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
that cortisol so it can help them be
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.780
that cortisol so it can help them be
more resilient to stress on one hand we

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
more resilient to stress on one hand we
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.770
more resilient to stress on one hand we
think it because it's going to promote

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
think it because it's going to promote
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.120
think it because it's going to promote
stress resilience on the other hand we

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
stress resilience on the other hand we
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.730
stress resilience on the other hand we
think they can use it to eat more

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740
think they can use it to eat more
 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.320
think they can use it to eat more
mindfully so we're teaching people

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330
mindfully so we're teaching people
 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.260
mindfully so we're teaching people
mindful eating skills and that that can

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
mindful eating skills and that that can
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.170
mindful eating skills and that that can
be as simple as noticing each bite and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
be as simple as noticing each bite and
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.280
be as simple as noticing each bite and
how it tastes and how full you feel
