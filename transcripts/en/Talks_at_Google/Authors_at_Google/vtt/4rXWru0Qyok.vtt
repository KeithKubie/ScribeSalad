MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
all for coming today.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:13.440
We have the pleasure of having
Ryan Holiday here at Google

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.300
to talk to us.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.110
I'll give you guys a quick
intro to who Ryan is.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.880
Ryan Holiday is a media
strategist and prominent writer

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.540
on strategy and business.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.410
After dropping out
of college at 19

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.160
to apprentice under Ryan
Green, author of "The 48

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.670
Laws of Power" and
other best sellers,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.140
he went on to advise
many bestselling authors,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.080
like Tim Ferriss and
multi-platinum musicians.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.010
He was a media strategist for
Tucker Max, another bestselling

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.674
author.

00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:40.090
And he's the
Director of Marketing

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.760
at American Apparel,
where he had

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.640
to deal with everything
from media hype,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.400
to lawsuits, to scandals.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.360
His campaigns and
strategies for handling

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.270
good and bad situations have
been used in case studies

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.050
by Twitter, YouTube,
and Google, and written

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.730
about in "Ad Age," "The New
York Times," and "Fast Company."

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.020
His latest book, "The Obstacle
is The Way The Timeless

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.660
Art of Turning
Trials Into Triumph,"

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.060
was released by
Penguin on May 1.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.630
He's also the bestselling
author of "Trust Me I'm Lying,"

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.490
and "Growth Hacker Marketing."

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.830
He's currently an Editor

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.040
Observer," and contributes
to "Thought Catalog"

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.030
from his home in Austin, Texas.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.890
Please join me in giving
Ryan Holiday a warm welcome.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.220
Ryan, thanks a lot for
coming to speak at Google.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.690
RYAN HOLIDAY: Of course.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.481
MALE SPEAKER: There's
a bunch of fun topics

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.190
I want to delve into,
like learning, media

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.090
strategy, philosophy,
reading, writing.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.350
But before we do all that can
you just walk us through real

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.720
quick like how you got
to where you are now

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.704
and how you got started
with everything?

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.370
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, I mean, it's
sort of a long confusing story.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.290
But I was in college.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.380
I actually went to
UC Riverside, which

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.370
is like an hour
from here, and I was

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.270
contributing to the
student newspaper.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.210
And so I thought
I would use this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450
as an excuse to like meet
all the people that I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.010
wanted to meet.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.312
So I ended up writing an
article about this guy.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.520
His name is Tucker Max, who
was like a famous blogger

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.630
at the time.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.520
We sort of struck up this
friendship from the article.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.640
And he put out his first book.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.840
I was like an intern for that.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.730
And that was just some sort
of random thing that happened,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.322
and that book ended up
becoming one of the first blogs

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:21.530
to become a bestselling book.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.090
It sold something like 2
million copies worldwide now.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.420
It launched this sort of whole
male centric literary genre,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.140
which was very unexpected.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.580
So I sort of saw how this
like blogging and publishing

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.800
was changing the book industry.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.050
I ended up working with
another author through Tucker.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.466
His name was Robert Greene,
who actually lives here in LA.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.789
He wrote "The 48 Laws of Power."

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.330
So I was doing this
publishing stuff,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.780
and then it happens
that Robert is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.640
on the Board of Directors
for American Apparel.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.820
So I started there as
sort of like a consultant

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.270
in 2007 maybe, and then ended up
building a marketing department

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.059
there.

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.350
And I've been there ever since.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.210
And then I wrote my
first book in 2011,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.930
which is sort of an
expose about the media

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.680
industry from my experiences
of working with relatively

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.790
controversial, unusual
people, and then obviously

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.059
my experiences with publishing
and writing as well.

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.850
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.921
That's cool.

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:20.170
You're obviously really young.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.770
And you've accomplished
a ton of stuff already.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.247
You've had big responsibilities
at American Apparel.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.080
You've dealt with a lot
of challenges there.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.010
And you already have
three books out.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.918
Is there something you
attribute your success to?

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:35.896
RYAN HOLIDAY: Not really.

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:38.320
I guess.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.310
What I've found-- I have
this weird thing where

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.040
I think if you do one thing
you can be like really good

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.960
at that one thing.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.800
If you do two things it's hard
to be good at those two things.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.880
But if you do like a bunch of
things that are all somewhat

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.000
related, they kind of
like fuel into each other.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.110
So it's like, I was
working for these authors,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.070
and I was learning how
blogging works, which

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.660
turned around and became very
relevant at America Apparel.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.170
But there I'm learning other
things about like ad buying,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.660
and media, and stuff like that.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.470
And then sort of working
with the authors,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.920
I'm learning how books get made.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.650
So all the things are
sort of this series

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.850
of like concentric circles that
sort of all add to each other.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.250
So for me it's not
like I did one thing,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.875
and I dedicated myself
totally to that,

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.333
and then I did another thing,
and then I did another thing.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.200
It was like all sort
of simultaneous.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.990
There was one period where I had
basically like three full time

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.100
jobs, which was not
exactly a fun experience,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.140
but it sort of
compressed a period

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.050
of learning that would
have normally taken

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.900
like years into like one or two
years where I just learned so

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.840
much that then I could
experiment and do things

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.805
when I took some of
that stuff off my plate.

00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:51.680
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.260
And I know you've talked before
about the role of mentors.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.180
I was curious to hear
about how in the past

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.160
you've set up those
sorts of relationships

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.560
where you're able
to learn from people

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.530
like Robert Greene and others?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.100
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.599
one of the problems
with mentorships

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.590
is people think it's this
like very formal relationship.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.150
Like I say now that I was
an apprentice under Robert.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.450
But that's just like
a word that gets

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.440
attributed to a relationship
after it's mostly wound down.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.490
You know, it was he needed
a research assistant.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.650
I volunteered to be
that research assistant.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.380
And then it slowly grew into
a very beneficial relationship

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.053
for myself, and then obviously
hopefully for him as well.

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:36.950
So when I get young
kids that email me,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.110
that want to talk
about-- They're like, oh,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.120
will you be my mentor?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.550
That sounds like very weird.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.840
Like who would say that?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.750
And I think Sheryl
Sandberg was talking about

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.840
that in "Lean In."
she was like people

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.630
think it's like
you get anointed.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.180
And that's not
really how it works.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.360
It's just like you don't
walk up to someone and say,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.070
will you be my
girlfriend or boyfriend?

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.650
It's like no.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.550
You meet, and then
a relationship

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.640
blossoms over time.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.310
So the mentorships
I've had started

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.450
as very informal or
even sort of random,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.720
and then based on like a
mutual exchange of value

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.910
grew over time into
being something.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.490
And there's obviously a
bunch of different traits

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.130
that are important to a good
mentor/mentee relationship,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.760
or whatever the other
word is for that.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.390
But it's something
that you have to want,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.370
and you have to sort
of build into existence

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.450
rather than like-- It's
not a scheduled thing.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.480
It's not a formal thing.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.410
It's just something
that happens.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.490
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.820
And besides these mentors,
what are some other places

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.190
that you've turned to in
the past for learning,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.495
or for basically figuring
things out as you went along.

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:47.870
RYAN HOLIDAY: I mean, books
obviously are very important.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.540
I read a lot.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.720
I try to read like two
or three books a week.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.909
And for me, what I
realized very early on,

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:56.450
and it's a little
bit clearer for me,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.910
because I work in book
publishing, and I'm a writer,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.661
but I consider reading to
be like part of my job.

00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:06.160
And that was actually
somewhat weird

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.990
when I was working full
time at America Apparel.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.156
It's like I would want to
sit there and read a book,

00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:13.230
but you can't do that
at an office, you know.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.370
So now I work from home, so
I can sort of arrange my day

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.480
in a way that appearances
matter a little bit less.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.772
But what I say is,
OK, look, chances

00:07:27.772 --> 00:07:30.230
are whatever problem you're
going through right now someone

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.780
else went through before
you, and they probably

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.790
wrote it down.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.930
And so books are the way that
we access that knowledge.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.227
And if you're not
availing yourself to it,

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:42.310
you're going to learn a
lot of things the hard way

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.810
when you don't
necessarily need to.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.910
So I consider reading to
be like part of my job,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.650
and part of what's
accelerated what

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.200
I've been able to accomplish.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.710
So it's like when
people are like, oh,

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.370
how do you have so
much time to read?

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.660
It's like, well, how do
you have time to sleep,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.920
and how do you have time
to eat, and go to work?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.390
Like that's just what you do.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.850
It's not like this
extra luxury that I

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.305
squeeze in when I'm on vacation.

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:11.180
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.660
That was going to be
one of my questions.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.180
How do you have so
much time to read.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.513
RYAN HOLIDAY: There's no secret.

00:08:15.513 --> 00:08:16.640
And I don't read fast.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.010
I think a lot of people think
that people who read a lot

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.132
must be like speed readers,
and so they focus on that.

00:08:22.132 --> 00:08:23.840
It's like, no, people
who read a lot just

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.100
spend a lot of time reading,
because it's important to them.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.315
And that's sort of the
distinction that I made.

00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:30.190
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.120
No, that's helpful.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.490
We'll get back to the reading
thing in a little bit.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.197
I wanted to ask you a bit more
about media strategy stuff.

00:08:36.197 --> 00:08:38.030
I don't know how many
people in the audience

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.830
have read either of
your first two books.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.240
So I just wanted to touch on
some of those topics briefly.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.500
Was media and marketing
sort of always a world

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.260
that was compelling
to you, and sort

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.880
of how did you get into that?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.170
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, I really
wanted to be a writer,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.010
and I wanted to
be around writers.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.892
But I was 19 years old so I had
nothing to contribute there.

00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.100
But I did sort of understand
how the internet worked.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.990
And I saw how blogs
were sort of becoming

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.140
very influential to
people who are my age.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.030
So I thought like, oh, if I want
to work for these authors maybe

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.330
that's something that I
can bring to the table.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.160
So I think that's a mistake
that a lot of writers make.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.140
I mean, that might not be super
relevant to everyone here.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.860
Like I find writing to be easy.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.010
It's like having something
to say that's far more rare.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.220
Like everyone has the ability
to string a sentence together,

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.774
and if you have something
compelling that you need to say

00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:32.190
it doesn't really matter how
well the sentence is written.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.770
Right?

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.820
So for me it was about-- I
wanted to be around writers,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.670
but then I also knew that I
had to have like experiences,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.480
and do things, and
learn things that

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.380
would make my
writing interesting.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.990
So "Trust Me I'm Lying"
was the first instance

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.240
where I thought like I
have something to say here

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.517
that no one else has said
because I understand something,

00:09:56.517 --> 00:09:58.850
or I've seen something that
maybe not everyone has seen,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.270
and this book would be a way
for me to communicate that.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.670
So it's like I always
wanted to do it.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.420
I was just waiting
for sort of the pitch

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.822
that I wanted to swing at it.

00:10:08.822 --> 00:10:09.530
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.660
Got it.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.820
And in terms of that first
book, in your mind what

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.230
are the biggest take aways
or lessons that you've

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.150
learned from that?

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.720
Or you learned that,
created that book,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.650
and that you've later
used to help promote

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.992
a lot of the musicians and
authors you've worked with?

00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:28.950
RYAN HOLIDAY: So basically
"Trust Me I'm Lying"

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.840
was sort of an expose of
the modern media system,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.610
but my premise is that when the
economics of a medium change

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.280
from subscription
based content to what

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.160
I will call one-off
content-- Right?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.950
Like we don't read
the "Huffington Post."

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.750
We read articles from the
"Huffington Post," or articles

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.174
from "The New York Times."

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:50.590
That means that
all these articles

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.230
are competing against each
other for a finite amount

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.140
of attention.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.690
And so that competition
multiplied millions of times

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.530
over exaggerates and
distorts the information

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.700
that's being conveyed.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.160
Like a newspaper is a
buyer's market, right?

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.210
Like they're
deciding what content

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.750
is going to go in the
however many number of pages

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.340
they're publishing that day.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.560
"Business Insider," or
"Gocker," or whatever,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.200
they can publish
an infinite amount.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.720
So there's sort of looking
to manufacture and create

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.400
as much content as
possible, and they

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.940
have a direct financial
incentive to do so.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.010
And so that very
quickly puts you

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.530
at odds with the truth or
reality in a lot of ways.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.890
Like in one of my talks And
this started with blogs,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.360
but it's turned the
entire media system over.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.650
Like I have this job ad I like
from "The Washington Post"

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.060
where they're looking for a
blogger to post like 12 times

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.580
a day.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.757
So it's like, you can see how
after like three or four posts

00:11:52.757 --> 00:11:54.840
you're starting to run out
of stuff to talk about.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.820
Or you're starting to have
to talk about things that

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.750
have already been
talked about, and then

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.340
put your own spin on them.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.310
And then because no one is
like subscribing to that site,

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.561
especially with things
like RSS reader declining,

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.810
the only way that people are
going to see that article

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.210
is whether it spreads on Twitter
or it spreads on Facebook.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.680
And, you know, SEO is
obviously important too.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.830
But basically that
means that unless it's

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.770
sort of hitting these
various social triggers,

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:23.920
it's not going to be seen.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.419
And so that creates what
I call toxic incentives.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:28.960
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
and people trying

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.544
to like grab you with headlines,
and the really weird subtext.

00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:33.126
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah,
basically it means

00:12:33.126 --> 00:12:35.000
the media is trying to
sell something to you

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.160
rather than trying
to literally sell you

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.130
something that is so good that
you would pay for it, you know?

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.520
And so because of that, one,
it turns a lot of journalists

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.640
into-- It adds a
level of manipulation

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.445
to the profession of
journalism, and then

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:56.180
it also creates certain
opportunities for marketers

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.380
to wield influence
and direct the news.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.100
And so the book is sort of
trying to rip back that curtain

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.100
and show how that works.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.535
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:06.022
Do you think
anything has changed

00:13:06.022 --> 00:13:07.480
since the publication
of your book?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.209
Have things gotten worse?

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:10.000
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.708
Definitely worse.

00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:13.195
So I wrote it in 2011.

00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:16.480
It was published in mid 2012.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.910
And I did an updated
paperback last year.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.050
But like when I
wrote those, like

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.350
Upworthy didn't really exist.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.730
And Buzzfeed was not the
behemoth that it now is.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.480
And so I was talking about some
of the snark and negativity

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.590
that was very pervasive
in the media at the time,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.722
and that's still a problem.

00:13:35.722 --> 00:13:37.430
And now you're sort
of on the other side.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.720
I think you're seeing this
very artificial positivity.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.190
It's like this kid was
dancing at a talent show,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.970
and you'll never guess
what happened next.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.530
And it's just some
weird kid dancing.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.630
It's not like this mind
blowing stuff, right?

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.800
But now what tends to get clicks
on Facebook-- Like the way

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.090
that the Facebook algorithm
favors certain stories,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.499
determines the content.

00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:04.790
Like there's entire businesses.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.400
Upworthy is basically an entire
multimillion dollar business

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.740
designed to game Facebook's
social algorithm,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.500
in the way that
like Demand Media

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.526
was created exclusively
to game SEO.

00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:21.930
And so you're seeing
just massive amounts

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.320
of content designed
essentially to manipulate us.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.450
And we know this.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.850
And yet we share
them all anyway.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.360
And the reality is most
things are not either

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.087
super negative or
super positive.

00:14:36.087 --> 00:14:37.920
They're somewhere in
the middle, and they're

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.610
complicated and confusing.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.720
But that doesn't distill itself
well into a headline or a three

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.130
minute video, and
so you see so much

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.570
content created
along those lines.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.000
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.310
Let's talk about philosophy
and stoicism a little bit.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.629
That's the subject
of the newest book.

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:56.920
What's your view on philosophy?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.884
How should people
learn it and use it?

00:14:58.884 --> 00:15:01.550
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, I definitely
didn't write a philosophy book,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.720
because I know that when
people hear that, they're

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.200
like I don't want to read
that, that sounds super boring.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:17.120
So like philosophy before
the modern university

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.090
was designed to help
people live good lives.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.340
Now, it's mostly
pretentious, confusing,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.920
and complicated
academic debates, right?

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.010
So I focus on
stoicism, specifically

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.460
on Marcus Aurelius, who
is at the time of writing

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.360
his book "Meditations," which
mine is partially based on,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.760
is this totally unique
historical figure.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.580
It's like you have a guy
who's the most-- He's

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.590
the guy in "Gladiator"
if you don't know.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.220
But he's the most
powerful man in the world.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.720
Right?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.410
He has unlimited wealth.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.900
He's the head of the most
powerful army on Earth.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.480
He's the head of the most
powerful empire on Earth.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.815
He's literally worshipped
as a god while he's alive.

00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:04.250
Right?

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.040
And yet every
night he sits down,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.390
and he writes in this little
journal about how he can

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:13.220
better, and more like just, and
honorable, and fair, and kind,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.570
and patient, and in
all these things.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.700
And then that document
survives, and for 2000 years

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.240
successful people have been
reading it, and interpreting

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.690
it, and basing
their lives on it.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.400
To me that's what philosophy is.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.636
And what's really cool
about stoicism-- Well,

00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:33.010
we can talk about stoicism a
little bit more in a minute.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.170
But stoicism, the three
most prominent stoics

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.670
are Marcus Aurelius,
who I just said

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.795
was the emperor, Epictetus,
who was a former slave.

00:16:39.795 --> 00:16:41.753
So you have the most
powerful man in the world,

00:16:41.753 --> 00:16:43.396
and then a totally
powerless man.

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:44.770
And then you have
Seneca, who was

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.940
one of the most famous
sort of businessmen

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.540
and political advisers
in his lifetime.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.480
To me that says that it's this
philosophy for extreme success

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.620
in extreme adversity for
people who are actually

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.110
out in the world doing things.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.540
It's not questions about
stuff you don't care about.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.089
It's like how do you deal
with getting angry, or getting

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.790
jealous, or getting
discouraged, or wanting

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.109
to break the rules
about something.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:18.390
How do you actually deal with
those practical issues in life?

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.648
That's what stoicism's about.

00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:21.540
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.349
Are there like a
handful of lessons

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:27.260
that you see yourself applying
like on a daily basis that

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.410
come from that philosophy,
or that help you

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.450
in certain situations?

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:30.890
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:31.389
Sure.

00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:33.780
Well, the big one is the one
that I based-- So the book

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.249
is based on a quote
from Marcus Aurelius.

00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:38.290
There's a long quote, but
the short version of it

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.740
is, "the impediment to
action advances action.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.547
What stands in the
way becomes the way."

00:17:42.547 --> 00:17:44.130
So I read that when
I was 19 years old

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.000
and it went over my head.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.290
But as I've gotten older,
and as I wrote this book,

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.290
I started to understand
sort of what that means.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.740
It's this formula for
optimism that essentially

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.980
says like, look, you don't
control what happens to you.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.050
You control how you
respond to that thing,

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.840
and you may as
well respond well.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.950
So that's a big one.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.210
You know, the stoics have
this idea where they say,

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.920
like there is no good or bad,
there is only perception.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.690
I think that's really important.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.940
Stoics had an idea of what
they called amor fati, which

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.580
is this sort of love of
everything that happens to you.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.340
So if you picked up any of
the stoic texts right now,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.000
it would just be like short
sentences, almost like zen

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.660
like sentences about how
to just deal with life.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.300
And that's what I take from it.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.050
And every time you
read it and look at it,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.466
you take something
different based

00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:35.085
on what you're dealing
with right now.

00:18:35.085 --> 00:18:35.960
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.190
You mentioned Seneca,
who was like one

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.950
of the wealthiest
people at his time.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.560
I think a lot of
people nowadays think

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.010
stoicism is like sort
of either not feeling

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.910
emotion, or forgoing like all
of your worldly possessions

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.859
and not being materialistic.

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.150
But this guy was super wealthy.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.941
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:18:54.941 --> 00:18:56.830
MALE SPEAKER: And
he really cared

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.670
about a lot of these ideas.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.359
So how do you
reconcile those things?

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:01.150
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.930
Well, one of the saddest
parts of philosophy

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.060
is that stoicism
is known as being

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.060
the philosophy of
not having emotions.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.580
And then epicureanism
is known as being

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.780
the philosophy of like
loving luxury, and whatever.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.970
And, in actuality,
both schools were

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.120
about essentially the
opposite of whatever

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.254
their modern reputation is.

00:19:23.254 --> 00:19:24.170
It's very unfortunate.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.940
I think it turns a
lot of people off.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.315
But what Seneca is saying
is, and all the stoics,

00:19:29.315 --> 00:19:31.190
they're not saying like
you can't be wealthy,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.690
you can't be successful, you
can't go out and do things.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.630
What they're saying
is that you can't

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.300
be dependent on these things.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.890
Like he's saying, wealth
is nice if you have it,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.970
but if you make your personal
happiness dependent on having

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.670
this money, that bad, because
it's not in your control.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.170
Right?

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.170
The economy could melt
down at any moment,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.410
or your house could burn down,
or you could lose your job.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:00.000
And if you have equated wealth
with personal happiness,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.450
now your personal happiness
is outside of your control.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.030
And so stoicism is about
control in that sense.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:12.290
How do you make the distinction
between externals and internals

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.160
and focus most of your
energy on internals.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.510
Having externals is nice, but
sort of what they would say

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.960
is understand that they
are yours in trust, which

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.210
means that they could
leave you at any moment.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.290
And a lot of the stoic exercises
are sort of about practice

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.350
not having those things.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.300
So Seneca was famous.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.970
One day a month he would
practice being poor.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.740
So he would wear
like crappy clothes,

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.090
and he would like
not eat at his house,

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.070
and he would sleep outside.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.831
I mean, it's I think more now
like a metaphor than anything

00:20:41.831 --> 00:20:42.330
else.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.030
But the idea is like we're
so afraid of these things,

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.020
so we don't think about
them, and therefore

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.490
we're not prepared for them.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.080
And then it makes
them much scarier,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.760
and we dread them
that much more,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.570
even though if you looked
at it really objectively

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.626
it's really not that bad.

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:00.459
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.751
That makes a lot of sense.

00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:05.250
Back to the subject of reading,
which you brought up before.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.708
For those of you who don't
know, sort of as Ryan mentioned,

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:10.080
he is an extremely avid reader.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.790
His collection of
books is enormous,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.420
and he has like
over 15,000 people

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.930
who subscribe to his
monthly reading suggestion

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.145
newsletter, which I
follow and appreciate.

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:23.770
So I'm curious to hear a little
bit more about your perspective

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.320
on reading and books, and the
purpose they serve for you.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.407
Have you always been
reading a ton of stuff,

00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:32.240
or did that sort of
develop all of a sudden.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.570
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.640
I mean, I've always
been reading a lot.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.650
I grew up reading a lot.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.500
In college I don't know.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.990
I would take cues
from the professor,

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.700
and then I would read just like
everything that they suggested,

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:51.690
or I would ask any smart
person that I would interact

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.820
with in any way if they
had any book advice.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.489
So weirdly I got
introduced to stoicism,

00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:01.280
because when I was in
college I got invited

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.470
to this conference that was
put on by Trojan condoms

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.190
of all things.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.430
They had a conference in West
Hollywood for like college

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.930
journalists.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.120
And then the moderator of
this like little session

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.645
was Doctor Drew, who's
host of "Love Line"

00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:17.790
and he has that show on HLN now.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.230
And so we were leaving,
and I was like, hey,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.660
do you recommend any books?

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.830
And he recommended Epictetus,
who is one of the other stoics.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.630
And so that sort
of chance encounter

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.440
introduced me to a book
that I spent $15 on.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.400
And it totally changed my
life in like dramatic way,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.630
and put me on the
path that I'm on now.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.930
And so I'm sort of
of the mind that it's

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.250
like ask people which
books changed their life,

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.810
read those books, and see
what you can get out of them,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.050
and then let them sort of-- Like
the way I find books to read

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.800
is I ask people what
they like, and then I

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.820
try to read one book from
every book that I read.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.830
So I flip to the
bibliography, and I

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.910
see like anything that
sounds interesting.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.850
Or I'll just pick something
mentioned during the text.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.814
So I kind of have these chains,
where it's like I read this,

00:23:09.814 --> 00:23:11.480
and then that takes
me to this, and then

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.100
that takes me to
some other thing.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.330
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.350
How do you organize
yourself and what you read?

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.870
I know you've written about
the commonplace book system.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.400
Maybe you can talk about
that as well for a second.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.240
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.190
So I only read physical books.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.700
I know that makes me
somewhat anachronistic now,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.410
but I read only
physical books, and then

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.150
I write notes in them while I'm
reading, and I fold the pages.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.080
I learned this system when I
was researching for Robert.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.730
This is the system that he used.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.760
So I had to learn
that system and then

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.210
participate in that system.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.110
So my system is I read
the books, I take notes,

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.820
I fold the pages.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.260
And then I wait
like a week or two,

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.760
and I go back through
the book and I

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.510
transfer any quotes,
or stories, or facts

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:59.320
that I marked down to
four by six note cards.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.220
And then I organize
those note cards.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.414
I have a box of my house
that's organized by themes.

00:24:05.414 --> 00:24:07.580
And I do this, one, when
I'm just reading generally,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.996
but if I'm researching
for a book,

00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:12.600
like "The Obstacle is the
Way" I think is three parts,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.810
and then each part
is like 10 chapters.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.520
So in my box for that
book was actually

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.150
five sections, three, and then
an intro and a conclusion.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.740
And then each section had
10 file dividers, and then

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:31.830
probably 20 to 30 note cards
per section, sometimes 200 note

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.915
cards per section.

00:24:32.915 --> 00:24:35.290
And then when I would sit down
to write I'd take the note

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.270
cards out, and I
sit down and I--

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.690
Like if I'm writing
Part Two Chapter Six,

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.750
and I'm travelling, all I have
to take with me is those note

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.360
cards.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.160
And that's got like
quotes and stories,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.550
and maybe I saw a
word that I liked,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.430
and I want to use that word.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:58.090
So weirdly the book only took me
probably three months to write.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.220
Like the first draft
took three months.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.090
But I researched for
it for seven years.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.530
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.470
Now, we're obviously at Google,
and here we do a lot of work

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.565
towards digitizing
things, and trying

00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:13.920
to put all the world's
information online, and make

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.250
it searchable, accessible,
all that stuff.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.458
RYAN HOLIDAY: I've been
thinking about hiring someone

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:20.130
on TaskRabbit to scan them
all, but I'm so nervous.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.870
So last year my house
got broken into.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.979
And the first thing I thought
about was like, oh my god,

00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:27.770
like I hope they didn't
take my note cards.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.380
I'm going to be so screwed
if they take my note cards.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.080
And they didn't.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.621
Like it was totally untouched,
and I was like, oh, thank God.

00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:37.830
So as I'm cleaning up my
office, because they basically

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.810
destroyed everything.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.170
I'm cleaning up the office.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.400
I set the box like
on like a corner,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.540
and then I forget about it.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.300
And like 10 minutes later
I walk into it, and just

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.771
poof, all the cards everywhere.

00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:49.770
MALE SPEAKER: Aw, shoot.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.440
RYAN HOLIDAY: So I know I need
to digitize it at some point.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.910
But I mean, it's literally like
thousands and thousands of note

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:03.000
cards, some of which have
totally illegible handwriting.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.662
And so I'm not sure.

00:26:05.662 --> 00:26:07.870
I may just have to stick
with this system until I die

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.652
or something.

00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:11.110
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, you could
do it for backup obviously.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.700
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.200
MALE SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] scenarios.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.330
But I was just curious to
hear like you love paper,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.039
and you love the
physical element of it.

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.580
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.772
Like what causes you to be--

00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:23.980
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well, I think
there's two things there.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.020
One, I think what
a lot of people

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.720
miss about books when
they're like making e-readers

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.630
and e-books and
stuff, is they forget

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.470
that a book is a
piece of technology.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.750
And at one point it was
a pretty innovative piece

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.850
of technology, sort of
blew everyone's mind

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.640
when it came out.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.310
But an analogy
might be like, you

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.060
know when you watch like
science fiction movies

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.710
they have all these
like cool doors.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.840
Like the doors break
open in the middle.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.440
And then we live in the
future comparatively, right?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.400
And we still have just
metal doors, right?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.070
Because a door is a really
good piece of technology,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.950
in terms of it being
simple, and effective,

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.840
and more or less does
what we need it to do.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.540
And I think a book is a
similar piece of technology.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.000
Like in terms of sitting
down and reading something

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.860
that you're probably only
going to read one time for $15

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.070
a book is a pretty
good version of that.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.370
And so for most people they
don't pick up a physical book,

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.980
and they're like,
ah, I hate this,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.690
it's just not working for me.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.780
In fact, people
love books, right?

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.140
So I think that's
something that people miss.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.795
And I think that's
something that's

00:27:33.795 --> 00:27:35.420
going to stick with
us for a long time.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.420
It's just a great
piece of technology

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.160
all things considered.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.750
People also forget
that in publishing

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.280
like it's so cheap to
print a physical book

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.600
that the margins
are-- It costs like $2

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.750
to print a physical book.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:53.390
So switching to
ebooks is not that big

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.120
of a savings for most people.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.280
But then in terms of the
note cards and stuff,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.200
I think it's really
important for two reasons.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.960
One, having to physically
transfer the stuff.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.880
So if I'm just reading an ebook,
and then I'm transferring stuff

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.610
to Evernote I'm not having
to put in any effort,

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.990
or I'm not having to run that
content through my mind again.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.350
And so I would fear that
if I did that I would just

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:23.100
have an enormous like Evernote
file or Google Doc filled

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.050
with things that I have no
idea are actually there.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.687
Like if I'm writing
something often I'll

00:28:28.687 --> 00:28:31.100
like think of a note card
that I know that I wrote,

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.066
and it will be a
total pain to go find,

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:34.565
but the only reason
I know it exists

00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:37.590
is because I physically
wrote it down,

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.700
and I remember
having to write down

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.990
like six sentences
on a note card.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.840
And I remember that,
and that's important.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.590
But then like when
you're crafting a book,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.670
being able to move things around
like right in front of you,

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.320
or lay them out, is, I
think, very underrated.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.570
A lot of authors that I
know, or aspiring authors

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.150
more often than not,
think that writing a book

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.790
is just like, oh, I'm
going to sit down, and then

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.960
see where it takes me.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.980
That's like a great way
to write a bunch of stuff

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.260
that you can't use.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.490
So for me, like organizing it
and having it all sketched out

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.030
before I start, and being
able to-- It's like,

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.920
oh, I'm going to
move this over here,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.550
or like actually I didn't use
this quote in section one,

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.710
now I can put it over
here in section three,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.570
is very important.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.250
And I don't know what the
technological replacement

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.910
for that would be.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.990
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.010
Are there any authors you're
reading right now that you want

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.540
to throw out, or
that you recommend?

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.290
RYAN HOLIDAY: Any books
that I'm reading--

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.980
MALE SPEAKER: Or just
finished recently?

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.950
RYAN HOLIDAY: I'm
trying to think.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:37.890
What have I read?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:40.980
Yeah.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.146
I just read this book called
"Evening Empire," which

00:29:43.146 --> 00:29:44.737
is by-- It's a fiction book.

00:29:44.737 --> 00:29:45.820
It was really interesting.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.570
It was like the author's
father was killed--

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.690
This is a true story--
The author's father was

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.500
assassinated by the mob in like
the '70s when he was like five

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.700
years old, and he wrote
like an investigative book

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.260
about his father's
own murder that I

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.230
thought was really interesting.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.730
I tend to read all
over the place.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.060
So like I'm reading a book
about the Civil War one day,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.935
and then I'm reading a
book about technology,

00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:09.700
and then I'm reading
a book of fiction.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.790
So I keep the reading list,
and I only recommend books

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.084
that I've read that I liked.

00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:16.500
I read a lot of
books that I think

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.041
like aren't good
enough to recommend.

00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:19.570
But I do that once a month.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.210
And that's sort of
everything that I've

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.846
been reading in that period.

00:30:22.846 --> 00:30:24.080
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.750
Besides reading,
are there other sort

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.800
of rituals, or things that
are part of your daily life

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.420
that help towards writing, or
towards any of the marketing

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:31.920
stuff?

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.503
RYAN HOLIDAY: I mean,
I think exercise

00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:35.770
is very important to
the creative process.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:42.980
I try to either run, or swim,
or I do cross fit every day.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.481
That's very important.

00:30:44.481 --> 00:30:46.230
I tend to have like
creative breakthroughs

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.390
when I've stopped
working on something

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.630
and I've went to
do something else.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.380
Which is cool.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.580
You were showing
me the gym earlier.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.920
I think that's probably
why that's there.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.500
It's like you can work, and
work, and work on a problem.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.366
And then you stop.

00:30:57.366 --> 00:30:59.240
And then when you're
thinking about something

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.240
else that sort of magically
comes together in your mind.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.030
So I think that's important.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.300
Yeah, I don't know.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.010
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.720
You mentioned about writing.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.060
You mention a little bit
about like the balance

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.020
between technique and
style, versus content,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:21.930
and you lean more heavily
towards the content side.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.620
I guess, is it a
common mistake that you

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.350
see that other
people don't really

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.920
have interesting
messages to say?

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.628
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
I just think it's sad

00:31:29.628 --> 00:31:33.640
that most writers think they
have to go pay like $80 grand

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.805
to get an MFA.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.900
So you're just focusing
on the craft part.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.180
And the craft is certainly
important, but just

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.540
think about all the
fascinating memoirs that

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.730
have been written by people
who are like essentially

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:54.420
illiterate, or just
dumb as shit, right?

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.850
But they wrote like
fascinating memoirs

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.570
because they lived
interesting lives.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.340
And I think you're far
better off focusing

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.860
on having something to say than
being really good at saying it,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.002
you know?

00:32:07.002 --> 00:32:08.460
Obviously there
are some books that

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.530
are just like amazing,
beautiful pieces of writing.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.006
And like "The Great Gatsby"
is like I think an example.

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.380
Like people go
like, this is some

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.629
of the best writing ever
done in the English language.

00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:21.980
But it's also, one, a super
compelling story written

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.110
by someone who was
being deeply critical,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.680
and felt very compelled
to say something

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.730
about an entire
generation of people.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.050
And so I would say
that "The Great Gatsby"

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.790
could be 50% worse from
a writing standpoint

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.670
and might still
be worth reading.

00:32:41.507 --> 00:32:42.965
Or even when you
look at people who

00:32:42.965 --> 00:32:46.150
are not professional writers,
like when you go on like Medium

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.680
or something, the best
posts are like from people

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.860
who have a particularly unique
or unexpected perspective

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.670
about something.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.050
And so that's what I think
people should focus on

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.543
on their writing.

00:32:59.543 --> 00:33:00.370
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.090
Before we switch
to audience Q&amp;A,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.940
I just wanted to ask you about
the roadmap going forward.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.450
What are you planning
on working on next?

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.547
Any upcoming goals or projects?

00:33:10.547 --> 00:33:12.630
RYAN HOLIDAY: I mean, this
is three books in three

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.010
years for me, so I'm
pretty exhausted.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.890
But I'm thinking about what
the next book will be probably,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.690
and then I'm going
to hopefully take

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.890
some time off because
I'm very tired.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.520
But yeah, keep doing
what I'm doing.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.820
I have a marketing company.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.115
I still work with
American Apparel.

00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:34.100
I mean, there's no like
thing that I want to do next,

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.709
because this is
what I wanted to do.

00:33:36.709 --> 00:33:37.500
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.830
That's great.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.360
I can open it up to audience
Q&amp;A. I'll walk over to you guys

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.820
so you get recorded.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.320
Yeah.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.918
RYAN HOLIDAY: That's so weird.

00:33:44.918 --> 00:33:46.750
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.850
RYAN HOLIDAY: Talk into
his hip microphone please.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.030
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.120
OK, I have 43 questions.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.030
RYAN HOLIDAY: Is it 43
questions or a 43 part question?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.520
AUDIENCE: No,
actually I guess it's

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.280
kind of a sign of how
great this talk was, or is,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.009
that it's like, oh, and I
want to ask that, and that.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:08.800
And why doesn't this
guy ask that question,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.679
and that follow up?

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.460
So I'll choose maybe one or two.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:21.040
The first one when Max
asked you about how did you

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.130
come by, kind of get to
the point of being-- You

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.750
kind of started at
19 as-- You know,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:32.440
you started working
with that author.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.639
But I'd like to kind of
take it a little bit.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.850
The thing that strikes me most,
and I'm sure a lot of people

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:42.320
here, you give off a sense of
like this relentless, sharp,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.769
focus that all these
kids that supposedly, you

00:34:45.769 --> 00:34:47.949
know, still live with
their parents at 35

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.409
probably don't display.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.120
And I would like you to talk
a little bit about-- I mean,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.439
it's like all of the rest of
the stuff stems from that.

00:34:55.439 --> 00:34:56.230
RYAN HOLIDAY: Sure.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.771
AUDIENCE: You've
got this huge drive,

00:34:57.771 --> 00:35:00.046
and then you figured
out how to-- If you

00:35:00.046 --> 00:35:01.300
could talk about that.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.841
RYAN HOLIDAY: No,
that's interesting.

00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:07.190
I've always been sort of a very
intense person I would say.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.980
I think there's
sort of an intensity

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.340
mixed with sort of
introvertedness, which

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.310
works well for what I
do, because it forces

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:18.039
you to sort of go internal,
and sort of nagging things

00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:19.580
that you're just
focused on until you

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.010
can get them to make sense.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:23.470
So I guess it's always
been that way for me,

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:27.200
but I sort of start
with 19 because up

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.400
until that point I guess I
was just a normal college

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.310
student that got a
series of lucky breaks

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.600
that introduced me to
people that taught me a lot.

00:35:42.142 --> 00:35:42.850
But I don't know.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.600
Like my childhood was
pretty unremarkable.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.990
It wasn't like Steve
Jobs growing up next

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:53.140
to like the dude who created
Hewlett Packard, or whatever.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.790
There was no thing like that.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.140
It was just in college
I met some people

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.690
and started down this
path, and I've always

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.840
been very intense about it.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.881
AUDIENCE: But there's
nothing during high school,

00:36:03.881 --> 00:36:07.940
or during earlier schooling
that shows a difference in focus

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.440
between--

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.898
RYAN HOLIDAY: No,
I don't think so.

00:36:09.898 --> 00:36:12.700
I mean, I've thought a lot about
it, but there's nothing there.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.990
I wish there was.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.390
It would make it
easier to explain this.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.730
AUDIENCE: I guess I have maybe
two questions, but one I think

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.440
is quick.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.750
Growing up you said you'd
had a lifelong obsession

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.570
with reading.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:33.160
Was there like any kind
of shift in genre or book

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.020
that drew you in?

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.380
Or did you always love
biographies, or historical,

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.070
or fiction, or escapist
fantasy, or whatever?

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.320
RYAN HOLIDAY: I think what
my parents did pretty early

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.995
on is they gave me like all--
My dad was a police officer

00:36:45.995 --> 00:36:49.560
and my mom was like
a school principal.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.390
They were just
very like educated,

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.810
but like civil servant types.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.746
So they gave me
their favorite books,

00:36:56.746 --> 00:36:58.620
which just happened to
be the books that they

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.240
read in high school and college.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.076
But they gave them
to me pretty early.

00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.450
So it was like,
by the time I got

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:04.380
to like middle school
and high school

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.755
I'd already read
all those books.

00:37:05.755 --> 00:37:07.730
So it was like, what
comes after that?

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:15.040
So I think I'm just a testament
to the compounding returns

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.370
that come from having
an early start.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.685
That's the only-- I mean,
I thought a lot about it,

00:37:19.685 --> 00:37:21.382
and there was no
like, oh, you know,

00:37:21.382 --> 00:37:23.590
I got introduced to this
book and it changed my life,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.540
or I saw this person talk
and it changed everything.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.790
There wasn't really like that.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.380
It was just, you know, I'm just
reading "Lord of the Flies"

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.340
in fourth grade, or fifth
grade, or something,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.756
when I should have
been reading it

00:37:34.756 --> 00:37:36.600
in freshman year of high school.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.450
And so that allowed me to start
asking questions and seeing

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.580
things maybe a little bit early.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.210
AUDIENCE: And then
the second question

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:50.620
is, is there a particular
book or work that you really

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.939
wish that you had done?

00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:53.980
RYAN HOLIDAY: Is there a
book I wish I'd written?

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:57.160
If you read something and
said, wow, I wish that was me.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.230
RYAN HOLIDAY: I'm a
big Nicholas Taleb fan.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.250
So I think "The Black
Swan" is pretty amazing.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.140
One of the people in the
book is Samuel Zamurray,

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.060
who was the founder
of United Fruit.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.530
He's not a good person.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.950
But there was a really
interesting biography

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:19.520
of him called "The Fish
That Ate the Whale"

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.990
that I liked a lot that I
probably wish that I'd written.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:26.740
I think most of the books
that I thought were amazing

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:30.830
that I wish I'd written were
probably like biographies,

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.440
because I just can't wrap my
head around writing like a 900

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.700
page book about someone,
and not only writing it,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.840
but having no factual
errors, and being

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.770
able to sort of live inside
this person and produce this--

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.430
I don't know.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:49.870
Just the mammoth size of that
task is very impressive to me.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.510
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned really at 19

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.410
you were interested, slash
excited about blogging.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.560
And, you know, you sort
of was charting a bit

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.070
about sort of the arc
of that, maybe how

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.080
it's maybe going down at this
point in time, the lack of RSS

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.120
feeds and what have
you, and maybe it's

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.660
turning into sort
of advertising.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.310
I'm curious, because
you've connected

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:18.180
in a great way blogging to how
that's produced sort of more

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.811
publishing opportunities, is
there a new technology today,

00:39:20.811 --> 00:39:22.560
or is there a technology
front that you're

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.000
excited about that
kind of connects,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.910
if not in the same way, but
has that sort of same feeling

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.480
for you that blogging once did?

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.330
RYAN HOLIDAY: I don't know.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.739
Obviously I think books are
really exciting right now.

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:39.280
I think you're seeing
a lot of people

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.720
do cool things in like audio.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.510
I think you're seeing
cool stuff in audio right

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.430
now, both like on podcasting
and in audiobooks.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.180
It's never sort of
been cheaper and easier

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.800
to produce like
professional quality stuff.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.820
And then with
smartphones and broadband

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.730
you can store this stuff really
easily or access it easily.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.280
So I think audio books used
to be the thing that you could

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.300
only listen to in your car,
and you had to have nine CDs

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.050
or whatever.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.940
And now it's like it's just one
thing in iTunes or whatever.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.870
Right?

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.560
So I think that's interesting.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.449
But there's no one technology
that's like, oh, I love this,

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:20.240
I think this is going
to change everything.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.520
And that might just
be because having

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.910
seen that happen with
blogging I'm a little jaded,

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.970
and I think that sort of--
That one of my favorite writers

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:34.850
is Evgeny Morozov,
where his sort of point

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.430
is that technology
just allows us

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.850
to be more or less
who we actually are.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.354
And so I've lost some of
that idealism about like,

00:40:44.354 --> 00:40:46.520
oh, this is going to make
everything so much better.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.990
It's like, no, you're going
to see the same people doing

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.830
the same things,
just like you're

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.539
seeing some of the same
Hollywood economics now

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:56.080
be applied to the people who
are creating content on YouTube,

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.900
or whatever.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.190
It's all, at the end of
the day, it's the same.

00:41:04.687 --> 00:41:05.603
AUDIENCE: Hello Senor.

00:41:05.603 --> 00:41:06.350
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yes.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.391
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:10.036
What's on your iPod right now?

00:41:10.036 --> 00:41:12.410
RYAN HOLIDAY: I would prefer
not to answer that question,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.900
because I listen
to terrible music.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.680
My thing is that I listen
to the same songs like over,

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.200
and over, and over again.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.810
And then I throw
them away after,

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.775
because I'm so
sick of them, and I

00:41:24.775 --> 00:41:28.010
feel so disgusted that I would
have listened to this song

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.439
300 or 400 times.

00:41:29.439 --> 00:41:30.980
AUDIENCE: But it
helps though, right?

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.230
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah, of course.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.550
And I think it's like very
good for like focusing.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.570
The music becomes
background noise.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.920
The music replaces
the background noise,

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.829
and then all that's left is
like whatever you're working on.

00:41:45.424 --> 00:41:47.340
AUDIENCE: I'll get your
recommendations later.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.172
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:41:49.172 --> 00:41:52.780
I don't think you're
going to like them.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.780
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.350
One is when do you read?

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.670
Do you ritualize you're
reading, like in the morning,

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.045
or a certain time,
or do you just

00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:00.780
read whenever you
feel like reading?

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.696
RYAN HOLIDAY: I'm more
of like a binge reader.

00:42:02.696 --> 00:42:05.742
So if I'm travelling I'll
read like a ton of books,

00:42:05.742 --> 00:42:08.200
and then if I'm home and I'm
busy I might not read anything

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:08.949
for a couple days.

00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:12.840
So it's me it's more I read
whenever I have a chance,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.990
and I try to increase
that by always

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.600
like carrying a
book around with me.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.710
So it's like, you know, let's
say I have to be here at 10:30.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.530
Maybe I'm going to
get here at 10:15,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.154
and like read
for-- You know, I'm

00:42:24.154 --> 00:42:26.730
going to try to squeeze
reading in like little blocks

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:27.516
like that.

00:42:27.516 --> 00:42:31.180
AUDIENCE: What motivates
you to put the effort

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.989
to do all this-- Like
what drives that?

00:42:33.989 --> 00:42:34.780
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.182
And I call it a
note card system.

00:42:37.182 --> 00:42:39.390
If you Google like my name,
and that, you can see it,

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.473
and I have pictures, and
I've sketched it all out.

00:42:41.473 --> 00:42:42.540
But like this is my job.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.350
I mean, I'm supposed
to find-- Like when

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:50.030
I write books I need to have
examples, and stories, and data

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.260
to make my argument.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.980
So it's somewhat
unfair in that I

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.840
get paid to produce this system.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.900
So it's not like I'm doing it
for fun because I'm very OCD.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.160
It's like this is what I have
to do to produce what I produce.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.154
But even if I didn't I
would still probably do it--

00:43:07.154 --> 00:43:08.570
And I had a version
of this system

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:14.907
before I learned it-- Because
I think it's important.

00:43:14.907 --> 00:43:16.490
I mean, one of the
big sections that I

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.910
have is just like life advice,
just weird, interesting

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.400
perspectives that I might not
have thought of otherwise,

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.170
that I might want to
go back to at some time

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.670
if I'm like dealing
with something

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.878
or struggling with something.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.970
Is there anything else
that you can attribute

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.130
to your success besides
reading, and social networking,

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.850
and obviously your drive?

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.860
Like is there anything?

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.590
RYAN HOLIDAY: Well,
one would be luck.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.089
Right?

00:43:49.089 --> 00:43:52.657
I think that's a
lot of people don't.

00:43:52.657 --> 00:43:54.240
It's like, hey, I
emailed this person.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.712
He got back to me, and then
another good thing happened,

00:43:56.712 --> 00:43:58.670
and another good thing
happened, and it sort of

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.310
builds from there.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.120
So I think that's
obviously very important.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.078
But that probably doesn't
answer your question.

00:44:03.078 --> 00:44:14.210
So I've hired and fired
my fair share of people.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.670
And like I hire people.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.160
I'm very excited about them.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.330
And then so often they
end up not working out,

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.920
because two things.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.260
They don't want it, right?

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.920
And I seem to want them to be
more successful than they want

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.100
to be for themselves, and
that's very frustrating.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.240
Or two, like they're
just nuts, like

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.725
they just have so many,
especially young people,

00:44:36.725 --> 00:44:38.890
like they have so many issues.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.430
And it's like, look, I'm
hiring you to do this job,

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.170
not because I want to be like
involved in your personal life,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.850
or I want to hear
why you couldn't

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.420
do this because of that.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.770
So for me it was like I
wanted this stuff really bad,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.910
and I wasn't going to
let any things that I

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.960
was dealing with
interfere with that.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.540
So it was like sort
of not all business,

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.950
but like when it was
business it was all business.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.470
And so I think taking
care of yourself

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.740
and being well
adjusted, and centered,

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.310
and healthy is very important.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.469
And it's sort of part
of the job as well.

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:16.510
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a
little bit more-- Sorry,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.370
it's another question.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:17.560
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.226
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit more

00:45:19.226 --> 00:45:21.569
about how you became Director
for the American Apparel?

00:45:21.569 --> 00:45:22.360
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.909
So this probably doesn't
apply for any other company

00:45:24.909 --> 00:45:26.950
because American Apparel
is a little bit unusual,

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.520
but when I came in American
Apparel had no marketing

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.620
department.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.840
And the company was probably
a $400 million a year

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.040
company at this point
with 10,000 employees.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.870
But there was like
a guy over here

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.090
who kind of did some
marketing stuff, and then

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.718
someone over here who sent out,
you know, product placement,

00:45:45.718 --> 00:45:47.426
and then there was
someone else over here

00:45:47.426 --> 00:45:48.970
who was designing ads.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.937
And part of what Dov
brought me in to do

00:45:52.937 --> 00:45:54.270
was sort of organize that stuff.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.700
So I ended up building
the marketing department.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.350
Like literally our office was at
one point like a large storage

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.750
closet for broken sewing
machines at the factory.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:09.080
And so we cleared that out,
and that became the office.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.540
So I ended up becoming
the Director of Marketing

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.000
because it was like
I built it, and there

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.930
wasn't anyone else
to be in charge.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:22.740
And so it was this sort of
totally random accumulation

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.110
of stuff that led to
me being the director.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.670
And American Apparel is like a
vertically integrated company.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.720
So like Dov, the owner and CEO,
is like my only direct boss.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.430
So it probably
couldn't have worked

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:43.650
at Urban Outfitters or somewhere
else, but it's been very cool.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.120
I got to learn so
much on the job.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.030
What I like about marketing
is you do this thing,

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:54.149
and then you can
like see in real time

00:46:54.149 --> 00:46:56.065
whether it's like driving
people to the store,

00:46:56.065 --> 00:46:59.360
or it's driving sales, or
you put out this thing,

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.152
and then a reporter's
calling you

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:02.443
and they want to talk about it.

00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:04.470
So marketing has been
very cool for me,

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.180
and my role at
American Apparel was

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.240
about creating some
semblance of strategy

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.370
behind that, because
it wasn't there before.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.971
It was just very scattered.

00:47:12.971 --> 00:47:14.720
AUDIENCE: Sorry, will
be my last question.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.678
RYAN HOLIDAY: Whatever.

00:47:15.678 --> 00:47:17.734
AUDIENCE: So in
terms of marketing,

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:20.150
would you say that you just
attended a lot of conferences,

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:23.320
and how you got into that in
terms of social networking?

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.560
RYAN HOLIDAY: I've definitely
been to a lot of conferences.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.020
I could probably count on one
hand with like half my fingers

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.940
how many of those conferences
I really got something out of.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.034
I think a lot of people
focus on those things

00:47:38.034 --> 00:47:39.950
because it's like what
everyone else is doing.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.760
The conferences that I've
gotten the most of that I've

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.800
met the most people
at-- I was actually

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.720
at a Google conference in
London like two weeks ago

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.780
called Google Create.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.184
It was very cool that I
met all these people at.

00:47:55.184 --> 00:47:56.600
It was one of the
best conferences

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.700
I've probably ever been to.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.950
But it was like totally
random, and most of the people

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.810
were not talking
about marketing.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.670
So I tend to find that
it's going to the things

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.390
that you don't know
that much about.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.020
Like you go to
South by Southwest,

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.200
it's like there's 250,000
other people there

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.844
attending this conference.

00:48:13.844 --> 00:48:15.760
You're not going to get
face time with people.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.635
You're probably not
going to learn that much.

00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:20.130
Everyone is there just
as an excuse to party.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.490
Is that the place that you're
going to get the most out

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:23.090
of it?

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.510
And is that worth a week
of your life, or whatever?

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:30.570
So one, I try to think
about attending the ones

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.070
that other people
aren't attending.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.670
And then I've also found that
if you're speaking at-- So

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.480
I would much rather
speak at a conference

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.800
than attend a conference, even
if that conference I'm speaking

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.220
at is much less prestigious
and much smaller than the one

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.022
that I'm attending, because it
sort of changes the dynamic,

00:48:50.022 --> 00:48:52.230
and you have a different
relationship with the people

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.520
that you're meeting.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.309
I went to this one like
sort of private-- I

00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:59.850
guess this is a good
example-- I went

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.075
to this private
conference, and Keith-- I

00:49:02.075 --> 00:49:03.950
don't know if you know
who Keith Ferrazzi is,

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.440
but he wrote that book
"Never Eat Alone."

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.320
And he spoke.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.940
And I was talking to the
host, and he was like, yeah,

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:15.174
I invited Keith, and he was
like, hey, do you want to come?

00:49:15.174 --> 00:49:16.340
It's this thing at my house.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.880
And he was like, I'll
come only if I can speak.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.890
And I was like, what?

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.850
And he's like, he only
goes to conferences

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:25.200
he can speak at, because
of that exact thing.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.672
It just changes the dynamic
of how you meet people,

00:49:29.672 --> 00:49:31.630
and how they perceive
you, and stuff like that.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.730
So that might be
like a little trick.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:33.563
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:33.563 --> 00:49:35.050
RYAN HOLIDAY: Yeah.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.050
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.360
Thank you so much
Ryan for coming.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.151
RYAN HOLIDAY: Cool.

00:49:38.151 --> 00:49:39.210
Thank you guys.
