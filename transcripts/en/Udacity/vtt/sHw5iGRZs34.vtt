00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.400
I can't imagine living in a world without

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.010
being able to drink milk with my cookies.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.340
But fortunately today, we have the ability to

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.670
digest lactose products even if you're lactose intolerant.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.040
&gt;&gt; Some companies actually sell a product which is lactase in pill

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
form. You don't make lactase? No problem. They'll try to provide it for

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.450
you in a bioactive form to help you digest that lactose. Essentially what

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.230
it does is put the lactase in your stomach to digest the lactose

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.350
so that the bacteria in your gut doesn't have to

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.200
do it and you don't have to get those side effects.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.100
&gt;&gt; So let's take this scenario, Miriam is

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.340
lactate non persistent meaning that she shows signs of

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.820
lactose intolerance. After hanging out with some friends

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.510
they decide to go out for ice cream which

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.830
has lactose in it. So she wouldn't be

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.410
left out, Miriam took a lactase pill so that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.580
she could enjoy the ice cream with her friends,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.590
without all the side effects of lactose intolerance. So

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.060
I want you to tell me, which of the following statements

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.910
apply to Miriam? Make sure to check all statements that apply.
