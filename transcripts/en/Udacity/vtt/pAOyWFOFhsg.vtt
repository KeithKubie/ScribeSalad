00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.150
Hey Christian, want some water?

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.360
&gt;&gt; Hey Don, yes please.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.650
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.820
&gt;&gt; That's a fancy teapot.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of my favorites. Oh I'm sorry it doesn't have much water.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.920
&gt;&gt; I'd like a little bit more than that.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.850
&gt;&gt; Well here why don't you fill it and I want to explain this coffee pot.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.360
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.690
&gt;&gt; So. This is a joke. It's one of

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.890
my favorite jokes. It's sometimes called Coffee Pot for Masochists,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.040
it was done originally by a French artists and this was

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.310
a copy made just for me. And I've used it for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.900
the cover of my books, I love it so much. You

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.030
know, what's nice about it is it's obvious that you grab

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.230
the handle, it's obvious that that's the spout, but it's also

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.620
obvious that it's the wrong way, it won't work. The conceptual

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.180
model is clear and it's clear that it, well, that it's

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.800
a joke. It's impossible on purpose. What's a matter? How you doing?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.900
&gt;&gt; Well I,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.560
it doesn't have a place to fill.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I know.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.810
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.230
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I recommend that.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.540
&gt;&gt; Okay. Then the other choice is at the buttom.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.950
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.130
&gt;&gt; Which I'm going to try.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Good. Seems to work.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.650
&gt;&gt; So far.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.170
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.220
That's a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.160
funny way to use a teapot.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that doesn't seem to work.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.050
&gt;&gt; That's not the way I used it before. Hm, hey.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.665
&gt;&gt; Why doesn't the water drip out? Well, look at that.

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:45.102
[SOUND]

00:01:45.102 --> 00:01:47.830
&gt;&gt; So, how do you think it works?

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.220
What's your conceptual model for the way it works?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.140
&gt;&gt; It's a mystery.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.030
&gt;&gt; Hm, it's supposed to be a mystery. It's called a puzzle-pot. The

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.930
Chinese invented a togo about 400 years ago, and this is a copy.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.710
And, you're right, there's no obvious way to put the water in you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.020
don't really want to put it in there, and you turn it upside

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.010
down and there's a hole

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.612
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:10.250
&gt;&gt; sure, but come on. You pour the water there, you turn it

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.490
upside down, the water will flow out. So, yet, if I do that, whoop,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.990
where does it, how does it work? You're not suppose to be able

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.430
to figure it out, that's the whole point, that's why it's called a puzzle-pot.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.360
&gt;&gt; So, this was designed by a trickster. A

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630
good designer, and this is the challenge for design.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.790
Will design things such that somebody can have

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.370
an effective conceptual model and understand how it works.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.630
&gt;&gt; Or, go out of the way so you don't have a model.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.249
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.390
&gt;&gt; If, in fact, that's the goal.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.420
&gt;&gt; You know, to fool you.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.940
&gt;&gt; And the only way a designer can communicate is through the objects

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.290
that they design. And there is the challenge, and what this lesson is about.
