00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.143
I'm here to tell you

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:19.018
how change is happening
at a local level in Pakistan,

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:22.792
because women are finding their place
in the political process.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.393
I want to take you all on a journey
to the place I was raised,

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:32.726
northwest Pakistan, called Dir.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.434
Dir was founded in the 17th century.

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:41.726
It was a princely state
until its merger with Pakistan in 1969.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.351
Our prince, Nawab Shah Jahan,
reserved the right to wear white,

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:50.083
the color of honor, but only for himself.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.125
He didn't believe in educating his people.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.643
And at the time of my birth in 1979,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.684
only five percent of boys
and one percent of girls

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.625
received any schooling at all.

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:08.417
I was one among that one percent.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:16.250
Growing up, I was very close to my father.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:21.333
He is a pharmacy doctor,
and he sent me to school.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.042
Every day, I would go to his clinic
when my lessons finished.

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:30.792
He's a wonderful man
and a well-respected community leader.

00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:36.018
He was leading a welfare organization,

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:39.351
and I would go with him
to the social and political gatherings

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:43.625
to listen and talk to the local men
about our social and economic problems.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.559
However, when I was 16,

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:52.708
my father asked me to stop coming with him
to the public gatherings.

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:57.417
Now, I was a young woman,
and my place was in the home.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:00.125
I was very upset.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.333
But most of my family members,
they were happy with this decision.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.809
It was very difficult for me

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.583
to sit back in the home
and not be involved.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.226
It took two years

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.976
that finally my family agreed
that my father could reconnect me

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.934
with women and girls,

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.333
so they could share their problems
and together we could resolve them.

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.601
So, with his blessings,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:33.226
I started to reconnect
with women and girls

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.667
so we could resolve
their problems together.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.601
When women show up,

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:44.083
they bring their realities
and views with them.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.059
And yet, I have found all too often,

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.893
women underestimate their own strength,

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:54.500
their potential and their self-respect.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.375
However, while connecting
with these women and girls,

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.809
it became very clear to me

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:07.809
that if there was to be any hope
to create a better life

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.559
for these women and girls
and their families,

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:13.143
we must stand up for our own rights --

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.667
and not wait for someone else
to come and help us.

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:22.018
So I took a huge leap of faith

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:26.101
and founded my own organization in '94

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:30.833
to create our very own platform
for women empowerment.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:34.708
I engaged many women and girls
to work with me.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:36.875
It was hard.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:41.726
Many of the women working with me
had to leave once they got married,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.167
because their husbands
wouldn't let them work.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:49.518
One colleague of mine
was given away by her family

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:53.125
to make amends for a crime
her brother had committed.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.226
I couldn't help her.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.333
And I felt so helpless at that time.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:06.833
But it made me more determined
to continue my struggle.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.559
I saw many practices like these,

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:15.792
where these women suffered silently,
bearing this brutality.

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:18.809
But when I see a woman

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:23.393
struggling to change her situation
instead of giving up,

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:24.667
it motivates me.

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:30.226
So I ran for a public office

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.309
as an independent candidate in Lower Dir

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.583
in the local elections in 2001.

00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:42.833
Despite all the challenges and hurdles
I faced throughout this process, I won.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:49.434
(Applause)

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:52.750
And I served in the public
office for six years.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.351
But unfortunately,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.601
we women, elected women,

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:02.542
we were not allowed to sit in the council
together with all the members

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.583
and to take part in the proceedings.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.393
We had to sit in a separate,
ladies-only room,

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.750
not even aware what
was happening in the council.

00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.143
Men told me

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:23.893
that, "You women, elected women members,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.208
should buy sewing machines for women."

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:31.458
When I knew what they needed the most
was access to clean drinking water.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:36.018
So I did everything I could do

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:39.833
to prioritize the real challenges
these women faced.

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:47.167
I set up five hand pumps
in the two dried up wells in my locality.

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:50.292
Well, we got them working again.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.708
Before long, we made water accessible
for over 5,000 families.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.601
We proved that anything the men could do,

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:03.875
so could we women.

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.351
I built alliances
with other elected women members,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.851
and last year,

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:15.601
we women were allowed to sit together
with all the members in the council.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:22.542
(Applause)

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:30.309
And to take part in the legislation
and planning and budgeting,

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:31.708
in all the decisions.

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.375
I saw there is strength in numbers.

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:38.018
You know yourselves.

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:41.625
Lack of representation
means no one is fighting for you.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.601
Pakistan is --

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:50.500
We're 8,000 miles away
from where I'm here with you today.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:56.292
But I hope what I'm about to tell you
will resonate with you,

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:02.375
though we have this big distance
in miles and in our cultures.

00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:05.893
When women show up,

00:07:05.917 --> 00:07:09.875
they bring the realities and hopes
of half a population with them.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:18.309
In 2007, we saw the rise of the Taliban

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:22.250
in Swat, Dir and nearby districts.

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:24.917
It was horrifying.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:30.476
The Taliban killed innocent people.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.101
Almost every day,

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:35.542
people collected the dead bodies
of their loved ones from the streets.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.018
Most of the social and political leaders

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.268
struggling and working
for the betterment of their communities

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:44.000
were threatened and targeted.

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.393
Even I had to leave,

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.708
leaving my children
behind with my in-laws.

00:07:54.917 --> 00:08:00.018
I closed my office in Dir
and relocated to Peshawar,

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:01.542
the capital of my province.

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:06.875
I was in trauma,
kept thinking what to do next.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.518
And most of the family members and friends

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:17.184
were suggesting, "Shad, stop working.

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:19.083
The threat is very serious."

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.750
But I persisted.

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:31.684
In 2009, we experienced a historic influx
of internally displaced persons,

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:34.292
from Swat, Dir and other nearby districts.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.333
I started visiting the camps
almost every day,

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.851
until the internally displaced persons

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.957
started to go back
to their place of origin.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.375
I established four mother-child
health care units,

00:08:50.582 --> 00:08:54.558
especially to take care of
over 10,000 women and children

00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:56.042
nearby the camps.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.226
But you know, during
all these visits,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.333
I observed that there was very little
attention towards women's needs.

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:11.268
And I was looking for
what is the reason behind it.

00:09:11.292 --> 00:09:16.601
And I found it was because
of the underrepresentation of women

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:20.708
in both social and political platforms,
in our society as a whole.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.018
And that was the time when I realized

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:27.768
that I need to narrow down my focus

00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:31.000
on building and strengthening
women's political leadership

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:34.726
to increase their
political representation,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.167
so they would have their own
voice in their future.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.809
So we started training around 300
potential women and youth

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:46.583
for the upcoming local elections in 2015.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.351
And you know what?

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.125
Fifty percent of them won.

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:58.934
(Applause)

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.018
And they are now sitting in the councils,

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:06.042
taking part actively in the legislation,
planning and budgeting.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:12.851
Most of them are now investing their funds

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:17.708
on women's health, education,
skill development and safe drinking water.

00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:20.851
All these elected women now

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:23.625
share, discuss and resolve
their problems together.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.500
Let me tell you about two
of the women I have been working with:

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.226
Saira Shams.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.601
You can see, this young lady, age 26,

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:40.708
she ran for a public office in 2015
in Lower Dir, and she won.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.726
She completed two of the community
infrastructure schemes.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.208
You know, women, community
infrastructure schemes ...

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.208
Some people think this is men's job.

00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:58.625
But no, this is women's job,
too, we can do it.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:05.726
And she also fixed two of the roads
leading towards girls schools,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.893
knowing that without access
to these schools,

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.750
they are useless to the girls of Dir.

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:14.851
And another young woman is Asma Gul.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:19.351
She is a very active member
of the young leaders forum we established.

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:22.083
She was unable to run
for the public office,

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:27.917
so she has become the first
female journalist of our region.

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:34.292
She speaks and writes for women's
and girls' issues and their rights.

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:39.101
Saira and Asma,
they are the living examples

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.708
of the importance of inclusion
and representation.

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.018
Let me tell you this, too.

00:11:47.042 --> 00:11:49.851
In the 2013 general elections in Pakistan

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.500
and the local elections in 2015,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.250
there were less than 100
women voters in Dir.

00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:00.101
But you know what?

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:04.768
I'm proud to tell you that this year,
during the general elections,

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:08.101
there were 93,000 women voters in Dir.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:14.167
(Applause)

00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:18.875
So our struggle is far from over.

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.143
But this shift is historic.

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:28.226
And a sign that women are standing up,
showing up and making it absolutely clear

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.125
that we all must invest
in building women's leadership.

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:41.018
In Pakistan and here in the United States,

00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:43.476
and everywhere in the world,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.893
this means women in politics,
women in business

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:51.958
and women in positions of power
making important decisions.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:58.042
It took me 23 years to get here.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.851
But I don't want any girl or any woman

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.583
to take 23 years of her life
to make herself heard.

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:10.917
I have had some dark days.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.976
But I have spent
every waking moment of my life

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.917
working for the right of every woman
to live her full potential.

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:25.309
Imagine with me a world

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.875
where thousands of us stand up

00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:33.434
and they support
other young women together,

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.792
creating opportunities and choices
that benefit all.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.875
And that, my friends,
can change the world.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.268
Thank you.

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:51.125
(Applause)
