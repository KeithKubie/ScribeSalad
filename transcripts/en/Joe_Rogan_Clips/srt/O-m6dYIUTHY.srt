1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,690
The Joe Rogan experience. See
that is just not wise, right?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,950
That's just too much. It's too
much to do. When people do that,

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,140
when they just take on too
many different, like I've, uh,

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,750
I've thought about other
stuff like doing other stuff.

5
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,820
I've had offers to do other stuff
and I start thinking about it.

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:19,600
Maybe I could find time for that. And
then I, then I give myself coaching.

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,700
Like I'm like, what would
you tell yourself? I'm like,

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,550
what the fuck is wrong with you?
You're not doing anything else.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,930
I can go barely do all this stuff
you're doing now. I think for me too,

10
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:31,600
as I get older, especially
like right now in my life,

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,180
my leisure time is very important to me.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,310
Like it means something
and I don't mean leisure,

13
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:39,970
like sit around doing nothing but
like hobbies, like stuff that I do.

14
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:43,360
Like lately I've been shooting
guns. You have a jealous man, dude,

15
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:46,210
you should come with us thinking about
buying a gun. You should get a gun.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,880
Do you want to come with us tomorrow?
Um, wait a minute. What's today?

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,560
Wednesday I might go in tomorrow.
We'll talk afterwards. Okay. But, um,

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,940
I'm going soon. But you should
come. It's fun. It's fun.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,170
You learn how to shoot your gun and
tactical stuff. That looks fun. It is fun.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,500
You know, it's like video
game, but some people get mad.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,640
A lot of mad comments lie. Just get
mad. They don't want you shooting guns.

22
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,160
Stop it. Stop it. Think of
the children stop at blanks.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,480
Well, you're not shooting blanks,
shooting real bullets, but it's um,

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,250
there's also a game that you can get,

25
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:24,640
we're going to get for this a
studio that's a, it's a real pistol.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,430
Like it looks like a real
pistol and has a six pound pole.

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,490
So it feels like a real pistol
when you pull the trigger. And uh,

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,120
it's like that techno hunt thing where
you've got a laser beam that shoots out

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,220
and uh, it even makes a noise like had
gone like pow and you shooting zombies.

30
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,870
Yeah. And it's heavy like a pistol. So
you have to hold it like a PESTEL dope.

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,580
Yeah. Dude, that's bad. That's
next score and whatnot. Oh yeah.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,930
It tells you how many civilians you
shoot, how many zombies you got.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Cause sometimes people come running around
the corner and it says it's a zombie

34
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,310
and then there's a civilian behind them.

35
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,740
You got to make sure not to start you
guys rolling around and shit out there or

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,750
you're just standing still and that
we're not in a movie, bro. What's funny,

37
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:04,090
you guys are having no obstacles.

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,720
I don't think it's a good idea to have
dummies like me roll around with a gun in

39
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:11,800
my hand. Somebody told me to buy a
Glock 19 that was the gun, that box.

40
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,250
Great gun. All right, cool. Yeah,
you should. Before you do anything,

41
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,380
you should learn how to
shoot. I've I've shot before.

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,630
I've gone a few times with you. Yeah,
yeah. For rifles, right? Yeah. Oh yeah.

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,210
I've shot in Burbank at the shooting
place where they have a place near ya. Oh,

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,200
that's right down the street. Yeah.
Yeah. It's fun, man. It's fun.

45
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:34,030
We should have a JRE, a shooting
range somewhere. Hell yeah. Have a,

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,650
just to that thing that we shot all the
hard drives. Yes. That was fun, man.

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,510
That was fun, wasn't it? That was rifle
shooting is fun, but pistol shooting,

48
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,450
um, when you're holding in your
hand it's way more difficult.

49
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,550
It seems to it more different.
You think it's more difficult?

50
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:52,480
More difficult to aim? Yeah, because
he gave me a rifle and uh, you know,

51
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:55,750
I shoot rifle so much or I have
shot him so much. It's easy.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,420
You just have trigger discipline. You
just don't yank the trigger. Just pull,

53
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:02,800
pull, pull, pull paying and let it go
off like a surprise shot. And I was,

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,070
I hit everything I aimed at and he was
like, okay, you've shot that before.

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,510
But like pistols, I've only shot
pistols at a range with no instruction.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,730
I don't really, I didn't
know what I'm doing at all.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,210
And once you learn like how to grip
it, how to hold it, how to aim,

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,940
like you don't really hold
that hard with your right hand.

59
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,810
Most of the pressures with your
left. So, and the, the grip is very,

60
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,090
it's not intuitive. You have to learn it.

61
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,360
It's something that you
have to be taught correctly.

62
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,910
And there's so many people
there that are like, they,

63
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,480
they shoot in competitions and so when
you watch them do it, you're like,

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,720
Oh wow, Jesus Christ. Like
there's levels to this.

65
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,710
I just guys that can pull their gun out
and shoot four shots inside of a second

66
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,170
in a second, pull, draw, pull,
shoot four shots inside of a second.

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,090
That's crazy. Yeah, that's ridiculous.

68
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,480
But they're just begging for someone
to break in their house. You know,

69
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,390
there's people like that out there.
There's people like that where you,

70
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,980
you know, you break into the house,
you fucked with the wrong person. Well,

71
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,170
tent city's growing, so I
think I need to get one.

72
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,310
LA is going to be a giant
homeless encampment.

73
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,790
It's like if you looked at the
spread, right? If it was a disease,

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,300
a deadly disease that was
killing everybody and you
saw like patient zero and

75
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,600
then it spread like two people,
four people, six people, 10 people.

76
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,990
Now LA has more than 60,000 homeless
people and every single underpass that you

77
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,170
go to, you see camps. Now.
It's not like it used to be.

78
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,710
It's a totally different animal now. It's
like the walking dead man where it's,

79
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,270
it seems like it's growing.

80
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,500
Like Laurel cannon when you're going
to Laurel cannon off the one-on-one.

81
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,400
It used to be pretty normal last night
or two nights ago when I went through it,

82
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,530
it was like there was no sidewalk anymore.

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,250
It was like if somebody wanted had
to walk on that sidewalk. Yeah,

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,590
good luck with that. You're going
through your walk village, you know? Yup.

85
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,440
And needles and all kinds
of fucked up and human shit.

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,930
I mean human shits all over downtown LA.

87
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,840
I seen a lot of people shit and that's
nothing compared to San Francisco.

88
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,610
That guy's Zubie who's on our podcast.

89
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,240
He did a bunch of posts about his
trip to San Francisco is like,

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,660
it is so much worse. He was saying it
was so much worse than he thought it was.

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,420
It's so, it's so beyond comprehension.

92
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:10,780
How many people were just openly shooting
up drugs, shitting in the streets,

93
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,110
homeless people everywhere.
How do you fix that?

94
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,230
And like if you would think that if
there's something that LA needed to fix,

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,920
how to all the things that Ellie
complains about the homeless problem,

96
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,160
it's like one of the most
insurmountable problems.

97
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,850
Like what do you do to curb that?
How do you get these people homes?

98
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,070
How do you clean these people up?
How do you get them off drugs?

99
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,130
How do you get them off the streets? How
do you make it not a public nuisance?

100
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,830
How do you make it so people
aren't scared to go down streets?

101
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,430
Cause there's certain streets in
downtown LA where you see the street,

102
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,930
like you're at the beginning of the mouth,

103
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,100
the street and you look
in those three lights.

104
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm not walking down there
like this is terrible.

105
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,280
They need to open up the mental hospitals
again whenever they closed them down.

106
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,010
Wait in the seventies or the
80s that's what caused all this.

107
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,820
They don't have those anymore.
It definitely was a problem.

108
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,230
But it seems like it's
gotten way worse. Right?

109
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,770
Like think about what it
used to be 10 years ago.

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
Now think about what it is
now. I mean this 10 years ago,

111
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,410
it was still decades after they
closed down the mental institutions,

112
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,730
they changed the standards.

113
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,300
So what it was was they had certain
standards where you would be

114
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,060
institutionalized and they changed
those standards under the Reagan

115
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,970
administration and just sent these
people out into the streets and everybody

116
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:20,390
thought it was like really cruel because
here you just releasing these people

117
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,630
with all these like severe mental health
problems and just releasing them out

118
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,100
into the street. But
that was a long time ago.

119
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,850
Something has happened recently
I guess is the economy.

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,410
I mean I don't know what it is,

121
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:38,030
but another thing you think seeing
around this area is mobile homes.

122
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,500
Like those, the dry, those campers
like Winnebagos fucking everywhere.

123
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,700
People just get enough money to
get one of them. Mobile homes,

124
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,110
they just park it on the street
and they live in those things,

125
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,920
which is just like a
mobile camp, you know?

126
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:56,030
And you get these gypsies that hang out
and they cook on the sidewalk and shit.

127
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,400
Like we used to have them here.
They would, they would like,

128
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,360
they were hanging out in sunbathing on
the lawn out here and the owner of the

129
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,270
building's like, get the fuck outta
here. Like, what are you guys doing?

130
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,670
This isn't the park, like go to the park

131
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,550
in what's worse? Sovereign
citizens, what does that,

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,530
there's people that don't drive,

133
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,890
they travel and they don't
follow the rules and they like,

134
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,780
if you watch it live PD, they have
one every episode to every episode.

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,620
They'll get pulled over and it's like
they won't even roll down the window and

136
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:26,890
they're like, I don't have
to follow your rules, sir. I,

137
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,040
they never have driver's
license or insurance. They,

138
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,170
it's like people that don't
think taxes apply to them,

139
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,710
but they don't think
the law applies to that.

140
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,780
But that's grown so big recently that
it's so many people now that do this shit

141
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,340
and it's the most grossest like,
uh, if you watch on an IPD, you'll,

142
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,520
you'll witness live P D by PDs
cops nowadays it's, but it's,

143
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,870
I think it's way better cause it's live,

144
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:54,830
it's like four hours long and the
host alive live in the moment,

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,560
like in seven different cities. They
have a whole control center. Like,

146
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,510
all right, we've got a speeding
going on here. We've got an,

147
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,790
Oh there's a chase going on here.
Let's go live over here. Yeah.

148
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,790
It's my favorite. And they have
it. They also have in Columbus,

149
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,070
Ohio where they used to and
they just got rid of it. Yeah.

150
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,900
I didn't even know this was a thing.
And so the sovereign citizens,

151
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,730
like what are they saying? They
get pulled over and they say,

152
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:13,550
I don't have to listen.

153
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,090
Yeah. They pretty much say like, your
rules don't apply. And they'll be like,

154
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,880
uh, get, you know, give me
your driver's side. I need you,

155
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,340
I'm ready to quick take you to the
jail for just a seatbelt, you know,

156
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,470
violation. Give me your
license. They won't like,

157
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,450
I don't need to give you
a license, sir, please.

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,610
They have this shit to keep on repeating.

159
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,630
And they all go to these websites and
they're like reading on their phone, sir,

160
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:35,540
I don't have to, you know,
do this and that and this.

161
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,020
And then they finally have to like break
their window and just drag them out and

162
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:42,110
arrest them. Just wear a seatbelt.
Finally, people are smart and you know,

163
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,810
they're talking about though. But other
people, I've just watched another video,

164
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,570
I'm like, Oh, I don't have to listen
to this guy. I'm a YouTube bourbon.

165
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,710
There's something unique, uniquely

166
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,980
satisfying about watching that.

167
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:53,570
I get pulled over by the cops and he
knows exactly what his rights are and the

168
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:58,571
cops are fucking up and he calls the cops
on different co codes and laws and the

169
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,460
constitution and then he winds up
driving off. I've seen that before. Yeah,

170
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,180
pull over the da on accident.
They're like, Oh geez. Oops. Yeah.

171
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,800
Or that woman who was a New York, uh,

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,000
she was like some kind of high up person
that got pulled over and she starts

173
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,140
yelling at the cops and shit. Like she
lost her job the next day. I saw that.

174
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,990
Yeah. Yeah. That was ridiculous. She
was trying to throw her weight around.

175
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,040
She didn't realize she was on camera
being a corruption man. That's corruption.

176
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,190
You're a citizen bitch. You know.
Everybody needs to realize I,

177
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:32,310
there was one where a judge got pulled
over and they let him slide but he got in

178
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:35,310
trouble afterwards as well
cause it's on camera, you know,

179
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,580
and then someone finds that video and
it's like, Hey man, you are a citizen.

180
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,420
You're like us.

181
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,970
Like if you're speeding or something
like that and they pull you over,

182
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:45,360
you can't get out and act
like you own these cops. It's,

183
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,370
I mean, you got to give your fucking
[inaudible] driver's license though.

184
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,830
You gotta you gotta show
them your identification.

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,980
If you're doing something that's
an infraction or violation.

186
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,540
That's the whole reason why we have cops.

187
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,160
Do you want everybody to just driving 150
miles an hour, no ID and masks on? No.

188
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,530
So you have to have rules.
So these are the rules.

189
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
If you do something that breaks the law,

190
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,900
they gotta be able to pull you over
and give you a fucking ticket and

191
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,730
incentivize you to drive correctly and
also find out if maybe you're running

192
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:18,210
from the cops and also they pull you
over, they get your ID, they go, Hey man,

193
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,310
you got a murder warrant
out for you. So, uh,

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,650
please step out of the car
with your hands up. I mean,

195
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,840
this is the whole reason when
we have cops in the first place,

196
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,930
then these people that think they don't
have to pay taxes and then the laws

197
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:31,890
don't apply to them. It's
all on unconstitutional.
Good luck with that case.

198
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,490
Good luck with the ass Wesley Snipes.
How that worked out. Yeah, it shit,

199
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,940
they put Wesley in fucking jail
for a long time. Lauren Hill too.

200
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,800
From the goddamn Fujis. They put her
in a cage for like a year. Right?

201
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,250
How long did she go to jail for
it? It was a taxes thing to men.

202
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,050
They get these wacky,

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
whether it's an attorney or
a tax professional or some
wacky advisor tells them

204
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,410
they don't have to pay taxes and
they read some internet thing.

205
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:00,660
It says actually it's unconstitutional.

206
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,200
It's only supposed to apply
during war time. I'm like, listen,

207
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,250
pay your fucking taxes. Okay.
You can protest all you want.

208
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,420
You think it's unjust, that's good.
They will put you in a fucking jail.

209
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,610
And if you're a famous person's
trying to pull that off,

210
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,870
especially a famous rich person, look,
it's not good, but it is what it is.

211
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,190
They're going to make an example of you.
Yeah. How long did she go to jail for?

212
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,450
Three months. That's it. Showing
what? The jail for three months.

213
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,340
Hmm. So she was released from a
federal prison, women's low security,

214
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,220
all facility. All females facility.

215
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,610
Just the fact that they put
her in a fucking cage is crazy.

216
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,540
Like she a danger to the public. Like
what is going on here? She owes you money.

217
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,560
How come that's the one money that
you can't just pay back. You know,

218
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,840
you can't just pay it back. How
come I can't just pay it back? Nope.

219
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,660
Not good enough. That you still
have to pay back and go. Yeah.

220
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,850
And yet they take away your ability
to earn a living for a long time.

221
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,430
Like Wesley Snipes. How
long was he in jail for?

222
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,780
He was in jail for like a solid
year. A whole year behind bars.

223
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:06,220
Put a halt to his career and all because
he owed some taxes cause he had some

224
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,000
wacky dude that was telling him he
didn't have to pay taxes. How long?

225
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,730
He had a three year sentence. Three years.

226
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,220
Imagine that man cause of money.
They lock you in a goddamn cage.

227
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,550
It's not like he stole money.
It's not like he held up a bank.

228
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,180
It's not like he was a violent person
that was a danger to society. No,

229
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,830
we owed some taxes. He made money and
they had, they're taking his money.

230
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,040
He made money, but he didn't give
his share up to the government.

231
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,980
So the government decided to lock him
in a cage to punish him and to make a a

232
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,570
statement to everybody else.
It's also like you pay taxes,

233
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,900
you get taxed on your paycheck
and then you'd get sales tax.

234
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,950
They're getting tax. How many times,
you know, getting taxed a lot. 10 times.

235
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,210
Well then that's why places like Nevada
people like because in Nevada you don't

236
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:55,750
have to pay state taxes, so you make a,
you can save a lot of money. Florida,

237
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,584
same thing.

238
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,320
Like I know a dude who moved to Florida
because he was going to sell his

239
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,880
business. So he's like, look,

240
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm going to move to Florida and establish
residence in Florida for a few years

241
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,840
and then sell my business so I'm a
Florida resident and then I'll have to pay

242
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,840
nearly as much money can say,
if you want a big business,

243
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,310
it can save you a ton of money.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,150
It's just weird that it's different
everywhere you go. You know,

245
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,650
like some places just don't have state
tax. You don't have to pay. Yeah.

246
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,850
Montana has different taxes. Colorado
is different. Taxes, they all have,

247
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,620
everybody's going to
like a different setup,

248
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,190
different amount that you have to
pay for this and that and over.

249
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,910
There's a weird thing that like a lot
of the big corporations have their

250
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,830
headquarters in Delaware for some reason.

251
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:40,120
It's like to somewhere tax law for
that. Yeah. A nice little tax Haven.

252
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,750
Well, isn't that why the
juice moved to Florida?

253
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,960
Didn't OJ moved to Florida because they
couldn't take his pension that way,

254
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,920
or he owes money based off the
lawsuit for the civil suit. Yeah,

255
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,490
but he has a pension right
from the NFL. Yeah. So right.

256
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,870
They can't fuck with that pension.

257
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,590
[inaudible].
