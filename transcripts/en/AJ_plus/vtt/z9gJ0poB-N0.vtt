00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.460
Canada is divided over a pipeline. Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau's government has

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
purchased a pipeline project from Texas-based energy giant Kinder Morgan. The

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.070
Trans Mountain pipeline, which will pump
oil from the Alberta tar sands to the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.580
Pacific Coast, is costing Canadian
taxpayers $7.4 billion.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.740
And opposition has been massive.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.420
These protesters have taken over one of the busiest intersections in Vancouver

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.780
to call for a stop to this pipeline.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.610
Activists have taken dramatic steps to
resist this pipeline. Now, a Canadian

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.450
court has halted construction because
the government didn't properly consult

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.900
Indigenous groups. But for many other
Canadians, the pipeline means one thing: jobs.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.140
Does it make you sad you have to
collaborate with a big oil company?

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.960
Not at all.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.500
How far are you willing to go to
stop this pipeline?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.260
It's in my blood not to stop.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.360
Trudeau has repeatedly
positioned himself as a climate leader

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.840
and a friend to Indigenous people.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.840
Protecting our environment and growing our economy are not opposing values.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.520
No means no, Justin!

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.980
Why are you guys still here?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.620
Because this is unceded land.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.740
So we're at a berry farm in a town called
Delta in British Columbia, and we got

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.740
tipped off that Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau is here for an event.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.780
It's the leader of the Liberal Party himself.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.520
Hello everyone! How are you doing?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.000
No means no, Justin! This is unceded

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.980
traditional territory! You're not welcome here!

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.120
So thank you very much! I’m counting on all of you for your help! Thank you everyone!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.060
We're trying to get closer to ask the Prime Minister a question but there's a huge crowd.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.840
This is an impossible situation. Prime
Minister Trudeau!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.500
British Columbia has become the epicenter of the anti-pipeline movement. Protesters have set up

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.380
resistance camps near Kinder Morgan construction sites. It's not the first time we've seen this kind of tactic.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.960
The police are right behind us! We want to make sure we get out of here.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.760
In 2016, water protectors at Standing Rock

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.430
successfully delayed construction of the
Dakota Access pipeline for months. It

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.150
looked like the #NoDAPL movement
would succeed. But President Trump

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.319
cleared the way for the pipeline after
taking office. Now, the focus has shifted

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.019
north. In 2013, Kinder Morgan announced
plans to build a twin pipeline next to

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.760
an existing one, in order to triple the
flow of oil through Canada. The backlash

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.810
was immediate. After several lawsuits,
Kinder Morgan threatened to walk away –

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.180
unless Trudeau guaranteed a path to
construction. In a widely criticized deal,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.840
Trudeau's government purchased the
pipeline for $3.5 billion,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.610
promising it would boost the economy and
allow Canada's landlocked oil to be sold

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.920
to foreign markets. For many, it was a
slap in the face.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.880
Climate leaders don’t buy or expand pipelines.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.690
If it’s completed, Canada will increase emissions,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.980
a major step backwards for the Paris
climate agreement. But tar sands

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.640
extraction actually produces more
greenhouse gas emissions than

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.400
conventional drilling does.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.300
So we're headed to see the main
construction site of the Kinder Morgan

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.790
pipeline here in British Columbia. And
because there's so much security

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.780
surrounding it, really the only way to
get to it is by water. William George of

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.040
the Tsleil-Waututh Nation is the leader
of the Coast Salish resistance here in British Columbia.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.060
How do you feel when
you look over there and you see how much

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.540
security there is and how much
construction there looks to be?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.400
There's a lot of emotions tied into it. You see the big crane there? From what I understand,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.359
they're pile-driving in big steel
structures, getting ready for these super-

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.049
tankers. So there'll be essentially, I
think, four docks, docking base for these

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.140
super-tankers to come in and then take
over, I guess, 890,000

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.019
barrels of bitumen. And the
thing with bitumen that not a lot of

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.829
people are aware of is that it doesn't float.
It sinks to the bottom, you can't recover

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.259
it at all. Again, just another
reason why this is unacceptable and we

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.520
won't allow it to travel through our bodies of water.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.960
Have you ever gotten in trouble for getting this close?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.900
No. I'm not allowed within 100 meters in any compound, though.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.420
Why?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.040
There's a bridge right there,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.160
so me and a team, we hung off there for 38 hours. We stopped an oil tanker from leaving here for two days.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.580
This coastline could see 21,000 oil tankers over the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.760
next 50 years. More tankers means more noise,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.440
which scientists say poses grave risks for endangered mammals.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.740
How has Kinder Morgan's presence affected the ecosystem here?

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.060
Well, right now we have a mother orca that's

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.040
swimming around for over a week, and
she's pushing around her dead calf, and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.200
it's really uncommon for them to do
that. So in a way that they, are telling

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300
us something. These are super-tankers that are the size

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.180
of the Empire State Building. Just that
noise pollution in the water alone will

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.800
ultimately put to extinction those orca whales.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.340
Days before the government announced it was buying the pipeline, the federal Fisheries and Oceans

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.900
Department sent a letter warning Kinder Morgan it
could face prosecution for putting

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.460
marine life in danger near an oil
terminal in Vancouver. The company had

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.840
gone months without filing mandatory monitoring reports.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.880
Your prime minister, Trudeau, came to office and positioned himself as an ally to Indigenous folks,

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.099
and as a friend of the environment. And
yet he's gone ahead and purchased this

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.760
pipeline. What do you think about that?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.500
Well, unfortunately I voted for the bugger, but him lying to us is upsetting in so many ways, when he promised to

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.520
protect our Indigenous rights, promised to be a
climate leader, and he's doing nothing

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.840
about it – absolutely just the opposite, really.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.020
Would you vote for him again?

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.680
No.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.440
Just looking around and being on this water, it's stunning. It's one of the prettiest things I've ever seen.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.140
Yeah, and I'm gonna make sure it stays that way, absolutely.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.080
Just outside Vancouver in Burnaby,
protesters have set up two different

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.640
resistance camps, Watch House and Camp Cloud. Watch House is operated by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.420
We're taking it back to our old culture, our old teachings. We'd

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.770
have watch house locations and strategic
... you know, to watch out for the enemy,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.860
centuries ago. Ultimately we do
see Kinder Morgan as the enemy.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.620
In 2007, Canada endorsed the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.590
specifies that states and organizations
must adhere to what's referred to as

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.450
“Free, Prior and Informed Consent.” While
Kinder Morgan says it communicated with

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.310
more than 133 Indigenous groups along
the pipeline route, several First Nations

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.100
communities say they weren't properly consulted.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.940
It's devastating in every single way. This pipeline has got to go.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.240
Reginald Gillins Jr. is an activist from Seattle who lives at Watch House.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.120
How big is this anti-pipeline movement?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.510
Oh, it's massive. It's massive. You see this
happening all over the globe.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.920
Disenfranchised communities are the
first to be affected by the effects of

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.080
climate change and extraction efforts on
Mother Earth.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.920
Camp cloud is stationed right across the street from Kinder Morgan. Days before our arrival, the camp

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.050
was served with an eviction notice. Black
Wolf is from the Kwakiutl nation. He's

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.090
been staying here for the past six months.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.180
You guys got served with an eviction
notice not long ago.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.920
Yes, we did.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.260
So if the city served you with an eviction notice, why are you guys still here?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.680
Because this is unceded land. We're federal
Indians. It means we don't have to listen to

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.420
the provincial levels of law. We're higher
up than they are. We've had this law put

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.760
in since the early 1800s. This is
our rights as natives to be here.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.900
We're not even protesters – we're water protectors, land defenders. That's what we like to be called.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.300
Why is this fight personal?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:14.720
It's our food chain. We rely on all the salmon that are coming and going from here.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.760
It’s going through all the natural watersheds that we have here.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.820
What do you think of Justin Trudeau's attempts at reconciliation between Canada and First Nations?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:30.340
I think it was just ludicrous. There is no reconciliation going on. There's so much

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.419
devastation to all First Nations all around BC, it's not even funny. Let alone

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.430
before this even happened, 50% of our Native reserves still do not have

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.480
drinking water. This is just not right.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.840
Camp Cloud's occupants run what they call surveillance operations to monitor Kinder Morgan's activities

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.380
and educate the public about the pipeline. This summer, the Federal Court of Appeals

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.530
delivered a major blow to the project,
unanimously ruling the Trudeau

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.700
administration violated Canadian law
when it failed to properly consult

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.600
Indigenous groups along the pipeline
route, and that it did not consider all

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.760
the evidence regarding harm to the environment.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.900
Our government inherited a flawed environmental review process, and we’ve made efforts to improve it.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.200
Now, the government must restart talks with First Nations before construction can proceed.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.900
This is Canada’s most active port. Hundreds of ships pass through here

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.250
every day. Years ago, you'd see even
larger ships in the water – that is, until

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.740
the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In 1989, an
Exxon Valdez oil tanker bound for

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.440
southern California struck a reef in
Alaska, releasing 44,000 tons of oil. It's

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.400
considered one of the worst human-caused
environmental disasters in modern

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.880
history. As a precaution, Canada placed
more regulations on the oil industry. In

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.300
2016, the City of Vancouver submitted a
report to the National Energy Board,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.589
claiming the risk of a spill along the
Trans Mountain pipeline route is between

00:09:57.589 --> 00:10:02.930
16% and 67%. They argued this could cost
the economy hundreds of millions of

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.900
dollars and result in the deaths of
100,000 sea and shorebirds. Carl and Ann

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.010
have lived in Burnaby for years. They're
opposed to the expansion because they

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.820
say it'll bring devastating effects to their community.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.379
I was driving home one night
and I started coughing really violently.

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:26.059
My car hit the curb, I thought I was
going to go off the road. I was madly

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:29.359
looking around to see if there was a
place to pull over – there wasn't, so I

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:33.439
remained going up the mountain. And I saw the
tank farm and I thought, well, it must be

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.720
fumes from the tank farm. Then this
happened three more times.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.980
When this was built, nobody lived down this mountain.
Now, there's residential areas all around

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.260
here, down here, and over here.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.960
Would you say most residents of this city oppose Kinder Morgan's expansion?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.100
75%.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.660
Chief Ernie Crey of Cheam First Nation is in

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.560
favor of the pipeline and says his community will directly benefit from its construction.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.560
Are the members of your nation in support as well, or is there opposition?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.860
There is opposition in my community. Surprise. There are some people that are opposed to it.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.960
For us, it means jobs, money, opportunities and a better

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.100
lifestyle, from this time forward, well, well, well into the future.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.239
We didn't really get much advantage from the
earlier pipeline, but we will from the

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:32.059
new pipeline, because we support it, and
we also have an agreement with the

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:38.749
company, Kinder Morgan, that offers us a
cash component. And I can't disclose how

00:11:38.749 --> 00:11:41.360
much money is involved. That's part of the agreement.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.540
We've been hearing a lot of different numbers about the jobs that will benefit your community.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.360
Do you have an exact number?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:53.040
Well, I think overall there will be thousands of jobs along the full extent of the pipeline.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.000
So there's nothing exact and guaranteed?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.900
No, I don't think so. The real jobs will come when we take

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.739
what we earn from the pipeline, drive it
back into our own band-owned businesses,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:10.980
and businesses owned by our community
members, and a lot of jobs will accrue.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.040
Does it make you sad that in order to
lift your community out of poverty, and

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.320
give them jobs and better benefits, you
to collaborate with a big oil company?

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.080
Not at all. Canadians have benefited from the

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.330
natural resources, including gas and oil,
all these many decades, and found a very

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.120
good lifestyle for themselves,
split-level homes, two-car garages,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.800
sending their children off to university,
enjoying the good life. For now, the short-

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.810
term goal for me is to improve the
economic and social standing of my

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.910
community, and make them players in the
economy, not people shunted over to the

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.690
periphery, out of the mainstream, out of
sight, out of mind.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:58.960
We're not going back there, folks, is what I tell white people, and others. We're not going back there.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.080
But we're not just talking about white people. There are several Indigenous communities

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.360
who are vehemently opposed to this pipeline being built. What do you say to that?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.900
I say that I understand their opposition. To me, it's worth the risk.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.260
Do you feel that Kinder Morgan bought off your community?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.140
No. Cheam is not the pushover community.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:28.540
We're the tough men and women, and we've showed it repeatedly, down through the decades.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.420
Back in Vancouver, resistance is building.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.720
These protesters have taken over one of the busiest

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.220
intersections in Vancouver to call for a stop to this pipeline.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.440
The day of the protest, Kinder Morgan announced that the pipeline will

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.440
cost billions more than initially estimated.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.320
We're out here because we want to send a really loud, really clear

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:51.859
message to the Canadian government that
we're not going to allow the pipeline to

00:13:51.859 --> 00:13:55.399
be built. And the people are still
committed to stopping it, no matter how

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.180
many billions of dollars they try and spend on it.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.480
Thomas Davies is a member of Climate Convergence, a grassroots organization

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.120
dedicated to fighting for climate justice.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.580
What's the significance of being around all these banks?

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.360
Well we just want to interact with as much of the public

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.420
as possible. The banks are big funders of
the tar sands in Alberta. And

00:14:13.429 --> 00:14:17.179
specifically, the Kinder Morgan pipeline –
before it was bought by the government –

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.240
was financed primarily by big Canadian
banks for hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.160
Days after we filmed at Camp Cloud, Supreme Court Justice Geoffrey Gomery

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.910
granted the city of Burnaby an
injunction, ordering all camp structures

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.620
to be removed from outside the Kinder
Morgan tank farm within 48 hours. The

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.320
morning of August 16th, Camp Cloud was evicted.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.960
The Kinder Morgan protest camp on Burnaby Mountain known as Camp Cloud is coming down.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:54.980
11 people were removed, and five were arrested. The injunction cited the camp’s refusal to

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.000
put out the sacred fire. Camp Cloud says even though the camp is dispersed,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.990
they'll continue to monitor Kinder
Morgan's activities and resist further

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:08.810
colonization of their land.
Both Kinder Morgan and Prime Minister

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.250
Trudeau declined to speak with us on
camera. Energy and Indigenous sovereignty

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.200
are going to be key issues heading into
the 2019 election. Trudeau still owns the

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.440
Trans Mountain pipeline, and the government is determined to see the

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:27.820
expansion through. But for those who put their bodies on the line to stop it, this is just the beginning.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.520
How far are you willing to go to stop this pipeline?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.060
It's in my blood not to stop. I will remain that warrior for my people.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.140
Do you think you’ll succeed?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.560
Absolutely. You're going up against your own government,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.600
and I'm just one person with a lot of supporters. So I really do hope and pray that I do succeed.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.800
Hey guys, it's Dena, and that's what's
going on with the Kinder Morgan pipeline

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.030
here in Canada. Come back next week for
another Direct From episode on the

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.900
epidemic of missing and murdered
Indigenous women also here in Canada.
