00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.530
- [Woman] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.663
for education and noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:13.288
(soft music)

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.790
- Well good afternoon.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.586
I'm William Lester, professor of chemistry

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:50.577
and chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:52.866
We're pleased, along with
the graduate counsel,

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.024
to present Professor Richard Thaler,

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:57.370
this year's speaker in the Charles M.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.787
and Martha Hitchcock Series.

00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:01.828
As a condition of this
request, we're obligated

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.530
and happy to tell you
how the endowment came

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.780
to UC Berkeley.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.616
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:10.952
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:13.960
and the Bay area.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.216
Doctor Charles Hitchcock,
a physician in the army,

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:18.760
came to San Francisco
during the gold rush,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.800
where he opened a thriving practice.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.731
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:27.930
here at Berkeley, as an
expression of his long

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.970
held interest in education.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.732
His daughter, Lily Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:34.990
still treasured in San Francisco for her

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.418
colorful personality, as
well as her generosity,

00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:40.358
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:43.650
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.988
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:50.320
The Hitchcock fund has
become one of the most

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.638
cherished endowments of the
University of California,

00:01:52.638 --> 00:01:55.370
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.740
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.150
Thank you Lily and Charles,
and now a few words

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.031
about Professor Thaler.

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.090
Richard Thaler is renowned
for his influential

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.083
contributions over the last three decades

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:10.781
to the emerging field
of behavioral economics.

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.390
He is considered by many to be the pioneer

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.850
in integrating psychological research

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.057
with economic theory and the inventor

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:23.680
of the field of behavioral economics.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.930
Thaler's studies also
focus on behavioral finance

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.870
and the psychology of decision making.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.710
He explores the implications of loosening

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.173
the standard economic
assumption that everyone

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:37.610
in the economy is rational and selfish.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.838
Instead considering the
possibility that some

00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:44.276
of the participants in the
economy are sometimes human.

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:47.033
Thaler received his BA from
Case Western Reserve University

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.317
in 1967 and his MA and PhD

00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:53.080
from the University of Rochester in 1970

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.430
and '74 respectively.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.400
Between 1974 and 1980,
he held the positions

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700
of assistant professor
at the graduate school

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.914
of management of the
University of Rochester.

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.790
And assistant professor of economics

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.721
and public administration at the graduate

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:09.240
School of Business and
Public Administration

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.340
at Cornell University.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.944
From 1980 to 1988 he was
professor of economics

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:17.765
at Cornell's Johnson Graduate
School of Management.

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.150
He is currently the Robert P. Gwen

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.782
Professor of Behavioral
Science and Economics,

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:26.310
as well as director of the
Center of Decision Research

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.238
at the University of Chicago,
Graduate School of Business,

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:31.710
where he has help appointments since 1995.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.660
Thaler is also a research associate

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.349
at the National Bureau
of Economic Research,

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.050
where he co-directs the
behavioral economics project.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.560
Professor Thaler has been
awarded numerous honors

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.360
for his extensive and illuminating work

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.230
in behavioral economics.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.107
He is a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:54.648
and in 2009, he was elected a fellow

00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:57.539
of the American Finance Association.

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.760
And currently serves as vice president

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.510
of the American Economics Association.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.616
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Richard Thaler.

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:08.033
(applauding)

00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:22.093
- Okay, well first of
all I have some good news

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:24.853
to announce, the Giants
won three, nothing.

00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:28.620
(applauding)

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.117
You can go now.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:36.070
So it's a great honor to be here

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.171
and so I think I have more
friends at this university

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:44.270
than any other and I also have a daughter

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.370
and daughter in law in the audience today

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.940
so it's lots of fun to be here.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.910
Let me start by talking about my so-called

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.340
friend, Danny Kahneman,
who some of you may know,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.580
he was a professor here,
much beloved professor

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.673
for many years before he,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.970
ditched Berkeley and went to Princeton.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.450
And Danny and I have
been friends since 1977.

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:18.847
So once when I was out
here for some reason

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.680
and Danny and I were doing
some work at this home

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.258
up in the hills.

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:28.710
He had to get a phone
call from some reporter

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.783
who was writing a story
about me, a profile.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.793
So I was there, it was a little awkward.

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:39.210
We were both, Danny and
I were worried about

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.080
whether I would be
embarrassed by the effusive

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.387
praise that he would be heaping upon me,

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:49.460
but we decided not to
share with the reporter

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.693
that I was in the room.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.277
So they're starting the
talking and then Danny says,

00:05:55.277 --> 00:06:00.277
"Well, really the best thing about Thaler

00:06:00.587 --> 00:06:02.817
"is that he's lazy."

00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:05.150
(laughing)

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.055
So I'm, you know, waving at him

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:11.661
and writing him a note saying, you know,

00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.493
it's not the best thing, right?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.309
So he and I have been arguing
about this ever since.

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.360
But the truth is that he's right.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.010
I don't know whether it's the best thing,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.630
but it's an accurate description.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.670
And so I was a lazy man
going into economics

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.640
and what was I to do?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.597
So what's a good research
method for a lazy guy?

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:40.500
Introspection.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.450
Now the scientific name for
this is thought experiment

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.840
and I've actually developed
some very little known

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.720
statistical methods for
analyzing thought experiments.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.995
I think I'm the only person that has

00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:58.832
those statistical packages.

00:06:58.832 --> 00:07:02.073
So here's my first thought experiment.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.840
When I was living in
Rochester, a friend of mine

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.170
were given two tickets
to a basketball game,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.310
this was when Buffalo had a
professional basketball team.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.113
There was a big blizzard which
was not a surprising event,

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:20.113
and we wisely decided
not to go to the game.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.900
And he says, it would be
nuts to go to this game

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.130
in this weather.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.290
But then he says, but if we had paid

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.090
for those tickets we would be going.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.640
Now this of course, is a
violation of economic theory

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.640
because in economics we teach,
thou shalt ignore sunk costs.

00:07:41.306 --> 00:07:45.783
But we were going, so it
started me wondering why.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.560
But I discovered the
hard way that you can't

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.710
publish thought experiments.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.745
Do the next best thing,
which is ask other people

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:57.430
to engage in thought experiments.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.810
So while I was working
on my doctoral thesis,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.313
which was on the value of a human life,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.260
that was an econometric exercise,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.620
where I was estimated how
much you had to pay people

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.140
to get them to take risky jobs.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.060
I thought it might be fun
to ask them some questions.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.010
So I asked two questions.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.290
The first was, we can
modify it for this crowd,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.309
suppose that by coming to this lecture

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:30.423
you have exposed yourself
to a one in a thousand

00:08:30.423 --> 00:08:32.630
risk of death.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.760
If you have this disease, you're gonna die

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.320
a quick and painless
death, sometime next week.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.894
But I have one cure
that I'm willing to sell

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:45.560
to the highest bidder,
how much will you pay?

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.671
So you can think about your
answer to that question.

00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:50.766
Then I asked another question.

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:55.275
How much would you
demand to expose yourself

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:56.910
to that risk?

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.930
Typical answers to
those questions would be

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.150
something like, $1,000
and one million dollars.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.191
But economic theory tells
us that those answers

00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:09.850
should be approximately the same,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.663
so how can they differ by
several orders of magnitude?

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.810
So this got me thinking.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.159
I was told that,

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:22.840
this experiment was
criticized on the grounds

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.960
that it was hypothetical.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.510
I've been trying ever
since to do it for...

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.073
Real, you know, I thought
Russian Roulette for money.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.264
Somehow I haven't gotten that past any

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:42.264
human subject committees,
so this was career stifling.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.290
So then I moved on to
more advanced methods.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.860
In 1991, '92, my friend Colin Camerer,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.189
one of the first people to join me in this

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:59.530
behavioral economics
venture, he and Danny and I

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.120
were all spending a year in New York

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.010
and if you live in New
York you spend a lot

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.850
of time in cabs.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.147
So Colin and I used to
talk to cab drivers a lot.

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:11.450
And what they told us was
that if they were having

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.740
a particularly good day, they
would quit and go home early.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.830
This is the opposite
of what economic theory

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.433
tells them they should
do because essentially,

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.394
what they're doing is they're minimizing

00:10:24.394 --> 00:10:29.394
their earnings per hour by working less

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.617
on the profitable days and
more on the unprofitable days.

00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:37.965
Then I moved on to playing
poker with my colleagues,

00:10:37.965 --> 00:10:41.060
that was another data collection method.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.060
And what I noticed was
that full professors

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.090
of economics would be
entirely different people

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.742
depending on whether
they were ahead or behind

00:10:53.742 --> 00:10:58.587
by some relatively small amount, like $50.

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:02.695
So if they were ahead by $50,

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:06.330
there was no point in
trying to bluff them.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.555
They would call any bet that didn't risk

00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:11.170
putting them behind.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.320
But if they were behind,
they didn't like getting

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.303
much further behind, but
they were willing to gamble

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.480
if they could get back to even.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.480
So again, it was hard to
publish my poker predictions

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.576
and in any case, that would've deprived me

00:11:32.576 --> 00:11:35.000
of an important income source when I

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.592
was a young professor.

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:41.577
So all of this got, all
of these observations,

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:44.154
scientific observations
got me thinking about

00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:46.870
what I've called mental accounting,

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.870
which is how people think
about everyday transactions.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.820
Why is it that they think that having paid

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.140
for those tickets makes
it seem more compelling

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.749
that they should go to the game?

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:05.540
Why does the cab driver
think it's a good idea

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.210
to quit when they're
making a lot of money?

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.830
Why do they treat opposite costs different

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.206
from out of pocket costs?

00:12:13.206 --> 00:12:16.522
And more important was how to convince

00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:19.750
any of my colleagues that any of these

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.200
observations were remotely
interesting or compelling.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.754
So essentially, today I'm
gonna tell you the story of

00:12:27.754 --> 00:12:32.754
how I began going beyond
thought experiments.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.700
So one method is to try real experiments.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:45.680
Here's an experiment that Danny Kahneman

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.296
and Jack Kinnech and I ran.

00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:52.481
It was run actually in a class at Cornell

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.217
in law and economics.

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:57.870
For the economists in
the room, this is a class

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.606
in which the coast theorem was mentioned

00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:01.883
at least once in every lecture.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.830
So we handed out Cornell coffee mugs

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:12.500
to every other student.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.421
And then created a market in these mugs.

00:13:15.421 --> 00:13:18.260
And if they had a mug they could sell it.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.900
If they didn't have a
mug, they could buy it.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.095
Now since there was
random assignment of mugs,

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:28.740
the economic theory and
particularly the coast theorem

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.740
suggests that it makes
it, and kind of an unusual

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.640
prediction of economics, it makes a

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.410
prediction about volume.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.010
Normally we have predictions about prices.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.080
We rarely have predictions about quantity.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.098
But this one makes a
prediction about volume,

00:13:45.098 --> 00:13:48.630
specifically it says that about half

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.420
the mugs should trade.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.346
And the reason is, suppose you rank

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:58.130
the students in this
class based on how much

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.660
they love a Cornell coffee mug.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.050
There were 44 students in this class.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.050
The 22 who liked mugs most
should end up owning them,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.670
and about 11 of them should have gotten

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.230
a mug at random so the
other 11 should buy a mug.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.630
Well that didn't happen.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.060
Instead of a volume of 11 trades,

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.233
we would get a volume
between one and four.

00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:23.875
The reason why we didn't get volume

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:28.875
is the people who got mugs
didn't wanna part with them

00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:31.250
and the people who didn't get a mug,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.579
weren't that interested in buying one.

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:37.020
I've called this the endowment effect.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.609
The idea is that once
something is in your endowment

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:42.810
you don't wanna give it up.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.049
But you wouldn't pay much to get it.

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:48.650
This experiment was criticized,

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.260
well this is small stakes.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.090
So here's another experiment that was,

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:59.090
this was an experiment
I conducted to try to

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.963
test my observations at the poker table.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.453
This was done with real money.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:11.710
It can be sometimes
difficult to run experiments

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.600
with real money where
people can lose money,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.330
but we had an unusually intelligent

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:20.350
human subjects committee at Cornell,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.100
so I was able to run these.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.400
So the first group of students are told,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.000
you've just won $30, truthfully.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.810
Now would you like to flip
a coin for nine dollars.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.557
And the 70, 30 means 70% said yes.

00:15:36.557 --> 00:15:39.981
Another group are told, you just lost $30,

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.581
they had bad luck.

00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:44.940
Now would you like to flip
a coin for nine dollars?

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.750
If you're wondering what we did with these

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.303
poor subjects who lost money,

00:15:48.303 --> 00:15:52.120
the experiment was designed in such a way

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.360
that that was fairly unlikely to happen

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.090
and they were told that if they didn't

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.170
wanna pay they could

00:15:58.573 --> 00:16:02.660
go to the library and xerox articles.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.859
Believe it or not, people
used to go to libraries

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:09.620
and xerox articles, if you
can imagine such a thing,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.420
and we would pay them for that activity.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.640
But anyway, you can see,
after having lost money,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.400
they're not as interested
in this coin flip.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.837
But if we say you've lost
$30, now would you like

00:16:22.837 --> 00:16:26.508
$10 for sure or a one
third chance to get 30,

00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:30.250
now they're back into
gambling because this gives

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.286
them a chance to break even.

00:16:32.286 --> 00:16:37.286
Now this experiment
illustrates two things.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.290
The first we've called
the house money effect.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.410
This is a gambling term.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.450
If you go to a casino
you'll sometimes see people

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.050
who win some money, they'll take the money

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.000
they've won, they put it one pocket.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.070
They take the money they brought with them

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.738
and they put it into another pocket.

00:16:53.738 --> 00:16:57.878
And the money they've won is referred to

00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:01.323
as the house money,
the casino is the house

00:17:01.323 --> 00:17:04.180
and it's like, that's
somebody else's money.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.440
They don't mind losing that money,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.400
but they hate losing their own money.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.470
And the problem three
illustrates what we've

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.485
called the break even effect.

00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:18.661
That people hate losing,
but if they get a chance

00:17:18.661 --> 00:17:23.343
to get back to even, they'll
gamble in order to take it.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.080
Now we have real money, real stakes,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.051
but people say, well this is peanuts.

00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:31.512
This is small stakes.

00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:34.227
And now people have
tried raising the stakes

00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:37.209
creatively by going to a poor country.

00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:40.252
So you can play games like this for

00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:43.510
the same amount of US dollars, but can be

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.974
three months income.

00:17:44.974 --> 00:17:49.665
But there's another way
of raising the stakes

00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:53.453
and that's to use game shows.

00:17:56.068 --> 00:17:58.981
I wrote a paper with
three Greek colleagues,

00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:03.981
using the game show Deal or No Deal.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.570
Now if you've never seen
this show, you're lucky.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.683
It's pretty much unwatchable.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.279
I'll explain how it works.

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:24.279
So we had data from the Dutch show,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.830
the US show, and now I'm
forgetting, German show.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.350
The US show was high stakes.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.470
You could win up to a million dollars.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.094
The Dutch show, the first
prize was five million euros,

00:18:41.094 --> 00:18:45.221
which is about 50 billion dollars.

00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:47.471
(laughing)

00:18:50.197 --> 00:18:54.570
Here's the way this game works,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.570
in the US version they had
to sex the US version up,

00:19:01.217 --> 00:19:06.217
there are brief cases with
various amounts of money.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.640
In the US version the
stakes were a little lower,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.215
but it's the same idea.

00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:16.022
In the US version each
briefcase is held on stage

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:19.093
by a scantily clad model.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.010
And the first step the contestant,

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:31.030
this guy's name is Frank,
names six of the cases

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.510
that he wants opened.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.650
Oh no, I forgot an important step.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.330
First he picks a case and
they bring it up on stage.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.010
That's his, whatever amount
of money is in there,

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.390
it could be any of these amounts, is his.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.900
Now he opens six cases and
the amounts are revealed.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.060
Notice, this tells him
what isn't in his case.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.640
So he's got one of the
remaining amounts of money.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.473
At this point, he's offered
a choice, deal or no deal?

00:20:05.473 --> 00:20:09.520
The offer, in this case
you can see at the top,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.450
is 17,000 pounds, sorry euros

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.254
and he can say deal or no deal.

00:20:17.254 --> 00:20:22.254
At the bottom, we've
calculated and are showing you

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.479
the expected value.

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:29.907
So on average, what he
would get if he played

00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:33.180
this game a lot times.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.330
And you can see that's 383,000 euros,

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.490
so this is a very bad offer.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.545
And in fact, the offers
always start out low

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:45.963
and no one ever takes them.

00:20:45.963 --> 00:20:49.460
And that's designed to
make the show watchable.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.706
So you can see Frank was quite
lucky in this first round.

00:20:53.706 --> 00:20:58.180
He didn't open any of the big briefcases.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.180
The US host frequently reminds
guests that the strategy

00:21:03.475 --> 00:21:07.433
is to pick the breifcases
with small amounts of money,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.120
which is undoubtedly the
right strategy in this game.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.063
I think that's a game theory result.

00:21:17.123 --> 00:21:20.970
Frank's luck turns immediately.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.900
So on the second round he opens up a bunch

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.810
of really big numbers.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:31.444
You can see his expected
value falls to 64,000 euros,

00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:35.009
and his offer falls, he says no.

00:21:35.009 --> 00:21:38.390
I'm gonna go through the
rest kind of quickly.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.353
You can watch how Frank does.

00:21:42.137 --> 00:21:44.387
(laughing)

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.290
now notice at this point, Frank
has quite a risky portfolio.

00:22:00.639 --> 00:22:03.380
Right?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.884
He's got one big number, one decent number

00:22:07.884 --> 00:22:10.445
and three tiny numbers.

00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:15.120
He's being offered 75% of expected value,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.197
that's a pretty good deal.

00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:20.500
In fact, we would expect
him to take that deal,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.973
but he says no deal.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.373
Very unlucky.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.243
So he keeps playing.

00:22:32.437 --> 00:22:37.437
Now at this point, he's offered
more than expected value.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.930
So he's offered 6,000 euros
for a 50% chance at 10,000.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.963
He says no.

00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:52.550
Okay, this is...

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.907
There's a lot of things going on here.

00:22:54.907 --> 00:22:59.610
One of them is that the very big stakes

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.189
that he started with sort of blind him

00:23:03.189 --> 00:23:07.318
to the fact that this is
actually a high stakes bet.

00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:10.809
So any other day of Frank's life,

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:14.192
if you walked up to him and said,

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:17.410
would you like 6,000 euros for sure,

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.020
or a 50% chance at 10,000?

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.533
He would say, thank you very
much and take the 6,000,

00:23:23.533 --> 00:23:26.040
but today, no.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.040
Now let me show you, this is
some German, Helga, I think.

00:23:31.518 --> 00:23:33.273
I'm not making that up.

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:39.840
And now you can see the German show

00:23:42.064 --> 00:23:43.603
is much smaller stakes.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.306
But it works, the rules are just the same.

00:23:48.306 --> 00:23:50.763
Helen is quite lucky.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.000
And now this is the house money effect.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.384
Here we're offering
exactly an even money bet,

00:24:04.384 --> 00:24:09.035
and she says, fine I'll gamble.

00:24:09.035 --> 00:24:12.490
I watched about three
or four of the US shows

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.510
and then couldn't bear it anymore

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.879
and then hired a student to watch them

00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:21.990
and record what happens.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.640
Don't report to the IRB.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.537
But in one of the shows I saw a scene

00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:30.437
kind of similar to this and this was

00:24:30.437 --> 00:24:34.380
a first grade teacher who,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.058
the stakes were kind of
similar to this in dollars,

00:24:39.058 --> 00:24:44.058
and she said no deal.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.587
The host said why and she says,

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:51.810
"Well it's only $25,000."

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.844
Now that was six month's income.

00:24:54.844 --> 00:24:58.300
And there is again no
other context in which

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:03.300
she would say, "It's only
25,000," but she did here.

00:25:04.507 --> 00:25:08.920
So this was one way of
us raising the stakes

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.660
and there is lots of boring sophisticated

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.928
econometrics in this
paper if you're interested

00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:20.433
in reading it, but essentially we're able

00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:23.954
to test a version of prospect theory,

00:25:23.954 --> 00:25:26.690
which is a theory of choice

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.210
that Kahneman and Traversky came up with

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.723
and we get quite a bit of
evidence supporting it.

00:25:31.723 --> 00:25:35.831
And remarkably, the
behavior is very similar

00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:38.592
to what I observed in the poker game

00:25:38.592 --> 00:25:42.240
and what we observed in
our low stakes experiments.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.240
One of the results of
mental accounting is that...

00:25:48.652 --> 00:25:53.652
What explains this behavior
about driving in the snow,

00:25:54.457 --> 00:25:58.270
one way to describe it
is to say that people

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:03.270
don't like closing an account,
a mental account in the loss.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.969
So they bought those
tickets, and now if they

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:10.843
throw them away, they're out that money.

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:16.206
Again, this is small stakes, anecdotal.

00:26:16.206 --> 00:26:19.200
Can we raise the stakes somehow?

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.670
so your own, Terry Odean

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.940
has run some experiments about...

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.960
Sorry, a study on this
with real investors.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.631
Here's the hypothetical experiment

00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:34.243
that you wanna think about.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.916
Suppose you need $30,000,

00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:43.539
you're gonna sell one
of two stocks you own.

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:46.092
One has gone up and one has gone down.

00:26:46.092 --> 00:26:48.760
Which one do you sell?

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.760
Now the rational choice
is to sell the loser.

00:26:54.047 --> 00:26:57.028
And the reason is the government,
or benevolent government

00:26:57.028 --> 00:27:02.028
likes to share and they share
our gains and our losses.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.930
And if you dislike paying
taxes than you would

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.600
rather share your losses
with the government

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.131
than your gains.

00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:14.060
But that's not what people do.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:19.060
So this is Terry's data and
what he's looking at here

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:25.805
is the, in people's
portfolios what percentage

00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:28.850
of their winners did they sell

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.690
and what percentage of
the losers did they sell

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.590
and what you can see is that they sell

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.470
15% of the winners and 10% of the losers.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:42.382
Now in December, when taxes get relevant,

00:27:42.382 --> 00:27:45.820
they get just barely rational.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.240
So the sell slightly
more losers than winners

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.552
in that month, but the
rest of the year, no.

00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:58.547
Now you might think,
ah, they're being smart.

00:27:58.547 --> 00:28:02.636
And they realized that these
losers are gonna rebound,

00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:05.550
but in fact, that's not true.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.220
The stocks they sell do
worse than the stocks

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.540
they hold on to.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.259
Some additional evidence with finance,

00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:15.774
with cabs, actually I think
I took the finance out,

00:28:15.774 --> 00:28:19.971
with football and another game show.

00:28:19.971 --> 00:28:23.683
After our driving around experience,

00:28:24.718 --> 00:28:28.419
Colin and I went to some guy.

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:31.113
It might have been Danny Devito,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.940
who was the dispatcher
for some taxi cab company.

00:28:39.462 --> 00:28:44.462
In New York many of the taxi
drivers fill out some sheet

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.980
that records every fair.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.479
And so we got a big pile
of these that we analyzed.

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:57.460
And we did this with Linda
Babcock and George Loewenstein.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.327
And what we found was some
evidence to support this

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.039
intuition the cab drivers
had shared with us,

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:13.039
that on days where in
the first half of the day

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.680
they were doing well, first of all,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.290
we had evidence that
that was a good predictor

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.320
of earnings in the second half of the day,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.002
and second that they were more
likely to quit on those days.

00:29:26.002 --> 00:29:29.770
So you can think of it as
a reason why you can never

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.470
get a cab on a rainy day in New York,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.020
is all the cab drivers have gone home

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.763
because they've made so much money.

00:29:36.763 --> 00:29:39.440
So we declared victory.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.463
Then came along a very mean and evil guy

00:29:42.463 --> 00:29:44.900
called Hank Farber.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.590
Oh, before I get to Hank,
who's actually quite

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.562
a lovable guy but...

00:29:50.562 --> 00:29:55.562
This result was only true
for inexperienced drivers.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.858
So we divided our sample in half.

00:29:59.858 --> 00:30:04.122
To the old ones and the young
ones, just a median split

00:30:04.122 --> 00:30:07.909
and the older drivers had figured this out

00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:11.720
and got it more or less right.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.541
The younger ones were making this mistake.

00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:16.453
So here's the quiz.

00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:21.360
Does this finding imply that cab drivers

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.740
are less likely to show up on a day

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.283
expected to be busy?

00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:28.750
Okay.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.338
The answer is no.

00:30:30.338 --> 00:30:35.338
Surprisingly enough
though, one leading journal

00:30:36.531 --> 00:30:40.700
published a paper that shows that people

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.490
who work in stadiums are
more likely to show up

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.245
on days like today when
the ballpark is full

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:50.870
than on days early in the season
when there's nobody there.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.422
Now this is not surprising
or contradictory

00:30:54.422 --> 00:30:56.490
of anything we found.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.018
Cab drivers are more likely to show up

00:30:58.018 --> 00:31:00.640
on a day that's busy too,
they're just more likely

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.970
to quit early.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.664
So it might have been
hard to find a beer vendor

00:31:03.664 --> 00:31:05.143
in the eighth inning today.

00:31:07.438 --> 00:31:09.587
Now we get to, no.

00:31:10.701 --> 00:31:14.740
More evidence, I'm
holding Hank in reserve.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.650
There's also a study by Ernst Fehr

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.460
and his student, Lorenze Goette who find

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.560
the same data for bike messengers

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.290
in a field experiment they conducted.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.050
But now we get to the evil Hank Farber,

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.975
who analyzes our data to death

00:31:31.975 --> 00:31:35.797
and gets the data to confess.

00:31:35.797 --> 00:31:39.940
Essentially what he finds
is that the evidence

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.288
that the first half of the day predicts

00:31:42.288 --> 00:31:45.723
earnings in the second
half of the day is too weak

00:31:45.723 --> 00:31:50.277
to draw our conclusion,
which was very depressing.

00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:55.277
But to the rescue comes Vince Crawford

00:31:56.139 --> 00:31:59.280
and one of his students, J.J Meng,

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.023
who combined even fancier econometrics

00:32:03.023 --> 00:32:08.023
with even fancier theory
provided by Berkeley's

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.750
none other than Botond
Koszegi and Matthew Rabin

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.200
and determined the truth.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.100
Now if I could install
a ban on anymore papers

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.110
on cab drivers, I would
like to do that right now,

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.670
but at least right now,
I don't know whether

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.514
this paper is out yet, but
it's forthcoming in 2010.

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:32.760
I'm declaring victory, I'm moving on.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.224
One of my colleagues somehow
has not been convinced

00:32:36.224 --> 00:32:38.100
by all this.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.140
There was an article in the
University of Chicago Magazine,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.920
a profile of me and
they went to talk to my

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.062
Nobeloreatte college, Gary Becker,

00:32:47.062 --> 00:32:51.656
who's the chief defender of
the rational economic model.

00:32:51.656 --> 00:32:54.740
And this was his comment.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.300
Gaze, I'll let you read it
because I need a sip of water.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.340
He basic, the translation is,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.686
no need to pay any attention to Thaler.

00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:04.446
This doesn't matter.

00:33:04.446 --> 00:33:08.632
Presumably cab drivers don't count.

00:33:08.632 --> 00:33:13.632
So we decided to turn to
National Football League teams.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.220
Now this, you would think,
remember he's claiming

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.630
that the 10% of people who
know what they're doing

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.471
will end up in the important
jobs and presumably,

00:33:25.471 --> 00:33:29.282
you have to be really rich
to own a football team.

00:33:29.282 --> 00:33:32.220
It costs about a billion dollars.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.900
I want one.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.065
If anyone has that kind
of money, come talk to me

00:33:38.065 --> 00:33:43.065
after the lecture, I want
somebody to knock off Al Davis.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:46.030
And then we'll buy the Raiders.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.870
And I'll prove to you
in the next 10 minutes

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.400
that we'll turn them into winners.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.490
So let's see whether owners
of National Football League

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.490
teams satisfy rationality
according to Becker.

00:33:59.816 --> 00:34:03.353
So what we do is we don't
study the game itself.

00:34:03.353 --> 00:34:07.390
You don't need to know
the difference between

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.348
a quarterback and a
linebacker, which is good

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:13.385
since my daughter's in
the room and doesn't know

00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:17.890
the difference between a
quarterback and a linebacker

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.660
although her boyfriend is trying hard

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.093
to explain the difference.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.630
Every year in April,
the teams have a draft

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.480
where they pick so called college players.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.328
They did attend some college.

00:34:31.328 --> 00:34:34.260
(laughing)

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.173
I'm sure the ones at Cal
are serious students.

00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:41.340
And they pick players
in order with the worst

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.389
team picking first.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.992
There are seven rounds of this draft

00:34:45.992 --> 00:34:50.614
and the players who are picked by a team

00:34:50.614 --> 00:34:54.000
are stuck with that team for a period of,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.835
typically four or five years.

00:34:55.835 --> 00:35:00.835
Crucially, for what we do,
those picks can and are traded.

00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:06.670
And so what we study is
the market for picks.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:11.313
And we wanna know whether
that market is efficient.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:17.675
So let me show you what
that market looks like.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.750
This is a plot of all the trades of,

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.560
this is all the trades
just picks for picks.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.639
Sometimes teams will
trade a player for a pick.

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:34.320
We can't analyze those in this way,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.232
so we only look at the data
that are picks for picks.

00:35:38.232 --> 00:35:43.232
And we estimate a curve to fit that data

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.626
and if you ever looked at real data,

00:35:47.626 --> 00:35:50.204
you know it doesn't look like this.

00:35:50.204 --> 00:35:54.903
This has an R square
that's embarrassingly high.

00:35:57.138 --> 00:36:00.115
I mean, it's .99.

00:36:00.115 --> 00:36:04.560
So at first, this is a
paper done with one of my

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.183
former students, Cade
Matthews, now at Yale.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.541
We thought maybe we had
discovered Newton's fourth law,

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:16.761
or something like that.

00:36:16.761 --> 00:36:19.510
It turns out that wasn't the case.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.460
What we had discovered was something

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.443
that in the league they
refer to as, the chart.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.284
It turns out some time in
the '90s, the Dallas Cowboys

00:36:31.284 --> 00:36:36.284
had one of Jerry Jone's
co-owners, an engineer,

00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:40.249
estimate that curve.

00:36:40.249 --> 00:36:45.249
And calculate just from past trades,

00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:49.350
what picks were worth.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.627
And he fiddled around, it was
nothing very sophisticated.

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:57.587
And then since he was dealing
with mere football owners,

00:36:57.587 --> 00:37:02.270
he produced this chart and what it's...

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.060
I'm sure it's hard to read in the back.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:08.367
What it says is the
very first pick up here

00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:10.530
is worth 3,000 points.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.490
The last pick, what they
call Mr. Irrelevant,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.220
is worth not quite a point.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.720
And then the second pick is
2,600, 2,200 and so forth.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.857
Well what we were estimating
essentially is this chart

00:37:23.857 --> 00:37:27.928
because the chart has
spread all around the league

00:37:27.928 --> 00:37:32.928
and teams all have it, and
now when they conduct trades,

00:37:33.044 --> 00:37:36.465
they're all looking at this chart.

00:37:36.465 --> 00:37:41.380
So if the Raiders, they
always have one of these

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.818
picks up here so...

00:37:42.818 --> 00:37:45.570
(laughing)

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.460
So Al Davis has the third
pick, he's talking to the guy

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.662
with the 12th pick about a trade,

00:37:51.662 --> 00:37:54.670
that there's a difference
of a thousand points.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:58.630
So the guy with the 12th pick will have to

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.441
come up with some number of
picks that equals a thousand.

00:38:03.441 --> 00:38:08.441
The picks, the trades follow
this chart very, very closely.

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:15.060
Now what we're interested in is,

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:19.595
is this chart right in the sense that

00:38:19.595 --> 00:38:23.580
is the first pick really worth three times

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.413
as much as the 16th pick?

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:32.150
Or is the first pick worth
four of these picks down here?

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.630
And our guess was the answer was no.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.800
That was our strong
intuition, but as I told you

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800
I've had trouble getting
my intuitions published,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.103
so we collected some data.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.780
One aside, since the chart came out,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.333
so this is when the first chart was done,

00:38:56.175 --> 00:38:58.990
two things have happened.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.990
One is it's become more
true in the sense that

00:39:05.557 --> 00:39:09.001
this is the variance away from the chart.

00:39:09.001 --> 00:39:14.001
And so at the beginning only
the Cowboys had this chart.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.490
But then a guy from
the Cowboys would leave

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.000
and go to the Niners and
he would take it with him

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.530
and in spread around the league.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.210
Now everyone has it.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.252
And so this curve here is plotting

00:39:25.252 --> 00:39:29.850
the deviation away from the
chart and this moves it out.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.450
And what you can see is the chart starts

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.890
to fit better and better as
everyone starts to use it.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.890
What we conclude so far is that the market

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.083
values high picks very highly.

00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:46.555
Now is that correct?

00:39:46.555 --> 00:39:49.200
So the next question we wanna ask is,

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.790
what do you have to pay these guys?

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.394
Well, here's another chart.

00:39:52.394 --> 00:39:56.000
This is how much you have to pay picks

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.250
as a function of draft order.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.613
And you can see these early
picks are also really expensive.

00:40:03.354 --> 00:40:07.393
You also see, this curve
also has a really good fit.

00:40:08.972 --> 00:40:13.610
There's not our chart, instead the league,

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.110
the league has a chart, essentially.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.760
Because there's, I'm not
gonna go into detail here,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.779
but there is something
called a rookie salary cap

00:40:22.779 --> 00:40:25.961
and the league is basically telling teams

00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:30.120
how much they can pay
rookies and it's this.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.080
And so players are pretty much slotted.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.557
The first guy makes more than
the second guy and so forth.

00:40:37.557 --> 00:40:41.826
So high picks are expensive in two ways.

00:40:41.826 --> 00:40:45.403
The picks are expensive and
the players are expensive.

00:40:45.403 --> 00:40:50.403
Now what that means is a
team should only be willing

00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:55.071
to take a very high pick
if they're really sure

00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.723
this guy is good.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.373
Now if any of you are 49ers fans,

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:07.403
you probably know a guy called Alex Smith.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:10.543
When was he drafted?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.530
Anyway, 2001?

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:17.660
Okay.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.520
That year the Niner's had the first pick.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.070
They spent about six
weeks trying to decide

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.040
whether Alex Smith or Aaron Rogers

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.020
was the better quarterback.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.805
In the end they went with Smith.

00:41:30.805 --> 00:41:33.740
Now it's a very close call.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.740
It should have been,
in fact what we find is

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:42.005
that the chance that the
first quarterback taken

00:41:42.005 --> 00:41:46.243
is better than the second is about 52%.

00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:49.110
And that's true throughout the draft.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.210
Here's a plot of that.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.560
What this shows is consecutive players

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.511
at some position, what's the chance

00:41:57.511 --> 00:42:01.640
the Nth guy is better
than the Nth plus first?

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.380
And it's a little higher
in the first round,

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.200
it's maybe 55, 56 percent.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.093
But then it gets to
coin flips very quickly.

00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:16.108
So you should be worried about that chart.

00:42:16.188 --> 00:42:19.710
So here's the last step.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.112
What we do is we take and
value player's performance

00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:27.890
and we value them by how much
you have to pay veterans.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.520
And so here's what you have to pay.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.793
This is what you have to pay veterans.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.320
These are all pros, the best players.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.580
The blue line are quarterbacks,

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.820
so quarterbacks get
paid about twice as much

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.520
as everybody else.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.180
Other players, there's not that much

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.993
difference between positions.

00:42:48.295 --> 00:42:50.680
Defensive ends get paid a lot

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.000
and left tackles get paid a lot.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.980
But essentially what we
do is we take Alex Smith

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.702
and we say, in his first year,

00:42:58.702 --> 00:43:01.351
let's say he was a backup quarterback.

00:43:01.351 --> 00:43:03.780
That's worth three million.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.894
Second year, below average quarterback.

00:43:05.894 --> 00:43:08.210
Third year, fourth year, fifth year,

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.290
below average quarterback.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.810
And we add those all up and we say,

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.322
all right that's what he
was worth to the Niner's.

00:43:14.322 --> 00:43:16.327
Here's what we get.

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:19.683
What we find, first of all,
this is what players are worth.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.920
Now you can see they know something,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.453
the teams know something.

00:43:25.453 --> 00:43:28.330
First picks are worth
more than the, right.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:32.799
So value goes down with the draft.

00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:35.472
But not fast enough.

00:43:35.472 --> 00:43:37.897
These are the...

00:43:37.897 --> 00:43:42.080
If you subtract payment

00:43:43.494 --> 00:43:47.520
this is surplus, so this
is what the picks are worth

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.980
to the players and you can see

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.360
according to us, the
best picks in the draft

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.514
are at the beginning of the second round.

00:43:56.514 --> 00:44:01.514
Now just to summarize, here is the curve

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.600
we were trying to test
of whether it's rational.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.363
Here's what we think is truth.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.493
It's not close.

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:15.280
This is the biggest, I've
done a lot of research

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.439
in behavioral finance, this is much bigger

00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:21.170
mis-pricing than anything we've found.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.100
What this says is that you
can trade the first pick

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.510
for about five or six second round picks,

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.583
each of which is worth more
than that pick you gave up.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.653
So of course, the Niner's
should have traded that pick.

00:44:36.653 --> 00:44:40.693
I was actually interviewed by
a reporter around that time

00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:43.810
and asked, if you were the
Niner's what would you do

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.706
and I said, I would put
that pick on sale, 20% off.

00:44:48.706 --> 00:44:50.800
They didn't do that.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.970
Last comment about football.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.280
Various complaints about our methods.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.450
Here's a simple analysis we've conducted.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:03.215
Let's consider all the trades,
one player for two players.

00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:05.410
See how they do.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.320
On two measures, number
of all pro appearances

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.419
and number of starts.

00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:11.733
This is what we get.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.344
We get, the technical term is dominance.

00:45:16.344 --> 00:45:20.439
You get just as many pro bowl players

00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:22.920
and the same number of...

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.546
You get just as many pro bowl
appearances, that's over here,

00:45:26.546 --> 00:45:28.993
but a lot more starts.

00:45:28.993 --> 00:45:31.823
So this is sort of a non-parametric test.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.493
Okay.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.943
One more game show.

00:45:39.763 --> 00:45:44.333
So this is a high stakes
prisoner's dilemma.

00:45:46.154 --> 00:45:49.455
You know what, while
we're messing with this,

00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:50.773
we're gonna listen.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.305
There's a middle-aged man and a rather

00:45:57.305 --> 00:45:59.147
attractive young woman.

00:45:59.147 --> 00:45:59.980
- The jackpot today

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.355
is 100,150 pounds.
- Listen carefully.

00:46:02.355 --> 00:46:04.772
(applauding)

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.450
- You have one final decision to make.

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:11.530
- A easy decision.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:15.104
- We're now going to play split or steal.

00:46:15.104 --> 00:46:17.521
(applauding)

00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.730
I know you're the last
two people in the country

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.465
I have to explain this
to, but you have two

00:46:25.465 --> 00:46:27.580
final golden balls.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.690
You each have a golden ball with the word

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.900
split written inside.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.889
You each have a golden ball with the word

00:46:33.889 --> 00:46:36.390
steal written inside.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.490
You will make a conscious choice

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.385
of choosing the split or the steal ball.

00:46:42.385 --> 00:46:44.912
If you both choose
- He's nodding.

00:46:44.912 --> 00:46:47.970
- The split ball, you
split today's jackpot

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.887
of 100,150 pounds
- She's nodding.

00:46:49.887 --> 00:46:53.785
- And you go home with 50,075 pounds.

00:46:53.785 --> 00:46:56.035
(cheering)

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.569
If one of you splits
and one of you steals,

00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:02.962
whoever chooses the
steal ball will go home

00:47:02.962 --> 00:47:06.677
with 100,150 pounds.
- He's shaking his head.

00:47:06.677 --> 00:47:08.670
- And the person who chooses the

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.903
split ball
- She's looking scared.

00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:12.630
- Goes home with nothing.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:17.630
If you both choose the steal
ball, you go home with nothing.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.020
Okay.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.070
Before I ask you to
choose, I want you to look

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.530
at your two golden balls
and make sure you know

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.300
which is the split ball and
which is the steal ball.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.907
This is very important.

00:47:29.907 --> 00:47:31.580
Make sure you don't show each other.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.850
- All right, now they're looking

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.250
at their balls and checking.

00:47:35.524 --> 00:47:37.823
- Before I ask you to choose,

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.730
I think you have some
talking to do to each other.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.104
- Steven, I just hope there
weren't puppy dog tears

00:47:45.104 --> 00:47:46.840
and they were real tears
and you were genuinely

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.673
gonna split that money.

00:47:47.673 --> 00:47:49.283
- I am going to split this.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.310
50,000.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:55.609
I'm just, that's unbelievable.

00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:58.577
I'm very, very happy
to go home with 50,000.

00:47:58.577 --> 00:48:00.190
- You are genuinely going
to split the money with me?

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.750
- If I stole off you every
- She's almost tearing up.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.940
single person over there would
run over here and lynch me.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.630
- There was no way I could.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.530
I mean everyone who knew me would just

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.600
be disgusted if I stole.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.181
- When people watch this,
they're not gonna believe it.

00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:14.255
- Please, do not--

00:48:14.255 --> 00:48:15.604
- She's reaching out
- Sarah, I can look you

00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:16.518
straight in the eye
- and touching his hand

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:17.580
at this point.
- and tell you

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.413
I am going to split.

00:48:18.413 --> 00:48:19.246
- Promise?

00:48:19.246 --> 00:48:20.079
- I swear, don't you.

00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:21.823
I am going to split.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.730
- Okay.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.520
This is serious money.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.650
- Okay.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:32.650
Now, we're gonna take a vote
on what you think happens.

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:35.159
(laughing)

00:48:37.679 --> 00:48:40.874
All right, there's two
decisions, split or to steal.

00:48:40.874 --> 00:48:43.670
You couldn't see the faces, but probably

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.260
doesn't matter that much.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:50.260
How many of you think
that the guy will split?

00:48:55.431 --> 00:48:56.560
Okay.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.693
How many think the gal will split?

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:05.830
Slightly more, but about 50/50.

00:49:07.067 --> 00:49:09.473
Okay, here's what happens.

00:49:10.586 --> 00:49:12.220
- Here it is.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.960
- Sarah, Steve, choose either the split

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.253
or the steal ball now.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.503
Hold it up.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:24.262
- We're going on the 50 grand
each, I promise you that.

00:49:24.262 --> 00:49:26.929
(intense music)

00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:33.579
- [Host] Split or steal.

00:49:34.476 --> 00:49:35.309
(screaming)

00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:37.476
- So he split, she steals.

00:49:40.749 --> 00:49:41.745
- You never know what's

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:44.110
coming in this game.
- He has his hands like this.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.570
- Congratulations, Sarah.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.140
You have just won
- He's looking kinda mortified

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.063
- 100,150 pounds.

00:49:50.408 --> 00:49:52.533
(cheering)

00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:55.613
Steven, Steven, I'm so sorry.

00:49:57.526 --> 00:49:58.443
- Okay, so.

00:50:00.696 --> 00:50:05.420
This is now the second in
my all star game series,

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.020
show series of papers.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.804
And it's done with one of my Dutch friends

00:50:10.804 --> 00:50:12.968
from the previous paper.

00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:17.850
And so the first question
is, there have been

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.470
literally thousands of papers

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.320
written about the prisoner's dilemma.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.100
None with stakes this big.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.730
What happens if you raise the stakes

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:32.733
to an average of $20,000,

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:37.649
you get amazingly close to the behavior

00:50:37.649 --> 00:50:41.050
in laboratory experiments
for a few dollars.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:44.253
About 45% of the participants split.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.710
Which means

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.350
half of that, about 20 some percent

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.913
of people leave with money.

00:50:55.981 --> 00:50:59.520
Now we study a bunch of things,

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.320
I'm not gonna go into detail because we're

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.490
kind of running out of time.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:09.490
Young men steal more
often which means they are

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.877
either rational or jerks.

00:51:12.877 --> 00:51:15.493
We can't distinguish between those.

00:51:17.819 --> 00:51:22.083
There's a question of what
happens with the stake size.

00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:29.850
The answer is

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.300
cooperation rates are quite a bit higher

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.873
when the stakes are very low.

00:51:37.945 --> 00:51:42.945
And here's my take on this
and it's the same take

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.610
I gave you on the Deal or No Deal,

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:50.610
that these stakes look low
in the context of this game.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:55.618
And so they know that
they could be playing

00:51:55.618 --> 00:51:59.031
for tens of thousands of pounds.

00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:03.610
If they are only paying for
200, they know it's peanuts,

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:04.763
why not cooperate?

00:52:07.645 --> 00:52:10.320
But once you get up to serious money,

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.753
stakes isn't doing much.

00:52:12.753 --> 00:52:17.753
And we get about the 40, 45%.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:27.913
Yeah, so that's what I just said.

00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:33.130
Another question you could ask,

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:35.331
so this game is on television.

00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:37.560
Does that matter?

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.150
And of course the answer must be yes,

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:43.370
but we're not quite sure how it matters.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.537
In the Deal or No Deal, we
actually ran an experiment

00:52:46.537 --> 00:52:50.090
with students at smaller stakes,

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.250
where we had some play the game in front

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.153
of a big audience and some
privately on a computer.

00:52:58.045 --> 00:53:03.045
It turns out, quite
surprisingly at least to me,

00:53:03.467 --> 00:53:08.020
the people in front of the
audience did not take more risk.

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.620
They took a little less.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.480
I would have predicted
the other way around,

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.173
but the difference wasn't huge.

00:53:15.788 --> 00:53:18.800
So one thing we did here
was we looked at whether

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:23.430
people sort of had some reputational stake

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.460
in appearing to be on this.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.465
And we did this by just
categorizing their occupations.

00:53:31.465 --> 00:53:36.465
And here's the result that
reputation only mattered

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:38.841
if the stakes were high.

00:53:38.841 --> 00:53:41.870
And otherwise, it didn't.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.791
The next thing is, we were interested in,

00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:48.270
there's a bunch of
previous rounds that were

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.001
four players originally and it seems like

00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:55.434
in all game shows you
vote to kick people off.

00:53:55.434 --> 00:53:59.710
There's also a lot of, what game theorists

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.200
would call tube talk in this game,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.720
where people announce they
have some of these balls

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.080
with amounts of money that are hidden

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.120
and they announce what they are.

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.394
And what we were interested
in is, if you lie about that,

00:54:14.394 --> 00:54:18.440
does that make you less trustworthy later?

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.007
The answer is no.

00:54:20.007 --> 00:54:22.823
It seems that everybody,

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.820
it's common knowledge that everybody lies

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.200
and everybody thinks that everybody lies.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.170
What often happens is

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:36.070
if a guy is dealt essentially a good hand

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:39.704
and he has the equivalent
of an ace and a king

00:54:39.704 --> 00:54:44.490
in his hidden balls, he will
truthfully say what he has

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.460
and say, see I'm always
gonna tell you the truth.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:51.310
And then in the next round
will lie if it's convenient.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.550
So they all lie and they
all know they would lie

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:55.410
so this doesn't matter.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:59.230
Now the last thing is,

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.990
one way of characterizing
behavior in this game

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.090
would be four types.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:08.403
The first would be, I'll call gameboys.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.610
They always defect.

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:12.374
They learned that in
their game theory class

00:55:12.374 --> 00:55:14.791
and so they always defect.

00:55:14.791 --> 00:55:18.830
Then there could be nice guys
and they always cooperate.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.678
So they always split,
the other ones steal.

00:55:22.678 --> 00:55:27.678
Third guys, I'll call them
conditional tit for tatters.

00:55:29.356 --> 00:55:33.720
They will cooperate with someone who they

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.323
expect to cooperate, and
otherwise they won't.

00:55:39.194 --> 00:55:42.350
Then we have the deep tit for tatters.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:46.640
These are ones who
realize, the game theorists

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:47.970
will know what I'm talking about,

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.313
this is a weak prisoner's dilemma game.

00:55:51.906 --> 00:55:56.306
And they come up with the
following deep realization.

00:55:56.306 --> 00:55:59.763
If the other person is gonna
cooperate, it doesn't matter.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.702
So they might as well cooperate.

00:56:04.702 --> 00:56:08.850
So they'll cooperate and if
the other guy cooperates,

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.230
great, they'll get half.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.925
If the other guys steals, they were not

00:56:11.925 --> 00:56:14.270
gonna get anything anyway,

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.031
and they might as well look good on TV.

00:56:17.031 --> 00:56:22.031
Now notice A, B, and D are all invariant

00:56:23.123 --> 00:56:25.551
to everything else.

00:56:25.551 --> 00:56:29.220
So what we do is we investigate whether

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.493
we can find any evidence for C.

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.630
So is there any evidence that people take

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:40.450
into consideration what they
think the other player might do

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.145
and the evidence essentially is no.

00:56:43.145 --> 00:56:47.640
It turns out the only
significant predictor of whether

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.672
someone will cooperate
is whether they explicity

00:56:50.672 --> 00:56:53.197
promise to cooperate.

00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:57.723
In the clip I played you,
he does and she doesn't.

00:56:58.791 --> 00:57:02.470
He says, "I promise you I will cooperate."

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.277
And then she says something like,

00:57:04.277 --> 00:57:07.617
"If I didn't, everyone
would think I'm a jerk

00:57:07.617 --> 00:57:09.207
"and no one would speak to me."

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.043
So if you had our data, you would predict

00:57:14.043 --> 00:57:16.520
that he would cooperate
and she would steal,

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.102
which that turns out to be right.

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:22.640
There's no version of any
model we could estimate

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.620
in which they seemed to pay attention

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.470
to any of those things.

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.926
So I can't tell you what of
the other things they're doing,

00:57:28.926 --> 00:57:32.120
but they don't seem to be doing

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.263
this conditional cooperation.

00:57:37.107 --> 00:57:40.990
Point one is good economics requires

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:45.810
sensible models of how real people behave.

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:50.810
That's really the radical
departure I had 30 years ago.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.590
You might worry or
wonder, what does this say

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.160
about public policy, but
you have to come back

00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.773
tomorrow to find out.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.021
Thank you very much.

00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:05.438
(applauding)

00:58:09.375 --> 00:58:11.792
(soft music)
