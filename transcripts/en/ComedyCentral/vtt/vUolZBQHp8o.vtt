First up--
keeping up Trump-earances.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.604
Keeping up Trump-earances.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:08.274
(applause and cheering)

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:14.280
Since screeching hobo's
filthy lice-ravaged ball sack

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.649
that's been dragged over a
urine-soaked truck stop toilet

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:17.917
and repeatedly slapped

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.819
with a greasy maggot-covered
slice of pizza,

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.154
pulled out of a flaming Dumpster

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.688
and covered
in mutant deer ticks,

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.924
created in a steroid factory
after the technicians

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.160
were up all night getting buzzed
off cough syrup,

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.229
Donald Trump, uh,
announced his candidacy...

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:33.766
(applause and cheering)

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:36.436
...the Internet can't get enough

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.404
of digging up his embarrassing
old television appearances.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.406
What's the latest Trump clip
to go viral?

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.875
A: Trump awkwardly
playing beach volleyball?

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:46.079
B: Trump awkwardly playing air
guitar at a Cheap Trick concert?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.347
C: Trump awkwardly sacrificing
a goat

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.084
in order to please
the Ancient Dark Gods? Annie.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:55.254
Uh, Trump awkwardly playing air
guitar at a Cheap Trick concert.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.023
Let's find out.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.992
Here it is, Your Moment of Zen.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.394
-WOMAN: Nice serve from Feiffer.
-(Trump groans)

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.795
MAN:
Wow.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.898
(indistinct chatter)

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.101
-Yeah!
-(whistle blowing)

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.404
-Well, his hat looks great.
-(laughter)

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.973
I like that spry teenage boy
who introduced the clip.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.408
Who was that young man?

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.876
LEDERMAN:
He did such a good job.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.611
How could he think
he'd hit a volleyball

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.313
with those little pin hands,
honestly?

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.380
(laughter)

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:24.383
How does he look
worse back then?

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:25.685
METZGER:
That's another good question.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.453
Every girl that, like,
wants to be a gold digger,

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.088
like, these are the guys
you have to (bleep).

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.890
-Like, guys who look like this.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.292
-Just finish grad school.
-HARDWICK: Yeah.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.393
Well...

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.229
Here's a slightly
more dynamic Vine

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.730
complete with
a<i> Top Gun</i> soundtrack

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:40.133

Who needs shirtless
Tom Cruise when you got those

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.255
perky man boobs bouncing up and
down in that saucy polo shirt.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.322
Oh, is it out?

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.459
No, it's (bleep) tucked
all the way in.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:07.758
Way in those jeans.
