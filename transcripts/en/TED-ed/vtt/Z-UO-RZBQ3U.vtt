00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:10.400
You may know that it takes light
a zippy eight minutes

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.123
to reach us from the surface of the Sun,

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:15.056
so how long do you think it takes light

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.453
to travel from the Sun's core
to its surface?

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:21.539
A few seconds or a minute at most?

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.977
Well, oddly enough, the answer
is many thousands of years.

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:27.323
Here's why.

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:32.139
Photons are produced by the nuclear 
reactions deep in the core of our Sun.

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:37.564
As the photons flow out of the core,
they interact with matter and lose energy,

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.962
becoming longer wavelength forms of light.

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.637
They start out as gamma rays in the core,

00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:49.961
but end up as x-rays, ultraviolet
or visible light as they near the surface.

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:54.356
However, that journey
is neither simple nor direct.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:01:01.712
Upon being born, each photon travels at
a speed of 300,000 kilometers per second

00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:06.621
until it collides with a proton
and is diverted in another direction,

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:11.543
acting like a bullet ricocheting off
of every charged particle it strikes.

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:15.387
The question of how far this photon gets
from the center of the Sun

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.251
after each collision

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.332
is known as the random walk problem.

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:22.586
The answer is given by this formula:

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:28.146
distance equals step size times the square
root of the number of steps.

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:31.198
So if you were taking a random walk 
from your front door

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:33.753
with a one meter stride each second,

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:37.835
it would take you a million steps
and eleven days

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:40.505
just to travel one kilometer.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:45.357
So then how long does it take for a photon
generated in the center of the sun

00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:47.313
to reach you?

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.055
We know the mass of the Sun

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:53.094
and can use that to calculate the number
of protons within it.

00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:57.978
Let's assume for a second that all 
the Sun's protons are evenly spread out,

00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:04.854
making the average distance between them
about 1.0 x 10^-10 meters.

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:11.149
To random walk the 690,000 kilometers
from the core to the solar surface

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:17.730
would then require 3.9 x 10^37 steps,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.389
giving a total travel time 
of 400 billion years.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.662
Hmm, that can't be right.

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:28.714
The Sun is only 4.6 billion years old,
so what went wrong?

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.255
Two things:

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:33.047
The Sun isn't actually of uniform density

00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:38.435
and photons will miss quite a few protons
between every collision.

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.079
In actuality, a photon's energy,

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.711
which changes over 
the course of its journey,

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:47.204
determines how likely it is 
to interact with a proton.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.790
On the density question,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.707
our models show that the Sun
has a hot core,

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.063
where the fusion reactions occur.

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:56.553
Surrounding that is the radiative zone,

00:02:56.553 --> 00:03:01.419
followed by the convective zone,
which extends all the way to the surface.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.996
The material in the core 
is much denser than lead,

00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:09.621
while the hot plasma near the surface
is a million times less dense

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:12.382
with a continuum of densities in between.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:15.570
And here's the photon-energy relationship.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.738
For a photon that carries
a small amount of energy,

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.352
a proton is effectively huge,

00:03:21.352 --> 00:03:24.884
and it's much more likely to cause
the photon to ricochet.

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:28.663
And for a high-energy photon,
the opposite is true.

00:03:28.663 --> 00:03:30.695
Protons are effectively tiny.

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:33.522
Photons start off at very high energies

00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:37.001
compared to when they're finally radiated
from the Sun's surface.

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:42.099
Now when we use a computer
and a sophisticated solar interior model

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.464
to calculate the random walk equation 
with these changing quantities,

00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:52.436
it spits out the following number:
170,000 years.

00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:56.732
Future discoveries about the Sun
may refine this number further,

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:59.565
but for now, 
to the best of our understanding,

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.913
the light that's hitting your eyes today

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:07.562
spent 170,000 years pinballing its way
towards the Sun's surface,

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:10.613
plus eight miniscule minutes in space.

00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:15.728
In other words, that photon 
began its journey two ice ages ago,

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:20.434
around the same time when humans
first started wearing clothes.
