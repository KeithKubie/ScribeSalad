00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.939
My tips for aspiring data scientists would be to sort of learn the tools

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.920
for data science very well, very, very well. And of course through several

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.340
curriculum, for example, Udacity from university courses, etc. Moreover, to use

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.380
them in the correct way. You know, one of the analogies I like using is Galileo,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.180
before Galileo, the telescope existed, but he used it to look

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.150
at the stars and it changed the course of history. So it's

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.230
important to know your tools, how to use them, and use them

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.360
to do something innovative and new and different. And that's my advice.
