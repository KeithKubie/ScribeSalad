00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.668
Oh, my goodness.

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:02.970
This dude Brian Nicholera
I went to high school with

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.672
just friended me,
he just moved here.
Oh, my God.

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.975
People from high school
only friend you, like,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.811
after business hours
if they wanna hook up.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.746
Really? I had a huge
crush on him.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.415
Oh, you should
ask him out.
I can't just do that.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.685
Oh, my God,
he "likes" "Roseanne."

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.920
Okay, this is--

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.989
This is your new
sexual partner.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.291
All right,
I'm asking him out.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.628
I'm just gonna do it.
Do it.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.129
This is so great.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:32.900
Like, why are we waiting for
guys to come to us, Ilana?

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.469
Did Amelia Earhart
wait to be

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.904
asked to fly
around the world?

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.872
Definitely not.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.741
She asked.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.676
And then they
said no.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.244
But she still did it.

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.413
And she died, but she,
like, died doing it.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.714
(Abbi)
Exactly.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:49.383
I'm doing it again,
I'm asking someone else out.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.451
This is the Abbi I love
and fell in love with

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:52.786
and I'm obsessed with.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.954
Skylar Cummings-
Conkelmann,

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.189
I used to babysit
for him.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.723
He was adorable.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.425
He's...

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.294
Yeah, he's 20,
that's acceptable.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.862
Troy Megliarino.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.065
He spent a hot sec in jail,
but he lives in South Jersey

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.067
and I know he'd steal a car
and come up for the night.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.570
Chris Wazcyleski,
he was a nude model

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.505
in my life drawing
class and he, like,

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.941
always angled
himself out to me.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.209
Chad Michael Fong.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.878
We met at a hardware store,
he was disgusting.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.880
You know, I'm picking all
white dudes right now.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.316
I must be craving
pink dick.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:23.717
I'm gonna
go with this.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.085
(Abbi)
Okay, who else,
who else?

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.754
Henry Rowdenbush, had a unibrow
all through middle school

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.524
and then he started waxing it
and all of a sudden it was like,

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.392
glasses off, you're
(bleep) gorgeous.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:33.594
It's like
"She's All That."

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.395
I feel like I'm on
coke right now.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.530
P.J. Mallory.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.564
Bobby Cornhauser.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.999
Johnny Fissinger.
Danny McCarrow.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.167
Ryan Long.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.401
Rod White.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:45.105
We are, like, feminist
heroes right now.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.410
So, okay,
that's 36 guys

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.214
that we've been rejected
by and one lady.

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:56.016
Okay, so what, dude?
You know what?

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.384
The Internet
is so '90s.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.220
Let's go find
some guys IRL.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:01.822
You know, you can just
say "in real life."

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.057
It's the same number
of syllables.
