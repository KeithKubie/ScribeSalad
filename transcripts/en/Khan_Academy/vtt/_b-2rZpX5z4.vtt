00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.523
Voiceover:When we first got introduced
to function composition,

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:06.557
we looked at actually
evaluating functions at a point,

00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:08.822
or compositions of functions at a point.

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:11.356
What I wanna do in this video is come up

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:14.814
with expressions that define
a function composition.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.523
So, for example, I wanna figure out,

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:21.694
what is, f of, g of x?

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:26.598
f of, g of x.

00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:28.556
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:31.232
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.494
Well, g of x in this case,
is the input to f of x.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:36.908
So, wherever we see the x

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:38.808
in this definition, that's the input.

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:41.074
So we're going to replace
the input with g of x.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.159
We're going to replace the x with g of x.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.857
So, f of g of x is going to be
equal to the square root of-

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:51.840
Well instead of an x,
we would write a g of x.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.317
g of x, g of x squared.

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:59.588
g of x squared, minus one.

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:01.273
Now what is g of x equal to?

00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:03.138
Well, g of x is this
thing right over here.

00:01:03.138 --> 00:01:06.673
So this is going to be
equal to the square root of,

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:12.824
g of x, is x over 1 plus x.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:15.339
We're going to square that.

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:18.506
We're going to square that, minus 1.

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:22.272
So f of g of x, is also a function of x.

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:24.522
So f of g of x is a square root of,

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:27.104
and we could write this as x
squared over 1 plus x squared,

00:01:27.104 --> 00:01:28.856
but we could just leave it like this.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.772
It's equal to the square
root of this whole thing,

00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:34.722
x over 1 plus x, squared, minus one.

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:36.621
Now let's go the other way round.

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:41.687
What is g of f of x?

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:43.556
What is g of f of x?

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:45.839
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.166
and try to think about it on your own.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:52.737
Well, f of x is now the input into g of x.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.295
So everywhere we see the x here,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.183
we'll replace it with f of x.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.515
So this is going to be equal to,

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:03.650
this is going to be
equal to, f of x, over-

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.259
Let me do it in the same color,

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.166
so you can appreciate it better.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.981
f of x over, one plus f of x.

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.282
One plus f of x.

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:16.049
And what's that equal to?

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.932
Well, f of x is equal to the square root,

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.964
of x squared minus one.

00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:24.450
x squared minus one.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.214
So it's gonna be that over
1, plus the square root.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:35.981
One plus the square root
of x squared minus one.

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.049
So this is a composition f of
g of x, you get this thing.

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.054
This is g of f of x,
where you get this thing.

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:46.568
And to be clear, these are
very different expressions.

00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:49.269
So typically, you want
the composition one way.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.939
This isn't gonna be the
same as the composition

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.240
the other way, unless the functions

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.920
are designed in a fairly special way.
