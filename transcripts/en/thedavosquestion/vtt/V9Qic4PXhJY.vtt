00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.799
&gt;&gt;There will be growth in the global economy
in 2009. Even in the United States, I think

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.780
the second half you're going to start to see
little signs of recovery. The global economy

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.480
was smashed as was the U.S. economy by the
financial crisis. If the new administation

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.110
gets a few things right or stops making mistakes
by the law of averages, we are due for some

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.730
good decisions from Washington. This thing
will start,basic strengths will start to come

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.140
through. For example, one of the things the
Obama Administration get rid of is this,this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.520
strange accounting rule called mark to market.
Which has devastated bank balance sheets.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.260
A bank makes a loan now it knows it's probably
going to have to take a hit to it's capital

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.281
because even if the principle is being paid,
interest is being paid. Banks if they have

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.511
to sell the loan tomorrow, which they won't,
but if regulators come in and say "If you

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:58.140
had to sell the loan tomorrow what price would
you get?" They'd have to take a write-down

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.739
on it. Which is crazy. If we had that rule
in the early 90's when we had a banking crisis

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.820
we would have destroyed most commercial banks
in the United States. So get rid of mark-to-market

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.791
and that way banks can rebuild their balance
sheets. And the other thing that I think the

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.439
administration will do- it's right up their
alleys-government activism. Is that the housing

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.740
market revive by having either the Federal
Reserve or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac go to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.569
banks and say we'll buy your mortgages. Any
mortgages you write with a fixed interest

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.850
rate of 4.5-5% long-term. Rates are low now
for mortgages but banks aren't making the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.529
loans. But if they know that they can sell
the mortgages to Fannie and Freddie or to

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:41.529
the Federal Reserve, they'll start writing
the loans again and get the housing market

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:46.890
moving. So a couple of basic things like that
would go a long ways and get things moving.
