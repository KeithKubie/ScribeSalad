00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.660
You've had an argument with the children.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.940
Later, you'll have to go to work and bite your tongue around your boss.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.560
Now, you're in the bath,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.040
reading the newspaper.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.980
There's a big story on the front page:

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.580
a chef in California

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.140
on becoming convinced that his wife was having an affair

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.660
dismembered her and boiled her body parts for four days.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.840
Only a few bits of her skull were left,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.620
and it was from these fragments that she was later identified.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.260
Then, you read, that a couple living near Luton

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.440
claiming to offer financial advice

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.320
befriended and then poisoned a sequence of elderly clients.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.120
Another story informs you about a woman in Spain

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.460
who stabbed her neighbor thirteen times.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.260
For months, the woman's dog had been barking during the day while she was at work.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.920
She was a dental hygenist.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.680
The neighbor complained repeatedly

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.860
left threatening notes

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.760
had called the police on multiple occasions

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.740
and once, kicked the dog in the street.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.240
From a distance

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.920
it hardly makes sense at all

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.960
that we should  find these things a source of pleasure.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.160
Such stories deal with obviously horrible, horrendous things.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.220
But strangly it's reasuring

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.480
and (even though we don't relish saying so)

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.640
enjoyable to hear about them.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.600
We perhaps worry that by taking pleasure in reading of such stories

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.100
we're endorsing the crimes themselves.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.180
But the truth is

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.120
we're not actively egging on criminals; we're not glad these things happened.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.320
On the contrary

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.180
it's the very fact that they're so clearly wrong that generates our moments of satisfaction.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.020
One source of our pleasure

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.800
is that in many ways, these people look so normal:

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.960
the Californian chef reminds you of a cheeky boy in the classroom when you were a kid,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.240
the woman with a dog is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.060
like someone you just saw at the supermarket.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.980
We mostly enconter the edited versions of other people

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.620
while we are continually exposed

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.180
to the weirder unedited version of ourselves.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.900
The unfair comparison

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.280
means we inevitably feel much stranger

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680
than we really are.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.260
There's that odd sexual thing that excites you,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.120
or maybe you feel like crying when you get stuck in traffic,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.700
in groups you have the strange sense that everyone is normal except you,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.460
at work everyone feels the need to laugh at a remark which, in all honesty

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.540
strikes you as entirely unamusing.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.320
This is where the criminals we see in the media come in.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.400
They redraw the scale of strangeness

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.100
by being exposed as fifty times more strange

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.280
they re-position our own, lonely peculiarities

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.080
squarely back in the realm

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500
of the humdrum and the average.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.400
It has absolutely never ever crossed your mind to cook your partner.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.420
In the realm of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.340
poisoning and stabbing your neighbors

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.720
you are a snow white innocent.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.140
This is surely one of the hidden reasons

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.420
why middle age men turn in such numbers

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.760
to reading books about Adolf Hitler.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100
His catastrophic levels of insane, rage, delusion, destructiveness and cruelty

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.120
make, pretty much, everyone else

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.200
look quite lovely by comparison.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.540
One may have spent the evening drinking beer

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.680
made three vaguely insulting remarks and omitted to brush one's teeth before coming to bed.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.000
But, by the standards of Berchtesgaden

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.560
you are revealed as really rather nice.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.780
It's not like you haven't had your share of challenges,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.620
you too have been deeply hurt by betrayal,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.580
you too have wished for easy money and luxury possessions,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.120
you too have had sour disputes with the neighbors.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.340
But by comparison

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.480
you have reacted with grace.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.760
You felt furious

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.500
suffered from envy and had periods of money worries.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.660
But you never did what those guys from the media did.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.460
You absorbed the pain

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.800
rather than committed some horrific crime.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.800
And now,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.380
their villainy is pleasing

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.620
because it reveals your quiet moral heroism.
