00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.850
chemistry occurs either in the gas phase
or in the solution but in this case the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860
or in the solution but in this case the
 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.500

between a solid phase a metal face and a

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980
between a solid phase a metal face and a
 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.990
between a solid phase a metal face and a
gas phase and it's something in between

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000
gas phase and it's something in between
 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.319
gas phase and it's something in between
the solid the liquid phase chemistry and

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329
the solid the liquid phase chemistry and
 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.179
the solid the liquid phase chemistry and

the gas phase chemistry at some aspects
 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.450
the gas phase chemistry at some aspects
of both and it's very easy from the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460
of both and it's very easy from the
 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.310
of both and it's very easy from the
point of view that compared to the solid

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320
point of view that compared to the solid
 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.240

phase liquid phase chemistry because

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
phase liquid phase chemistry because
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.010
phase liquid phase chemistry because
it's not so complex but it's more

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020
it's not so complex but it's more
 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.020
it's not so complex but it's more
complex than the guests I saw it coming

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030
complex than the guests I saw it coming
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.120
complex than the guests I saw it coming
from a complexity of the liquid phase to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130
from a complexity of the liquid phase to
 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.210
from a complexity of the liquid phase to
the relative simpleness in the gas phase

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220
the relative simpleness in the gas phase
 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.370
the relative simpleness in the gas phase
this is something intermediate and we

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
this is something intermediate and we
 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.840
this is something intermediate and we
can understand things there and we can

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850
can understand things there and we can
 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.270
can understand things there and we can
make predictions of what's going on in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280
make predictions of what's going on in
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520
make predictions of what's going on in
the liquid phase safe to say so this is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530
the liquid phase safe to say so this is
 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.679
the liquid phase safe to say so this is
a fundamental sort of area of physical

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689
a fundamental sort of area of physical
 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.330
a fundamental sort of area of physical
chemistry but it's one that has a wide

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340
chemistry but it's one that has a wide
 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.950
chemistry but it's one that has a wide
range of applications could you tell us

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960
range of applications could you tell us
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.469
range of applications could you tell us
a few examples please yeah I mean long

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479
a few examples please yeah I mean long
 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630

before professor Arthur got his Nobel

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640
before professor Arthur got his Nobel
 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.570
before professor Arthur got his Nobel
Prize we actually utilized it for

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580
Prize we actually utilized it for
 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.380
Prize we actually utilized it for
example in the production of ammonia and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
example in the production of ammonia and
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.350
example in the production of ammonia and
ammonia is the main ingredient as a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360
ammonia is the main ingredient as a
 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.980
ammonia is the main ingredient as a
fertilizer and I mean in the beginning

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990
fertilizer and I mean in the beginning
 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.060
fertilizer and I mean in the beginning
of the last century we started our to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070
of the last century we started our to
 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.920
of the last century we started our to
completely processes one was an obedient

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930
completely processes one was an obedient
 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.130
completely processes one was an obedient
process and one was a dreamer process at

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140
process and one was a dreamer process at
 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.619
process and one was a dreamer process at
the Harbor Bosch process and that is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629
the Harbor Bosch process and that is
 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.530
the Harbor Bosch process and that is
refined by trial and error so it's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540
refined by trial and error so it's
 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.360
refined by trial and error so it's
probably not possible to improve it very

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370
probably not possible to improve it very
 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.819
probably not possible to improve it very
much today by the findings of Professor

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829
much today by the findings of Professor
 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.459
much today by the findings of Professor
Ethel but he has laid the foundations

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469
Ethel but he has laid the foundations
 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.030
Ethel but he has laid the foundations
they to say

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
they to say
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.530
they to say
landscape is showing what what's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
landscape is showing what what's
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.000
landscape is showing what what's
actually going wrong we're not knowing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
actually going wrong we're not knowing
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.470
actually going wrong we're not knowing
what was going on before but now we

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
what was going on before but now we
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.119
what was going on before but now we
knows what's going on either in this

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129
knows what's going on either in this
 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.849
knows what's going on either in this
type of systems so we can understand

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859
type of systems so we can understand
 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.130
type of systems so we can understand
process like how how rust forms an iron

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
process like how how rust forms an iron
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.949
process like how how rust forms an iron
and how catalysts work and leaving the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
and how catalysts work and leaving the
 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.110
and how catalysts work and leaving the
ozone layer that works function exactly

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
ozone layer that works function exactly
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.059
ozone layer that works function exactly
all these kind of very important

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069
all these kind of very important
 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.890
all these kind of very important
chemical process we can understand today

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
chemical process we can understand today
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.199
chemical process we can understand today
and maybe tomorrow we can control them

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
and maybe tomorrow we can control them
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.190
and maybe tomorrow we can control them
and to say stop the rust to better than

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200
and to say stop the rust to better than
 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.970
and to say stop the rust to better than
we do today and we can make maybe even

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980
we do today and we can make maybe even
 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.240
we do today and we can make maybe even
better catalytic cleaning or exhaust

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
better catalytic cleaning or exhaust
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.780
better catalytic cleaning or exhaust
from the cars and say well and I mean

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
from the cars and say well and I mean
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.030
from the cars and say well and I mean
very many processes in chemistry

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
very many processes in chemistry
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.909
very many processes in chemistry
actually occurs at surface especially in

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919
actually occurs at surface especially in
 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.390
actually occurs at surface especially in
the heavy chemical industry Suffolk acid

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400
the heavy chemical industry Suffolk acid
 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.429
the heavy chemical industry Suffolk acid
is produced that way and many other

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439
is produced that way and many other
 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.589
is produced that way and many other
processes so it's very important

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599
processes so it's very important
 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.750
processes so it's very important
actually so what's professor rattles

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
actually so what's professor rattles
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.369
actually so what's professor rattles
contribution means the field of surface

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069
chemistry what he has done is that he I
 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.420
chemistry what he has done is that he I
said to say thoroughly investigated some

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
said to say thoroughly investigated some
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.039
said to say thoroughly investigated some
of these fundamental processes and

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049
of these fundamental processes and
 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.129
of these fundamental processes and
clarified in detail how the atoms are

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139
clarified in detail how the atoms are
 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.890
clarified in detail how the atoms are
moving what was actually happening and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
moving what was actually happening and
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.580
moving what was actually happening and
clarify the energetic landscape out

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
clarify the energetic landscape out
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.020
clarify the energetic landscape out
how's it to say how much energy is

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030
how's it to say how much energy is
 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.670
how's it to say how much energy is
required for coming from this step to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680
required for coming from this step to
 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.559
required for coming from this step to
the next step and say what so we know

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569
the next step and say what so we know
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.890
the next step and say what so we know
now in detail exactly what is happening

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
now in detail exactly what is happening
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.849
now in detail exactly what is happening
and that is to say a foundation for

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859
and that is to say a foundation for
 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.469
and that is to say a foundation for
making improvements I mean when you know

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479
making improvements I mean when you know
 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.180
making improvements I mean when you know
what things look like then it's much

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190
what things look like then it's much
 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.729
what things look like then it's much
easier to improve them then if you has

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739
easier to improve them then if you has
 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.050
easier to improve them then if you has
been done before us do it by trial and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060
been done before us do it by trial and
 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.539
been done before us do it by trial and
error so he's really helped shape the

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549
error so he's really helped shape the
 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.610
error so he's really helped shape the
field here shaped the failures and I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620
field here shaped the failures and I
 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.509
field here shaped the failures and I
mean it's a field which is today very
