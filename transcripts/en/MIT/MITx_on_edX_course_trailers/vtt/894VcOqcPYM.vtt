00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.996
 

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:20.130
ESTHER DUFLO: This course is about the
lives of the world's poor and the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.900
problems that they face.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.790
It's about both understanding why the
poor make the choices they make, what

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.680
are the constraints that they face in
their everyday life, and what all of

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.530
this tells us about what could
possibly be done to

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.810
improve those lives.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.290
We will carve out all of the
aspects of people's lives.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.350
ABHIJIT VINAYAK BANERJEE: We'll also
carve out the key existing research in

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.320
fighting poverty.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.930
ESTHER DUFLO: Food, hunger, health,
education, how people decide about how

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.100
many children to have and how
to invest in those children.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.700
It is hard to imagine a more
important problem.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.340
SPEAKER 1: It's so cool to receive all
this information and points of view

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.450
from people and the students
from all over the world.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.220
SPEAKER 2: I've learned that development
economics is for everybody

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.160
and anybody.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
SPEAKER 3: It's just been fascinating
to hear the stories of people who

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.410
actually live and work in the areas that
we're talking about in many of

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.310
the studies.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.330
SPEAKER 4: It's been really fascinating
for us because after

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.450
watching each lecture series, we are
able to walk outside and live what we

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.170
have learned.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.910
We can ask questions and do our own
local research, like testing theories

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.710
and examples discussed.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.210
The knowledge that we have gained will
make our service immensely more

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.440
impactful because we now have a deeper
understanding of global poverty.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.230
SPEAKER 5: We thank you for having done
an incredible job making quality

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.916
education accessible in even the most
remote corners of the world.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:38.290
ABHIJIT VINAYAK BANERJEE: I hope many
of you will take this course.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.540
ESTHER DUFLO: And become
part of the solution.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:56.725
