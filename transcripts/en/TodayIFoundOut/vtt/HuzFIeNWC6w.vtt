00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:17.880
As we discussed in our article on what happens
to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.009
a person who is accidentally declared dead
and the process in getting declared alive

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:31.859
again, tens of thousands of people die each
year across the globe by a simple clerical

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.370
error, at least as far as their respective
governments are concerned.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:45.269
However, what we didn’t mention is that
many thousands more people are more purposefully

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.230
declared “dead in absentia” each year.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.629
As you’ve probably surmised from the term
used to describe these deaths, being declared

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.949
dead in absentia occurs after a person goes
missing.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.940
When this happens, their will is probated
and estate settled.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.630
But what happens if they aren’t dead at
all and turn up later, perhaps after helping

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.740
a tempestuous, but lovable bunch of vertically
challenged individuals reclaim their homeland

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.020
from the clutches of the Chiefest and Greatest
of Calamities?

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.320
How do they go about getting their stuff back,
or do they even have any rights to it at all

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
anymore?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110
To begin with, how does one go about getting
declared “dead in absentia” in the first

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.110
place?

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.040
After all, in most countries adults are perfectly
within their rights to uproot and go start

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.340
a new life somewhere else without telling
anyone, or even go on a lengthy adventure

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.119
with a wizened grey wanderer.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.360
Before we jump into the meat of all this,
just a quick note, as this particular topic

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.930
deals with estate distribution and the like,
we’ll focus primarily on adults who disappear,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.100
though many elements of what we’re about
to cover does also technically apply to children.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.290
As with many things, there’s no uniform,
worldwide policy concerning what exact set

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.369
of circumstances need occur or even how long
a person needs to be missing to be declared

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.619
dead in absentia, though there are many similarities
in the process from country to country.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.119
In general, the courts will have to be directly
involved in these cases and they will almost

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.390
always err towards presuming the person is
actually alive.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.000
However, if the person has been missing for
a specific length of time, with no one who

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.950
would otherwise normally hear from them having
contact, and a diligent (unsuccessful) search

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.080
has been conducted to find them, the courts
will ultimately determine that the person

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.560
indeed must be deceased, even if there is
no direct, hard evidence that they are, in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
fact, dead.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
As to the search, to dispel a popular notion
frequently perpetuated by Hollywood, a person

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.550
does not have to be missing for more than
24 hours before authorities in most countries

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.550
will act.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.250
In fact, while almost all missing person cases
are resolved of their own accord in relatively

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.050
short order, in rare more legitimate missing
person cases, every hour that passes reduces

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.470
the probability that said missing person will
be found and nobody is more aware of this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.440
than the authorities who deal with this stuff
every day.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.010
Thus, they often actually recommend reporting
missing people as soon as the person is determined

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.230
to be missing.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.041
That said, given there is only so much manpower
available at any given time and, again, most

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:12.240
missing person cases resolve themselves of
their own accord rather quickly, the appropriate

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.600
authorities do have to prioritize what cases
they take on immediately.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.370
Thus, rather than strictly going by how much
time has passed before an investigation is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.150
opened, they’ll weight a number of factors
including the probability that the person

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.320
is truly missing, and not just off doing something
without telling anyone.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.150
If the disappearance is highly unusual given
the person’s normal daily habits and no

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.290
good explanation can be thought up for the
disappearance, this will bump the case up

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.480
in the priority list as a potential legitimate
missing person case.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.180
Just as important in getting the authorities
to look into the matter immediately is the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.120
probability that the person missing might
be in some sort of peril given the known facts

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.291
of the case.

00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:54.990
Once an investigation is started, if nobody
in the person’s life seems to have heard

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.210
from them or knows where they are, authorities
usually resort to monitoring the person’s

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.490
digitally trackable life, for example where
applicable monitoring financial accounts,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.120
cell phone, email, social media accounts,
etc., as well as checking if the person has

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.320
attempted to go through any border check points.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.950
As you might imagine, disappearing without
a trace in the modern world has become increasingly

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.739
difficult, meaning these days authorities
are much more frequently able to locate the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.930
person if they are indeed still alive, compared
to even just a few decades ago.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.719
It also helps that many people who are choosing
to disappear from their previous lives are

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:31.210
not trying to hide from authorities, so the
use of personal bank accounts and the like

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.520
tends to continue.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.069
If they are found, the authorities will typically
respect the person’s right to disappear

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.320
from a former life, unless there are legal
reasons not to, such as someone running from

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.159
financial obligations or the like.

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.030
As Miranda Napier of the Missing Persons Bureau
notes,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.430
If someone has elected to leave their friends
and family… and we find them and they express

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.610
this wish, then we would close the missing
report and advise those making it that they

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.550
were safe and well, but we would not be able
to tell them where they were.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.010
Speaking of financial obligations, when trying
to decide if some missing person might actually

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.930
be dead, authorities will also analyze whether
the person missing might have had motive to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.439
go missing in the first place.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.469
For example, if they were having extreme financial
difficulties, were in legal trouble, having

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.620
relationship or family problems, etc.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.580
As they move along in the process, authorities
will also usually check with local coroners

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.060
to see if any unidentified bodies have been
found that match the description of the missing

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060
person.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.690
But what about if all of this turns up nothing?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.469
Next, it becomes a waiting game.

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.940
In regards to the length of time needed, as
noted, this varies, but a commonly observed

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.599
rule of thumb is that the person has to have
been missing for at least 7 years, unless

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.009
circumstances of their disappearance seem
to indicate imminent peril, thus a high probability

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.719
that the person is, in fact, deceased.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.210
For example, many bodies couldn’t be identified
or recovered when the World Trade Center towers

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.409
collapsed on 9/11, so people who worked there
who went missing directly after would have

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.960
an extremely high probability of being declared
dead in absentia almost immediately should

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.439
their loved ones request such of the courts.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.169
Few cases are so cut and dry, however, and
in all cases you generally need to get a judge

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.330
to agree with you, with the burden of proof
lying with the people trying to get someone

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.039
declared dead earlier than the required number
of years.

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.860
The judge in these cases will then determine
if, given the evidence, the probability has

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.210
shifted from presuming the person is alive
to it being reasonable to presume they are

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.969
dead, again usually erring on the side of
assuming the person is still alive.

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:35.080
As former assistant attorney general of Illinois,
Floyd Perkins notes, “Before seven years,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.919
anyone who wants you declared legally dead
has to offer evidence that you’re not alive.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.520
But after you’ve been missing seven years,
anyone who wants you declared alive has to

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.759
offer evidence that you’re not dead.”

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.710
As for more specifics, in the United States
the authority to declare someone dead in absentia

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.550
falls to the states themselves, each of which
have their own specific rules.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.279
For example, while most states go with the
seven year general rule, states like Georgia

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.279
and Minnesota instead go with four years.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.879
Moving around to the other side of the world,
in Italy, it actually takes 20 years for someone

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.490
to be declared dead in absentia, barring compelling
evidence to decree this sooner.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.479
In Poland, the time span is 10 years.

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.439
In Russia, it’s 5.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.960
Like in many states in the U.S. and many other
parts of the world, in the UK, there is a

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.409
7 year waiting period before the authorities
can make this call.

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.999
It should be noted here that until the authorities
declare the person dead, the missing person’s

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:33.770
financial affairs are basically in a state
of bureaucratic limbo.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.809
To illustrate the issues here, consider the
case of Vicki Derrick, a woman whose husband

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:40.509
Vinny went missing in 2003.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:45.610
After an investigation to locate Vinny turned
up nothing, he was presumed missing by the

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.610
police.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.379
The problem was that in the eyes of the law
Vicki’s husband was still alive and, thus,

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:56.150
she was still married to him with all obligations
that implies, still shared a mortgage on a

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.050
house she could no longer afford with just
a single income, but could also not sell because

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.110
her husband wasn’t around to put his signature
on the necessary paperwork to sell it.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.880
Furthermore, Vickie couldn’t claim her husband’s
life insurance policy nor access his personal

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.849
accounts to settle his various financial obligations
until the courts finally decided enough time

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.710
had passed to declared him dead in 2011.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.990
In a bizarre twist, Vinny’s body was found
just two months after he was finally declared

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.280
dead in absentia.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.120
As Vicki would later recount,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.199
There was a huge sense of relief, which I
felt guilty about.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.129
But at the same time I had already grieved.

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:33.010
Deep down I think I knew the day he disappeared
he wasn’t coming back.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:36.770
It was so out of character that something
terrible must have happened for him not to

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.770
come home.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:43.979
It turns out that in the UK alone, while about
98% of the 250,000 or so people that go missing

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:49.850
each year turn up within a week of their disappearance,
about 1% of these people go missing for at

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.380
least a year.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.450
In a little over half of these 1% cases, the
person is ultimately either found dead or

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.130
eventually declared dead in absentia, but
the other half, over 1,000 missing people

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.430
annually, turn up alive in the end.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.720
As a direct result of cases like these, the
government passed the Guardianship (Missing

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.880
Persons) Act in 2017 which, 90 days after
the disappearance of the individual, allows

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.560
the loved ones of a missing person to assume
some degree of control over their affairs.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.590
Thanks to this, many of the problems people
like Vickie faced can be avoided, mitigating

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.220
the potential damage to a missing person’s
financial situation as well as providing a

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.510
degree of help in cutting through a lot of
red tape for their loved ones during a tumultuous

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.510
time.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:37.440
No such nationwide laws exist in the United
States and, thus, for example if any benefits

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.530
would otherwise have been paid, the beneficiaries
involved usually simply have to wait the required

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.760
period for the death in absentia to be declared
before they can begin receiving them, assuming

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.710
they can’t offer a sufficient body of evidence
to get the person declared dead early.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.060
Alright, so that’s how you could potentially
be declared dead and have your estate pass

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.640
to others without actually being dead.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.140
So let’s now talk about your stuff.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:07.250
In a nutshell, a person declared dead in absentia
is, by the letter of the law, dead.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.070
Shocker, I know.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.440
As such, the actual process of probating their
will is functionally identical to a more straightforward

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.020
death in most countries.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.930
Likewise, death benefits will similarly be
paid out in a timely manner, though some insurers

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.770
may require a person making a claim in these
cases to jump through a few additional hoops,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.120
such as providing evidence a good faith effort
was made to locate the person before death

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.850
in absentia was declared.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.623
With this information being necessary to declare
a person dead in absentia anyway in most cases,

00:10:35.623 --> 00:10:39.710
this usually is a pretty easy hurdle to jump
over at that stage of the game.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.960
But let’s say after all this happens the
“dead” person turns up very much alive

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.650
and wants all their stuff back from the clutches
of the Sackville Baggins.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.100
What happens then?

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.240
This is a far more thorny legal issue and
there’s little universal precedent in law

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.730
to say what exactly should happen, though
in the vast majority the court cases we could

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.390
found, the heirs typically weren’t required
to give anything back.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.420
In the US especially what happens in this
unlikely scenario varies slightly from state

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.150
to state, with some dictating that the person
has no right to any of their stuff back and

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.010
others adding caveats, including Pennsylvania
who deals with the matter perhaps most sensibly

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.620
of any region we looked at.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.650
Another example of a state with a caveat is
Nevada, where a missing person has up to a

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.080
year after legal proceedings to divide up
the estate have begun to veto the whole thing

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.550
and get their money and property back, despite
having been previously declared dead in absentia.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.650
If a missing person turns up after this grace
period, they will no longer have any claim

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.010
to their former assets.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.470
To give the missing person as much of a chance
as possible to prevent this from happening

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.170
if they are indeed still alive, a person laying
claim to the estate to the missing person

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.380
in this case must “give notice by publication”.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.820
This mostly just means doing something like
putting an ad in a local paper or the like

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.040
that they are going to make a claim on the
estate, which is sure to be read by no one

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.080
but the intern who processed the notice, but
at least gives the appearance of accomplishing

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.700
something, so is a bureaucrat’s dream law.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.110
Moving on to Pennsylvania, the state law very
sensibly requires anyone laying claim to a

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:11.010
person’s estate who has been declared dead
in absentia to secure a refunding bond before

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.710
assets will be distributed.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:17.420
As Pennsylvania-based attorney Patti Spencer
states, “The person entitled, a spouse or

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.480
kid, has to post a refunding bond, before
the property is distributed.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.860
If the person comes back… and someone else
has her property, they have to give it back,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.280
and if they can’t, then this bonding company
has to make it right.”

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.360
This is something that happened relatively
recently as 2013 when a woman named Brenda

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.280
Heist returned after her presumed death in
2003.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.620
She’d actually been living on the street
for the last decade and hadn’t even been

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.160
aware she had been declared dead.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.150
UK law, as with many other countries we looked
at, seems to more or less handle things about

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.520
the same as the general U.S. court systems.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.010
If the person has been declared dead in absentia
and sufficient time has passed, which is usually

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.050
needed to get declared dead in absentia in
the first place, the courts will usually rule

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.110
that the heirs aren’t required to give anything
back, though, of course, any heirs are free

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.250
to do so at their own discretion.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.420
The courts simply usually won’t require
them to do so if a lawsuit is raised over

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.420
the matter, though, as with all things in
life, their are exceptions.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.300
But what about life insurance and various
death benefits?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.710
As you might imagine, the insurance companies
will almost always seek to get their money

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.010
back, unless the cost to do so exceeds the
amount paid out.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.720
But from whom do they try to get the money
back from?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.620
While, as with so much of what we’ve just
discussed it’s not universally true, if

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.100
a missing person’s loved ones have them
declared dead in absentia and then claim against

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.650
their life insurance policy in good faith
(and thus aren’t involved in any fraud here),

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.930
they won’t generally be sued for the money
back, or, even if they are, the courts are

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.370
unlikely to side with the insurance company
in these cases.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.391
The life insurance companies tend to have
much better luck going after the person who

00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:44.640
was incorrectly declared dead in absentia.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.550
After all, the missing person knows they are
still alive and usually went missing on purpose,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.070
setting off the chain of events that required
the insurance company to eventually pay out

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.410
on a policy when they otherwise shouldn’t
have been obligated if the missing person

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.410
had just told someone they weren’t dead.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.460
For example, consider the case of John Burney
who disappeared, in this case in a way that

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.200
made it seem very likely he was dead, in 1976
after getting in some rather hot water owing

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.630
to mismanagement of his company, causing it
to go bankrupt.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.660
About six years later, in 1982, he was found
to be alive when he decided to return home

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.210
to visit his father who had been seriously
injured.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.070
Although Burney’s insurance company initially
filed suit against the beneficiaries of his

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.920
life insurance policy – specifically his
wife and business partners – the courts

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.160
ruled that they didn’t have to return the
money.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.090
Burney, however, who didn’t receive a dime
of that insurance money, did, to the tune

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:35.000
of $470,000 (about $1.2 million today).

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.500
So to sum up, if you do happen to mysterious
disappear and then turn up again after being

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.830
declared dead, chances are your stuff will
be gone unless your beneficiaries are feeling

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:48.380
particularly generous and choose on their
own to give it back.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.540
And should they have cashed in on a life insurance
policy you had, assuming they really thought

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.550
you were dead when they did it, you are likely
going to be the one on the hook to pay that

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.140
back, even if you didn’t benefit from it
in any way.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.720
To add insult to injury, particularly if you
live in the United States, prepare yourself

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.281
for quite the lengthy ordeal in getting yourself
declared alive again in the first place, with

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:11.490
a number of rather severe consequences while
you try to prove to everyone that you are,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.080
in fact, not dead.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.000
Thus, unfortunately for the owner of a certain
estate along Bagshot Row, given his disappearance

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.960
most definitely was out of the ordinary for
his normal behavioral patterns and, beyond

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.050
that, he was last seen, at least in the film
adaptation, noting he was “going on an adventure”

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.520
(always a dodgy business), in either case
those seeking his estate seem perfectly within

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.630
their rights to have had him declared dead
in absentia.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.580
Assuming Shire law did not have a grace period
for legal right to recover an estate after

00:15:38.580 --> 00:16:21.280
such

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:53.090
a declaration, like Nevada,
