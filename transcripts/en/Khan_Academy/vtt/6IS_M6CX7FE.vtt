00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.295
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video,

00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:02.536
is think a little bit more about

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.470
how populations can be regulated.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.467
And broadly speaking, we can think of

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:10.500
the regulation of populations
it two different categories.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.849
There's the regulation
dependent on density,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.016
so density, density dependent
regulation, density dependent.

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.302
And then, there's the type of regulation

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:24.906
that isn't dependent on density,

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:28.928
so we could call that density
independent regulation.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.928
Independent, independent regulation.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.457
So first let's think about
density dependent regulation.

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:41.542
Let me draw a little chart
here, to help us visualize that.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.580
So let's say that that
axis is the population.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.383
I'll say P for population.

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:49.092
And let's say this axis is time.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.342
So, T for time.

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:54.449
In previous videos we
talked about a population,

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.339
and I like to use the example of rabbits,

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.347
how it could grow exponentially.

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.609
So if it's just growing a
certain percent every month,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.202
that population will grow exponentially,

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.765
but we can't expect that that
will just happen forever,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.701
if rabbits just kept
growing exponentially,

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.918
it wouldn't take long for them to

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:12.487
cover the surface of the earth,

00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:14.278
and and then fill the universe,

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:16.627
if in some way they weren't
limited by anything.

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:18.877
But we know that they
are limited by things.

00:01:18.877 --> 00:01:22.609
And so the environment
only has a certain amount

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.274
of carrying capacity, and
we'll think a little bit

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:28.019
about this carrying capacity in a second,

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:31.164
and what's determining
the carrying capacity.

00:01:31.164 --> 00:01:35.331
And so as the density of the
rabbits in a certain area

00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:40.288
get higher and higher
and higher, well then

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:43.702
the density dependent,
use a different color,

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:47.700
the density dependent
factors start to play,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.075
the density dependent limiting factors.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:51.686
And what could be some of these

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:53.504
density dependent limiting factors that

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:54.967
keep the population from going

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.521
dramatically above the carrying capacity?

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:59.651
Well the most obvious one could be

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:02.901
competition for resources, competition,

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.372
competition, for, resources.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.633
And the one that might

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:13.530
come to mind most clearly
is food resources.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.321
So this is actually a picture
of Australia in the mid 1800s.

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.202
And they had a bunny population problem.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.306
The rabbits were first introduced

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:24.337
in order to have a little bit of hunting,

00:02:24.337 --> 00:02:27.348
but then they reproduced like rabbits.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.217
And it was estimated that at some point

00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:31.250
you had over a billion rabbits

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.896
that had populated the
country, and that was,

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:37.421
you might say, how cute,
but it was a huge problem.

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:41.588
(stammering) The were
eating all of the farmable,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.458
they were eating crops.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.730
They were eating the grass that

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.846
other types of livestock would graze on.

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:53.890
So it was a huge infestation of rabbits.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.517
And so you can imagine one
competition for resources

00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:57.831
is just the grass itself.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:01.082
In this picture you can
see the land is barren.

00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:02.777
Maybe this happened because the rabbits

00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:05.067
ate all of the vegetation here.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:08.431
So, competition for resources,
one type of resource

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:12.598
could be food, another type
of resource could be water,

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:15.308
there might only be so much water

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:17.799
to support organisms of a certain kind.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.764
You know here, we often
talk about animals,

00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:23.855
but it could be plants,
or it could be bacteria,

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:26.538
it could be all sorts of organisms
that we're talking about.

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:28.659
And if we're talking about plants,

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.172
we could think about light.

00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:33.645
You could say, well what limits
having an infinite number

00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:35.148
of plants in a certain area?

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.155
Well, water will limit,
the nutrients in the soil

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.350
will limit, but also access to light.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.515
You've seen pictures of a
dense canopy in a rain forest,

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.569
and the plants are trying to seek out

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.663
whatever gap in the canopy they can find,

00:03:47.663 --> 00:03:51.580
so that they can get some
access to that light.

00:03:53.714 --> 00:03:55.227
Now there's other examples,

00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:57.364
and this wouldn't apply
as much to, say, plants,

00:03:57.364 --> 00:03:59.028
but the idea of shelter.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:03.025
This might apply to humans, or to other

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.922
types of animals that maybe
need shelter in order to hide,

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:08.903
or a place to reproduce, or whatever else.

00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:12.384
So at some point, if the
population density gets too high

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.902
in a certain region, then these things

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:18.945
are going to limit how dense
the population can get,

00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:21.270
or frankly just what the
population actually is,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.976
and so that would lead, once again

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.021
we talked about this in a previous video,

00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.888
to this logistic curve right
over here, where we just,

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:30.833
we don't, we just start
approaching the carrying capacity,

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.652
and it is possible that you could even

00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:35.229
go above the carrying capacity
and then you're at kinda

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.452
this very unstable situation,
and then something happens

00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:39.222
and you go below it, then you go above it,

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:42.077
and then below it, and
then something like that.

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:45.038
But what are other
density dependent factors

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:46.704
that we could think about?

00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:49.873
Well, another thing is,
if you were a predator,

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:53.400
when, say, the rabbits become this dense,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.875
it's much easier to
start to pick them off,

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.693
it's much easier to get your lunch.

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:00.616
And so, predatory factors,

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:03.892
or we could say predation, predation.

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:06.463
Once a population gets large
enough and dense enough,

00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:08.957
it might be the predators who can say,

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:12.902
hey, we can start, it's way
easier for us to get our lunch.

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:15.418
Now the other thing, it might
be a little less obvious,

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:17.945
but when you have a
high density population,

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:20.542
and there's examples of this
in medieval times in Europe,

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.651
and even in modern times
today with human populations,

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:25.781
but this happens with all organisms,

00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:28.870
is that when you become
a dense population,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.573
there's more interaction.

00:05:30.573 --> 00:05:31.978
There's more contact, there's more

00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:34.700
sharing of resources like water, and so

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.950
disease and parasites becomes an issue.

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:43.052
So let me write this down,
disease, disease, and parasites

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.480
can spread much easier, and

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.546
they're much more likely to
start limiting the population.

00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:52.458
The thing that always comes
to my mind is the plague

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:56.025
in medieval times, where
it was very easy to spread

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:58.581
from one human to the next, or

00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.938
frankly from rats to
humans, and whatever else.

00:06:00.938 --> 00:06:03.630
Now the other thing, and this is maybe

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.402
somewhat related to everything else

00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:08.516
we've talked about, is waste accumulation.

00:06:08.516 --> 00:06:10.433
So let me write this right over here.

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:11.701
Waste.

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:14.106
If you have a really
high density population,

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:17.408
and the waste is just everywhere,
it could poison the water,

00:06:17.408 --> 00:06:20.044
it might poison sources of food,

00:06:20.044 --> 00:06:23.139
it might help the spread
of disease and parasites.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.441
And once again, all of
these things help define

00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:27.758
what the carrying capacity,

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:31.676
how dense can a population
get in a certain region.

00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:32.874
Now you might say, well maybe they don't

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:34.333
have to stay in a region, maybe they can

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.040
go and explore other
places, and that's possible,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.632
and that's been the story for

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.215
many different types of species.

00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:43.761
Lemmings are famous for, when
their population gets dense

00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:45.847
in a certain area, groups of them

00:06:45.847 --> 00:06:48.974
start just running to start
exploring other areas.

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:50.033
Sometimes running in directions

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:53.244
that are not that good for them.

00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:55.761
So all of these are
density dependent factors.

00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:58.736
And a lot of these, as
we just talked about,

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:01.037
you could think of them as biotic factors.

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:03.995
They're related to other
living things around.

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:07.475
The density independent
factors tend to be a-biotic.

00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:10.599
They tend to be not
related to living things.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.715
So the most common
density independent factor

00:07:13.715 --> 00:07:15.465
is natural disasters.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:19.035
So, natural, natural disaster.

00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.650
We have a picture here of a forest fire.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.954
The deer population here
might not be in any way

00:07:24.954 --> 00:07:28.135
close to their carrying
capacity, but despite that,

00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:30.916
the forest fire maybe might
kill off a lot of the deer.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:34.301
Other natural disasters,
you could have a flood,

00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:36.161
you could have a tsunami, you could have

00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.694
a meteorite coming from outer space.

00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:41.895
That happened to the dinosaurs.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.927
To just knock out huge populations.

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:47.276
And so, density independent factors,

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.155
you could have the
population growing and it's,

00:07:49.155 --> 00:07:51.291
and at just some random point it just,

00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.111
there's some density independent factor,

00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:55.978
there's a forest fire, there's
a flood, or something else.

00:07:55.978 --> 00:07:58.180
And then maybe the
population grows from there,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.782
and eventually gets closer
to its carrying capacity,

00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:03.410
who knows, but the density
independent factors, once again,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.812
it's not related to where
we are on this curve.

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:08.582
It could happen at any
time, and to some degree

00:08:08.582 --> 00:08:11.129
they feel a little bit more random.

00:08:11.129 --> 00:08:13.603
Now, with all of this talk
about carrying capacity

00:08:13.603 --> 00:08:16.655
and the different density
dependent factors,

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:19.040
you might be thinking well,
what about human beings?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.790
We are for sure a species, and so

00:08:24.096 --> 00:08:26.835
the same ideas apply to us.

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:29.567
And so is there a
natural carrying capacity

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:32.678
for the environments that we are in?

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:36.962
And there's a famous philosopher
scientist Thomas Malthus,

00:08:36.962 --> 00:08:38.815
and I have a whole video on him, but

00:08:38.815 --> 00:08:42.725
he hypothesized that humanity
had a very serious problem.

00:08:42.725 --> 00:08:46.890
Because our populations
were growing exponentially,

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.077
so this is population, this is time,

00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:50.426
and so he said, look, there's just

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:53.621
a natural carrying
capacity for human beings.

00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:57.445
And as human beings just
kept growing exponentially,

00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:00.445
We would hit that carrying capacity,

00:09:02.164 --> 00:09:04.688
and the term for that carrying capacity,

00:09:04.688 --> 00:09:07.946
in the case of human beings,
that Thomas Malthus set up,

00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:11.129
and there's a whole video on
this, is the Malthusian limit.

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:14.549
And he hypothesized
that once you crossed it

00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:16.952
or approached it, there
would be all sorts of crises,

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.726
that once you're at
this carrying capacity,

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:20.184
there might not be enough food, and then

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:24.438
there might be a famine,
or we go across it

00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:27.021
and then disease spreads a lot more.

00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:28.856
And so he was just applying these

00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:32.234
ideas of density dependent
factors to human populations

00:09:32.234 --> 00:09:35.829
and said hey, this is not going
to be pleasant for humanity.

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:38.806
Now what's been interesting,
is that humanity

00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:42.479
has found ways repeatedly, of pushing up

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:45.064
the carrying capacity for us as a species.

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:48.597
We've been able to do it,
frankly through technology.

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:52.146
Frankly finding ways to grow food

00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:55.770
in denser and denser ways,
ways to stave off disease,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.937
ways to get rid of waste
and sewage and all of that,

00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:04.444
so it's an interesting
philosophical question to say,

00:10:04.444 --> 00:10:06.270
is there ever gonna be a point where

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.119
human being just hits this Malthusian,

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:12.451
where human society hits
this Malthusian limit,

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.604
or are we always going
to be able to fend it off

00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:18.369
by just better and better
technology, or maybe even

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:20.657
just regulation of the population itself,

00:10:20.657 --> 00:10:23.321
so that we don't, you know,
where we just have whatever,

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:26.528
birth control, or family
planning, or whatever it might be,

00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:30.695
so that we are less likely
to hit some eventual limit.
