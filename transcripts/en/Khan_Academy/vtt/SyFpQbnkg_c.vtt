00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:02.408
- [Voiceover] If x is equal to 20,

00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:04.797
so this right over here
is a 20 degree angle

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:07.547
and this one also is a 20 degree angle,

00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:09.876
and y is equal to 30,

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.351
so this right over here, we'll
do this a different color,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:15.009
this right over here is,

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.378
I'm having trouble switching colors,

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:18.369
that's a 30 degree angle.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.863
In the figure above, what is
the value of z right over here?

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:23.618
This is a little bit strange at first

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:27.042
because it feels like
we might be able to use

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:32.042
triangles somehow, but this
whole shape is not a triangle.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:34.684
But, if we could construct a triangle or

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:36.260
we know two of the angles of the triangle,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.318
then we know we can always
figure out the third

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:39.948
because we know the sum
of the interior angles

00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:41.998
of a triangle add up to 180.

00:00:41.998 --> 00:00:44.529
So, can we construct a triangle where

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:46.525
we know two of the angles?

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:47.768
So, let's think about it.

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:49.943
So, this is, we know this is 30 degrees.

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:50.918
We know this is 20 degrees.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.637
Can we construct a
triangle where these are

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:54.744
two of the angles of that triangle?

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:56.968
Well, what if we,

00:00:57.398 --> 00:00:59.811
what if we extend this side

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:01.807
to go all the way over here?

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.390
Now we have, we know two of
the angles of a triangle.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.478
Now, we should be able to figure out

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:08.431
this third angle right over here

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:10.143
and what is a third angle going to be?

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:13.617
Well, 30 degrees plus
this angle plus 20 degrees

00:01:13.617 --> 00:01:14.773
is going to be 180,

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.111
or another way to think about it,

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.598
this is going to be 180 degrees,

00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:21.292
minus 30, minus 20

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:24.711
or this is going to be
180 degrees minus 50.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.744
So, this is going to be 130 degrees.

00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:32.222
Now, if we know that, we can figure out

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:34.153
what this angle's going to be because

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:35.820
these two angles are supplementary.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.196
They are going to add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.923
When you go all the way
around, you've essentially,

00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:42.042
you've gone all the way
or you go halfway around

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.648
the circle or you can kinda say

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:46.241
the two rays of the angle form a line.

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:49.167
And so, what plus 130 is 180.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.444
Well, 180 minus 130 is 50 degrees.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:54.774
So, this is 50 degrees, what do we know,

00:01:54.774 --> 00:01:59.252
what do we know about this angle

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.992
right over here?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.949
Well, 50 plus 20 plus
this is going to be 180.

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:07.634
So, another way of thinking about it,

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:10.133
this is going to be 180 minus 50,

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:14.583
minus 20 or 180 minus,
what is this, minus 70.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:17.630
So, this is going to be 110 degrees.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.256
Well, if that's 110 degrees,

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:21.227
now we're really cutting
to the chase 'cause this,

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:24.599
that angle, that angle is supplementary

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.601
with the angle that has measure z degrees.

00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:33.601
So, we know z plus 110, z plus 110

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.961
is going to be equal to 180

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.697
or subtract 110 from both sides.

00:02:39.697 --> 00:02:44.144
You get z is equal to 70

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:45.790
and we're done.
