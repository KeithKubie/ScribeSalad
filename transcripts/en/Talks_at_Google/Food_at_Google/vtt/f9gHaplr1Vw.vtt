[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.920
SPEAKER: You guys have a pretty
impressive resume between you,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.720
six James Beard awards;
multiple, incredibly successful

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.180
cookbooks; some of the
most interesting and unique

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.730
restaurants, mostly in Philly.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.509
How is this experience with
this cookbook different for you?

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.050
STEVEN COOK: Well,
our first cookbook

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
is called "Zahav," which is
the name of our restaurant

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.220
that just turned 10 this year.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.690
SPEAKER: Oh, congratulations.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.090
STEVEN COOK: Yeah,
in dog years, it's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.140
like a 70-year-old
restaurant, I think.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.930
SPEAKER: Especially
when it's called

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.941
the most influential, important
restaurant, food and wine,

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:43.440
right?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.310
STEVEN COOK: People say a
lot of nice things about it.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.270
SPEAKER: A lot of
nice things about it.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.840
STEVEN COOK: So
that cookbook, which

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.470
was our first, was really a
look at the food of Israel,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.054
but through the lens
of Mike as a chef

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.928
and what we're doing in
eastern Pennsylvania,

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.990
with the products that
are available to us

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.350
and the influences
of where we are.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.920
And "Israeli Soul" was really
based on an eight-day trip

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770
that we took to Israel.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.710
We 82 meals in those eight
days and, somehow, both

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.075
managed to lose weight doing it.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:13.950
SPEAKER: So you need to
talk to me about that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.900
later because that sounds
like a perfect plan.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
STEVEN COOK: Kind of magical.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.350
So that was really an
attempt to, I think,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.380
go deeper into the
roots of the cuisine,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
because Israel encompasses
over 100 different cultures

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.670
that many have been there
for thousands of years

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.560
and many have come
within the last 70 years.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.880
So it's really a complicated
complex food scene

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.490
to unpack, which is what
we try to do in this book.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.670
SPEAKER: And it's also
approachable for those of us

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.640
who are just cooking
at home, yeah?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.340
We wanted to, basically,
take everybody over there,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.160
immerse them in the
food, and then process it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.860
in my tiny, little,
crappy apartment

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
with like ill-equipped kitchen.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.927
SPEAKER: I think we
all thank you for that.

00:01:57.927 --> 00:01:59.010
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I know.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.385
So I was living in this one
bedroom apartment at the time

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:04.070
and the deal was that if we
could make it in that kitchen,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.780
we could make it into a book.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.260
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.729
SPEAKER: What are you
going to make for us today?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.919
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
So we are going

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.043
to make a couple of things.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.909
We're going to make
Steve's patented--

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.200
you should have just done this.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.980
STEVEN COOK: I should
have patented it.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.440
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
It should have

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.090
been years, not in the book.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.180
It's a five minute hummus.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.220
Steve has four children
so to be able to make

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.380
five minute hummus,
very important

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.080
for the well-being
of the whole family.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.340
So five-minute hummus.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.350
We're going to make
matbucha, which

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.390
is like a North African sort
of condiment salad situation.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.250
And we're going to make
zucchini schnitzel as well.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.610
And then we're going
to put it all together.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.110
Yeah.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.290
SPEAKER: Sounds delicious.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.373
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I hope.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:46.170
Yeah, you certainly
talked us up a lot.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.970
I hope that we don't blow it.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.580
SPEAKER: I think actually
I underscored everything

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.050
just slightly.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.930
I think you guys are
doing it yourself.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.471
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Thank you so much.

00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.920
So really quickly, we're
going to make the matbucha.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.295
And we've already started that
because this process takes

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:03.330
a while to cook, all right.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.900
This is not like
competition TV cooking.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.920
A lot of this stuff,
most of the stuff,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.500
is actually from the
diaspora, and it's

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.990
like very grandmotherly.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.420
OK, so it's not
about showing off.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.040
It's really about soulful
stewing, very vegetable-heavy.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.510
And this is a fantastic
example of that.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.420
This is sort of a
condiment or it can

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.340
be served as a salad course.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.260
When you sit down and
you get salad in Israel,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.770
it's not like a Caesar salad
with black and mahi-mahi.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.120
It's like seven or 12 tiny
little dishes that usually

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.270
represent an entire
part of the world,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.340
or multiple parts of the world.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.130
And they're room temperature,
and sometimes they're cooked,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.790
or sometimes they're raw
but very heavily seasoned.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.964
So this is olive
oil, garlic, onion,

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:56.880
and peppers that we've
cooked for a very, very

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.340
long time at a very low
heat with olive oil.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.919
We're going to add
some salt to this.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.460
STEVEN COOK: Mike,
I have a question.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.880
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yes, Steve.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.296
STEVEN COOK: So
this is originally

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:06.660
from North Africa, right?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.040
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yes.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.570
STEVEN COOK: But basically,
almost every Israeli restaurant

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.445
you walk into, you'll
find this on the table.

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:14.370
So how does something that's
from one part of the world

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.754
become part of the food
cuisine of an entire country?

00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:22.170
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Well, I
mean, I think that's the thing,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.135
because Israel is, at
one point, super young.

00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:26.010
It's seven years old.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.420
But also the culture of Israel,
or the diaspora, that thousands

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.150
of years have sort of brought
back all their cooking

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.380
traditions.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.070
And the gastronomy is to
one tiny little place,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.930
everything is this
sort of mishmash.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.110
And you see it in
very quick, real time.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.720
I moved back to Israel.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.819
I was born there, but I
moved back in the '80s,

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.860
and there was a huge wave
of Ethiopian immigrants

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.140
that nobody knew
about up until then.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.880
It was the sort of
like a lost tribe.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.540
They came back and now there's
heavy use of fenugreek, teff.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.530
And Ethiopian cuisine is
part of the conversation now.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.950
So in the '50s, the
Moroccans, the Libyans,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.480
and the Algerians--

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.220
not yet the
Tunisians, I believe--

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.240
moved back.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.312
They brought with them matbucha,
which is served, like I said,

00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:19.270
it could be a condiment,
it could be breakfast,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.880
it could be anything.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.600
Basically, every
kebab shop in Israel

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.970
serves this as like,
"ketchup" or salsa.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.630
And, now, also when you sit
down in a restaurant in Israel

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.550
and you're presented
with a spicy condiment,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.480
it used to be harissa, but
the Yemenite Jews brought back

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.380
zhug, which is also part of it.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:47.990
So it's impossible to avoid this
tapestry of culture in Israel.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.760
It just happens.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.430
It just happens
sort of organically.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.930
Yeah?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.295
Did that answer your question.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:55.670
STEVEN COOK: I'm
satisfied, yeah.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.870
Thanks.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.010
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: You just
wrote an Israeli cookbook,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.676
you should know.

00:05:57.676 --> 00:05:59.385
We're going to add
tomatoes to this

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:00.760
and then we're
going to cook this

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.600
down for a very, very long time,
probably like an hour or so.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.670
What we want to do is get all
the water out of the tomatoes.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.330
It'll get really, really sweet.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.870
STEVEN COOK: The hands-on time
here is, what, 10 minutes?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.900
And then you let it go.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.900
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.220
You'll let it go on a
very low temperature

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.310
for a very long time.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.780
And actually, what I'll do
is put my oven at a very low

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.550
temperature, like 200 degrees.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.260
I'll start it at night
and then I'll just

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.070
put it in a cast iron,
or something like that,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.090
very lightly covered.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.250
And just rock it out
overnight, and when

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.490
you wake up in the morning,
you're like, is that coffee?

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.900
Is that my matbucha?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.460
I don't know.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.760
Also, if you've noticed, I've
been adding salt in layers.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.910
I don't like just adding
all my seasoning at the end.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.020
I like to add.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.440
Whenever you add a new
component to this pot,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.260
I want it to taste
excellent by itself.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.510
That's kind of the rule,
I think, with braising

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:59.500
or with complex saucing
or sauce cooking,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.485
is every time you add a new
aromatic or another component,

00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:04.360
you want to treat it as
though you were going

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.890
to eat this thing by yourself.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.840
So I always add a
little bit of salt.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.060
If you're big fans
of spicy, or if you

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.430
like coriander or paprika,
also add it in layers.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.340
The onions and the
peppers get seasoned.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.870
Tomatoes get seasoned.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.940
Cook it down and then
you finish at the end.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.470
That way, the flavor's developed
and it's not just one note.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.030
Also, we're going to get started
with our zucchini schnitzel.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.890
Have you guys all
had schnitzel before?

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.950
Steve, can you
tell them something

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.680
anecdotal about
schnitzel in Israel?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.471
STEVEN COOK: I can.

00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:36.790
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Please.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.210
STEVEN COOK: I can.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.001
I mean, when Jews first
started coming back

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.120
to Israel around the
turn of the 19th century,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.480
it was primarily German
Jews at that time, that wave

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.390
of immigration, so that
schnitzel was a dish that they

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.340
brought over to Israel.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.090
They very used to veal, which
wasn't really available when

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.790
they got to Palestine.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.920
And so chickens were a
lot cheaper and a lot more

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.840
widely available, so
chicken schnitzel sort of

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.370
became the unofficial
tourist food of Israel.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.580
Many of us encountered it for
the first time on a tour bus

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.350
and it wasn't very good.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.090
And it's gotten a bad
rap over the years,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.510
but it's kind of
making a comeback.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.000
I mean, it's basically
fried chicken,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.570
so it's inherently good.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.465
But it became really
popular in Israel

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:22.840
in the early days
of the country,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.119
because it was a super poor
country that was very isolated,

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:27.160
from a trade perspective.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.080
People didn't have
ovens their home,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.049
so they'd take a pounded out
piece of chicken and bread it

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.070
and fry it in a pan.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.386
It was cheap.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.010
It looked like a lot
of food because it

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.600
was pounded out really thin.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.419
And it was something that
they actually used to teach.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.290
As each successive wave of
immigrants came to Israel,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.330
they actually would
have cooking classes

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.079
and teach everybody
how to make schnitzel.

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:51.430
So something that started
out as European and German

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.430
became widely, widely
adopted in the country.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.880
And you encounter it in museum
cafeterias and tour groups.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.462
And then there is an
awesome place right

00:09:01.462 --> 00:09:02.920
on the beach in
Tel Aviv that makes

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.710
these incredible schnitzel
sandwiches that, I don't know,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.870
taste so good after you
come out of the water.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.530
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.210
And also, you can eat
them like, standing up

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.043
in your bathing suit
with no shirt on, which

00:09:12.043 --> 00:09:14.050
is a pretty amazing thing.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.340
But also, it's sort of
become this iconic dish

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.100
because everybody that's
ever visited Israel usually

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.960
ends up eating schnitzel.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.630
And it's become almost highbrow.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.324
Now, hipsters have
started making schnitzels.

00:09:27.324 --> 00:09:29.740
What do they call them, like
schnitzel arias, or something

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.290
like that.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.770
And all they make are
these schnitzel sandwiches

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.660
either in pita or in baguettes.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.210
And they use the zhug,
the [? harees, ?]

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.330
all these different
condiments to make what are,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.445
essentially, fried
chicken sandwiches.

00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:44.110
STEVEN COOK: Yeah.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.600
SPEAKER: So what led you
to zucchini schnitzel?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.760
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I just feel
like zucchini is delicious.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.280
I feel like we always
have it in our CSA.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.280
And I'm like, I can't do this
anymore with you right now,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.020
schnitzel, or with zucchini.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.770
And I feel like you need
something kind of exciting,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.750
and it's sort of a star.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.010
If you treat it like
a piece of protein,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.630
it's something really
special, and nobody's also

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.380
really doing it.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.660
I mean, people do eggplant like
this, sort of like Milanese.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.140
So what is cool about this is
we're adding a Yemenite soup

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.330
spice mix called [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.640
And it's like turmeric,
cumin, and black pepper.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.810
And what we're also doing
is using beaten eggs to,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.570
obviously, adhere the
motza meal to crust it.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.990
But it acts as a brine or a
marinade, which is awesome

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.470
because normally, when we grew
up going to culinary school,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.530
European chefs would say,
you don't ever do this.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.270
Because you don't
add salt. You don't

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.370
let things sit in an
egg wash for too long.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.010
And the beautiful thing
about this cuisine

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.140
is that it
contradicts everything

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.090
that my culinary school
teachers taught me.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.350
And it's usually grandmothers
that are doing it,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.934
which I love.

00:10:57.934 --> 00:10:59.850
STEVEN COOK: So you're
not flowering it first.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.720
You're going right into the egg?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.500
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: I'm
going right in there,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.760
and that's the other thing.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.599
I'm glad that you
brought that up, Steve.

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:07.140
STEVEN COOK: Yeah,
I was almost going

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.644
to stop you because
I also thought

00:11:08.644 --> 00:11:09.810
that's not the way to do it.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.040
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.610
Yeah, so that's the thing.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.060
If you guys have ever
made any sort of Milanese.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.890
It's like flour, egg
wash, breadcrumbs.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.260
That's the standard
thing that we're taught.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.290
Flour doesn't actually
need to be there.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.780
This will adhere really
nicely, and you'll

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.525
get something really
nice and crisp.

00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:28.650
The worst part about cutting
into something breaded

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.350
is when you slice it and
all the breading falls off.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.440
And you're like,
all right, well, I

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.790
guess I need a sharper knife.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.280
No, don't listen to the
European pastry chefs that

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.990
taught you how to cook food.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.180
You just simply batter
it and marinate it,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.010
and then we're going to bread
it in motza meal and fry it.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.610
And this works really
well with chicken.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.930
This works well with veal.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.670
This works well with eggplant.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.860
This works well
with green tomatoes.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.320
And it's super simple.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.710
I'm using this amazing-- do you
guys want to pass that around?

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.940
It's so good.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.810
You usually add it to chicken
soup or veal shank soup.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.810
You can add, really,
whatever spice blend you want

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.260
and it will act as a
brine and really permeate

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.350
the zucchini or the meat.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.224
STEVEN COOK: But don't
get it on your fingers

00:12:13.224 --> 00:12:14.855
because it will stain,
or your clothes.

00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:17.230
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah, if
you're wearing a white shirt.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.229
STEVEN COOK: Be careful.

00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:20.490
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
It'll be festive.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.620
So Steve, you want to
show them your hummus?

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.370
STEVEN COOK: Yeah.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.630
So we have a recipe for hummus
in our first cookbook, which

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.030
is really based on what we
do with the restaurants.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.347
And it's super easy but
it requires a little bit

00:12:32.347 --> 00:12:33.180
of advance planning.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.690
You have to soak the
chickpeas overnight.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.090
You have to cook the chickpeas.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.700
So we really wanted to
come up with a little bit

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.820
of a shortcut, because we feel
like there's really no reason

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.729
to buy hummus from
the grocery store

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:46.770
because you can make
something that's super cheap

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.280
and you can make
it really quickly.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.040
The idea came to us-- we
were doing our six minute

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.180
abs one day and we were like, we
could do hummus in five minutes

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.920
and we would be rich.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.850
So we're going to do it
all in the food processor.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.940
When we're done,
for the most part,

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.410
this is the only thing
you have to clean.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.140
And it was really based on--

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.690
so the great folks at
Google have actually

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.420
done the dirty work of
taking tahini out of a jar

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.400
and emulsifying it in this bowl.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.890
But if you've ever
opened a jar of tahini,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.170
or natural peanut butter,
or anything like that,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.617
you know that
there's oil on top.

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:25.450
There's like, some nice
stuff in the middle,

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.570
and then a bit of
sludge on the bottom.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.440
And a lot of hummus recipes
will call for like, let's say,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.760
six ounces of that.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.950
So you have to get
in there, mix it up,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.690
and then you're left with
like nine ounces of stuff

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.430
that maybe you'll use, or maybe
it'll just sit there forever.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.144
And it makes a mess, and
this is not water soluble,

00:13:45.144 --> 00:13:47.060
so cleaning up after
this is really difficult.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.880
So we tried to build the recipe.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.520
This is literally one--

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.770
I think it's a 14
ounce jar of tahini

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.205
that you can literally just
dump the whole thing in.

00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:57.720
You don't have to mix it up.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.942
Just dump it in and
recycle the jar.

00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:01.650
SPEAKER: I'm sold on
this recipe already.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.483
STEVEN COOK: So this
is all the ingredients.

00:14:03.483 --> 00:14:06.030
We're going to start,
counterintuitively--

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.330
Israeli and Palestinian
stock almost is really not

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.700
super big on garlic and lemon.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.420
It's really mostly
about the tahini.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.836
So we're just going
to, literally,

00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:18.782
put a couple of small
slices of garlic.

00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:20.990
The thing with raw garlic
is it kind of will radiate.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.216
It will continue to
radiate through the dish.

00:14:25.216 --> 00:14:27.090
And then it calls for
the juice of one lemon.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.210
These are a little bit small
so I'll probably use 1 and 1/2.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.580
And I like to put the lemon
right on top of the garlic

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.380
because it can kind of
mellow it out a little bit

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.171
and keep it from being--
it almost cooks it

00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:40.140
a little bit, keeps it from
being super aggressive.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.350
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.790
There's nothing worse
than eating hummus

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.290
and then two days
later you're like,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.229
I don't know why I still
have that taste in my mouth.

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:55.020
STEVEN COOK: And then
the only other things

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.000
we're really going to
add, besides the tahini

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and the chickpeas, is
a little bit of cumin

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.150
and a little bit of salt.
And the other nice thing

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.300
is we're using canned
chickpeas, which a lot of people

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:15.390
might say is an inferior
product to dried,

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.890
soaked, cooked chickpeas.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.777
But we actually
feel the opposite,

00:15:19.777 --> 00:15:22.110
because when you buy dried
chickpeas in a grocery store,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.901
they could have been
sitting in a warehouse

00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:25.590
somewhere for two
years or two months.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.660
And you got to cook
them and they could take

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.490
45 minutes or eight hours or--

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:29.780
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Whenever.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.790
STEVEN COOK: --every
once in a while.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.300
Right.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.425
Every once in a while, you
get a batch of chickpeas

00:15:33.425 --> 00:15:36.120
that literally never cooks.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.330
So just adding some cumin
and some salt. And then

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.001
we're going to put the
whole bowl of this in.

00:15:48.339 --> 00:15:50.880
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: You guys can
see this matbucha cooking out

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.380
right now.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.450
It sort of resembles
a tomato sauce.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.130
And honestly, this with
ziti would be fantastic.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.420
But we're going to let this
cook it down and down and down.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.390
We're going to add a little
bit of olive oil to it

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.972
and really let the flavors
concentrate and bind.

00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:08.430
STEVEN COOK: All right so we're
going to just buzz this up.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.040
So the secret, or the key,
to the hummus that we make

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.060
is we like to make a really
super light and whipped tahini

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.931
sauce as the base.

00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:26.930
The last thing we're going
out is the chickpeas.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.430
So when you get
to that final step

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.930
before you add the
chickpeas, you're

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.390
going to have a beautiful,
well-seasoned sauce that

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.900
goes with anything from
zucchini schnitzel to fish

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.980
to roasted meat.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.880
It's super versatile.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.106
We use it at the restaurant
for almost everything.

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:44.480
But in order to get it whipped,
we're going to add water.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.900
And the thing about
tahini is it's mostly fat.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.670
And when you mix fat and water,
sometimes it's problematic.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.347
So the trick is
to use ice water,

00:16:53.347 --> 00:16:55.680
and I'm going to show you,
when you first add the water,

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.910
it's going to look
really gross and broken.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.470
SPEAKER: A technical
term, gross.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.470
STEVEN COOK: I don't know,
it's like the closest

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.989
we get to magic is to
watch that come back

00:17:05.989 --> 00:17:08.030
and turn into this beautiful,
pale, creamy sauce.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.560
So I'm going to
start and then I'll

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.268
stop to show you guys
what it looks like.

00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:20.730
All right.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.735
SPEAKER: Wow, Steve,
that's really disgusting.

00:17:24.735 --> 00:17:26.619
STEVEN COOK: Can
you guys see that?

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:30.150
SPEAKER: Looks gross.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.739
STEVEN COOK: You just got to
have a little bit of faith.

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:34.780
SPEAKER: Ready for magic.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.321
Let's see it.

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:37.050
STEVEN COOK: Here
we go, all right.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.466
And it takes quite
a bit of water,

00:17:38.466 --> 00:17:40.410
so don't be scared
to keep adding.

00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:04.430
SPEAKER: Oh my god, magic.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.430
STEVEN COOK: I'm going
to scrape the sides down,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.930
but you can see how beautiful
and creamy and pale that is.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.026
And I'll taste it for us.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.170
And that's a great sauce for
a million different things.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.690
SPEAKER: Yeah, that's the base
for almost every single sauce

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.720
that we serve [INAUDIBLE] and
certainly all the meat since we

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.440
don't mix milk and meat at all.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.490
So if you're
barbecuing lamb chops,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.445
you add pistachios and
mint to that, amazing.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.430
STEVEN COOK: You were saying?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.310
SPEAKER: I'll wait.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.170
We like ground walnuts
and [? hertha ?]

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.307
peppers for roasted
fish as well.

00:18:52.307 --> 00:18:53.140
Really, really good.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.710
And because it's been minimal,
minimal garlic and a little bit

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.110
of lemon, you're not going
to have a huge fermentation

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.610
problem.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.470
So it can sit in the
fridge for a couple days.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.150
People even freeze it,
which we don't recommend,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.340
but it does work.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.620
You just have to put it
back into the Robot Coupe

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.090
to spin up so it lightens.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:10.881
STEVEN COOK: Right.

00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:12.760
The heat from the motor
actually your friend.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.344
If you take cold hummus out of
the refrigerator, it seizes up.

00:19:15.344 --> 00:19:17.551
You put it back in here,
maybe a little bit of water,

00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:19.470
and just, literally, the
warmth from the motor

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.344
is going to bring it
back to room temperature

00:19:21.344 --> 00:19:23.085
and make it taste
like you just made it.

00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:24.460
How's the frying
going over here?

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.720
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Frying is
going really, really well.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.020
So we have a little canola and
grape seed, just medium heat.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.160
And I don't want to go super
hot because the zucchini is raw.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.166
So if it's too close to high,
the exterior and the crust

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.790
will cook and the
interior will be raw,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.620
and you don't want al
dente fried zucchini.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.500
That's super junior varsity.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.000
So we're just going
to cook this up,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.300
and if you've got a little
extra garlic, can I use this?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.930
STEVEN COOK: Yeah, have that.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.263
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Thanks, dude.

00:19:51.263 --> 00:19:54.170
Boom, throw it in,
which is really good.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.660
We've got some za'tar over here.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.470
And when we flip it, we're going
to kind of crust it with that

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.250
as well.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.060
STEVEN COOK: What's za'tar?

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.726
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Za'tar is two things.

00:20:02.726 --> 00:20:08.470
Za'tar is an herb that grows
wild that is like if margarine

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.210
and the savory were to have
a child, it would be that.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.640
Za'tar what most people think
of when they think of za'tar, is

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.390
a spice blend, that has got,
depending on where you are

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.080
in the Middle East,
sumac, sesame seeds,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.502
and some of the dried herb.

00:20:24.502 --> 00:20:26.710
Everybody makes it a little
bit different over there.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.450
And we actually got a
farmer in Lansdowne, like,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.100
30 minutes outside
of Philadelphia,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.970
to grow za'tar for
us, which is weird.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.010
He doesn't know where
to put the apostrophe.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.247
He's like Z,
apostrophe, A-T-A-R.

00:20:39.247 --> 00:20:41.080
And they're like, I got
za'tar herb for you.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.121
And I'm like, I don't even
understand what you're

00:20:43.121 --> 00:20:45.250
saying right now, but bring it.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.020
But it has a two month growing
season in Pennsylvania.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.520
He grows lemon verbena for
us, too, which is fantastic.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.650
He walks through the dining
room of the restaurant

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.679
and it smells like
something special.

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.720
You can see also, too, so
this matbucha is really

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.780
coming down well.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.490
And I like to make this, cook it
out, and let it show overnight,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.140
and cold, so it gets mature
sort of tasting and settles.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.090
But it would be really
good just like this.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.506
We're going to
flip this guy over.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:20.890
So nice.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.430
And this is an entrée.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.960
This is a sandwich filler.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.160
This is like, anything.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.860
And zucchini is one of
those things that is just

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.720
really, oftentimes, underused.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.500
I don't know.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.480
People grill zucchini with
other things as like, filler,

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.730
and it doesn't need to be.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.230
That's it.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.830
We're almost done.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.900
I mean, should we
clean these guys up?

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.483
STEVEN COOK: I'll
go ahead and finish.

00:21:47.483 --> 00:21:51.010
So this is two cans
of chickpeas drained.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.650
Use your favorite brand of
canned chickpeas and they

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.360
go right n.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.992
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Or tuna.

00:21:57.992 --> 00:21:59.908
STEVEN COOK: We don't
know what's in that can.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.740
And I mean, you're literally
just going to turn this on.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.219
I think you have to sing the
alphabet in Hebrew like twice

00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:09.010
and then it's done.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.460
Stop a little bit and
make sure you scrape down

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.960
the sides once or twice.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.060
SPEAKER: The color is beautiful.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.726
STEVEN COOK: Yeah,
it's really gorgeous.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.262
AUDIENCE: You're not singing.

00:22:32.262 --> 00:22:33.470
STEVEN COOK: In my head I am.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.570
SPEAKER: It's
internal monologue.

00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:47.990
STEVEN COOK: The
only real difference

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.844
with using canned chickpeas
is that they cook--

00:22:50.844 --> 00:22:53.260
I mean, they do a beautiful
job of cooking them in the can

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.850
so that each chickpea
maintains integrity

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.040
and it's got a little
bit of bite left to it.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.755
When we cook chickpeas from
dry at the restaurants,

00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:02.630
by the time that we're
finished cooking them,

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.550
they're not recognizable
as chickpeas.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.950
They're just mush, and
that's what contributes

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.140
to like a super creamy texture.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.690
But that texture,
really, is just a matter

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.400
of personal preference.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.604
This is going to be
still very, very smooth,

00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:17.520
but you'll have a little
bit of texture in it.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.330
SPEAKER: Yeah, question?

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:32.691
AUDIENCE: How much [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:34.690
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: That's
a really good question

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.680
and I'll repeat it.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.190
SPEAKER: Paraphrase it.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.730
Yes, thank you.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.105
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Yeah, so it's,

00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:41.170
how much of Israeli
cuisine is kosher?

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:50.890
So culturally, the
laws of kosher--

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.340
the way that the food came
back from the diaspora

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.650
came mostly through Jews.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:02.140
So Yemenite cuisine,
North African cuisine.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.696
My family's from Bulgaria,
but from Spain, originally.

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:08.070
And so the food
that they brought

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.690
about wasn't Spanish and
wasn't totally Ottoman,

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.760
because the Ottomans had also
conquered the Balkans for oil.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.220
It was still laws of
kosher were maintained.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.000
So it's not just
Yemenite food from Yemen.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.240
It's Yemen without
milk and meat together,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.595
with the cooking
on Shabbat, which

00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:30.220
is a big thing, that
overnight cooking.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.150
Because you're not allowed,
from sundown till sunset--

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.250
sundown on Friday till
sunset on Saturday,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.110
you're not allowed to
mess with your ovens.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.818
And you're also kind
of commanded to have

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:43.044
an extravagant meal on Saturday,
which is a huge problem

00:24:43.044 --> 00:24:44.710
because you can't
turn ovens on and off.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.860
So everybody's got their
own version of cassoulet,

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.350
or overnight Sabbath stew.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.610
So I would say, as I was saying
before, we're not kosher,

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.400
but we wanted to keep
it a little bit real

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.130
because the laws of Kashrut
are relevant when it comes

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.440
to eating, like the
cultural way that you

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.250
eat in Israel for the
majority of the population.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.780
So I'm not sure, actually.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.080
I almost forgot the
intent of that question,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.110
but I hope I
answered part of it.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.080
But that's a good way
for us to distinguish.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.300
When we started, we we're
like, well, if we're not kosher

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.570
and we're roasting lamb, I
want to serve it with yogurt.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.370
But once I start
serving with yogurt,

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.600
that takes away a little
bit from like the intent

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.260
that we want our
customers to have,

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.910
that we wanted to cook with,
to understand that how it was.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.330
So that the laws of Kashrut,
even though we're not

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.130
kosher restaurant, the
way that you cook really,

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.920
really matters.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.640
There's a Yemenite bread called
kubaneh, which literally, it's

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.500
a yeasted bread that goes in a
200 degree oven for 12 hours.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.750
And you eat it Saturday
morning with hard boiled eggs,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.134
and it's like delicious.

00:25:58.134 --> 00:26:00.050
Not the lightest thing
in the world, but very,

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.240
very, very good.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.610
And having that Saturday
morning experience

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.710
is something that is
very relevant to the way

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.630
that we cook.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.500
Also, cassoulet, too,
came from hameen,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.800
or from [INAUDIBLE] which is--

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.459
the Ashkenazi Jews made
[INAUDIBLE] and the Moroccan

00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:19.000
Jews made hameen,
and usually, that's

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.590
a legume meat stew
that goes overnight.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.448
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:26:24.448 --> 00:26:30.821
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:32.070
STEVEN COOK: We've tried that.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.920
It doesn't quite-- it
gets a little bit softer,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.286
but it doesn't quite--

00:26:37.286 --> 00:26:38.910
I think once they're
cooked and cooled,

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.580
it's kind of hard to
take them further along.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.705
We found that hasn't been
really worth the trouble.

00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:46.500
SPEAKER: Yeah, finish up.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.320
STEVEN COOK: I'm going
to plate this up.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.230
So I mean, the only
clean up we really

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.770
have is this, a spatula,
a couple of bowls.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.590
But it's pretty clean.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.340
Actually, I want to
buzz it one more time.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.630
I just season it with
a little extra squeeze

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.300
of lemon and some salt.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.210
And the plating of this
is actually important.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.390
When Israelis invite
you to go eat hummus,

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.300
they ask you, literally, do you
want to go wipe some hummus?

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.120
Because it's the
action of dragging

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.050
the pita through the hummus.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.730
And so the way
that you plate it,

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.510
traditionally, is both
beautiful and also functional.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.280
So I will demonstrate that now.

00:27:30.405 --> 00:27:32.630
So you want to put the
hummus in the middle.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.000
You want to take the back
of the spoon and go around

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.150
and sort of run the hummus
up on the rim of the bowl,

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.337
kind of like a wave.

00:27:39.337 --> 00:27:40.670
It just kind of makes it easier.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.253
And a shallow bowl
is great because it

00:27:42.253 --> 00:27:44.240
makes it easier to
get in there and not

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.880
get hummus on your sleeve.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.880
And then we have, in the book,
about 25 different toppings

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.350
of hummus, which are not
super traditional in Israel,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.780
but it's such a great
campus, because it's rich

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.470
but it's also kind of neutral.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.610
So we top it from everything
from pine nut and broccoli

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.580
pesto to ground lamb with
[? faharad ?] and pine nuts.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.440
It kind of goes with everything.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.600
But the simplest
way to do it is just

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:22.382
a little bit of olive
oil, some chopped parsley,

00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:23.090
and some paprika.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.940
SPEAKER: Beautiful, absolutely.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.770
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
It's good for wiping.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.270
I'm going to finish
this up as well.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.910
We're just going to take
some of our matbucha,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:40.871
spoon it down with a
little bit of hummus,

00:28:40.871 --> 00:28:52.090
the zucchini, some cilantro.

00:29:02.303 --> 00:29:05.090
I feel like finishing everything
with excessive amounts

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.990
of olive oil is the way to do.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.200
There it is.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.960
SPEAKER: Beautiful.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.290
Can you guys shift those
gorgeous dishes just a little

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.340
bit over so everybody can
see them on the camera?

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.340
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.157
AUDIENCE: More.

00:29:28.157 --> 00:29:28.990
SPEAKER: More, more.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.172
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: OK.

00:29:31.172 --> 00:29:32.622
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:33.830
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: All right.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.085
Thank you, everybody.

00:29:35.085 --> 00:29:37.460
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.950
Beautiful.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.720
So we absolutely have
time for questions,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.060
but I have one for you first.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.760
So in addition to Zahav
and your cookbooks,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.390
you guys are the CookNSolo team.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.330
So how did that come to be?

00:29:52.699 --> 00:29:54.240
STEVEN COOK: How
did that come to be?

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.020
We've been working
together for 13 years now.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.880
We were introduced, actually, by
my wife, who's from Pittsburgh,

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.230
where Mike grew up.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.720
So they were family
friends, and my wife

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.370
introduced about 13 years ago
because the first restaurant

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.500
ever opened I was
looking for a chef.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.310
And my wife Cher was like,
you really got to meet Mike.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.910
He's the other Jewish
line cook in Philadelphia.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.072
SPEAKER: The two of them.

00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:23.780
STEVEN COOK: We had
apartments in Philly.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.070
We both moved to
Philly the same year.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.050
We had apartments
literally right next door

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.184
to each other for a
year and never met.

00:30:30.184 --> 00:30:32.600
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: And I kept
hearing about Steve as well.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.349
I was working at a
restaurant called Vetri

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:36.610
and I was going to leave.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.050
STEVEN COOK: Yeah.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.889
In retrospect, it was a pretty
hasty, foolish decision.

00:30:43.889 --> 00:30:45.930
We met each other for
coffee for like, 20 minutes

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.080
and then I was like,
you want a job?

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.539
And that's kind of
how it happened.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:51.829
SPEAKER: But now it's James
Beard awards and six minute

00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:52.340
abs.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.470
It clearly worked out.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.680
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Yeah,
one of those things.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.460
It's fun, I mean, our business.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.820
When we started
working together,

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.890
Steve was the owner
of a restaurant that

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:08.720
had seven employees that
was in 45th and Marchwood,

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.280
past [INAUDIBLE]
campus in West Philly.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.740
It was this tiny, little BYOB.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.719
And today, we have 250
employees and 12 restaurants,

00:31:17.719 --> 00:31:18.510
for 13 restaurants?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.919
12 restaurants.

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.710
SPEAKER: So many that
you're not even sure.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.465
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Well, that's a lot.

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:25.850
We try to block it
out, the number, so we

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.950
sleep better at night.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.230
And yeah, I mean,
we're super different,

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.720
super different people,
and that has really helped.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.020
But when times are
tough, which they often

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.150
are in restaurants-- it's
like every other day,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.730
there's some sort
of catastrophe.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.510
The ability to like bounce
ideas and have support from,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:49.380
essentially, your
BFF is very helpful.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.630
SPEAKER: That's beautiful.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.130
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
And also auditing

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.960
your terrible decisions,
if it was only us.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.350
I mean, independently, we come
up with some very bad ideas,

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.977
I think.

00:31:58.977 --> 00:32:01.310
SPEAKER: That's the best
partner, the one who can really

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.615
audit your terrible decisions.

00:32:02.615 --> 00:32:03.740
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Totally.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.140
SPEAKER: You had a question.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.269
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so there's
this debate about--

00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:10.060
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
That's a great question,

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.476
and I guess I'll
paraphrase, which

00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:15.080
is what is American
Israeli cuisine's

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.690
role in telling the story,
I guess, of Israeli food?

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.570
I mean, the fact of the matter
is food travels and food

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:25.130
changes and adopts the
way that people do.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.230
Now Israeli food in
the US is a big thing.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:33.230
And I think that what
we had to do at Zahav

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:39.620
was break from tradition,
because it wasn't relevant.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.860
What you have available to you
in Pennsylvania in February

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.080
is, obviously, very
different than the produce

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.360
that you have access
to in the Middle East.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.090
And it came at a
time where we were

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.510
about to close the
restaurant, we were so slow.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.260
And I really held on
to this idea of things

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.925
being very traditional.

00:32:58.925 --> 00:33:02.290
At the end of the day,
it doesn't matter.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.120
My shakshuka, I
think, is very good.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.190
Regardless of how
good it tastes,

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.250
it's not as good as
the restaurant in Jaffa

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.300
that makes it overlooking
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.260
And ordering
tomatoes in February,

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.020
even though they were from
Israel, it doesn't taste right.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.750
So we had to adapt.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.480
We had to start pickling
and preserving, using

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.440
spices and techniques
to really tell a story.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.490
So the visceral reaction
that we got from our guests

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.430
was good enough.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.730
I didn't need something
to be literal.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.921
At the end of the
day, my bourekas,

00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:38.420
which were my
grandmother's recipe--

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.690
they're this beautiful puff
pastryesque thing that's like

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.010
a turnover that's stuffed
with feta cheese--

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.490
tells the story of my family
going back to the Inquisition

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.754
till now.

00:33:50.754 --> 00:33:52.670
I make it the way that
my grandmother made it.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:57.380
It will never taste
as good as hers, ever.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.170
And when Steve
hired me at Marigold

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.270
and I started taking
her boureka dough

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.180
and stuffing it with
porchinis and foie gras.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.730
My grandmother would
have hated that.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.030
She would have thought
it was terrible.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.155
I thought it was very good.

00:34:09.155 --> 00:34:12.679
But that's the way
that we progressed.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.020
And I think that that's
probably the big contribution

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.219
is that people are
not only saying--

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:20.639
it's up to me.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.620
I'm not a grandparent.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.560
I need to adapt and change,
and I can take liberties.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.860
But you get to look at a
country from a third person

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.659
point of view, from
a different narrative

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:35.730
and say, well, the best
Bulgarian restaurant in Jaffa

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.630
is here.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.460
The best Yemenite
restaurant that I know

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.500
is in Hadera is here.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.440
The best Palestinian restaurant
that I go to is here.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.909
And we're going to take all--

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:49.050
I can look at all these
things and pick and choose

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.020
what I want to put on a plate
to tell a different story.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.270
And I think that's what we do.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.103
I think if you go to
Israel and ask somebody

00:34:56.103 --> 00:34:57.690
where the best
Israeli restaurant is,

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.140
they have no idea what that is.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.390
I mean, there's no such thing.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.660
And so for us to be able to
articulate that, I think,

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.320
is important.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.490
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.910
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Right.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.743
Where to get good za'tar
and a good baharat?

00:35:09.743 --> 00:35:12.350
I mean, I hate this
answer, which is just like,

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.850
order it online now.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.190
But when you come
up with cookbooks,

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.240
you're like, resources.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.060
And you're like, Amazon, baby.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.580
Or like, go to your
local fishmonger.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.830
I'm like, I've never been to--

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.740
I've been cooking
for a long time,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.927
I don't know any fishmongers.

00:35:27.927 --> 00:35:29.510
SPEAKER: We can
introduce you to some.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.040
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Do they
wear like, rubber boots

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.670
all the time?

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.391
Where do you get them?

00:35:33.391 --> 00:35:35.390
I know California's better
than everywhere else,

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.910
but we don't have that,
really, on the East Coast.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.490
So where you can get it, we've
got a really good spice guy

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.420
in New York.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.840
His name is Leyora
[INAUDIBLE] and he's

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.660
got a spice shop
called La Boda Piece.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.080
And he makes the
best blends ever.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.830
It is much easier now
to get those ingredients

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.089
and those certain items.

00:36:00.089 --> 00:36:02.630
And it's, obviously, much easier
to get them shipped directly

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.202
to you.

00:36:04.202 --> 00:36:04.910
But I don't know.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.493
I like going to
different supermarkets

00:36:06.493 --> 00:36:09.660
and ethnic supermarkets and
just tooling around and running

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.160
around.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.920
And when we opened Zahav, we
had access to none of them.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.940
So it was like anytime my family
would visit, I was like, hey.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.460
Meet this guy on a corner,
he's going to give you a bag.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.170
Don't ask any questions.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.330
And then they'd get to the
States and they're like,

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.180
all of my underwear smells
like Yemenite soup spice.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.950
Thank you very much.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.260
So it's a little bit easier now.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.940
But I don't know,
spices are really--

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.090
it's funny because now,
just now, we have access

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.100
to really good spices.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.980
Before, it was
like baharat, which

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.790
is funny, too, because baharat
and hawaj, and curry, those all

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.400
mean the same.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.840
They're all blends and there's
like, 17 different kinds.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.150
But I think now, people are
starting to understand it,

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.560
and it's a very good way
to take local ingredients

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.290
and really articulate
something that is very pure.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.980
What is the-- there's
one dish that we do.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.050
Oh, so we take figs right now.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.030
We have local figs
that are awesome.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.990
And we're barbecuing
them on charcoal

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.790
and we're taking
Bulgarian feta cheese

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.580
and whipping it with
[INAUDIBLE] and spooning it

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.990
on top of the figs.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.500
And we're frying lentils
on top for crunch,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.110
and then we're taking
sumac from New Jersey--

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.930
not poisonous-- and
we're blooming it

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.030
and olive oil from Turkey.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.010
And we're pouring
on top of the feta

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.220
to break it, because
any sauce needs to be

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.720
broken with tons of olive oil.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.150
That's our rule.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.930
And it's nothing that
you've ever really

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.050
had over their, or at
home, but the feeling

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.300
is something that is super pure.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.270
So yeah, I would try [INAUDIBLE]
Kalustyan's, is, I think,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.870
is pretty good as well.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.380
And yeah.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.238
SPEAKER: Amazon.

00:38:00.238 --> 00:38:01.321
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Amazon.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.150
You're asking an
impossible question,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.880
which is how to make your
tomatoes taste better.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.710
I mean, I feel like
in California, they're

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.820
pretty awesome.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.360
So whenever we're in
Israel, I'm like, wow.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.490
Why does everything here
taste so much better?

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.100
From a trade perspective, Israel
is, essentially, an island.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.260
So not even to be cool, but
everybody eats local there,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.330
and I think that
really helps out a lot.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.950
On the East Coast,
we have to deal

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:37.050
with shipping from South
America or California, at best.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.140
And we have a small
window in the summer,

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.965
actually, Jersey goes till
mid-October and they're great.

00:38:43.965 --> 00:38:47.060
So to make tomatoes
really concentrated,

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.470
you gotta find the
tomatomonger, and just try

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.450
to develop good
relationships with farms

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.000
and go to farmer's markets,
I think would be it.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.910
We like to dehydrate a lot.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:03.870
So towards the
end of the season,

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.740
we'll buy many cases of tomatoes
and we'll salt and preserve

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.320
them and dry them a little
bit, and that kind of helps us.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.140
But yeah, it's a tricky thing.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.630
You have to elaborate.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.900
There is tomato powder--

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.020
dried tomatoes,
entirely dry, ground.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.180
Adding a little bit of
tomato powder, sumac,

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.490
and salt to fresh tomatoes
really wakes them up.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.580
SPEAKER: I love that idea.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.694
Yeah?

00:39:29.694 --> 00:39:31.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Quick question for you.

00:39:31.712 --> 00:39:32.920
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Nailed it.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.760
Yeah.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.630
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.790
How do you guys design
eating experiences

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.680
at your restaurants?

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.570
STEVEN COOK: I mean, I think
that was in addition to being

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.946
an early American
restaurant that

00:39:43.946 --> 00:39:45.320
was calling itself
Israeli, which

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.240
was a big thing 10 years ago.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.820
I think the style of eating
kind of defines Zahav

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.840
more than anything else.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:55.040
And when we worked
together at Marigold,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.895
we had very few customers,
so we had a lot of time.

00:39:57.895 --> 00:40:00.020
We had a lot of time to
just sit on the back steps,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.700
waiting for people
to come in and talk.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.060
And that was really
when Mike was started--

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.700
we started we start having
this conversation of here's

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.870
how they eat in Israel.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.190
You come in, sit down.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.870
Before you order any food,
a lot of food shows up.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.220
It's all the
salads, representing

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.570
all the different cultures.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.330
And it's fresh bread
and it's hummus,

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.890
and it's just the
sense of abundance

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.800
that is really free of
anxiety of having to make

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.300
any choices at that point.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.460
And I think that's
kind of what we wanted

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.020
to capture when we opened
Zahav because it was not

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.780
American dining.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.180
It was nothing like that.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.260
And we were starting to see
Spanish tapas places open

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.804
and do very well.

00:40:40.804 --> 00:40:41.720
That was 10 years ago.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.240
That was like the big
restaurant openings

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.910
for these giant Spanish tapas
places that we all wanted--

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:49.810
we were all jealous of because
they were just killing it.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.820
And as Mike says,
meze predates tapas

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.420
by a couple of thousand years.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.366
So that sort of primed
the dining public

00:40:57.366 --> 00:40:58.490
to be able to eat that way.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:02.840
But yeah, when you come
into Zahav, basically,

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.630
I mean, I would say
90% of the people

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:10.040
choose one of our options where
the menus kind of prescribe--

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.060
you get some choices,
but you sit down.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.970
All these salads come to
the table, fresh laffa

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:22.010
that Mike cooks, hummus, and
then you get a bunch of meze

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:23.077
and a bunch of--

00:41:23.077 --> 00:41:24.660
excuse me-- a bunch
of grilled things.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.860
So it's super casual.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.360
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Everybody shares.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.770
Everybody rolls
up their sleeves.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.870
Everybody rips bread apart.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.109
And it's not formal.

00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:35.900
STEVEN COOK: We're
really proud of the fact

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.750
that the critic of
record in Philadelphia,

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.170
instead of handing out
stars, he hands out bells.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.730
And you can get
four bells, and I

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.197
think there's five or six four
bell restaurants in Philly,

00:41:46.197 --> 00:41:47.780
which we're really
proud to be one of.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.970
And I think our
price point and check

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.610
average is probably about
half of the next cheapest one.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:59.990
And so, really, we try to
be hospitable and warm and

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.327
approachable as much as we can.

00:42:01.327 --> 00:42:02.660
And part of that is price point.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.670
Part of that is
taking away anxiety

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.620
from people when they come
to a restaurant with a menu

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:11.460
that they might not know
what the words mean.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.174
So that's a huge part
of success, I think.

00:42:14.174 --> 00:42:16.340
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Zahav
is, essentially, our house.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:22.190
I mean, that's hospitality
on every level is that.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:27.050
Eating with my family in
Israel is, essentially,

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.110
being force fed
way too much food,

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.900
but really being made
to feel comfortable.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.160
And that's what we try
to do with every guest.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.460
SPEAKER: So if that's your
launch point in your home base,

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.910
how did you start deciding what
other types of restaurants you

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.560
might want to have?

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.670
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Well, we opened

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.720
Zahar in 2008, which
was not a great year

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.890
to open any small business, let
alone an Israeli restaurant.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.560
And the Phillies had
won the World Series

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.990
that year, which
is great if you own

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.440
a bar with a television
in it, not a restaurant.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.030
So we were a super slow.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.940
We'd opened another
restaurant that was doing OK.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.040
And we were hanging
out with our friends

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.070
that were the first people to
bring fancy coffee to Philly.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.080
And we they wanted
to open a donut shop.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.580
They wanted to do
coffee and donuts.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:20.450
We were eating tons of Korean
fried chicken at the time.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.170
So we were like, why don't we
do donuts, coffee and chicken?

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:25.490
We're not doing anything else.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.110
Our restaurants
are kind of slow.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.630
We each put a couple thousand
dollars-- five partners

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.030
put a couple thousand
dollars in a pot

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.910
and we opened Federal Donuts,
which serves donuts, coffee,

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:35.720
and fried chicken.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.460
SPEAKER: Just because you felt
like eating donuts and coffee

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:38.210
and fried chicken.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.840
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
We were bored.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.756
SPEAKER: This is my kind
of business decision.

00:43:40.756 --> 00:43:41.450
I like it.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.200
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: If
we each lose $5,000,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.230
it would totally
be the worst thing.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.550
Let's just try it out.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.170
And then on day two,
we're like, wow,

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.710
this is the best idea
we've ever had in our life.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:54.484
And that was what,
five years ago?

00:43:54.484 --> 00:43:56.150
STEVEN COOK: No, that
was six years ago.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.880
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Six years ago,

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.700
and now we have
five or six of them.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.480
And super random, but delicious.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.709
And it's like the
three major food

00:44:06.709 --> 00:44:07.875
groups in the United States.

00:44:11.469 --> 00:44:12.510
We've owned a restaurant.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.960
So that's sort of an outlier.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.990
But we had a barbecue
restaurant at one point.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.210
We had a Mexican
restaurant at one point.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:26.130
The food that we serve
at all of our restaurants

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.890
are the things that
are very personal to us

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.700
and we have this
emotional connection.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:35.250
And as I said, things go wrong
all the time in restaurants.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:40.230
And you feel you have this
like obligation a little bit

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.690
to your heritage to
really keep things alive.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.582
It helps.

00:44:44.582 --> 00:44:47.040
We've got a couple really cool
projects that are definitely

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.789
related to Israel.

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:54.330
We've got a couple
really cool things

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.038
happening in the next
year that we're not

00:44:56.038 --> 00:44:57.090
quite ready to announce.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.997
But you guys should definitely
take a field trip to Philly.

00:45:00.997 --> 00:45:01.830
SPEAKER: Hear, hear.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:05.910
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: It's
only a five hour flight.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.650
But the cost of doing
anything in Philly

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.620
is so much cheaper than the
Bay Area, so it's nothing.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.120
Going to a convenience
store for you

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.180
is spending a
weekend in our city.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.300
SPEAKER: Our team is working
on some delicious bites,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.780
and we hope you guys will
stick around and sign some cook

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.480
books for those lucky few.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.855
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Yeah, we will.

00:45:22.855 --> 00:45:24.170
Thanks so much for having us.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.320
SPEAKER: Well then,
please, join me.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.162
Thank you so much.

00:45:26.162 --> 00:45:27.620
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Yeah, thank you.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.220
Thank you.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.270
[APPLAUSE]
