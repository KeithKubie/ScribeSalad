00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Knowing yourself sounds like a good idea

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.080
but it can be hard to see quite why it should matter so much

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.840
there are some clues in an old story about a lion with a sore paw

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.700
a traditional folktale known as Androcles and the Lion

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.140
the earliest version of the story comes from the ancient Roman philosopher Aulus Gellius

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.280
and has been adapted and retold ever since

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.400
one version goes like this

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.580
once long ago there was a Barbary lion nine feet long with a splendid dark mane

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.720
who lived in a forested foothills of the Atlas mountains in what is today Algeria

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.820
usually the lion kept far from human settlements but one year in spring

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.760
he started approaching the villages at night roaring and snarling menacingly in the dark

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.740
the villagers were terrified

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.740
they put extra guards on the gates and sent out heavily armed hunting parties to try to kill him

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.800
It happened around this time that a shepherd boy named Androcles

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.060
followed his sheep far into the high mountain pastures

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.160
one cold evening he sought shelter in a cave

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.340
he had just lit a candle and was setting his blanket on the ground

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.960
when to his horror he saw the ferocious beast staring at him

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.480
at first he was terrified the lion looked as if it might be about to pounce on him and rip him to pieces

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.800
but Androcles notice something

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.840
there was a thorn deeply embedded in one of the lion’s front paws

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480
and a huge tear was running down his noble face

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.200
the creature wasn’t murderous it was in agony

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.880
so instead of trying to flee or defend himself with his dagger

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.780
the boy’s fear changed to pity

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.740
Androcles approached the lion stroked his mane and then gently and reassuringly extracted the thorn from the paw

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.540
and wrapped it in a strip of cloth torn from his own blanket

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.960
the lion licked the boy’s hand and became his friend

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.780
many years later Androcles got into trouble with the authorities

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.300
he was shipped to Rome taken to the Colosseum

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.440
and thrown before a lion to be devoured in public

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.100
for the pleasure of the people and the emperor

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520
but when the lion saw Androcles he became quiet

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.800
and went forward and lowered his head in a bow

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.280
it was the same Barbary lion Androcles had taken pity on as a boy

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.080
the emperor pardoned Androcles and he and his lion lived together in Rome

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260
and they used to go for walks together through the streets

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.580
with the lion peaceable and contented

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.580
led only on a slender leash

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.820
the fable can be usefully be read as an allegory about self-knowledge

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.460
the lion is in terrible pain but has no capacity to understand what is hurting him exactly

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.400
and how he might put it right

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.960
in his blind distress he acts in horrifically aggressive and threatening ways

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.800
he makes blood-curdling noises and frightens everyone

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.600
the lion is all of us when we lack insight into our own distress

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.340
the thorn is a troubling, maddening element of our inner lives

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.260
a fear

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.420
a biting worry

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.940
a regret

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.940
a sense of guilt

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460
a feeling of humiliation

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.600
a strained hope

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.520
or agonized disappointment

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.740
that rumbles away powerfully

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.180
but just out of range of our standard view of ourselves

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.820
but there’s potentially another Androcles-like side of us

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.840
able calmly to see past the fury to what the problem really is

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.820
and then calm our untargeted anger and help us find constructive solutions

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.000
however it’s not always easy

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.140
some of the following can happen when we try to locate the stubborn thorn

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.160
we make the wrong diagnosis of what’s upsetting us

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.040
we’re in no doubt we’re in pain but we don’t correctly attribute the source of the distress

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.940
we lash out innocents usually the kindest people around us

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.400
perhaps we start to get tetchy around our partners

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.900
we accuse them of being dull and obsessed with domestic trivia

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.800
and not as much fun as they once were

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200
but the thorn might in fact lie elsewhere entirely

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.220
maybe there’s a lovely new colleague at work

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.860
and awkwardly we’ve developed a sort of crush on them

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.180
we don’t even admit to ourselves that something so unexpected and challenging might be upsetting us

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.120
we don’t know where to look for the thorn but others close to us who are kind, forgiving

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.980
and easy targets for our frustration

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.160
end up taking the blame nevertheless

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.920
another option is that we try to ignore the pain

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920
when the paw hurts too much in ways we don’t grasp

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.380
it’s tempting to try to numb our distress

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.040
we search out an anesthetic that can reduce the discomfort but fails to address it’s causes

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.560
we might take to drinking

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.360
playing nonstop game of solitaire

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.140
watching porn

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.780
or working obsessively

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.380
the thorn is still firmly lodged in place

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.220
but we notice it less and yet the numbing move

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.620
extracts a high price

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.160
it eats away at our time

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.840
undermines our self respect

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.020
or leads to debilitating symptoms

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.420
we might not be able to sleep

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.600
insomnia often being traceable to the turbulent impact of issues

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140
we haven’t paid proper attention to during the day

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.280
or finally we might apply the wrong medicine

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.360
we might come up with unfounded confused schemes to solve a pain we don't understand

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.620
we may take to
blaming our partner

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.640
the city we live in

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.320
the government

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.260
or our employer

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260
rifling through a cabinet of cures

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.960
we might pick a journey to the desert

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.800
or a quick divorce

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.440
we decide to quit our jobs

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.500
or sack someone

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.480
it can be hard not to inflict severe pain on ourselves or others when we don’t have

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.420
an accurate handle on our agonies

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.040
fortunately there’s almost always information to hand about what is really wrong

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.680
our stream of consciousness

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.080
contains a reservoir of muddled hints

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.940
about our woes

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.960
which need to be gathered and decoded

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.840
the art of living is to a large measure dependent on an ability to locate our thorns accurately 
and in good time

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.980
so that we will not forever be condemned to suffer our symptoms

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.640
and terrify strangers with our roars
