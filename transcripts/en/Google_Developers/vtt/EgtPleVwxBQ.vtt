Being able to arbitrarily combine
and overlay widgets atop one another,

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:15.336
it's simple in Flutter
using the <i>Stack</i> widget.

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:18.727
But how do you position
those widgets in a <i>Stack?</i>

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:21.257
There is a couple of ways you can do this.

00:00:21.257 --> 00:00:24.819
And one of them is
to use a <i>Positioned</i> widget.

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.147
You know, for positioning things.

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:30.448
Which is kind of self-explanatory
when you think about it.

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:32.987
So how does <i>Positioned</i> work?

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:38.047
First, let's wrap a widget in a <i>Stack</i>
with a <i>Positioned</i> widget.

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:41.856
Then, use a combination of the parameters

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:45.957
<i>top, bottom, left, right,
height,</i> and <i>width</i>

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:48.906
to position the widget within the <i>Stack.</i>

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:54.799
Here, we see a widget placed 25 down
from the top, and 50 in from the left.

00:00:55.127 --> 00:00:59.097
And here, we have the widget
placed at 25 from the right,

00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:01.466
and 50 up from the bottom.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:06.487
You can use <i>height</i> and <i>width</i> to control
the size of the <i>Positioned</i> widget.

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:07.987
And one last tip.

00:01:07.987 --> 00:01:12.827
You can use <i>Positioned.fill</i>
to make the widget fill the <i>Stack's</i> space.

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.347

and <i>Stack</i> layout,
