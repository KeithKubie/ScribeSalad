00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.552
&gt;&gt; Now, the first thing we do is actually set the viewRect width and height

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:07.437
equal to the canvas size. This way we know that the viewRect is actually going

00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:11.557
to encompass everything that the canvas can actually see. From here, we actually

00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:15.157
translate the x and y value of the viewRect by offsetting it by half of the

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:18.998
canvas size. Now, what this is going to do is effectively shift the viewRect,

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:22.906
such the x and y value are at the center. Of the viewRect, meaning that it's at

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:24.717
the center of what the canvas will draw.
