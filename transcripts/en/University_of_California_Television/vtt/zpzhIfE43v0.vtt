(light techno music)

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.478
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.978
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:21.887
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:26.041
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.343
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:31.510
Yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.142
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.611
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.694
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.790
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.957
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.249
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.416
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:59.027
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.610
of humans like you.

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:03.993
(music ends)

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.926
(silence)

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:23.568
(slow techno music)

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:45.056
- [Ajit] Among the oldest
questions of humans are:

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:48.729
Who are we? What are we doing here?

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.835
Where did we come from?

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.100
How did we get here?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100
And, where are we going?

00:01:56.808 --> 00:01:59.800
As you know, two of these
questions are tractable

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.050
to scientific inquiry.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.666
And this is the question of anthropogeny,

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.391
explaining the origin of humans,

00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:10.581
where did we come from
and how did we get here.

00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:13.598
And so pursuing this
discipline involves most

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.020
academic disciplines.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.617
So we incorporate people
from many backgrounds.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:21.880
This symposium is of
course sponsored by CARTA,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.029
Center for Academic Research
and Training in Anthropogeny.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.482
It is a transdisciplinary
collaboration between faculty

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:32.626
at UC San Diego, Salk
Institute, along with interested

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.213
scientists at other institutions.

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:38.529
And our mission is to explore
and explain the origins

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.529
of the human phenomenon.

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.965
Our Co-Directors are myself, Rusty Gage,

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:46.492
Margaret Schoeninger, and
our Associate Director

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:47.992
is Pascal Gagneux.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:51.977
With special thanks to our major sponsor,

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:54.577
The Mathers Charitable
Foundation in New York,

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:57.827
Howard Chester, the Executive Director.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:01.160
And also a special thank
you to Annette Merle-Smith

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.665
for support of our Graduate
Specialization in Anthropogeny

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:05.998
at UC San Diego.

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.882
Thank you to the sponsors
of this symposium's closed-

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:13.782
captioning on YouTube, Elizabeth Lancaster

00:03:13.782 --> 00:03:15.115
and Eli Shefter.

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:19.370
And we're particularly
grateful to our many individual

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.537
supporters who are listed
here, but also at the web site.

00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:28.528
They are part of the rotating
slides that we'll see, also.

00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:30.607
We'd like to honor them.

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:34.759
And you can become a
CARTA supporter today.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.768
And special thanks, of
course, to the CARTA staff:

00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:41.480

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.647
and UCSD-TV Rich Wargo, Matt,
Steven, Marci, and Jacob.

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:50.891
And, of course, Salk Media
Services' Kent and Mike.

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.209
And, last but not least, our
guitarist, George Svoboda.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.209
(audience applause)

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.171
- So, I'm Rusty Gage.

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.754
As Sochi said, I'm one of the Co-Directors

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:08.587
with Margaret and Ajit and Pascal.

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:13.846
We're the co-sponsors of
today's presentation to you all.

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:17.991
I'm going to give you a
little bit of an explanation

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.682
for why we're having this meeting today,

00:04:20.682 --> 00:04:23.765
how we came about doing this meeting,

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:27.423
and, I'm also gonna give you the first

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:31.590
of our presentations today on
my approach and take to this.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.170
So, some of you are long-time participants

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:42.536
in these symposia and will be
somewhat intimidated probably

00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:45.911
by the title of this current presentation,

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:49.177
Cellular and Molecular
Mechanisms that are underlying

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:52.444
or evolving- the
differences between humans

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:54.229
and non-human primates.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.146
So, probing the molecular
cellular differences.

00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:02.611
Remember what Ajit told us.

00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:07.012
He said that our goal
is to really understand

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:07.845
where we came from.

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:11.320
How did we get here, and
what is the mechanism

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.253
or what is the way in which this happened?

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:19.878
In truth, most of what we've
been talking about for many

00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:24.427
years, is the ways in which
we actually examined this:

00:05:24.427 --> 00:05:28.039
By looking at DNA from post-mortem tissue

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.820
from our closest relatives,
even neanderthals now,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.111
and sequencing that DNA and
comparing with humans and

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.454
looking for the differences that exist.

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.779
We have post-mortem tissue
itself where we can look

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.195
at brain structures and see
how they may have changed

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:48.420
with evolution, anatomical
kinds of information,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.337
And of course, at the core
of it we have archeological

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:56.411
evidence from bones where
we can get brain casts

00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:58.811
and look at how the
brain size has changed.

00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:00.910
And even, if you get a
good cast, you can see

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.592
how certain areas of the
brain have grown more

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.250
in different species or different evolving

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.015
creatures over time. These are endocasts.

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:14.182
And finally, we have
archeological evidence that gives

00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:18.928
insights into perhaps even
the thought processes that

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:22.761
were going on while our
species were evolving.

00:06:24.148 --> 00:06:27.315
So, in the case of DNA, we have genes.

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:33.476
In the case of the post-mortem
tissue, we have tissues

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.559
and slices and histological evidence.

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:41.902
With bones, we have inferences
about size and structure.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.377
And of course, archeological evidence,

00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:46.877
we have cultural implications.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.732
And so, a missing piece for
this, for a lot of us has been,

00:06:52.732 --> 00:06:55.748
really, what we consider to
be mechanisms at the level

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.498
of cellular and molecular events.

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:03.833
And there is a growing
interest in this piece here.

00:07:06.314 --> 00:07:10.358
We call it "the missing
link"- it's a joke.

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:12.128
(audience laughter)

00:07:12.128 --> 00:07:16.052
A missing link in the sequence of events.

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:20.734
There are some recent technologies
that have been developed

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:24.916
that have allowed us to
get insights into tissues.

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:27.432
One, is using what
you'll hear a bit about,

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:29.907
which is called induced pluripotent cells.

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:34.495
This is the ability to take
somatic cells from any species

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:38.268
and convert them into an
embryonic cell that can be

00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:42.305
differentiated into all cells
of the body including neurons.

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:46.297
So, for living organisms that
we normally can't penetrate

00:07:46.297 --> 00:07:50.497
and see how their brain
functions, we can now look at

00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:53.270
behavioral function, look at
the genes while they're active,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.983
while they're alive.

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:59.186
In addition, you'll hear a
lot about model organisms

00:07:59.186 --> 00:08:01.755
where once genes have been
identified that might have

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:05.467
implications for certain
growth patterns that are

00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:09.631
unique to humans, they can
be tested experimentally

00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:13.995
in living animals, different
species, that reveal to us

00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:17.463
how that unique change in
the gene may have fostered

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:20.762
a meaningful change that is
relevant to how it is that

00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:23.166
we became who we are.

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:25.286
So that is the motivation.

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:29.453
And, on a personal note, I
would say that my hope is,

00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:36.023
you know, hopes are
always mixed with worries,

00:08:36.023 --> 00:08:39.503
is the worry is not that
we develop a whole new area

00:08:39.503 --> 00:08:44.036
of research that just looks
in towards ourselves exploring

00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:46.546
more and more about the cellular
and molecular mechanisms,

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:50.538
but rather, that these
new tools become vehicles

00:08:50.538 --> 00:08:54.372
for expanding outward into
the other panoply of ways

00:08:54.372 --> 00:08:57.039
in which we can study evolution.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.381
There's an emerging idea
now, sort a reemergence

00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:05.548
of a concept in science
called convergent science.

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:10.555
It was a term that was modified

00:09:13.613 --> 00:09:15.921
from the concept of consilience,

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.822
but it is the idea that different

00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:21.958
levels of science that
normally talk specifically

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.908
to themselves, begin to
understand how they can transmit

00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:28.513
information from one level to the next.

00:09:28.513 --> 00:09:33.037
And that's how we believe,
or hope, that new concepts

00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:34.958
and deeper thoughts will emerge.

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.753
So, our challenge, as most
of us, as cellular molecular

00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:41.853
biologists that are
speakers in this symposium,

00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:46.011
is to think about how we can
use this information to stretch

00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:50.044
this and expand to these other
areas that are so important

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:54.261
for understanding the
underlying principles.

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.344
