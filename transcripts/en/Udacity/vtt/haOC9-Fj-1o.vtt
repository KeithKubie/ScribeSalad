00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.290
As a developer,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.060
your goal is to keep your app
rendering at 60 frames per second.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.770
This means that you have 16 milliseconds
to finish all of your computation and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.510
drawing for the next frame.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.580
If you miss the 16 millisecond target,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.930
you'll have a dropped frame,
which will cause your app to skip.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.768
So, you'll want to use this time wisely.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.010
A common you've probably
encountered is overdraw.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.810
The idea here is that you draw a layer.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.420
Great.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.610
But then the next layer you draw

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.810
obscures a portion of
that initial layer.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.650
You just wasted precious time drawing
all of those pixels that were drawn over

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.330
immediately after.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.680
There are two ways to
tackle overdraw issues.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.180
The first is to remove
unnecessary backgrounds and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.780
drawables, such as a base white
background on your top most layer

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.150
when you're completely obscuring
the layer out with other views.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.410
Or you can mark certain portions of
the layer as visible or not visible.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.010
Especially with stacked views, this
will help by only drawing the visible

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.790
portions and
ignoring the rest until it's needed.
