00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.029
TRUDI MCCANNA: Hi everyone.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.510
My name is Trudi McCanna,
and it's my pleasure

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.410
to welcome you to today's
Talks at Google event featuring

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.030
best-selling author, educator,
and consultant Rachel Simmons.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.610
As the mother of an
11-year-old girl,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.100
I've been a big fan of
Rachel's for a few years now.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.980
And I found her work
invaluable as I've

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.380
worked to understand and
help my daughter navigate

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.330
the challenges of
growing up today.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.390
And let me tell you,
there are more than a few.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.130
I've also been a
little bit surprised

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.010
to find that Rachel's
lessons and teachings have

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.290
been so relevant to
my own life, because--

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.950
shocker-- it turns out the
challenges that girls face

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.070
don't just stop at the
end of adolescence.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.790
So really happy Rachel's
here to join us today.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.150
A bit more about Rachel.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.180
She is "The New York
Times" best-selling

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.060
author of the books "Odd
Girl Out" and "The Curse

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.500
of the Good Girl."

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.710
Her most recent book, which
she'll be talking about with us

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.430
today, is "Enough As She Is -
How to Help Girls Move Beyond

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.480
Impossible Standards of
Success to Live Healthy, Happy,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.420
and Fulfilling Lives."

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.400
Pretty cool.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.050
Rachel is also an educator.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.000
She consults
nationally on women's

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.360
professional development, and
is a national spokesperson

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.570
for the Always Like a
Girl and Keds Brave Life

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.370
project campaigns.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.100
She was the host of the
PBS television special

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.280
"A Girl's Life," and her writing
has appeared in the "Washington

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.670
Post," "Atlantic Slate,"
and "The New York Times."

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.210
Rachel is a regular contributor
to "Good Morning America"

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.580
and appears often in
the national media.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.760
"Odd Girl Out" was adapted into
a highly acclaimed Lifetime

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.890
Television movie.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.670
Rachel co-founded the national
nonprofit Girls Leadership,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.410
and that's actually
very important,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.910
and important as
an organization,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.250
because what it does is
it takes the research

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.990
and work that she's
done, and puts it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.260
into actual,
practical application.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.380
We're lucky that Simone, who
co-founded Girls Leadership

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.940
and is the executive director,
is here with us today.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.773
And we'll have the
opportunity to learn more

00:02:09.773 --> 00:02:11.585
about that amazing
organization as well

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.840
at the end of Rachel's talk.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.740
We will have some time for Q&amp;A.
For those of you on livestream,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.870
there is a Dory available.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.957
It is go/rachelsimmons-dory.

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:25.790
And for those of you
who have books in hand,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.498
Rachel has kindly
offered to stick around

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:30.250
after the talk at the back
of the room to sign them.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.220
With that, please join me
in welcoming Rachel Simmons.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:37.990
RACHEL SIMMONS: Thanks, Trudi.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.460
Thank you.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.280
Hello, it is a pleasure
to be with you today.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.460
I want to thank Google, and
Google Talks, and Trudi McCanna

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.990
for putting this together.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.390
So I want to talk with you
both as potential parents

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.910
in the audience, but
also as individuals.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.730
Because as Trudy said,
there's no question

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.550
that a lot of what I write
about not only applies to girls

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.510
but applies to grownups,
applies to boys and men.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.110
And I have had that pointed
out to me many, many times

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.280
over the last four weeks.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.080
I've been touring this
book all over the country.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.830
Today's actually the last
day of my tour, so woo-hoo.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.630
And so yeah, so I really--

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.250
and if I'm honest, so
much of what I write about

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.710
comes from personal
challenges that I myself

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.020
have been navigating and
trying to make peace with.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.820
And so with that, I
encourage you to listen

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.710
with lots of different hats.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.650
Today, what I'd like to explore
with you in the 30 minutes

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.290
or so that I have to talk
with you are three things.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.270
One is to talk about ways
that the culture has changed

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.760
for girls since we were teens.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.590
Two is I want to be a translator
for you of some of what I would

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.490
say are the more toxic messages
about success that girls are

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.330
getting, because I think it's
very important that we as

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.060
advocates for girls, as
educators, as teachers,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.610
as parents, that we learn
how to talk back to some

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.770
of those messages, so
that we can shield them

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.340
from those messages.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.660
And finally, what are the
skills that you both need.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.880
Meaning you, both
parent and girl,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.600
need to help her redefine
success in some healthy ways.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.399
So let's start off with a couple
of changes that have occurred

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.180
since I was younger, although I
kind of want to start with even

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.534
an earlier change,
meaning something that's

00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:26.700
been around for a long time.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.090
And I'm going to ask the
members of the audience

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.350
to do a brief exercise.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.790
I promise there won't be
anything else after this.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.620
You could be totally
just hanging out.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.890
But if you could,
sit as you would

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.760
imagine a typical guy
sits in his chair.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.082
How do you--

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:43.540
OK, so everybody-- for those
he live streaming, everybody's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.500
manspreading right now.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.930
Everyone is spreading out.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.260
And then how do you think a
typical girl sits in her chair?

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.960
There's no more laughing,
just if you can't hear.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.400
The typical girl posture--

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.330
everyone is starting
to contract.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.930
Everyone's sitting up
straight, crossing their legs,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.790
looking like they're
being watched.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.710
And yeah, you guys were
totally manspreading

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.240
during the man thing.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.220
And I love that
activity because I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.460
think it illustrates what
people would call gender norms--

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.950
some of the unwritten rules
that girls and guys grow up

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.250
with about how you're
supposed to act.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.180
And what I also like
about that activity--

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.450
and it's a great one to
do with your own family--

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.990
is it allows us
to think not just

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.290
about the space that guys
might be given to take up

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.540
with their bodies, but
also with their voices,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.340
and their opinions,
and their appetites.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.980
Because when I ask you
to sit like a girl,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.860
everyone suddenly gets smaller.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.260
And so there are also
messages that girls

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.020
get about the permission they
should be taking up or not

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.840
taking up, the space that they
should be taking up or not

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.900
taking up with their
voices and their opinions.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.770
And why does this matter?

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.250
Well, it matters
because, in addition

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.180
to this pressure that girls get
not to take up too much space,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.670
we have also said to
girls, hey, guess what?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.440
You can go do and be anything.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.330
So we've said to
girls, would you

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.950
like to go now be an engineer?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.730
Fantastic.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.230
Would you like to
go work at Google,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.500
and study cognitive
science, and do robotics?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.090
Absolutely awesome.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.580
What we haven't done is
we haven't said to them,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.530
but you don't have to worry
about being liked anymore.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.110
You don't have to worry about
pleasing others anymore.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.443
You don't have to worry about
having that perfect bikini

00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:19.550
body anymore.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.580
What psychologists call what
girls are facing right now

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.990
is role overload, which
basically means too many roles

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.910
for one person to play.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.690
Role overload is linked to a lot
of stress, as you can imagine.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.730
You may be surprised--
or not-- to learn

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.680
that adolescent
girls get the least

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.320
sleep of any group of youth.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.480
And I honestly think
that this is in part

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.570
due to the expectation
that you not just be smart,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.780
but you also better get one
like per minute on Instagram.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.130
God help you if you don't.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.100
You also need to be
involved in activities.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.220
You need to be
captain of a team.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.940
And that is fatiguing, it
leads to early burnout,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.270
and it also creates what
researchers call role conflict.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.550
So in other words,
in a 24-hour day,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.920
what it takes to have the
bikini body that you want--

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.860
I keep saying bikini body
because if you open up

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.500
Instagram--

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.580
even this week, there's a lot
of young people on spring break.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.155
And I actually
follow a lot of them.

00:07:17.155 --> 00:07:19.530
And luckily, they usually
forget that I'm following them,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.100
so I can learn.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.900
But there's a ton of
bikini pictures coming out.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.410
And it's all about look at
me, and look at my body.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.770
And it's a very specific kind
of body that's being shown off.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.020
And what we're finding,
actually, in the research

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.190
is that--

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.850
whereas it used to be that
when I was 100 years ago--

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.134
a teenager--

00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:41.300
and I wanted to look at
somebody's cute little body,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.250
I would have to go
to the grocery store.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.650
I'd have to buy a magazine.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.382
I'd have to look at a celebrity.

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.590
What's different for girls
is that all you have to do

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.751
is open your phone.

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:52.250
And not only are you going to
see the bodies of celebrities,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.880
but you're also going to see
the bodies of your friends.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.820
And that can create, and
that is creating, body shame.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.790
That is creating concern
and a loss of confidence

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.580
in their own body.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.464
So these are some of the things
that are really different.

00:08:06.464 --> 00:08:08.630
Another thing that I would
call as different as what

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.810
I like to affectionately
call the college application

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.850
industrial complex.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.940
And by that, I mean the
very intense pressure

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.280
that girls face almost from
middle school at this point,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.050
this sort of message they
get that if they don't craft

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.220
themselves into the most perfect
specimen worthy of college

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.860
admission, they are going
to lead mediocre lives.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.309
They really get this
pressure that they

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.110
have to be absolutely amazing
at everything they do.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.530
And if they don't, I don't
know, cure a major disease

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.360
in their science project
in middle school,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.610
they're going to leave
very unhappy lives.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.660
And what they feel is that
their whole worthiness

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.685
is kind of riding on
that day, whether or not

00:08:49.685 --> 00:08:51.810
they get accepted into the
college of their choice.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.500
And I think what it's doing
is it's sending them some very

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.260
toxic messages about success.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.110
One of them is the expectation
that they be amazing

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.030
at everything that they do.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.790
What can you say to girls--
and, frankly, to ourselves--

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.100
about this expectation?

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.430
I mean, first of all, there's
absolutely no way that we can

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.260
be amazing at everything we do.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.070
No way.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.580
And in fact, if you
expect yourself always--

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.340
what I do with girls
is I sort of say,

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.320
if you always expect
yourself to be up here,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.160
you are invariably going to
feel that you are not enough.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.200
You will feel that
you are less than.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.400
You will feel that you,
in the moment as you are,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.990
are not worthy.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.030
And it is impossible
to try to be

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.810
amazing at everything you do.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.905
And when you try, in addition
to feeling that self-criticism,

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:41.780
the other thing that
happens is that you feel

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.760
like you can't take any risks.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.250
And as I speak at a
place like Google,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.000
I feel like Google is all about
taking risks, asking questions,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.610
being curious.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.190
And if you feel that
you have to play it safe

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.680
because you can't mess
up, because you've

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.390
got to get that
perfect resume, you've

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.710
got to have that perfect GPA,
your muscle for risk-taking,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:09.200
your ability to comfortably face
uncertainty, that will atrophy.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.180
And I think what we
want for our girls--

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.650
if you really want
to be brave, you

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.510
have to regularly put yourself
out there in small ways.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.170
I'm not a big believer in
the Eleanor Roosevelt saying,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.662
"Do something every
day that scares you."

00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:26.120
Because I'm kind of like, who
wants to be scared every day?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.260
Do you guys want to
be scared every day?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.460
I'm not down with
that, personally.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.560
No, I would like to be a
little nervous every day.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.250
I could do that.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.710
I could get with that.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.420
That was my long-winded
way of saying

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.860
that comfort with risk-taking
happens through small things

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.920
that we do all the time
to challenge ourselves.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.240
When girls are
trying to be perfect,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.450
they lose comfort
with risk-taking,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.475
and it diminishes their courage.

00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:52.940
The other thing that happens
is what I affectionately

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.360
call a mass nationwide
adolescent hallucination,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.600
that all my friends are doing
and being more than I am.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.210
In other words, girls are
often taken with the sense

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.930
that obviously all my
friends are smarter than me,

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.520
all my friends are
doing more than me,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.870
they're cooler than I am.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.420
And I think it's super
important to talk

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.240
to girls about the kind of
futility of that attitude,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.240
because the reason why
you think everyone's

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.550
doing more than you is
because you don't feel enough.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.110
If you're trying to get up
here all the time, of course

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.026
you're looking over your
shoulder, being like,

00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.460
who's coming up behind me?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.230
One of the most
common questions I've

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.390
been asked on the
road for this tour

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.250
has come from girls
who come to my talk.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.890
And they say, what am I
supposed to do about the fact

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.470
that I don't feel happy for
my friends when they succeed?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.970
What do I do about
the fact that there's

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.920
a competition between me and my
friends where I don't feel good

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.170
about it, and we're
not talking about it,

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.450
and it's eating away
at our relationship?

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.880
Now, I think this
is a warning sign

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.210
in terms of when we think about
women supporting other women.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.490
If girls are operating
from a belief

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.620
that even their
friends are potentially

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.210
threats to their own success--

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.795
again, stemming from that sense
that they are not enough--

00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:08.170
what does that
mean for how women

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.560
support each other later on?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.964
So there are quite a few--

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:14.380
I wouldn't call
them side effects,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.450
but there are real
consequences to what's

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.570
happening around the culture
in terms of that pressure

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.720
to be admitted to a four-year
college or university.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.310
So what are some things you can
say to the girl in your life

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.870
who might be struggling?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.040
I have been totally blown away
by how much the following makes

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.040
a difference to a
teenager's well-being.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.720
Saying to them, I don't think
this is your fault, what

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.770
you're going through.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.070
In other words, a lot of
teenagers-- girls and guys--

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.790
who are overwhelmed
by anxiety and stress,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.380
they're very convinced that--

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.380
what's wrong with me that
I can't overcome this.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.830
What's wrong with me
that I can't keep up.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.500
And to say to a
teenager, you know what?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.410
What's wrong has very
little to do with you,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.500
and much more to do with
how broken this culture is

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.560
around achievement and
success, and the pressures

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.140
that it's putting on you, it's
transformative for a teenager.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.340
And I don't want to
oversimplify my work,

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.980
but I do believe that when
you can make a teenager

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.380
feel like they're not the only
one suffering from something--

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.800
and I think we all can feel
the benefits of that awareness.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.250
But when you can tell
her, this isn't just you,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.150
it makes a huge difference.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.120
The other thing I
think we need to say

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.844
is we don't want
to tell them, why

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:35.010
are you guys putting so
much pressure on yourselves?

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.017
I know I was told that many
years ago by my parents.

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:40.350
And I actually wrote an article
in the "Washington Post"

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.360
about a month ago
about this very thing.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.670
And in it, I really
call on parents

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.490
to stop telling their kids
that they put too much pressure

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.800
on themselves, and here's why.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.130
When you say that to a
kid, the implication is,

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.720
if you could just
chill, everything

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.730
would be fine, because
it's just all you.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.530
You're just doing this yourself.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.799
When, in fact, we know--

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:01.590
and hopefully I've
convinced you somewhat--

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.040
that this is a cultural issue.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.130
This is something
much bigger than what

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.350
one kid is doing to herself.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.370
And it's actually much
more helpful to your kid

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.820
to hear that everybody
is struggling right now.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.520
And you could have a
really peaceful home.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.250
Let me be clear.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.570
You could have an amazing
house that is like super zen

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.490
and very spa-like, and you
really are putting pressure

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:24.990
on your kid.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.090
And I totally believe
you that you're not.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.240
However, the second your
kid walks out of your house,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.860
she is flooded with that stress.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.850
So it's not about what
she's doing to herself.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.700
I want to talk about
impostor syndrome right now.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.730
This is a picture of Maya
Angelou, who is obviously

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.450
a giant of a human
being, and a writer,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.370
and a poet, and so many things.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.920
She has been very public
about her struggle

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.000
with imposter syndrome.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.420
And she believes and
has said that she

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.120
has this abiding fear
that at some point

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.390
she's going to be found out.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.344
And when she's found
out, everyone's

00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:02.760
going to see that she's not
nearly as smart or as talented

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.260
as everyone thinks.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.900
Well, one of the great surprises
of my research with girls

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.050
has been the extent to which
imposter syndrome is with them

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.130
from a very early age.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.890
In fact, I discovered
research that

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:18.180
said that it's firmly
in place by adolescence.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.270
I work on a college campus, and
I ask my students all the time

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.220
to finish this sentence.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.340
I say, sometimes I worry
that I'm not as blank

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.620
as other people think I am.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.750
And I've also started
doing the same with adults.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.600
The most common response, the
most common fill in the blank,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.380
is I worry that I'm not as smart
as other people think I am.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.420
So what do we say to our kids--

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.460
and to ourselves,
because, my goodness,

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.140
I also struggle with
imposter syndrome for sure,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.282
and relatively frequently.

00:15:47.282 --> 00:15:49.740
I was going to joke between
meals, but not that frequently.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.110
But a lot.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.410
When that voice comes
up inside of us, when

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.560
we hear that voice that says,
you don't deserve to be here,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.770
you don't belong here, you
don't have what it takes,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.430
we have to talk back to it.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.870
And we do this in two ways.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.600
One is we realize that this
voice is a voice inside of us,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.400
but it's not the
voice that is us.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.500
It's not you.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.120
It's the small, scared part
of you that rears its head,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.980
but it does not
mean that it is you.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.700
So we really need to teach not
only our kids but ourselves

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.650
that that's a
recurring part of us,

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.030
but we don't
over-identify with it.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.840
And the second thing
you do is you name it.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.810
I have one student who named
her imposter voice Lester,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.850
which I thought was hilarious.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.920
And so she'd be like,
yo, Lester, I got this.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.910
You step off, OK?

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.432
Like, Lester, I hear you.

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:42.390
I hear you telling me
that I'm not smart enough

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.220
to be in this AP class, or
I'm not whatever it is enough.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.920
Chill, dude.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.970
Just have a seat.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.780
And so when you talk back to--

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.040
and you name-- that voice, it
actually gives you an ability

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.770
to separate yourself from it.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.940
Gratitude is a very
powerful practice

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.430
that research tells
us does everything

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.490
from help us sleep
better at night,

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.450
boost our immune systems,
and elevate our wellness.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.640
And basically, what
this sounds like is

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.950
a kind of simple
acknowledgment, which

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.140
you can do any
time, of what it is

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.599
you are grateful for right now.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:22.859
It does not have to be epic
or polished or important

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.391
beyond I'm happy
the sun came out.

00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:27.349
You know what I'm grateful
for today, honestly?

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.973
I was staying in Mill
Valley last night

00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:31.680
because I spoke
there for my book.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.250
I woke up.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.630
I didn't have time to
go to the gym, which

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.120
was five minutes away, and
there was a terrible storm

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.850
here last night.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.880
And somehow it stopped raining,
and I got to go run outside.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.844
And a few minutes after I came
back in, it started pouring.

00:17:44.844 --> 00:17:46.260
And I just took a
moment and said,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.620
I'm so grateful that I got to
get my heart rate up today.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.520
That's enough.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.570
That's enough.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.710
When we can, in small moments,
say this thing that happened,

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.760
that's enough for me, it
allows us to be on the ground

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.630
instead of going up here.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.380
It allows us to affirm
what matters right now.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.070
But we also have to be
willing to buy into the fact

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.540
that the small things count.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.970
And I think a gradual
practice-- and I

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.400
want to say practice because
it's just like that muscle

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.261
that we have to flex
for risk-taking.

00:18:17.261 --> 00:18:18.760
It's just like the
do something that

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.350
makes you nervous every day.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.140
We're not talking about
becoming like a zen monk.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.317
We're talking about
you're driving to work.

00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:27.400
What are you grateful for?

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.870
Just stop and think about it.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.440
And this can open up
something inside of you--

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.260
a place of appreciation
that can make you

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.270
feel enough in this
very moment right now.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.020
And it's been very powerful
for me and my young daughter

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.680
as well.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.210
Well, I hope it's
powerful for her.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.692
I might just be hallucinating,
but I'm hoping that it is.

00:18:47.692 --> 00:18:49.150
There are a couple
of things that I

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.600
want to cover in this talk
beyond some of the smaller

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.850
pieces of advice that I've given
you that are, in the research,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.030
considered very palliative
factors in adolescent wellness.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.770
One of them is purpose.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.540
So what's purpose?

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.820
Having a sense of
purpose in your life

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.780
means that you do
something that you're into.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.760
You really like doing
this, pursuing this goal.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.900
But this particular goal or this
thing that you're involved in

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.300
connects you to something
bigger than you.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.610
It's not like a
self-oriented goal.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.810
So let's just think of
something purposeful, something

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.990
that makes an impact on
the world in some way.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.650
I mean, it could
be volunteering.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.680
It could also be
creating an app.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.720
It doesn't mean that it has
to be public service oriented.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.470
I was on a public radio show
in the Bay Area yesterday.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.420
A caller phoned in
and talked about how

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.480
his daughter, who had
been riven with anxiety,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.280
discovered juggling.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.750
And once she
discovered juggling,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.830
she began traveling and juggling
for underserved children,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.510
and that this healed her.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.190
And that's a sense of purpose.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.920
She was part of something
bigger than herself.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.130
Contrast that with
the kid who says,

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.320
my goal is to get good grades.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.650
My goal is to be accepted
into a brand name college.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.040
My goal is to score a
perfect score on the SAT.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.760
People who are driven
by self-oriented goals

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.690
tend to be less happy.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.370
They also tend to
be less resilient.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.500
I'll tell you who else,
actually, just to--

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.180
I want to deviate
from this purpose,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.080
or digress from this purpose,
conversation for just a moment

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.540
to say that there are two
other differences that I

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.040
want to talk with
you about in terms

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.620
of types of goals you pursue.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.230
So Carol Dweck, who is
a psychologist based

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.050
at Stanford University
who studies motivation,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.500
talks about the difference
between pursuing a performance

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.690
goal and a learning goal.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.380
Now, a performance goal is when
you undertake something because

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.870
of the approval that you
might get from others,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.800
or because you wish
to avoid failure.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.862
A learning goal,
which-- spoiler alert--

00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:57.070
is what we want girls to
have, and what we should all

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.640
be trying to pursue
more than anything,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.500
is when you undertake
a goal because you're

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.670
trying to master something.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.910
You undertake this
thing because you really

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.110
want to learn about it.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.240
So for example, I want to
master the past tense in French.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.440
That's a learning goal.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.990
I want to get an A in French
is a performance goal.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.860
Now, there's nothing wrong with
performance goes on there face.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.740
It's totally fine
to want to strive

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.660
for attention and reward.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.420
But that can't be the primary
thing that drives you.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.260
Definitely not.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.200
Because for those people
who are driven primarily

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.530
by performance goals, they
are also less resilient.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.660
They are also more unhappy.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.850
Now, why are you
less tough if you're

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.530
driven by a performance goal?

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.700
Well, think about it.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.030
If what is driving you
isn't coming from within,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.930
isn't inspired by a
kind of genuine desire

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.420
that comes intrinsically
from within you,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.460
it's so much easier
to knock you over.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.100
So you have a setback, and
because you're more invested

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.190
in what other people
think, it's so much easier

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.440
to get knocked over,
because you don't

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.320
have the grounding
in your own desire

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.010
and in your own motivation.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.600
So what that means for you
as parents, or for yourself

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.640
as you pursue your own
goals, is to say, hey,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.740
am I doing this
because I want to?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.500
Or because I feel
like I have to?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.050
Are you taking that class,
you could say to your kid,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.210
because you really want
to learn this thing?

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.730
Or are you doing it because
you think it looks good?

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.610
And again, nothing wrong
with wanting to look good,

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.420
but that can't be the
primary reason why.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.600
A purposeful life is
on the decline in terms

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.160
of goals of adolescents.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.980
Adolescents are increasingly
saying, I want to make money,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.040
I want to get a great job, and
I want to go to a good college.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.846
The percentage of
students who say,

00:22:43.846 --> 00:22:45.220
I want to lead a
meaningful life,

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.590
has experienced a steep decline.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.830
And researchers believe
this is absolutely related

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.400
to the decline in
wellness in teenagers.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.800
When you are with your daughter,
and if your daughter-- or you,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800
honestly, because what I'm
about to say absolutely

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.220
comes to my own mind as I
stand in the face of a risk.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.470
But if you want to get your
kid to do something that's

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.140
challenging to her, if you
yourself want to take a leap,

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.836
there are three questions
that work really well.

00:23:15.836 --> 00:23:18.210
One is, what do you think the
worst that could happen is?

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.520
And I want to
clarify here, girls

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.302
are particularly
good at telling you

00:23:22.302 --> 00:23:23.760
the absolute worst
thing that could

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.920
happen on a catastrophic level.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.840
And so I want to
just sort of amend

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.100
this by saying actual
worst that can happen,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.350
not catastrophe worst
that could happen.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.690
Because girls are such
good catastrophizers.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.770
And then, can you live with it?

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.760
So for example-- and I say
this, too, because I know

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.980
a lot of girls who don't
want to take risks.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.080
They don't want to raise
their hands unless they

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.770
have the right answer.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.680
They don't want to
try out for the play

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.630
because they're afraid
they won't get a part.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.974
They have application fear.

00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:54.390
I don't want to
apply for that job

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.940
because I'm afraid I won't
get it, or that internship,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.406
or that fellowship.

00:23:58.406 --> 00:24:00.780
And so we say to them, what
is the worst that can happen,

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.640
and can you live with that?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.560
It's very rare that
I have a student who

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.360
says, no, I can't live it that.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.970
Most people, once they
really are willing to look

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.670
the consequence-- not the
catastrophe consequence,

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.810
the legit one--

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.280
in the eye, they're like,
yeah, I could live with that.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.700
Another question that has
been profoundly helpful for me

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.130
personally is, as you stand
in the face of a challenge,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.390
a risk, you're going to put
yourself out there in some way,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.390
you say to yourself, what is
the minimum benefit that I

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.770
could get from this thing?

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.020
What's the least good
thing that could come out

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.890
of this experience?

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.640
And I feel extremely strongly
about what I'm about to say.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.120
If you want yourself-- or
if you want your daughter--

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.340
to resist perfectionism, we
have to help them appreciate

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.230
the beauty of the process.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.410
We have to help them appreciate
that there are always

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:54.780
unanticipated benefits,
lessons, moments of inspiration

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.930
and wisdom that come
when we least expect it,

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.040
that come when the big moment
of glory doesn't arrive.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.440
So that even if you
don't get into that play,

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.440
or you get a crappy chorus
part, and wow, that's a bummer,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.720
and I'm sorry, there
are other benefits

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.470
that come from this experience.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.260
You make new friends.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.910
You learn a new skill.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.830
You learn that you
can stick stuff

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.770
out that's not what you
thought it was going to be.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.410
I think that when
we all imagine--

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.670
if you think to yourself, what
in the face of an obstacle

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.870
have I learned?

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.970
What from a heartbreak
have I gained?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.750
We ask ourselves this
question as adults.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.990
The same kind of wisdom
will accrue to our children.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.910
We have to have
faith that it will.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.470
I think as parents,
you don't want

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.330
them to be suffering, right?

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.810
We don't want our children
to be in anguish in any way.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.600
And yet the same wisdom
and strength and courage

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.870
that we have gained
from our own obstacles

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.110
will also come in due
time to our children.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.480
And we have to have
patience with that,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.310
create space for that.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.830
Because ultimately, if
all we are driven by

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.070
is the big polished
finish, is the outcome,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.500
is the college essay-worthy
moment, then of course

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.460
our children will be
addicted to perfection.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.010
Two more things I want
to say before I hand it

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.430
over to Simone Marean
from Girls Leadership.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.800
Parents need to practice
what psychologists

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.680
call self-regulation just
as much as our kids do.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.120
Just as much as
we expect our kids

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.760
to keep it together, we also,
as parents, have to do that.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.420
And that's because it's really
hard to watch our teenagers

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.550
goes through the ups and
downs, the chaos of this time.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.360
So here are three
things you can do.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.010
One, remember she is
still watching you.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.740
I say this because
teenagers are exceptionally

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.380
good at acting like they
do not care at best what

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.070
you say, and think you're
clueless and stupid at worst.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.630
And it's very
important to remember

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.940
that even if you think
your child doesn't

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.950
want to connect with you
anymore, it's not that.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.360
It's the way she
wants to connect

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.439
with you is deeply
unsatisfying, often is the case.

00:26:57.439 --> 00:26:59.730
I'm just going to be assuming
that one here is laughing

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.360
on the inside about that one.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.300
But anyway, I still
think it's funny.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.950
Thank you, Trudi, for laughing.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.150
Anyway, my point is that
your teenager is absolutely

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.740
still connected to you.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.540
They still want to
know what you think.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.120
And the way that you
react as a parent

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.840
in the face of a problem, they
are absolutely downloading.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.420
They are mimicking it,
too, in the sense that--

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.090
just like they used to mimic
the words you say when they were

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.980
little, they are now
starting to mimic

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.950
how do you respond to
distress, how do you respond

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.240
when things don't go your way.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.010
They are watching us.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.890
And we do have to be careful
with how much anxiety we

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.150
bring into our
conversations with them.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.870
Number two, share your mistakes.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.280
Do not imagine that being a
good role model to your kid

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.840
is about acting like you
never do anything wrong.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.900
When you do that, when you don't
tell them about your setbacks,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.600
they think that
it's not OK for them

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.280
to experience them themselves.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.340
And worse, or
maybe related, they

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.440
become afraid to tell you
about their own mistakes.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.560
Number three, ask
yourself this question.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.900
And this is a shout out to
Sheryl Sandberg's question

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.180
and "Lean In," when she posed
the question, what would

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.010
you do if you weren't afraid?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.879
When you stand in the face of
deep anxiety around your child,

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:13.920
when you look at something
that's not going well,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.320
and you say, this
thing happened.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.030
What if this means blank?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.790
Because I think parents can
also catastrophize, right?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.370
We can also say something
went wrong here.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.844
What if this means
globally that she's not

00:28:25.844 --> 00:28:26.760
going to make friends?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.080
What if this means
she's not that smart?

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.770
What if this means she
doesn't go to a good college?

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.520
As parents, we have
to check ourselves.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.170
We've got to walk that back down
away from the global anxiety,

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.710
down to what's really happening.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.370
And one of the best ways to
do that is to ask yourself,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.390
all right, if I knew that
everything was going to be OK,

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.270
if I knew that whatever
is freaking me out right

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.190
now about my kid was
going to be fine,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.260
if I could practice
faith and optimism,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.740
if I were not afraid, how would
you parent if you were not

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.460
afraid?

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.880
The choices that we make in that
moment when we're not afraid

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.920
are so much wiser.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.140
They are choices we're much
more likely to be proud

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.290
of than when we make choices
from a place of fear,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:12.260
and what if, and what does
this mean, and anxiety.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.200
The last thing I want
to introduce you to

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.940
is self-compassion.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.720
Self-compassion is a second,
strongly research-based

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.000
palliative factor
for adolescents.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.490
It is the practice of
being gentle with yourself

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.140
in the face of a challenge.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.380
Now, many people think that
gentleness with yourself

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.330
in the face of a
challenge is not

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.940
only a way of being
lazy about your problems

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.149
but also could result
in complete paralysis,

00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:39.440
because who would possibly
be motivated if they weren't

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.370
being mean to themselves?

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.180
These are all common
responses to self-compassion.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.700
Responses I should say
I had myself for sure

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.470
when I first encountered it.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.350
In fact, what self-compassion
is about is not

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.720
pretending that
something didn't happen,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.040
or taking responsibility.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.216
It's basically about saying,
yeah, something happened.

00:29:58.216 --> 00:29:59.840
I don't feel good
about it, but I'm not

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.570
going to trade away my
self-worth in the process

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.750
of dealing with it.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.030
I also want to add that research
shows that self-compassion does

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.770
not diminish motivation,
and it doesn't

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.485
diminish performance standards.

00:30:11.485 --> 00:30:12.360
So here's what it is.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.860
Here's how it works.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.990
There are three steps that
were developed by University

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.380
of Texas at Austin Professor
Kristin Neff who has a book

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.910
of the same name,
"Self-Compassion,"

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:23.990
a wonderful website--

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.610
of course, a TED Talk.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.070
And the three steps
work this way,

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.260
and I am going to teach
them by telling the Google

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.390
world about something
that happened to me,

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.000
and how I learned to
practice self-compassion.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.820
So the first step
is mindfulness.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.750
Now, several years ago, I was
really, royally, and radically

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.750
dumped.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.270
And I went into a total tailspin
about what this meant about me.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.360
So I am also an excellent
catastrophizer--

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.530
recovering now.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.720
So I went into this
place of, obviously,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.720
I'm a broken human being who's
going to die alone with dogs.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.680
Not cats, because
I'm allergic to cats,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.320
but I think you
get my reference.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.240
And clearly nothing
good will ever

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.010
happen to me again in my life.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.600
So that's not mindful, right?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.700
Mindful is not catastrophizing.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.580
Mindfulness means, all right,
something bad happened.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.770
What do I really feel right now?

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.690
What is my actual emotion?

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.310
Not the denial or
the catastrophe.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.190
I feel sad.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:20.630
I'm grieving.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.320
And the next-- well, this
week, probably the next year

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.330
is going to be
really hard for me.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.100
The second step
of self-compassion

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.210
is self-kindness.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.770
This is hard for
a lot of people.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.420
Deceptively simple.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.720
And this basically means if you
had a really close friend who

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.630
you loved who was being mean
to themselves in the way

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.550
that you were being
mean to you, what

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.410
would you say to your friend?

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.790
Because the reality
is, aren't we

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.800
so much nicer to other people?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.610
We show other people
so much more grace

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.290
than we show ourselves.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.847
So this is a thing.

00:31:50.847 --> 00:31:53.180
I also do this, by the way,
by channeling one of my best

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.460
friends, who I call my
unicorn friend because she's

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.830
like so much nicer sometimes,
I think, than I am.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.413
I'm like, why are
you friends with me,

00:31:59.413 --> 00:32:00.560
because you're so nice?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.060
Do you ever have a
friend like that?

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.268
I call her my unicorn friend.

00:32:03.268 --> 00:32:04.520
Trudi actually knows her.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.640
And I imagine what my
friend Daniela would say

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.740
to me, because she's so nice.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.390
And I think, what
would Daniela say?

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.010
I've got to say that to myself.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.180
And then the third step
of self-compassion--

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.980
another really powerful step--

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.420
is common humanity.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.580
And what that
means is, are there

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.560
other people who
might be suffering

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.910
the way I'm suffering?

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.280
Am I the only one
who's ever been dumped?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.070
Thank you, Google, for telling
me that heartbreak advice gets

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.300
1.5 million hits.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.580
Google was
instrumental in helping

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.210
me understand I was not alone.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:37.610
So thank you, Google.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.620
Seriously, I promise
you, I did this.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.940
And when you know you're
not alone, it is so helpful.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.780
The feeling of aloneness and
isolation that so many of us

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.330
have exacerbates shame.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.270
It makes us not want
to solve a problem.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.020
And so reminding ourselves we
do have a shared experience

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.240
of suffering, we are
not by ourselves,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.220
is absolutely powerful.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.680
So following these
three steps, I strongly

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.120
encourage you to practice this.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.010
You can do it in the
middle of the night.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.500
If you ever wake up, you had
an extra glass of red wine,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.580
you woke up at 2:00
in the morning--

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.580
I'm not saying I've
experienced that personally.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.030
Of course I have.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.120
And you walk yourself
through these three steps.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.980
You walk yourself,
and you practice, just

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.690
like you practice risk-taking.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.480
Just like you
practice gratitude.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.360
The bottom line is
that we all have

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.180
to be able to access why
we are enough as we are.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.590
And one of the best ways to
do that is to ask yourself,

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.310
what about me is
valuable and of worth

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.920
beyond my external
standards of success?

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.170
Beyond my salary,
beyond my position,

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.530
beyond the accomplishments
that I may want to share,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.060
or that I think define me?

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.020
What beyond those standards
makes me enough as I am?

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.180
And when you know that,
you can be stronger

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.690
than you ever thought possible.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.830
Thank you very much.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.320
Thank you.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.210
So I'd like to turn over the
mic to Simone Marean, my dear

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.380
friend, my colleague, who is
fiercely committed to making

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.310
sure that every girl, no
matter what her income

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.219
level or background, has
the power and the skills

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:17.810
to exercise the
power of her voice.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.560
So I want to introduce
everyone to Simone,

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.040
the CEO and co-founder
of Girls Leadership.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.170
SIMONE MAREAN:
Thank you, Rachel.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.730
Our mission at
Girls Leadership is

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.790
to equip girls with
the skills to exercise

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.710
the power of their voice.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.920
And we see this as
the foundational skill

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.190
of leadership no matter
what a girl wants to pursue.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.696
Whether it is coding,
or business, or arts,

00:34:40.696 --> 00:34:43.070
or government, and all the
places where we want our girls

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.719
to have leadership.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.050
And I would like to
say, before telling you

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.730
briefly about who
we are, that I am

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.770
so grateful to be
back at Google,

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.389
and grateful for the support
of Googlers' contributions

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.610
and the matching
program here, which

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.367
has made such a powerful
difference in our work

00:35:01.367 --> 00:35:03.950
every year-- at Girls Leadership
particularly-- in our ability

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.830
to serve girls and schools
in low-income communities.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.470
So thank you for that support.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.000
What makes Girls
Leadership unique

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.220
and the girl-serving space
is really three things.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.140
One is that we are the only
organization to partner with

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.060
the adults' and girls' lives.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.200
What we have found is that
when we teach a girl the skills

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.850
to exercise the
power of her voice,

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.790
but she goes back to a
school or to a family that

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.000
doesn't support that and
doesn't understand her voice,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.170
that what we teach
can be undone.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.450
But if we work with the girl--

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.200
not only the girl but also
her parent, her teacher,

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.730
the caregiver, the auntie,
the nana in her life

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.320
who's giving her
scripts every day

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.750
and giving her
permission, that's true,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.900
sustainable change.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.870
So of the 10,000 people that
we teach in person every year,

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:54.810
over 5,000 of those are the
adults' and girls' lives.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.420
The second thing
that makes us unique

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.640
is that we are really grounded
in emotional intelligence,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.377
which I think is
so much of the work

00:36:01.377 --> 00:36:03.710
that Rachel's been talking
about-- the social, emotional

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:04.210
learning.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:07.790
These invisible skills
and processing that

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:12.050
is the vital foundation
of the external skills

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.470
that we want them to
demonstrate in academics

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.980
or in the workplace.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.760
And so our belief
is that if a girl

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.960
knows what she thinks
and feels and needs,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.290
and she respects it--

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.790
that's the hard
part that many of us

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.190
lose over the course
of adolescence--

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.220
and she has the ability
to express it effectively,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.390
those three things will provide
that foundation for her.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.970
The last piece that
really makes us powerful

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.390
is that we see girls' everyday
relationships as her incubator

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.810
for leadership.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.720
So rather than
saying to the girls,

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.055
if you are chosen as
captain of the team,

00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:49.430
if you are president of the
class, then you are a leader,

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.410
and you have influence.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:55.220
We are instead saying to girls,
leadership is a way of life.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.590
You get to decide in
the countless decisions

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.520
that you make every day whether
you're going to have influence.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.025
When you decide how you
look somebody in the eye.

00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:06.650
Do you raise your hand in class
when you don't know the answer?

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.110
Do you raise your hand in class
when you do know the answer?

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.193
Where do you sit at lunch?

00:37:10.193 --> 00:37:12.050
A high schooler
recently reminded

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:17.150
me, do you eat lunch was a
leadership question that she

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.197
had to face every day.

00:37:18.197 --> 00:37:19.280
Where do you sit at lunch?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.160
All of these countless
decisions are opportunities

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.680
that girls have to build this
self-awareness and agency

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.590
and ability to make change.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.760
So those three things--

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.510
emotional intelligence
is the foundation,

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.420
adults are our partners,
and everyday relationships

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.400
are the incubator--
are what makes

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.430
Girls Leadership who we are.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:45.300
And right now, we're focused
on two strategic initiatives.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.240
One is that we
are looking deeply

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.150
at the experience of
girls and women of color,

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.490
and really trying
to understand how

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:56.570
does race, ethnicity, and
income level impact gender

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.500
expectations.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.440
Because what we're finding
is there's very different

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.710
experiences that girls
have in different cultures.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.440
And if we can gather the
data on that difference,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.400
then we'll be able to reach
the 25 million girls in the US

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.850
where they are across those
infinite differences that

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.409
exist.

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:16.200
So that's the first
thing that we're doing.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.450
And then we're also very much
focused on educator training

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.440
as the vehicle to
scaling our curriculum.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.510
Reaching each girl one
by one is a slow process.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.050
But if we can reach the
educators, the administrators,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.610
the principals, the people
that have power over hundreds,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.500
if not thousands,
of girls' lives,

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.610
that's how we can really move
the dial quickly in the US.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:43.670
And so the last thing
I would like to say is,

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.830
we have a couple
Googlers on our board.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.500
But if anyone would like to
be involved and participate

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.820
in this work, we are very
grateful for the partnership

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.680
and the support of many.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.782
Like Trudi McCanna has been
here over the years for myself.

00:38:57.782 --> 00:38:59.240
So please reach
out to me if you're

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.500
interested in being involved.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:00.999
Thank you.

00:39:05.222 --> 00:39:05.930
Great, thank you.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.600
OK, let's go to Q&amp;A. If you
have a question in the room,

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.106
go ahead and head to the mic.

00:39:10.106 --> 00:39:12.730
And we will be watching the Dory
for anybody who has questions.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.505
Again, it's
go/rachelsimmons/dory.

00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:17.880
TRUDI MCCANNA: Oh, great, we
have a question in the room.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.920
Let's start with that.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.420
Thank you.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.253
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you very much,

00:39:21.253 --> 00:39:22.040
Rachel and Simone.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.980
My question might be--

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.160
either you an answer, probably.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.730
My question is about--

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.330
so I observed this
tendency among-- so I have

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.190
an eight-year-old girl myself.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.240
And I observed this
tendency for her

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.050
to quickly identify
her BFF at school,

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.990
and sort of constrain
her relationship

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.060
with this small
number of friends.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.750
So even if she is sitting next
to another eight-year-old girl

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:49.340
that she just met today--

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.580
if she was a boy, then I think
there's more tendency for them

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.440
to kind of play along
with others, as long

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.150
as this kid is well behaving,
but my girl wouldn't talk.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.290
So I'm not sure if
this is good or bad.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.440
Caring more about
relationship is good,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.140
but not expanding it is bad.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.080
So I'm not sure how this
will pan out in her future.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.090
So I wanted to
get your thoughts.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.442
RACHEL SIMMONS: I think
this is a Simone question.

00:40:17.442 --> 00:40:18.650
SIMONE MAREAN: The BFF thing?

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.733
RACHEL SIMMONS: Yeah, Do
you want to come up here,

00:40:20.733 --> 00:40:23.360
and we'll do a
little duet on the?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.110
SIMONE MAREAN: Songs
I don't have to sing.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.970
RACHEL SIMMONS: Will you
sing "Islands in the Stream"?

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:27.720
No?

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.220
SIMONE MAREAN: Yeah,
I mean, there's

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.080
incredible pressure on
girls to find that BFF,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.550
and to find her on the
first day of kindergarten.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.050
And it's at eye contact, and
there's rainbows and glitter,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:37.550
right?

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.230
RACHEL SIMMONS:
My Little Ponies.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.563
SIMONE MAREAN: Yes, jump around.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.640
And the cost of that is--

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.920
the BFF rules are basically
you like all the same things,

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.100
you do everything together,
and you never fight right?

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.280
Any of us as adults, if we can
imagine a 24-hour relationship

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.840
where we like all
the same things,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.520
we do everything
together, and we never

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.550
fight, this myth is the
biggest setup of all time,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.037
because of course all those
things are going to happen.

00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:05.870
So I think it is important
that we dismantle

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.720
that myth for girls,
and we really teach them

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.300
what healthy
relationships look like,

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.970
and how to navigate
disagreements,

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.200
and how to make
people feel included.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.870
I have a six-year-old
son, and it's still

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.290
every day giving him
scripts and teaching him

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.570
about the impact of his
relationship choices.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.510
And so when he doesn't talk
to that person next to him,

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.050
how does that make them feel?

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.740
And I call it
leadership behavior.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.290
When you have influence, and
when you reach out to somebody,

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:37.697
and when you're
inclusive, what's

00:41:37.697 --> 00:41:39.530
that change that you're
making in the world?

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.740
And that they can take on that
bigger label and that bigger

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.130
meaning of their actions.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.480
So it is important to look
at that myth and that gender

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.520
expectation,
dismantle it, and help

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.010
her build the full set of
skills to connect with people

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.660
across a range of differences.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.750
RACHEL SIMMONS: Couldn't
have said it better myself,

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.030
so I hope that was helpful.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.830
TRUDI MCCANNA: And we do have
several questions on the Dory.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.100
All right, so our top
question right now on the Dory

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.910
is from Hillary.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.280
And she asks, how can
parents lay the groundwork

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.832
for these skills in
younger children?

00:42:10.832 --> 00:42:13.040
RACHEL SIMMONS: I'm so happy
you asked that, Hillary,

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.350
because I'm also the
parent of a younger child.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.070
And you may know the
common phrase, little kids,

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.050
little problems, big
kids, big problems.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.040
And so by that, I take from that
little kids are so much more

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.450
impressionable and a little
bit easier to work with.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:30.070
So what are some things you
can do with a young child?

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.130
One, you can make the
practice of gratitude part

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:34.620
of every breakfast.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.570
So every day breakfast, what is
one thing you're grateful for?

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.064
And you say it, and they say it.

00:42:41.064 --> 00:42:42.730
Again, one of the
benefits of doing this

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.310
with younger children
is that, as they proceed

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.170
into the eye-rolling
years, they at least

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.100
have this groundwork
that's been laid,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.500
which helps keep them
much more connected.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.870
You have a much better
chance of hanging on.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.770
Another thing you can
do is talk with them

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.080
about the way they
talk to themselves.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.950
So if you're physically
comfortable going to a place

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.010
where you could maybe jump
over something with your child,

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.440
like, for example,
bouldering, climbing on rocks,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.540
or walking by a
creek and stepping

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.400
on the rocks in
the creek, and you

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.380
sense your daughter
anxious about something--

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.000
and I'm using the
creek as an example,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.020
but there are all
kinds of things

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.330
we might do with our child
where she feels afraid

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.470
when she's young.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.720
You say to her,
it's a good thing

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.030
to talk to yourself in
a positive way, to say,

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.180
I can do this.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:29.840
I can do this.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.620
Teach her what internal
self-talk sounds like.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.170
This is certainly something
my daughter has absolutely

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.480
internalized, and who
is almost six years old,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.580
and who does this frequently.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.550
Another great thing to do is
when your daughter is working

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:45.010
on something that's
challenging for her,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.680
and you can feel her starting
to either get frustrated or want

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.330
to walk away from
it, you go up and you

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.610
give her tons of praise,
and you say, look

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.440
how far you've gotten at this.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.930
Look how much
you've done already.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.970
And that's known
as process praise.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.810
Process praise is about
making sure kids feel really

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.240
good about being in the
middle of a challenging

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.630
process, making sure they feel
praised for sticking with it

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.390
and being a part of it,
as opposed to waiting

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.900
until they've finished and cross
the finish line, as it were,

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.110
to give them the praise.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.930
We know from research that--

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.520
and I find this
amazing that they've

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.370
been able to figure this
out, coming out of Stanford--

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.550
that even in toddlerhood,
boys get more process

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.200
praise than girls.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.760
Which is unbelievable to me.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.880
And if you hear process praise,
if you are praised for--

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.940
another way to ask
this is, let's say

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.560
your kid is working
on something,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.242
and you say, tell me about
the strategy that you used.

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.700
And by the way,
teach them the word

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.520
"strategy," because strategy
implies there's always

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.600
more than one solution.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.590
There's lots of different
ways to do something.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.970
So what kind of strategy did
you use to figure that out?

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.940
And they can get excited about
what they've done so far.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.610
So all of this helps
make kids braver

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.250
because it means they don't
have to perform at the highest

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.010
level.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:00.250
It means they know
you care when they're

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.900
in it and in the
process and trying.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.720
So those are all
things that you can do.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.860
There's so much to do
with younger girls.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.150
AUDIENCE: So first I want to say
I'm currently reading "Enough

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.920
As She Is," and one
of the struggles I'm

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.520
having is reading it as both
being and as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.130
Like, still being growing
up, and kind of trying

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.200
to view it from maybe
how my mother felt

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.270
about me growing up.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:26.970
And something that
my mother and I

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.020
have been talking about
and trying to work out

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.800
for a long time is the
fact that it didn't so much

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.420
matter to me what she said.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.160
It mattered to me what she did.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.200
And I would just
mirror her behaviors,

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.630
even if she was telling
me the opposite.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:45.040
And as somebody who struggles
with things in my own life,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.810
I wonder if you have
any advice on if you

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.680
know you have a problem, and you
participate in a behavior that

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.980
would be very damaging to mimic,
and yet you're still struggling

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.930
yourself to not
do it, how do you

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.050
communicate this with somebody
who might be watching you

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.794
as a role model?

00:46:00.794 --> 00:46:02.460
RACHEL SIMMONS: That's
a great question.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.630
So meaning you have
awareness of the behavior

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.160
that someone is mimicking.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.300
Well, of course, the pat answer
is do as I say but not as I do.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.095
But I think you're pointing
to something deeper,

00:46:13.095 --> 00:46:14.530
and something
that's been studied,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.580
actually-- it's just
beginning to be studied,

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.700
which is the way that
young people can tell

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.700
the difference between what
their parents' values are

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.380
and what their
parents actually say.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.960
So in other words, teens
have a great BS detector.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.980
They know that their
parent might say,

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.456
oh, I really want
you to be happy.

00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:31.330
And they, at the same
time, know their parent

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.070
is very committed
to them getting

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.830
into the best possible
college, which may actually

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.810
contraindicate their happiness.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.030
And so I think
that you're really

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.110
highlighting something that's
quite new in the research.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:44.860
But, of course, your
question is about how

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.940
do you relate to somebody when
you know that you're modeling

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.470
something that's not healthy.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.010
And I guess I
think the kind of--

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.170
I know Brené Brown was
here at Google yesterday.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.900
I think vulnerability--
authentic vulnerability--

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.020
is really important.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:04.450
So to be able to say almost
as part admission of what's

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.730
going on but also
part apology, if you

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.170
believe it is called for.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.620
I know on a smaller scale
that in the moments where

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.230
I let my own child down,
when I fail my own child,

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.950
whether it's because I have
yelled in a way that wasn't

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.400
appropriate or called for,
or I have been too dismissive

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.890
or distracted, I catch
myself, and I say,

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.416
I'm really sorry
for what I just did.

00:47:26.416 --> 00:47:27.790
And she'll say,
it's OK, it's OK.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:30.040
I think she gets like, Mom,
please stop being awkward,

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.850
because we live in New
England, and she apparently

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.710
has no feelings.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.370
Anyway, she's like,
please stop, please stop.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:42.469
And she's only six, but I try to
say to her, this wasn't right,

00:47:42.469 --> 00:47:43.510
and I need to make right.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.593
I need to meet it right,
I need to make it better.

00:47:45.593 --> 00:47:46.660
I don't beat myself up.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.670
So it's a combination
of that vulnerability--

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.680
that authentic vulnerability--

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.520
but also being willing to
be accountable, and to say,

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.926
I don't have it all together.

00:47:55.926 --> 00:47:57.550
And it goes back to
what I said earlier

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.820
about the importance of making
mistakes in front of your kids,

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.300
because your kids need to know
how to screw up as much as they

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.670
need to know how to succeed.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.520
You can't know how
to succeed truly

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.980
well if you don't have the
tools to make mistakes.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.150
And yet so many
of us as parents,

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:15.790
we err too much on
the side of we're

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.390
going teach how to succeed.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.960
And that's really part of
what this book is about.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.240
I'm a big fan of
the book "Lean In."

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.830
And I believe what
we need to teach

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.160
our kids to do is to lean
inside so that they have

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.250
the tools to be
strong and to navigate

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.550
the barriers and the
unforeseen moments that arise

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.015
when they are pursuing success.

00:48:37.015 --> 00:48:37.890
TRUDI MCCANNA: Great.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:38.930
We have another
question on the Dory.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.100
This one's from Elizabeth.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.310
She says she's currently reading
"The Curse of the Good Girl,"

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.430
published in 2010, specifically
in regard to part two,

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.750
Breaking the Curse.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.970
Is there anything
you'd update or advice

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.210
you'd modify based on things
you've learned and observed

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.470
since it was published?

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:57.950
RACHEL SIMMONS: Wow, that's
a really good question.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.220
Well, I guess yes, absolutely.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.560
And I actually talk about
this in "Enough As She Is."

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.360
That's a wonderful question.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.267
Yeah, I kind of realized
that I screwed up

00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:09.725
a little bit in "The Curse of
the Good Girl." so Elizabeth,

00:49:09.725 --> 00:49:10.466
mea culpa.

00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:12.090
And if you decide
that you like my work

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:13.909
enough to read the
next one, you'll

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:15.200
see I actually talk about this.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.658
So in "The Curse
of the Good Girl,"

00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:20.180
I argue that the most important
thing girls need in order

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.220
to thrive is to
break that curse,

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.040
is to not have to sit
like a girl all the time,

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.310
is to be able to speak
up and not feel like they

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.320
have to be modest
and have conflicts,

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.150
and express their feelings.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.430
And I thought that if
girls could do that,

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:39.950
they would lead happier,
healthier lives.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.540
So here's the
problem with that, is

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.340
that I was putting
way too much emphasis

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.840
on the role of the girl.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.260
I was not at all thinking
about how toxic the culture is

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.320
for the girl.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.040
And I think that just
stems from my own can-do--

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.810
I come from a very
immigrant family,

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.630
like, you can do it, just
bootstrap it, figure it

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.600
out kind of mentality
that I grew up with that

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.645
actually wasn't fair to girls.

00:50:01.645 --> 00:50:03.020
The thing that
I've realized now,

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:08.330
almost 10 years later, is that
the data that we see around

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.840
the world, really, in terms
of what girls are facing

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.240
around anxiety and
depression and stress,

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.920
and the percentage
of girls who say

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.290
on college campuses
at the age of 18

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.060
that I feel overwhelmed
by all I have to do.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.210
These are all
stratospherically rising.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.310
That's not about
the girl's failure.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:28.660
That's about the way
we are failing girls.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.240
And I do think becoming a
parent changed things for me.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.120
It allowed me to see the
things that I could control

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.326
and the things that I
can't, and that we all need

00:50:37.326 --> 00:50:38.450
to work together to change.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.770
TRUDI MCCANNA: All
right, another question

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.045
from the Dory from Shralika.

00:50:44.045 --> 00:50:46.940
I apologize if I
butchered your name.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.880
She asks, teaching kids to
be independent versus being

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.500
there through the process.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.610
Example-- would you sit with
them passively or actively

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.370
through a homework, or
leave them to work it out

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.380
and let them ask if
they have a question?

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.963
RACHEL SIMMONS: Such
a great question.

00:51:01.963 --> 00:51:03.680
And I think as our
kids get older,

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.810
that is the
million-dollar question,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:10.130
is where is the balance between
finding that zone of struggle

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.620
and growth that doesn't
push them over the edge

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.250
and make them deteriorate
into a tantrum or whatever.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.210
I think that is an art.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.070
It's not a science.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.169
I think that what
we want-- let me

00:51:21.169 --> 00:51:22.460
tell you what we want to avoid.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.380
We want to avoid
parenting and teaching

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.560
girls who feel like they have
to ask every five minutes,

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.267
is this right?

00:51:28.267 --> 00:51:28.850
Is this right?

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.660
Did I get it right?

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.220
I don't know if this is right.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.530
What happens is they
go to their teachers,

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.200
and every couple of
minutes they keep asking,

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.820
is this exactly what you want?

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.710
Teachers are now
complaining about this to me

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.090
all over the country.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.700
It's called learned
helplessness, basically.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.500
So it is support seeking, right?

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.260
It looks like support
seeking, but really what it is

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.110
is a fear that if I don't
get it exactly right,

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.400
oh my god, it's
going to be a crisis.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.090
Now, that is not a muscle we
want our kids to cultivate.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.820
And if you hear your daughter's
teacher talk about this,

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.067
it's really important.

00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:01.400
So how do you find that balance?

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.358
Well, first of all, I
think you have to prepare

00:52:03.358 --> 00:52:04.820
your daughter beforehand.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.590
And you say, listen,
I know that you're

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.730
going to be doing
your homework, and I

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.070
want you to know that I'm here.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.060
And I also watch and
know that my goal is

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.700
for you to challenge yourself.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.810
And so I might not be
as available to you

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:16.670
as I usually am,
because I'm going to ask

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.292
you to grapple with some stuff.

00:52:18.292 --> 00:52:20.000
Grapple might be a
big word for your kid,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.287
but I'm going to ask you
to work on stuff yourself.

00:52:22.287 --> 00:52:24.620
And I'm going to ask you to
come up with some strategies

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.350
yourself for how you
could help yourself

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.060
without necessarily using me.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.060
So I would say to a kid, what's
one thing you could do other

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.260
than asking me?

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.920
Maybe it's to call a friend.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.820
Those are all powerful
things that they can come up

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.630
with to advocate for themselves,
to make good on a problem

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.350
that they have, that don't
involve going to you.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.107
Then I think you have to
find that growth edge, right?

00:52:48.107 --> 00:52:49.190
I think that's the phrase.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:51.710
You have to find that
place with her where she's

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.020
pushing herself
but not becoming so

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.879
turned off by what she's doing
that she doesn't want to do it.

00:52:56.879 --> 00:52:57.920
Because here's the thing.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.960
I think when kids really start
to hate what they're doing,

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.580
I mean, they hate
what they're doing.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.454
So we also have to make
sure that they're not

00:53:04.454 --> 00:53:06.930
getting undone.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:08.180
And like I said, it is an art.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.910
I wish I had a good hard
and fast rule for that.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:12.830
Actually, wait, I have
one more thing to say.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.320
Sorry, I did think of it.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.620
It's hard to think on
your feet, because I'm

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.869
like, what would I really say?

00:53:16.869 --> 00:53:17.840
So here's what I think.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.090
I would actually
say to the kid, what

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.040
is one way that you
could challenge yourself

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.240
that you've never
challenged yourself

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.490
before in doing your homework?

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.270
That's what I would say.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.939
Let's come up with
something that you

00:53:27.939 --> 00:53:30.230
would do to push yourself
that you haven't done before.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.690
OK.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:32.840
TRUDI MCCANNA: All right, and
we've got one more question

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.429
on the Dory.

00:53:33.429 --> 00:53:35.720
And I think it's the last
question we'll have time for.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.310
And it's, again, from Hillary.

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:40.310
And she asks, what is your
take on single-gender education

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.270
for girls?

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.730
Are there specific situations,
personalities where

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.210
parents should consider it?

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.580
RACHEL SIMMONS: Yes, I think so.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.800
My take on single-gender
education for girls

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.510
is that it can be
a very important

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.540
and empowering and enriching
experience for certain girls,

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.480
but not necessarily
for all girls.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.550
There's a lot of great
research out there about--

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:06.230
for example, I'm thinking
of the work of Linda Sax

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.660
at UCLA, who has looked
at the difference

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.480
in self-reported
confidence levels

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.270
in the first year of college
of girls who have attended

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.557
coed schools versus
single gender schools,

00:54:16.557 --> 00:54:18.140
and there is a
significant difference.

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.350
That the girls who come
from the all-girls school

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.000
report higher levels
of confidence,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.890
more speaking up in class.

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:28.790
That being said, I think there
are wonderful benefits to being

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:30.972
part of a coed community.

00:54:30.972 --> 00:54:32.930
I also think-- are there
certain kinds of girls

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.221
that I would recommend
a single-sex school to?

00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:35.720
Yeah.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.340
I mean, I think
about this a lot for

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.780
my own soon-to-be six-year-old.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.580
And I think that
if she turns out

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.220
to be a kid who is very
vulnerable to social pressure,

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:47.450
particularly around
boys, who has a hard time

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.720
distinguishing between
what her own values are

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.700
and what the values
of her peers are,

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.500
I might seriously
consider putting her

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.910
in an all-girls school.

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.920
Because I do think
that particularly

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.310
around middle school because I
think that during that period,

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.830
the powerful,
intense expectations

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.560
to conform to what
other people are doing

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.230
can be very destructive
for certain kinds

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.442
of kids who are vulnerable.

00:55:10.442 --> 00:55:12.650
So I'm thinking a lot about
that for my own daughter,

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.600
and watching her.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.850
I also think that
for those girls who

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:19.880
need more attention around
things like leadership

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.070
development, speaking
up, girls schools

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.860
tend to be more
oriented to focusing

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.030
on what the vulnerabilities
are that girls bring.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.170
So I would say those two
points of vulnerability, to me,

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.030
would be reason to
seriously consider

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:33.311
an all-girls environment.

00:55:33.311 --> 00:55:34.310
TRUDI MCCANNA: Terrific.

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:35.876
Well, with that,
we're out of time.

00:55:35.876 --> 00:55:37.250
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.440
RACHEL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.110
TRUDI MCCANNA: Join me in
thanking Rachel and Simone,

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:39.610
please.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.970
RACHEL SIMMONS: Thank you.
