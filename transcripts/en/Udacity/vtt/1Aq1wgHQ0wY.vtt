00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.830
You may have noticed code snippets using
set large icon for a notification.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.390
Android Wear automatically uses
these as the background image.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.310
However, the android framework only
uses a 64x64 pixel version of the image,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.210
since it is normally shown quite small
in the notification shade on a handheld.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.124
The wearable extender provides
a method called setBackground.

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:26.014
This method can handle high resolution
images, such as mBitmap here, and

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:29.670
send them directly to the wearable so
they'll appear nice and sharp.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.980
However, make sure that the image
you provide is not too large.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.520
If it is too big, you can overwhelm
the memory in the small wearable device.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.660
Instead, we recommend
that you provide 400 x

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.848
400 sized images if you
want a static background.

00:00:41.848 --> 00:00:46.890
And 640 x 400 if you want to have image
parallax added, where the left and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.170
right edges are used to
simulate background movement.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.560
Make sure that you store these resources
in the drawable-nodpi directory to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.410
insure the framework does
not try to resize them.
