00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.070
In central Missouri, about hundred miles from
St. Louis and right off of Route 66, sits

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.070
the small town of St. James.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.070
Despite this town having only about four thousand
people, it is proudly the location for the

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.070
Tacony Corporation’s vacuum cleaner factory,
a giant facility that produces cleaners for

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.070
13 different lines and brands, including for
Maytag, Riccar, and Simplicity.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.070
Sitting on the bottom level of this massive
factory is something even more unique, a museum

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.070
dedicated solely to vacuum cleaners.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.070
Tom Gasko is the curator there and will delightfully
show off his massive collection of cleaners,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.070
ranging from ones from the 1910s all the way
to a vacuum cleaner that joined George W.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.070
Bush on Air Force One.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.070
This fascinating museum takes visitors through
the rather unknown history of America’s

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.070
favorite cleaning machine.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.070
Here, now, is that history – how the vacuum
cleaner came to be.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.070
People have been cleaning the floors of their
domiciles for thousands of years.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Brooms, in their most rudimentary and handmade
form, were the common tool of choice for accomplishing

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.070
this.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.070
However, it actually wasn’t until Levi Dickenson’s
1797 advancement of the broom that it began

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
to become mass produced.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.630
The story goes that Levi’s wife complained
often about the brittleness and inefficiency

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.060
of her handmade broom.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.930
So, Levi, being a farmer in Hadley, Massachusetts
and all, made a broom for her out of his toughest

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.719
grains, a variety of sorghum, a stalk of grain
used to feed livestock and used in the production

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.719
of alcohol.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.570
In fact, sugar cane is a type of sorghum.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.850
These stalks are tough, resilient, and quick
to dry – in other words, perfect for a broom.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.829
Levi’s wife loved it and so did neighbors,
family, and friends.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.989
He quickly grew more sorghum to keep up with
the broom demand.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.620
By 1810, Levi Dickenson had also invented
a foot-treadle broom machine, which helped

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.990
mass produce brooms.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.239
By the 1830s, broom factories popped up across
the northeast.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.860
While a sorghum-made, mass-produced, reliable
broom was nice and all, it still wasn’t

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.710
particularly efficient.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.770
It required a person to sweep for long hours
and use a lot of energy.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.700
There had to be a better way to clean.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.200
There was.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.641
It was in 1860, with the United States not
so united and on the brink of a Civil War,

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:31.390
when a man in West Union, Iowa by the name
of Daniel Hess filed U.S. Patent 29,077 for

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.340
a type of device that would in the not to
distant future revolutionize the cleaning

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.340
industry.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.200
In the patent, it is written,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.810
The nature of my invention consist-s in drawing
fme dust and dirt through the machine by means

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.960
of a draft of air, and forcing the same into
water or its equivalent for the purpose of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.250
destroying it substantially as will be hereinafter
specified.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.159
This was the first known vacuum-cleaner.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.789
Of course, he called it something different
– a “carpet sweeper” – and it had

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.409
pretty major issues.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.032
Plus, there is no evidence he ever sold it,
much less created the thing described in his

00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:08.032
patent.

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:12.860
Either way, Hess was proposing using a rotating
brush and a bellows mechanism designed to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.140
shoot out a strong blast of air.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.970
He also explains in the patent that “the
dust and fine dirt accompanies the air in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.600
its passage to the bellows and from thence
down to the water chambers.”

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.830
In other words, he was saying the air would
be cleansed by water.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.770
It is not clear either how Hess intended for
his machine to gain the power necessary to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.100
do their work.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.070
In 1869, Ives W. McGaffey of Chicago, Illinois
took this invention one step further.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.000
In his patent (U.S. patent 91145), he sets
up his invention by saying,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.360
The accumulation of dust and dirt/in dwelling-houses
is a source of great annoyance to all good

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.600
housekeepers, a large portion of the dust
being so light that the ordinary process of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.380
sweeping sends it dying into the ain-so that
it is difficult to control or expel it from

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.380
the room.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.210
He goes on to describe a similar machine to
Hess’s save for two important additions:

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.760
a hand-operated crank to produce power and
the machine standing upright, resembling modern

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.770
vacuum cleaners.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.810
Hence, why many historians credit McGaffey
with the invention of the vacuum cleaner instead

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.810
of Hess.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.420
Even with a crank, this was hard work.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.080
As described by the book Vacuum Cleaner: A
History, “The faster operator turned the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.780
crank, the faster the fan went, and, presumably,
the greater the suction.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.740
It was with much work, but with little result,
but it seemed better than a carpet sweeper.”

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.820
McGaffey did try to sell his invention retail
for twenty five dollars ($425 today) and with

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.500
the name the “Whirlwind,” but found few
buyers.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.280
For the next 29 years, the “carpet sweeper”
didn’t have any other significant (at least

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280
recorded) innovations.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.320
It wasn’t until 1898 when John S. Thurman
of St. Louis submitted a patent (U.S. patent

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.320
634042) for a gasoline-powered “pneumatic
carpet renovator,” that things started to

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.940
pick up again in the broom replacing world.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.730
Thurman’s device “dislodged” dust by
blasting the carpet with compressed air, then

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.360
blew it into a receptacle.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.420
There was no sucking involved, so it wasn’t
really a “vacuum” cleaner as we might

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.420
think of it.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.250
His contraption was also not very portable,
but rather the size of the cabin of a horse-drawn

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.250
carriage.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.940
So, Thurman offered door-to-door service in
the St. Louis area for four dollars a visit

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.700
(about $110 today).

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.690
He even took out an ad in the St. Louis Dispatch.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.050
Thurman’s business was a moderate success,
though it wasn’t technically a vacuum cleaner

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.280
as we’d think of it, just a device that
did the same basic job.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.790
It was in 1901 when Herbert Cecil Booth, an
English structural engineer, saw a demonstration

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.500
by an American inventor where, like Thurman’s
design, it blasted dust out and then blew

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500
it away.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.140
(Booth, in interviews, did not name the inventor.)

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.810
When Booth approached the gentlemen and asked
why it wasn’t designed to suck, he was yelled

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.460
at and told that no one and no machine had
been able to suck dust successfully.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.800
Booth decided he was going to be the first.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.400
He figured if he could just reverse Thurman’s
design, from blowing to sucking, it could

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400
work.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.210
Booth created “a massive gasoline-powered
and horse-drawn vacuum cleaner” and received

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.660
several patents for it throughout 1901.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.510
He called his sucking machine a “Puffing
Billy.”

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.390
Booth also offered home service and it was
so popular that the British Navy called him

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.420
into service to clean London’s Crystal Palace
when a bunch of naval reservist came down

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.870
with “spotted fever.”

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.010
While Booth’s invention worked well, it
wasn’t compact nor meant for personal home-use.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.820
But through the early 1900s, patents across
the world were submitted to try to capitalize

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.020
on this new innovation.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.500
However, despite countless well educated engineers
and inventors trying their hand, it was actually

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.950
60 year old James Murray Spangler, a department
store janitor and hobbyist inventor in Canton,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.230
Ohio, who invented the first compact, ready-for-home-use
vacuum cleaner.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.030
Spangler suffered from asthma and his job
was to dust and sweep every corner of the

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.030
store.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.690
Needless to say, he had constant asthma attacks
at work.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.570
To solve this issue, Spangler made his own
vacuum cleaner from a tin soapbox, a sateen

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.490
pillowcase (as a dust collector), and a broom
handle.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.450
Inside of the box, he had an electric motor
he pulled from a sewing machine which powered

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.540
a fan and a rotating brush.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.490
The crudely-made machine collected dirt and
blew it out the back, where it was caught

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.110
by an attached dust bag (the pillowcase).

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.240
Unbelievably, the machine, dubbed the “suction
sweeper” worked well.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.320
He was able to clean the whole building and
his asthma subsided.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.010
He then set about perfecting his design as
well as patenting the machine.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.800
After receiving his patent in 1908, he began
selling the machines, which were quite popular,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.840
but Spangler didn’t have money to set up
a factory to mass produce them and initial

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.600
funds he received for such an endeavor dried
up quickly.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.910
Luckily, one of his very satisfied customers
was his cousin, Susan Hoover.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.770
Susan Hoover was also the wife of leather
goods manufacture William Hoover.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.660
After seeing it demonstrated, William saw
the business potential for such a device and

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.170
had the funds to mass produce and market it.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.830
He was also looking to diversify away from
the leather industry as the burgeoning automobile

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.040
industry was starting to cut into his bottom
line with fewer leather horse harnesses and

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.480
related gear needed.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.750
So he bought the rights to the patent from
Spangler, formed a partnership with him, and

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.400
began mass producing his “suction sweeper.”

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.480
William Hoover was also a great marketer,
coming up with the idea of door to door salesmen

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.139
to demonstrate how the vacuum cleaner worked.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.450
He also ran newspaper ads in the Saturday
Evening Post that promised customers ten days

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.200
of free use with the machine.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.419
If they weren’t satisfied, they could return
the “vacuum cleaner” (named by Hoover)

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:35.530
free of charge.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.671
By 1912, the Hoover vacuum cleaner had “sucked”
up the world and its dominance in the early

00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:45.890
market resulted in many people calling the
vacuum cleaner a “hoover,” regardless

00:07:45.890 --> 00:08:07.860
of brand, something that’s still true in
some regions today.
