00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,060
Joining me today is a contributor for
Canada's national post known here on the

2
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:13,880
Youtube, as my name is
Josephine Josephine. Matthias,

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,714
welcome to the Rubin [inaudible].

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,980
Thank you for having me.
I'm so excited to be here.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,110
So your real name is Josephine.
My name is Josie can. It is.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,890
I know why a lot of
people don't believe that.

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,860
I think it's like an alias isn't
really not that believable.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,190
You say, my name is Josephine.
We're always getting punked online.

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,200
So they were curious.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,541
Sorry.
That was gonna say,

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,290
I think they assume it's like Bong Queesha
or something. Joseph into really? Okay.

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,990
All right, well I'm, I'm really
super psyched that you're here.

13
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:44,650
We met about a month and a half ago in
Toronto after Jordan Peterson thing.

14
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,130
We got to chat a little bit.
Yeah.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,930
And I've been a fan of what you're doing
for a while and I think you're actually

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,260
one of the few people on the
youtube making some sense.

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
Hello.
I feel special.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,690
Thank you. So, so, uh,

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,360
let's just do a little bit about your
history first and then we're going to play

20
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,570
a clip from one of your videos in case
people haven't seen some of your stuff,

21
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,510
and then we're going to talk about all
sorts of political stuff because you are

22
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:11,250
a true political beasts. So you're
originally from Nigeria. Yes.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,880
Lived there for what, eight or nine
years before you years to Canada.

24
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,750
So tell me about growing up in Nigeria.

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,590
Yeah.
Um,

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,670
I actually don't remember much about
growing up in Nigeria and my parents kind

27
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,700
of a closed me off to
what was really going on.

28
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,310
I lived in the gated community and um,
yeah,

29
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,990
I immigrated here when
I was nine years old.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,800
My Dad actually first went
to Canada when I was too, uh,

31
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,790
he got here on a work visa,
worked his ass off for years,

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,200
for about seven years.
Actually.

33
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,570
I didn't even know who my dad was for
seven years. And then when he, you know,

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,220
got his visa and everything, he brought
my family over and yeah, now I'm in,

35
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,060
I'm in Canada. I mean, a great guy.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,980
Yeah. So what did your dad do that Mike
was able to get a visa to go ahead.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,620
Yeah, my dad was an accountant
and then when he got to Canada,

38
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,610
he went back to school and decided to do
nursing instead. And my mom's a teacher,

39
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:00,090
so that's, that's what they do. What
does your mom teach? She teaches,

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,990
she thought English in Nigeria and now
she kind of teaches us special ed kids

41
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,240
and stuff like that.
So she still loves teaching.

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,950
She obviously can't teach a nature and
person can't teach English in Canada. Um,

43
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,540
but yeah,
so she still loves teaching,

44
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,990
so I'm glad she's still kind of gets to
do that. But yeah. So my dad's accountant,

45
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,270
my dad,
my mom's a teacher.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:17,830
Yeah.

47
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,910
Do your parents tell you anything about
the political situation or anything at

48
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:24,550
the time when you were growing up, even
if you don't have great memories of it?

49
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,530
Uh, not necessarily. My parents
were not really that political. Um,

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,800
I think we became more political
when we came to Canada. And I mean,

51
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,460
politics in Nigeria is just, it's
completely corrupt. And there,

52
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:37,650
there was no such thing as politics.
It's all just money. And, um,

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,920
is when I came to Canada is when they
start to get a little bit more political

54
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,300
and uh,
I don't know,

55
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,320
I think religion and strict parents
kinda create conservatism in a way.

56
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,670
So they're very, very conservative.
Uh, so I, I had grew up about, um,

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,220
around that, but they didn't
really name it as conservatism.

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,910
It was just strict and religious and had
all these rules that basically apply to

59
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:00,460
conservatism in the way. Yeah.
Yeah. So then you get to Canada,

60
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,690
you're not even 10 years old. And what
was that like to be in a new country?

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,620
So weird.

62
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:10,000
I mean 16 degrees outside
and I was freezing.

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,690
It's why is it so cold? And there's people
wearing t shirts. I did not understand.

64
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,060
Uh,
I remember like driving from the airport,

65
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,520
I think it's piercing airport
and we all stopped and was like,

66
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,920
why are we stopping? And they're
like, oh, it's a red light. I'm like,

67
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:23,720
what does that mean? Don't you just go
into this? Everyone has figured it out.

68
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,790
My Dad's like, there's order here.
I was like, oh, okay. And snow.

69
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,080
Snow is the best one.

70
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:32,410
I think I spent like half an hour just
like touching it and like what is this?

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,490
And My,
uh,

72
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,280
elementary school teachers or middle
school teachers had to tell me to get back

73
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,340
inside. I'll freeze. But
yeah, it was, it was really,

74
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,840
it was surreal as a culture shock.

75
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:44,920
So it was mostly a weather related
weather whether an order. Exactly.

76
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,690
It's basically it.
Whether an order,

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,530
so when you say you grew up in like
a in a religious atmosphere where,

78
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,880
what was that like?
Um,

79
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,910
my parents were just super religious and
they hoped I'd be also as religious as

80
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,270
them.
Unfortunately I'm not.

81
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,770
But I think that kind of comes with
age and also living in, I don't know,

82
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:03,760
a different country.
Nigeria, it's easier, easier.

83
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,950
The majority of people are religious. Um,
but yeah, they, they are still a very,

84
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:12,330
very, very Catholic. I'm
Protestant. Yeah. So, yeah.

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah. So, okay. So now you're
in Canada, you're a kid,

86
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,820
you're making a good life for yourself.
When did you get interested in politics?

87
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,980
Ooh, I got interested in politics. Uh,

88
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,520
while I'm taking political science and
studying political science in school

89
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,000
right now. And, um, I was also
president of the debate club.

90
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,330
I was just interested in like
this scores and discussing things.

91
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,380
I was interested in people's ideas
and different ideas and reasoning,

92
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,480
the reason for things.
Um,

93
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,800
but I also think my political views
were really shaped by me immigrating to

94
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,630
Canada and we lived in the inner cities.

95
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,210
I'm not sure if you've ever heard
of Jane and finch by any chance.

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,230
It's kind of like a south side
of Chicago lights. Like it's not,

97
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,790
it's obviously not as bad. Um, but it's an
inner city majority black, um, you know,

98
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,690
poor neighborhoods. I lived there for
most of my Canadian life actually.

99
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,170
And then from there I moved to a more
higher income neighborhood and having to

100
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,030
experience that.
So it was really cool,

101
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,630
kind of seeing like the culture there
and then get another culture shock and

102
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,420
move somewhere else. So it's
like I've experienced, you know,

103
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,900
Nigeria in the inner city in Canada
and then a much more, you know,

104
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:17,480
well off neighborhood. So, which would you
say is the best out of those three? Uh,

105
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,760
Nigeria, no, the wall up
neighborhood. But yeah,

106
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,320
living in like the um,

107
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,100
inner cities really it shaped my views
because now when I look back I was like,

108
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,420
oh,
that makes sense.

109
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,540
You are a product of your environment
and a lot of people that, you know,

110
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,980
I think about two,
three of my friends made it out of there.

111
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,470
The majority of them are,
you know,

112
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,590
pregnants are single parents now they're
in the system and it's unfortunate and

113
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,390
weird to see that happen.

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,260
And my parents being extremely strict
and they gave me a curfew at like 5:00 PM

115
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:50,320
every day. I wasn't allowed
to, you know, have boyfriends,

116
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,710
which I guess I was young, I probably
shouldn't have. Um, but they were really,

117
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,660
really strict and I
hated them at that time,

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,730
but I didn't understand why they didn't
me to go out and play with people and

119
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:01,670
now I get it because I would have ended
up like a lot of the people that are

120
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,100
still there right now. Um, and then, yeah,

121
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,960
moving to like the much
better neighborhood.

122
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,150
I realized that while
there is a difference,

123
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,040
there is a cultural difference I guess.
But yeah,

124
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,600
when I've watched a ton of your
videos I thought all right,

125
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,880
I sensed that she basically is a liberal,
why kind of liberal.

126
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,050
But I think you are probably
some conservative leanings
perhaps or at least have

127
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,060
an understanding. I think that's
what you're laying out here.

128
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,610
You have an understanding
of that line of thinking.

129
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
I you consider yourself a classical
liberal. I don't want to push you,

130
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,630
but I'd like to hear you say it but,

131
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,490
but what do you actually consider
your views to be? Um, okay. Here.

132
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,940
I know everyone says they
don't like putting labels,

133
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,110
but I absolutely hate labels because
like I have some conservative ideas,

134
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,810
I have some liberal ideas, I have
some classical liberal ideas. Um,

135
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,810
I have some progressive ideas,
socialist ideas.

136
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,800
Um, but I guess I just see a look at
things from issue to issue, but I am,

137
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,500
you know, primarily liberal,
but I'm fiscally conservative.

138
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:03,170
So that's kind of where I lean I guess.

139
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,150
So the route I think of of
your ideas, he's sort of
individualism. Yeah, for sure.

140
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,020
Yeah. Yeah. You want to throw to
a clip? Yes, let's do it. Alright.

141
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,100
Let's get people to know you
and your natural environment.

142
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,050
West has also been tweeting about the
lack of freedom of thought in America and

143
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:19,760
the backlash about whether blacks
can be allowed to be Republicans.

144
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:24,010
Sure is helping prove his point. But Black
Americans, contrary to popular belief,

145
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,550
can hold widely diverse and opposing
opinions and political issues.

146
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,060
Maybe Connie as a Republican, I mean,
he's ever referred to himself as such,

147
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:34,900
of course. But he said something about
Trump that wasn't severely negative,

148
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:39,340
so he suddenly the Black Paul Ryan.
But even if he is so what?

149
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,121
In fact,

150
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:44,710
a 2012 study by Vincent Hutchens and Kim
Jefferson using data from the American

151
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:48,910
national election studies found that
45% of black Americans identify as

152
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,890
conservatives. Despite this, however,

153
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:55,870
the Democratic Party typically received
85 to 95% of the black American vote.

154
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,920
The tendency of black Americans to vote
Democrat allows the Dempsey believe that

155
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:03,100
they have a strong hold on the
black American vote. In fact,

156
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:07,210
back in 2016 when Kanye West announced
he would run for president in 2020 the

157
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,360
democratic Party's official Twitter
account immediately assumed.

158
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:14,380
He meant he'd be running for them
responding. Welcome to the race, Mr. West.

159
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,400
Glad to have you.

160
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,110
If only the Dems had Ron Kanye in 2016
better candidate than she who shall not

161
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,960
be named to be.
All right.

162
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:25,180
So I think I picked that one because
it's a great example of what you do and

163
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:25,680
there's,

164
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,910
there's information and facts and it's
kind of light to and find and all that

165
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,440
good stuff. Now, first off though,

166
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,970
as a black Canadian talking about
black Americans, that's kind of racist,

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,370
wouldn't you say?
Yeah,

168
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,510
I think I've gotten a lot of
comments of people saying like,

169
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:42,540
he don't understand what it's like to
be black in America. And it's like,

170
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,231
oh my gosh,

171
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,280
thought I can have the same discussions
about race relations in America.

172
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,860
It's just a little scaled down in,
in the Canadian context.

173
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,990
And I think a lot of
Canadians try to project,

174
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:56,270
I guess I American issues on Canadians
as well. So, um, but yeah, I know,

175
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,170
I do get that criticism,
which is annoying.

176
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,210
We should all be allowed to
talk about whatever we want.

177
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,440
You are black in America right now?
Yes, I am. I know it's awful. I mean,

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,000
sign down like 10 times. People are
yelling the n word at me. I mean, I just,

179
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,100
I feel so unsafe. Well that's
why we create a safe space. Okay.

180
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,380
So I want to about that video though,

181
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:20,780
because the numbers that you laid out
there actually kind of incredible and

182
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,450
something that we obviously had been
talking about lately related to Kanye and

183
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,090
Candace and the rest of it.
Foot,

184
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,130
45% of black Americans consider themselves
conservative yet at 85 to 95% of our

185
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:38,790
voting Democrat. That is a
massive disconnect. So, so
what do you make of that?

186
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,940
Yeah,
I think it's just,

187
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,620
there's an idea that the Democratic Party
is the best one for black Americans.

188
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,330
It's the one that's going
to help black Americans.

189
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,960
And although they are conservative and
you know, in the true sense of the word,

190
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,170
they aren't necessarily Republican. They
don't believe in the Republican Party.

191
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,180
Um, but it is, it is very interesting.

192
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,050
I mean no one group or identity bolts
the same way as black Americans do.

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,970
So there is some kind of,
I guess,

194
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,670
story that's being told to them
that this is the way to do it.

195
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,190
This is the way to go. And
I don't think, you know,

196
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,230
the Republican party
per se is the way to go.

197
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,730
And I don't think the Democratic Party,
in fact,

198
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:13,400
I think both parties are just garbage at
this point. Um, but yeah, I think it's,

199
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,610
it's a little odd that the
majority 95% vote one single way,

200
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:21,780
but yet they're still conservative in a
sense. Um, but yeah, I just think it's,

201
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,650
it's uh,
it's a leftover ideas.

202
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,680
Like they just need to kind of
start to refigure things up.

203
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,900
But first we probably have to start with,
you know,

204
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,650
changing up the government and changing
up the party systems and I try to find

205
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,530
who to vote for instead of just
picking Democrat or Republican.

206
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,070
Do you think this was more of a good
sell job by the Democrats who are a bad

207
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,800
cell drive by the Republicans?
Cause when you look at all this,

208
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,880
the cities especially where
it's the worst for black people,

209
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,650
they're always democrat run cities
for decade after decade after decade.

210
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:57,180
Yet black people still in extremely
high numbers keep voting Democrats.

211
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:59,010
So that's obviously a great
sell job, right? Yeah.

212
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:02,570
Somebody is doing some serious PR work
on. Yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. And um,

213
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
I think it's also the
Republicans as well on,

214
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,100
I think Black Democrats make it feel like
the Republicans are against the black

215
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,890
Americans and the demo on the
Republicans make it feel like, you know,

216
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,930
the black Americans are against
Republicans. Like it's just,

217
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,600
I think both sides are not
necessarily trying to help.

218
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,430
They're just trying to
pander to their own side.

219
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:24,120
But it is interesting that you've been
voting Democrat for so long and things

220
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,500
are not getting better. It's like, oh,

221
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,010
maybe I should start voting a different
way or maybe I should start criticizing

222
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:29,850
the Democratic Party.

223
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,450
I think that's actually the biggest
thing is it's not picking a side.

224
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:36,000
It's criticizing what they're doing
wrong. It's criticizing, you know,

225
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,770
this didn't work.
Let's try something else.

226
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,020
Instead of just saying we
need Democrat and that's it.

227
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,140
This is what's going to happen,
but it's clearly not not working.

228
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:47,010
Let's try to figure out what policy
changes we need instead of trying to pick

229
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,800
like, you know, Democrat or
Republican. Sorry, I keep saying that.

230
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,170
I've never got to know. I'm with you.
I'm with you. So I know you're not,

231
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,340
you're not a huge proponent

232
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,220
of the sort of Candace
Kanye training in general,

233
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,740
but the fact that that
conversation is happening now,

234
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:04,210
the fact that you made that video,
you view that all as positive, right?

235
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,300
Oh yeah, no, for sure.

236
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:09,080
I think Connie really allowed a lot of
people to think for a second and try to,

237
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,950
you know, investigate some
more information, try to
figure out what their real,

238
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,660
why they hold certain ideas.

239
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,060
I think that was the biggest
thing and it was really exciting.

240
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,970
It's like scroll through Facebook and
see people that are not normally engaging

241
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:20,960
in politics.
Now.

242
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,920
Actually that might be scary because it's
like the majority of people are saying

243
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,610
you don't know what they're doing. But
yeah, I'd rather have them some way.

244
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,980
Exactly. I'd rather have them
involved. And the thing is,
I think as much as I, um,

245
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,690
you know,
dislike Ken is politics.

246
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:39,290
I do think that it opened
a lot of people's minds in
the sense that it allowed

247
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,400
them to investigate more.

248
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,920
And that's the most important thing
because then you're just stuck in the echo

249
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,730
chamber. Connie broke that. A lot of
people, all they see is, you know,

250
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:50,240
beyond say and Chrissy Tiegen and all
these celebrities that are all just

251
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,340
talking about the far
left, you know, super.

252
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,150
I hate saying social justice for you
over Super Social Justice Warrior talking

253
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,080
points. So Kanye broke that and
show them the other side. Um,

254
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:05,060
unfortunately I think, uh,
you know, because Candace is
kind of harsh and you know,

255
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,530
I think it's harder for people to connect
with her that are already sold down

256
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:13,070
the drain of the far
left. And unfortunately we
might have to cuddle them,

257
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:16,190
fill the Neil, come on, come
to the other side. It's okay.

258
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,720
Let me explain things to you.

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,740
So do you view that as just
like a personality trait?

260
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,480
Because that's what's interesting to me.

261
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,960
Like people used to say to me
all the time, well, uh, you know,

262
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,100
when you have milo on like Milo's
creating chaos and out of chaos,

263
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,060
hopefully my feeling was if I brought
Milo on that out of the chaos that he

264
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:38,470
creates, that some people would hear some
good ideas in a more calm, relaxed way,

265
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,410
and then they joined me on
the adventure that I'm on.

266
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,210
And I think there's proof in that pudding.
Yeah,

267
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,870
I think you're kind of a little bit more
like where I think you see a little bit

268
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:50,110
of the chaos that cannabis is creating
and you want people to understand the

269
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:50,910
ideas behind them.

270
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,140
Yeah. That's, that's the
thing is that, you know, when
Candice says one thing, like,

271
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,380
um, stop the victim
mentality for example. Um,

272
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,560
I think black Americans that are stuck
in like the far left echo chamber just

273
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,530
sees it as like, excuse me, like what
are you trying to save a little blot?

274
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,460
So it's like they needs either
she explains it further,

275
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,260
which obviously she doesn't have to do.
I mean she can do whatever she wants,

276
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,260
but I think she needs to break it down
a little more cause saying get off the

277
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,640
plantation,
the victim hood,

278
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,170
it's harder for people that all
they've ever heard is white privilege.

279
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,530
White people suck, blah, blah, blah.

280
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,500
It's harder for them to kind of understand
where she's coming from because if

281
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,760
you do break it down, it makes a lot of
sense. But if it's just thrown like that,

282
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,130
then it's harder for them to figure
it out. What they can do. The,

283
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,110
I keep like pointing here
like the Liberals are these
people over here. Yeah. Um,

284
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,440
so we just need to kind of
break it down and figure

285
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,040
you think maybe you need both.
Like in any movement,

286
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:43,420
like if you just look at the black
rights movement that Malcolm x who is

287
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,800
different than Martin Luther King.

288
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,010
And even the way comedians talk about
things differently because we talk about

289
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:52,280
things differently than Dick Gregory, then
Chappelle and Chris Rock. We just need

290
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,580
people. People just get affected by
different things. Yeah. Shock value works.

291
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,840
I mean it gets people, it wakes people
up. It allows them to kind of, you know,

292
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,390
be more aware of what's going on. I
totally, I do think we need both of them.

293
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,970
We need people to say, you know,
shut up, you're being annoying.

294
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,460
And we also need people to say,
here's why you're being annoying.

295
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,770
We most certainly need both. Um, but yeah,
I think she, what she does is awesome.

296
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:16,010
She has such a great platform and there
are also other people that are doing the

297
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:18,410
same thing,
but in a more kind of calmer,

298
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,700
I'm not saying she's like crazy
or anything. Um, yeah, she's just,

299
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:26,690
she's a tough girl and it's
a lot of SJWs or snowflakes.

300
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:31,640
So I might goes out any
direction. Um, not necessarily.

301
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,474
I mean I think we've,

302
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,650
I have d under like we've talked
over dms on Twitter before. Um,

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,680
and this was after the whole Blair
white debate and that was wise guys,

304
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,940
guys, guys. Yeah. Uh, no I was just um, at
reaching out to her and asking her like,

305
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,220
Hey, what's going on? Like
I don't, cause she was,

306
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:52,370
I think closing everyone off that were
criticizing her and I didn't want to

307
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,450
openly criticize her and I wanted
to go directly to the source. Um,

308
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,490
but we left off on like a good
notes. Yeah. Yeah. All right,

309
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,720
well I'll put it out here.

310
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,710
Why do we have a Jay z Kanye moment and
you both can come on the show sometime.

311
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,620
Oh yeah, let's talk it out. Yeah,
you're going to be like guys guys,

312
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,800
please guide if I'm a glutton
for punishment. Exactly.

313
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,470
So when I was doing a
little research on you,

314
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,080
one of the things that I thought
was most interesting is that,

315
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:20,081
so you have a twin sister and part of
your awakening was related to a paper that

316
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,480
she was writing in college. Yeah.
So can you tell me about that?

317
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:27,500
Cause it's pretty fascinating. Yeah. So
my sister is not into politics at all.

318
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,470
She is studying marketing
and she decided to take,

319
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,550
she goes to various university,

320
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:35,810
one of the biggest far left
universities in Canada.

321
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,860
And um, he took a sociology
course that was her fault.

322
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,920
I made called how society works.

323
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:46,130
I think it was the title of the
course or is what bothered me.

324
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,250
Cause if the course was feminism studies,
if the course was,

325
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:51,500
you know how women are oppressed and yeah,
sure,

326
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,140
but this is how society
works and you know,

327
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,610
in your assignment they had to talk about,

328
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,720
I know some societal issue and
discuss it and analyze it or whatever.

329
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,440
And she wanted to talk about the weight
or I actually encouraged her, I'm like,

330
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,650
you should talk about the wage gap and
you know how it's false and you know how

331
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,100
it's misinterpreted and all of that.
And you were setting her up.

332
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,630
I was setting her up a little,
I wanted to test it out,

333
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,620
but I didn't know it would, the professor
would, you know, respond that way. Um,

334
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,011
but yeah,

335
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,100
I told her to write about the wage gap
so she just sent like a short thesis and

336
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,800
said like, here's what I want to
talk about. I'm going to use studies,

337
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,850
blah blah blah.
Let me know.

338
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:27,470
And the professor like her response is
a meme like I hope I could let you guys

339
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,790
can like put it up or something.

340
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,140
It's like the reality is patriarchy
do not use business sources.

341
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:36,320
They blame women and it's like period.
The reality is patriarchy do not.

342
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,140
They blame women and like you
know the screenshot on this,

343
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,100
you can say sure we're going to throw
down. Totally. Yeah. I was reading it.

344
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,580
I was like okay, this is fake, right?
This is, this is definitely fake. No,

345
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,190
she basically shut it down and she
said your premise is completely,

346
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,620
and it was one of the most absurd emails
ever and use only feminist sources and

347
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,980
in the assignment details,

348
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:03,270
the list of sources they can't use
was dictionary.com the encyclopedia.

349
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,940
You couldn't use the
government of Canada website.

350
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,120
You couldn't use statistic Canada,
Statistics Canada.

351
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,250
How like how does that even make sense?

352
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,210
How are you going to explain how society
works and the only source you have is

353
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:18,540
feminist studies and you know, as
Peterson has mentioned this so many times,

354
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,240
they're not sighted.
It's just within this little group.

355
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,010
These aren't real textbooks. Uh, but
yeah, it just, it blew my mind and I was,

356
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:30,420
I'm so excited that she sat back cause I
was like this is exactly what is wrong.

357
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,050
So okay, so your sister
gets this response. What was
her response? Was she like,

358
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh look what you did to me? No, yes.

359
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,880
She was upset at me and she thought I
was wrong and I have to sit her down and

360
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,940
say, girl, let me explain it to you.
Here is what is actually happening.

361
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,970
By the end of that conversation
she's like, oh my gosh, I've been,

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,960
every class I go to, I've been lied to.
They are lying to me every single day.

363
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,940
And it, it's, it's, it's so messed up
and I think it's, this isn't teaching,

364
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:57,000
this is imposing your political ideas
on students because if it's teaching,

365
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,080
you teach it objectively,

366
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:01,470
you show them the facts and
let your students come up
with their own conclusions.

367
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,670
This is not teaching. She's trying to
tell them how to think. And you know, I,

368
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,470
I did some research on her actually,

369
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:11,610
and she's the highest paid woman
in her person, in her department.

370
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,350
She makes more money than the male
counterparts. What are you talking about?

371
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,240
So I'm sure there's a reason.
Yeah, exactly. But it's like,

372
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,090
there's obviously reasons
for it. She probably works
more hours. She's, you know,

373
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:27,060
doing all these other things and that's
how you can explain the wage gap.

374
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,330
So it was just interesting to me that
why like why are they doing this?

375
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:34,380
Why are you lying to your
students or isn't the point
of education for you? Like,

376
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,760
or essays or assignments.

377
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,190
Like you're supposed to come to
your own conclusions by using facts.

378
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,620
We have the facts. What's wrong with it?
She just didn't want those facts. It,

379
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,590
it blew my mind. But that was right.
Well they're often not for facts. Yeah.

380
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,840
Facts that they lie. Yeah. What
happened with the paper? Oh she,

381
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,210
she's like, okay, this is like
too much for me and my sister.

382
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,230
And she ended up just doing some other
like topic and try to pander to what the

383
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,560
professor wanted to get a good mark. And
that is my advice to a lot of students.

384
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:04,410
It's like, just suck it up. I mean
if you are already in this class,

385
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,280
it's not worth getting a bad
mark over. Um, however, sorry.

386
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:11,580
The great thing about it was I got a
ton of messages from students from her

387
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:15,180
class started to explain all the other
things that this teacher is engaging it

388
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,360
and how awful it is. And that made me
happy cause they said, you know what,

389
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,090
next week I'm going to speak up and
I'm going to tell her she's wrong.

390
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:24,210
And I was like, yes, yes, but be
prepared. Don't just say she's wrong.

391
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,770
So it's interesting. So I talk about this
when I do college, uh, speeches. Yeah.

392
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,760
Two years ago or so. I used to say
what you said about get the grade,

393
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,370
like suck it up and get the green because
hopefully you know if you want to move

394
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:39,290
to Grad school or get a good job after
or whatever, and I, I've turned on that.

395
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,080
But really you're the one 80 on that
because to me it's like we live in a time

396
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,470
where people can be on youtube
and expose these things,

397
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:50,620
share the emails out on social media.
Periscope while you're in classes,

398
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,890
the teacher is telling you that
you're an evil white racism.

399
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,680
Many videos of my teachers.
Just the worst thing.

400
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,860
But that's been so empowering for you.

401
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,890
So that's why I'm not for telling kids
can students not to do that. But I,

402
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:07,950
I understand the line of thinking and
I guess it depends on the person or

403
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:10,640
anything. It's still can challenge
your professor while he's, you know,

404
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,020
just teaching.
I met more for assignments.

405
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,710
The assignments says explain why women
are oppressed. Like just do it. That's it.

406
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:21,160
Like if you, you're probably going to
fail if you say women are not oppressed,

407
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,280
but if the teacher is actually teaching,
then yes please.

408
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,470
That is the best time
because you catch them at it.

409
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,060
And I love watching them squirm.

410
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,940
I love watching them just kind
of look around and it's like, oh,

411
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,460
there's a black woman asking me to tell,
you know,

412
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,710
tell her why she's oppressed
and my white professor,

413
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,610
please tell me what rights you have
did I don't have in Toronto, Canada.

414
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:44,140
And it's like, well, you know,
there is white privilege.
It's like, oh my gosh, stop.

415
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,670
It's enough. Do you feel bizarrely
empowered because of that? Now, I mean,

416
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:51,760
someone who's clear on their
political thoughts and you don't,

417
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,660
you're not a victim nor want
to be a victim or anything
or he's immigrant status

418
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,390
or blah, blah, blah. Do
you feel very empowered?

419
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:01,870
Like almost like your teachers can't
push back on you in a weird way because

420
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,590
they're caught in their own
guilt cycle? Yeah, no, for sure.

421
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:09,430
And it's also funny because, um, you
know, I am the, I'm an immigrant,

422
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,830
I am black and I'm a woman.
It's like I just have to be,

423
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,110
I guess Muslim and I'm
all the impressions. Um,

424
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,070
so it's really difficult
for them or anything. Yeah.

425
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,870
I got to limit to emulate every
oppression there is. Um, but yeah,

426
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,710
no, it, it's, it's,

427
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,430
it's kind of funny to see how they can't
challenge me because a lot of their

428
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,940
arguments, it is based on
lived experiences. This
is what black people face.

429
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,770
And I'm talking about
the Canadian context.

430
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:36,310
I think Canadian social racial relations
is a little bit different than the

431
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:40,870
states than here in the states. Sorry.
Um, but yeah, me being like a black woman,

432
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,750
it's, it's very difficult for
them. Like they can't give me any,

433
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,180
they have to give me a legit argument
because the only argument is, well,

434
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:50,470
black people feel that way. I don't.
So what is your argument? Um, but yeah,

435
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:53,570
I mean in, in a sense it does kind of
make me feel empowered because it's,

436
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:54,820
it's funny to watch them score.

437
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,710
Do you feel that you've had
an undue influence? You know,

438
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,800
I suspect in a positive way
on some of your classmates,

439
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,550
because I'm imagining they're probably
learning as much from you in some ways.

440
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,940
Oh yeah. More than they're learning from
some of these professors. Yeah, for sure.

441
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,080
Um,
it's actually fun.

442
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:14,800
There are some classes I would have where
a professor would say something absurd

443
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:18,130
and like there's a student that I know
knows me from Youtube and he'll look at

444
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:18,730
me and I'm like,

445
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,060
I'm not saying anything and I know raise
your hand and they'll talk and they'll

446
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:25,240
want me to like chime in and I'm like,
I don't want to do this in every class.

447
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,270
I'm not going to be challenging
my professors. Um, but yeah,

448
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,440
I really liked the fact that I've
encouraged so many students, you know,

449
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,890
step up and actually speak up and say what
they believe in. And um, yeah, it was,

450
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,300
it just really,
it's really interesting.

451
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,080
There was a course where one of
the textbooks, I forgot, dammit,

452
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,140
this is why school sucks cause like you
forget everything literally, instantly.

453
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:44,681
Um,

454
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,250
but one of the students that how it was
problematic and before we just kind of

455
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,360
brush it off and then another
student rose their hand and said,

456
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,290
why is it problematic? And it looks
at me. I was like, Oh God. But yeah,

457
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,260
I really liked that. I've encouraged
people to speak up and you know,

458
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:01,010
state what they believe and do more
research and not just listen to everything

459
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:03,380
your professor is saying,
not just listen to anything I'm saying.

460
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,840
Do more research and investigate
and try to find, you know,

461
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,000
let's get closer to the
truth is basically it.

462
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,480
Do you think students want to
be smarter than this stuff?

463
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:15,950
They're being spoon fed?
Because I definitely do. And
when I go to these schools,

464
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:20,951
I see such a thirst for knowledge and
honesty and facts and an exhaustion with

465
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,310
this nonsense.

466
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:25,940
But if you listen to the way the media
talks either about millennials or

467
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:29,170
whatever, it's like they're the spoiled
entitled generation on that same,

468
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,750
I'm not saying that a lot of them
aren't, but I, I genuinely think that,

469
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,980
that most people, especially young
people, they want real answers,

470
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,930
not just like easy dribble.

471
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,930
No, for sure. And, um, I think a lot of
this has to do with the student unions.

472
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,070
And again,
I'm talking,

473
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:48,030
I'm obviously more familiar with the
Canadian context of this. Um, but the,

474
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,160
you know, major schools,
University of Toronto,

475
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,920
York University and viruses university.
I go to University of Toronto,

476
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,190
run by black lives matter, Ryerson black
lives matter and feminist, uh, York.

477
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,500
University of black lives matter.
I mean,

478
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:00,810
individuals that are part
of the black lives matter.

479
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,360
Original organizations are the presidents,

480
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:06,270
vice president and all that
of the student union. And, um,

481
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,940
I was a president of the debate
club for about three years,

482
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,460
the first three years of my
schooling. And I was like, you know,

483
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:14,610
what would be really exciting to
have a debate on race, racial issues?

484
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:17,490
I would love to. I don't care if
I'm on this side, on the other side,

485
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,480
that would be such a good thing cause
all we're ever being fed is raised.

486
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,650
Every corner there's some poster about
being black and UFT, which by the way,

487
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:28,290
people just realize like
during the Trump election,

488
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,430
we've been here for three years.

489
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,730
No one complained and all of a sudden
Trump is elected. It's hard to be black.

490
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,700
Come on. Um, but yeah, I,

491
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,280
I went to go talk to the school presidents
and I said I would love to have this

492
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,560
event, all of that. They shut me down.

493
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,000
They said anyone that goes in the other
side on the opposite side is, you know,

494
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,740
trying to question the humanity of
black people. How dare they try it.

495
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:52,410
And I'm sitting there like, I will be
the one, like what are you talking about?

496
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:55,510
But yeah, they, they canceled it
and shut it down, which is so sad.

497
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,780
It was so excited for that.
So

498
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,231
it's interesting.

499
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,200
I know you've been pretty critical of
black lives matter and I want to get into

500
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:00,741
that a little bit.

501
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,820
But the moment for me that I realized
it had morphed into something that I no

502
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:08,360
longer felt was positive because at the
beginning I did think it was basically a,

503
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:09,950
a positive movement.
Yeah.

504
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,600
Or a grass roots movement that
was making some sense and,

505
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,130
and addressing some important issues.
But the moment I realized that it jumped,

506
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:19,760
the shark was in Toronto actually
at the Toronto Pride Parade.

507
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,680
When they stopped the parade,

508
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,480
they literally stopped the parade from
marching to demand that the organizers of

509
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:29,500
the gay pride parade or
another oppressed group, uh,

510
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,800
submit to their demands.

511
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,570
Their demands were that they were going
to focus on these issues. And I thought,

512
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:40,550
wow, what a perfect example of everything
that's wrong with identity politics,

513
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,290
with the oppression,
Olympics, the whole thing.

514
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,190
And then subsequently saw a lot more

515
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,730
of that style of thinking happening
throughout black lives matter.

516
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,810
But was that moment for you as someone
that's from a Rondo? We met in Toronto,

517
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,100
um, is that, was that a seminal moment
for you? Yeah, for sure. I mean, I,

518
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,770
I absolutely hate black lives matter.
Toronto.

519
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:01,890
I can't say much for many of the
other black lives matter chapters.

520
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,240
What black lives matter.

521
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:08,120
Toronto is extremely toxic and divisive
and I think it's mainly because I,

522
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,580
we were getting so much better in terms
of racial relations and people were

523
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:14,370
getting along and there wasn't really,
I mean, I'm speaking for myself.

524
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,700
It wasn't really that many
racism or racist acts happening,

525
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,070
but all of a sudden they
erupt and they say, you know,

526
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,100
black people feel uncomfortable
during pride because of the police.

527
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,100
When again happens during
the Trump presidency,

528
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,390
it's like all of a sudden you're
starting to feel oppressed.

529
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,370
And it blew my mind stopping the
pride parade. I was so confused.

530
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:35,820
They stopped it for like an hour asking
for demands that the police be band.

531
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
And it's like being a gay police officer,
isn't that an oppression?

532
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,050
And then they say, okay, but you can go
without your uniform. Are you kidding me?

533
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,970
No, that's not the point. The
point is there was a stigma
against being, you know,

534
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,910
a police officer and gay being gay.
How dare you take that away from them.

535
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,860
And there were a lot of proposals,
by the way,

536
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,970
during the pride parade with officers
and their uniform. That's beautiful.

537
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,280
Like what are you, are you really going
to try to marriage proposals? Yeah,

538
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,540
it's married. Yeah. Sorry. It's marriage
proposals. Yeah. It was like, oh my God,

539
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:07,470
this is such a great thing.
But no, no, no. Now they,
they've actually been banned.

540
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:07,890
They didn't,

541
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,740
they're not coming to the pride I think
for the next like five years or so. Um,

542
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,040
but that actually was not the
reason why I started to hate BLM.

543
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,920
Do you remember the Jordan Peterson
free speech event in Toronto? Oh,

544
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:23,880
yeah. Uh, so he teaches at
University of Toronto. My school,

545
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:27,070
and this is actually when I
started making videos. Um,

546
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,180
it was because during the,
the event he,

547
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,740
this was his first public event after
making the series of videos and um,

548
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,310
black lives matter was there, you
know, just there are two sides I guess.

549
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:41,130
And I wasn't really picking a side.
It was also my very first protest.

550
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,450
I was just there to observe.

551
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:44,670
I was very confused as to why
people were yelling at each other.

552
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:47,370
What was going on? Oh, I
should have just gotten home.

553
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,650
No. Yeah. So I, I, you know,

554
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,750
I observed the whole thing and
it was pretty peaceful there.

555
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,390
People of color went up there and
we're seeing things like, you know,

556
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,420
I don't feel oppressed. This is one of
the greatest countries in the world,

557
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,580
especially Toronto. Like this is so
diverse. It's everyone loves each,

558
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,630
everyone's nice to each other. Um,
you know, the black lives matter,

559
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:08,720
we're calling them coons,
they're calling up sellouts,

560
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,690
they're yelling all these things.
And I immediately knew who the aggressors,

561
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:16,350
where I immediately knew who,
which side I did not want to be on.

562
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:18,210
I wasn't picking sides,
but it was like, Oh God,

563
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,470
I stayed til the very end until the
last person left because this was again

564
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,230
first protest. I was like
excited and talking to everyone.

565
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,800
I got home and there are articles that
are posted by the school newspaper,

566
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:32,940
by Toronto Star about, you know, black
people were, you know, called the n word.

567
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:35,500
They were harassed. Someone
brought dogs, someone brought dot.

568
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,420
I was actually standing next
to the person with the dogs.

569
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,740
So when apparently brought
dogs to chase off the block,

570
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,710
black people complete lies. And that
opened my eyes to like the media bias.

571
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,280
That didn't happen, not even close
to being happening to happen.

572
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:50,860
So it blew my mind that
they would lie about that.

573
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:54,040
And then I personally messaged a,
the leader of black lives matter instead,

574
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,480
I am disappointed girl. I was there
like why are you doing this? Um,

575
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,050
and then I decided to start making videos
cause I said clearly there in getting

576
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,150
the wrong information, the
school, literally things.

577
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,080
Jordan Peterson was this Nazi that came
and said I hate black people and women

578
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:11,550
and transgenders and all about, um,
so I just thought like, you know what,

579
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,160
if no one's going to do it, I should do
it. And then I started making videos,

580
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,550
which was weird cause I had to go to
school the next day and then deal with

581
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:19,384
these people.

582
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,030
Yeah. But do you know what you, you put
your ass on the line and yeah, paid off.

583
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:27,350
Wait. So did, when you a DM, the
black lives matter president,

584
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:28,140
did she respond to you?

585
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,070
Yeah. She responded to me saying,
I'm, I'm going to screenshot this, uh,

586
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:35,340
to use against you in the future.
Why don't you say it to my face?

587
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:36,720
I still have it saved cause I'm like,

588
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm going to save this for the rest
of my life. Yeah. The, the president,

589
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,280
like the CO founder of black lives
matter Toronto said she's going to,

590
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I should say it to her face
and she's going to use this
against me in the future.

591
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,850
Meanwhile, all I said was, I was
there. This is very inappropriate.

592
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,580
Why are you telling lies or making
black people feel like, you know,

593
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:54,870
this is what actually happened.

594
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,780
You're making students feel like that's
why students feel like they're being

595
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:59,310
oppressed because you're telling them,
sorry,

596
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,620
what do you know?
What do you think these people,

597
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,710
and I don't mean just black lives
matter in this case, but like this,

598
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,020
this type of person at a university,

599
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,010
whether it's from gender studies
or whatever it is, you know,

600
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,870
with all the identity politics stuff,

601
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,600
what do you think they
actually want in the end?

602
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:20,020
Like if they were to get what they want,
what is that?

603
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,810
That's what I don't understand is that
the are obviously fakes because if they

604
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,850
truly care about black liberation,

605
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,840
there are policies that you could point
to that you can probably fix and help

606
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,520
the black community and,
and Canada,

607
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:37,110
one of the things was a carding and that
was actually immediately carding was

608
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:41,480
gone. I'm in Toronto, Ontario. I'm not
sure either the province or the city. Um,

609
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,770
but that's the one thing where
I was like, okay, random stops.

610
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,430
I think that's something
that you should be, you know,

611
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,120
stopped and it's done in inner city
neighborhoods and blah, blah blah.

612
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,020
Apart from that it's like, okay, what else
do you want? They want black professors.

613
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,870
They want police out of pride.
That's not helping black people.

614
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,110
That's not changing their social
economic status. So what do you,

615
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:01,830
what is your goal? I really don't
understand cause it's, you don't care.

616
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,650
I don't want to say, I mean I do
care. I don't want to say like I'm,

617
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,950
I have all the solutions but
I can tell you what to do.

618
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,320
But they are telling
people false solutions.

619
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:14,340
You're telling them that we need all black
professors to teach black people. Um,

620
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,060
but I don't know what their, what their
goal is. I don't know if I is money,

621
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:22,140
I guess. I really don't get
it. I don't get it seriously.

622
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,420
Okay.
