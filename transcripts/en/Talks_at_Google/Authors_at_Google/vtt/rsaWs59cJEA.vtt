RICK SMOLAN: Thank you.

00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:01.438
Thank you.

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:05.490
MEI-MEI ZHAO: All
right, welcome.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.830
So to start, I think
I speak for myself

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.500
and many people in
the audience when

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.930
I say being a professional
photographer is very cool.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.160
And I've definitely thought
that being a National Geographic

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.140
photographer and going
and chasing adventure

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.720
and action is just
something so unbelievable.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.350
So how did you first become
interested in photography,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.007
and how did you later decide
to turn it into a career?

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:36.340
RICK SMOLAN: I think that
probably my answer is probably

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.930
very similar to almost
any other, at least

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.380
male, photographer
you ask, which

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.685
is I was painfully
shy when I was a kid.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.435
And my dad gave me a
camera when I was 14.

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.768
It was the first time I could
go over and talk to girls.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.020
Seriously.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.832
I mean, every
photographer I know,

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:53.540
even the ones that
are the most outgoing,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.010
are kind of shy underneath.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.390
And it was just a great excuse.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.150
It also allowed me to
transition from group to group.

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.390
Well, when I was
growing up, I always

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.515
thought that most people
had a gene that taught you

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:07.054
how to talk to strangers and
it was left out of my kit

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:07.720
when I was born.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.678
And I thought if I watched
other people enough,

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:11.110
I could learn how to do it.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.150
So being a photographer,
it's sort of be-there,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.060
but-not-be-there.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.150
So I can hang out with the jocks
or the nerds or the freaks.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.720
Or I could move in and
out of different groups,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.780
and everybody
accepted me because I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.100
tended to make them look good.

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:25.930
And I never studied photography.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.590
It was my hobby.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.552
My dad was adamant about me
not being a photographer when

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:32.260
I told him I wanted
to be a photographer.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.176
When I grew up, I didn't
know what that meant,

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:37.059
but he wouldn't let
me go to a college

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:38.600
where they had a
photography program.

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:41.860
He said, I'm not going to
pay for you go to school

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.270
and end up doing wedding
pictures and baby portraits.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.780
I want you to be a doctor or
a lawyer or some serious job.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.880
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Don't
listen to your parents.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.960
See how wrong they were?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.160
RICK SMOLAN: So I did the
yearbook in high school

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.020
and in the newspaper, and
I just loved photography.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.999
It was just fun.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.290
MEI-MEI ZHAO: That's fantastic.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
So do you remember what was
your first major assignment when

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100
you were like, oh man,
this could actually

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.300
be something I want
to do with my life?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.360
RICK SMOLAN: A
friend of mine-- I

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.832
used to read "Popular
Photography."

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:13.040
Back then, it was really
the equivalent to the blogs.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.980
And a friend of mine
in college one day

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.296
read that "Life"
magazine was doing

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:20.670
"One Day in the
Life of America."

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.349
And he bet me $25.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.640
He thought I was a much better
photographer than I did.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.145
I was always very insecure.

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:28.440
I still am.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.430
And he bet me that I could
get hired by Life magazine.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550
So I took a train
to New York City.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.000
I was in Pennsylvania.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.400
And I had my yearbook
and a box of pictures.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.470
I had no appointment.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.300
I just show up at the
Time Life building,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.537
and I'm dressed in jeans
and sneakers and a t-shirt.

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:46.870
And I go to the reception
desk, and the woman says, yes,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.495
can I help you?

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:50.540
And I said, I'm here to see
the editor of "Life" magazine.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.520
And she goes, do you
have appointment?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.761
I said, no.

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.760
I read about this issue
that you guys are doing.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.960
And she said, well,
you can't just

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.975
show up here without
an appointment.

00:02:57.975 --> 00:02:58.620
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.100
And she waves me
out of the building.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.700
And I'm walking out
of the building,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.680
and there's all these guys
walking in jeans and t-shirts

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.180
bringing packages wrapped up
in brown paper with string.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.740
So I had this sort
of crazy idea.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.609
So I went around to Sam
Flax, wrapped up my yearbook

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.650
in paper and string, and
then followed these guys

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.029
into the freight elevator
and got up to the floor.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.570
And, of course, when I got out
and then went to the reception

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.600
desk, the woman there said,
well, who's the package for?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.390
I said, well, no, actually, I'm
here to see the photo editor.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.060
As she said--

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.970
MEI-MEI ZHAO: It
might be illegal,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.020
but at least it
got you in there.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.990
RICK SMOLAN: So she got
really angry and she said,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.920
you have to get out of here.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.128
So I go back to the elevator.

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:36.055
I remember I push
the Down button.

00:03:36.055 --> 00:03:36.930
I was standing there.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.620
I was thinking,
what would the hero

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.060
do in a movie at
this moment, like

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.784
if you're writing
this as a movie?

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:43.950
And I thought, this woman
works for "Life" magazine,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650
and she probably never
gets to see the pictures

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.483
until they come out.

00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:48.670
I had this thing
about "Life" magazine.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.540
If you were the secretary,
all your friends

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.248
would say it's so cool
to work at "Life,"

00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:54.070
but she probably
doesn't see anything.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.195
So I thought, I'll go back.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.153
I'll just show her two
of my favorite pictures.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.600
She'll kick me out, but at
least I'll feel like I tried.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.420
So I went back to her desk.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.252
She's on the phone.

00:04:02.252 --> 00:04:04.210
And I get that look like,
what the hell are you

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.876
doing back here?

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:06.456
But she's talking to somebody.

00:04:06.456 --> 00:04:07.830
And I'm standing
there trying not

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.550
to make eye contact, because
I know if I look at her,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.125
she's going to go,
get out of here.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:13.000
And some guy walks out
of one of the offices,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.541
and I'm looking down trying not
to make eye contact with her.

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.500
And this guy walks out.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.749
I remember looking down, and
he had jeans and sneakers

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:19.279
on like me.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.440
So I figured he was
also not important.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.527
And he said, hey
kid, what are those?

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:26.360
And I had these pictures,
and I was shaking.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.360
I was so nervous, because
the more this went on,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.350
the more I'm just
feeling terrible.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.382
And I said, oh, just
some of my pictures.

00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:33.340
He goes, can I see the?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.298
And I said, yeah, sure.

00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:37.035
And he looked through then and
he said, these are really good.

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:38.410
He said, what are
you doing here?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.575
And I just sort of lost it.

00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:43.390
I said, I came all the way
from my college and nobody

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.896
will talk to me and
all I want to do

00:04:44.896 --> 00:04:46.520
is just show my
pictures to the editor.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.478
He said, OK, calm down.

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:48.160
Calm down.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.130
He said, I'm Grey Villet.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.247
I'm the senior photographer
here at "Life,"

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:54.580
and I really like your pictures.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.538
And if you wait a minute,
I'll go back and talk

00:04:56.538 --> 00:04:59.290
to John Loengard, the
director of photography,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.430
and I'll see if he can see you.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.534
This woman gets off the
phone, and I've just

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:05.575
done what she's paid not
to allow ever to happen.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.320
And so he comes back
out, and he said, John.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.320
I thought he was going
to say, he can't see you,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.903
but thank you.

00:05:11.903 --> 00:05:13.830
And he said, John's really busy.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.026
And he said, if you
don't mind waiting,

00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.150
it might be an hour or two.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.608
It's like, I'll
sleep on the couch.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.360
I'll wait all day.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.880
It was not inconvenient.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.100
So about an hour
later, he comes out.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.552
And this guy comes out and
say, hi, I'm John Loengard.

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:27.510
Come back in my office.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.906
And he said, what do you got?

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:32.030
So I showed him my yearbook,
and I had some prints.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.160
I'm thinking, really?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.540
I mean, I brought my yearbook?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.870
I couldn't have even
done a portfolio?

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.219
And he goes through and he
says, these are pretty good.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.635
He said, so what
can I do for you?

00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:42.170
And I said, well,
I saw that you're

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.490
going to do this "One Day
in the Life of America."

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.500
And I said, I was hoping maybe
you'd might like to hire me?

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.400
And he said, well, you
know, we've already

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.310
hired 99 photographers,
and the whole concept

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.737
is 99 photographers one day.

00:05:53.737 --> 00:05:56.195
He said, why don't you take
some pictures and send them in?

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:58.225
And I remember taking
this deep breath

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:01.065
and I said, Mr. Loengard, my
whole life growing up I've

00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:04.105
been reading "Life" magazine,
and I would just do anything

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:06.605
if I could really be part of
the team, like, to be official.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.360
And I thought I'd
blown it, because he

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.950
had no expression
on his face at all.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.990
And he just sat there
and he just stared at me.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.790
And I remember I was
dripping with sweat,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.600
and he's just staring at me.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.430
Then I see a little smile
in the corner of his mouth.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.830
He goes, well, I guess
it wouldn't financially

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.410
bankrupt Time Life if we
made it 100 instead of 99.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.710
He said, OK, you're hired.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.149
So that was my first job.

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.940
And I photographed two
of my friends taking

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.570
a shower together at college.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.776
And her father turned out
to be a Baptist minister.

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:40.150
And this was the
picture everyone

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.580
talked about, because kids naked
in college-- what a concept,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.620
right?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.189
But it was the one
picture everybody

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:47.730
talked about when
the issue came out.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.480
So then I met the
people at "Time,"

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.920
and suddenly I had a job.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.450
And I'd never
studied photography,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.360
so I'm glad my friend
bet me the $25.

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:58.300
MEI-MEI ZHAO: That's incredible.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.580
So I think a lot of
us here can relate,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.785
because the Google job
interview process is--

00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:03.784
RICK SMOLAN: I've heard.

00:07:03.784 --> 00:07:04.678
It's the gauntlet.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.950
MEI-MEI ZHAO: But it
seems like you also

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.420
went through quite
the interview,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.560
but we're really
glad you got the job.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.570
So I watched your TED Talk.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.930
And so one of the projects
that you chose to pursue

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.105
is documenting
Amerasian children.

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:29.230
RICK SMOLAN: For those
of you who don't know,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.580
Amerasian children are American
fathers and Asian mothers,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.330
which happens wherever we
have troops in the world.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.030
Nothing to do with being at
war, but wherever we have bases,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.720
there are children being born
as a result of these bases.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.680
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, so
if you guys have time,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.180
if you have or
haven't watched, it's

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.010
a really incredible TED Talk.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.360
Do you mind giving us a
little bit more details

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.120
about that project
in particular?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.920
RICK SMOLAN: I'll
try to do it quickly,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.310
because as a photographer,
I had trouble staying

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.240
outside of the things
I'm photographing.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.390
I tend to get very
emotionally involved

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.360
in the stories I shoot.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.050
And I think all of
us, as photographers,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.850
hope that we're not
just documenting things,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.430
but maybe our pictures
could actually

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.900
have an effect on
people's lives.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.170
I mean, I think that's the
dream of every photojournalist.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.211
I also want to say that
there's a real difference

00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:20.290
between paparazzi,
fashion photographers, war

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.817
photographers, photojournalists.

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:23.650
Because they have a
camera around their neck

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.040
doesn't mean they're
all interchangeable.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.480
And there's certain
code of ethics

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.561
and certain
emotional things that

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.435
go along with different
kinds of photography.

00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:32.760
And I love being
a photojournalist,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.226
because I think journalist is
the part of it is you're not

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:36.850
just taking pictures,
but you're trying

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.527
to shine a light on
something and some injustice.

00:08:39.527 --> 00:08:42.110
You hope that your pictures may
actually touch somebody's life

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.240
or change them.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.830
So I found out that there
were 40,000 children who

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.670
have fathered by GIs
all over Southeast Asia.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.984
And in many of these
countries, the children,

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:56.650
by the local governments,
are considered

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.059
to be children of Americans.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:59.600
And the American
government considers

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.840
these to be the children
of prostitutes or whatever.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.230
These kids are stuck in this
horrible diplomatic limbo,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.110
and through no fault of
their own, obviously.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.380
But they're prejudiced against.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.129
They're beaten up.

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:12.240
They're made fun of.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.620
All of us growing up,
somebody would make fun of us

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.310
because we had a big
nose or big ears.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.760
You would imagine, from
your earliest memories,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.290
people ridiculing you simply
because of the reason that you

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.160
came to be.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.470
So I thought, at
the beginning, this

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.230
was the bad GIs getting
the poor girls pregnant

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.410
and leaving them.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.749
But when I actually when out
and started spending time,

00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:37.540
I found that everybody
was using everybody.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.270
The GIs wanted to
get laid, right?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.529
And the girls, in
some cases, wanted

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:43.570
to get pregnant, because
their families had said,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.740
if the guy marries you
and takes you to American,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.300
then we can all come.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.190
And so all I cared about were
these poor kids, because I just

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.830
thought, as a kid that was
really shy and made fun of,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.070
I could really identify with
a lot of these children.

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:00.910
It was a three-day
story for Time Magazine,

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.830
but I got so
disturbed by it that I

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.830
decided I would take
six months off and find

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.010
six kids in different
countries and go

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.343
back and forth amongst the kids.

00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:09.710
And my fantasy was that the
story would get published,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.335
and I would send a copy of it to
every congressman and senator,

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:16.280
and people would do so outraged
that something would happen.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.030
I couldn't find a
single American magazine

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.113
that would tell the story.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:20.430
What?

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.160
Illegitimate children
of American GIs?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.240
Forget it.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.170
We're not going there.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.590
I mean, nobody would publish it.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.239
I finally found a
German magazine.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:28.780
And at the last
minute, they ended up

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.820
pulling all the strongest
pictures, because they

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.070
were worried it was going
to offend their advertisers.

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:35.000
So in the middle of
doing this story,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.416
I met this one
little girl who was

00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:38.250
unlike all the other children.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.520
She was not cowed by this.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.040
She didn't seem to be haunted.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.450
In fact, she was popular.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.160
She was the most American of
any kids that I photographed.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.506
And long story short, in the
course of photographing her,

00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:53.469
her grandmother,
who had raised her

00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:55.260
and had done a wonderful
job of raising her

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.860
in this little village up
along the DMZ in South Korea

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.604
but near North Korea--
the grandmother

00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:02.020
died and left her
to me in a will.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.799
I was 28 years
old, and suddenly I

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.840
had this 11-year-old that
looked American, didn't

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.280
speak a word of English.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.580
And I won't tell you the whole
story, but it's on ted.com.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.312
And it's exciting to
think that a million

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:14.270
people have watched it.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.670
And she's sort of like
my kid sister now.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:21.340
And our children-- the strangest
part is my kids are 12 and 14,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.550
and her kids are seven and nine.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.920
So our children have
sleepovers together now.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.450
And part of my brain still
can't quite get around that.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.490
I still think of her as
this 11-year-old girl.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.302
And she is more mature and
smarter and wiser than me,

00:11:35.302 --> 00:11:37.010
and she has been since
the day I met her.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.047
And I've given you the
CliffsNotes version

00:11:39.047 --> 00:11:41.380
of the story, but when you
see the pictures of this girl

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.300
and you see her
story and how she's

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.985
touched other people's lives.

00:11:44.985 --> 00:11:46.830
And I've never
published the story.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.330
I just decided the
best gift I could

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.390
give her is to put
the pictures in a box

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.590
and put them in the closet.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.390
And now that her
daughter's almost 11,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.850
which is the age that I met
her at, she's been saying,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.966
why don't we do a book?

00:11:57.966 --> 00:11:59.340
It would be fun
to do a book now,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.470
because it's sort
of like full circle.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.410
So I think Natasha's story and
now this new movie, "Tracks"--

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.921
both are labors of love for me.

00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:10.420
They're both things that I got
very emotionally involved in.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.295
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, it
would be great to have

00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:14.030
Natasha come in a TED Talk.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.650
She seems to be
quite the young lady.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.150
It'll be--

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.566
RICK SMOLAN: She's
so poised and funny.

00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.430
MEI-MEI ZHAO: She
is, and it's amazing

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.850
how you're able
to capture so much

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.270
of her character in your photos.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.760
And it would be
great to follow up

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.552
with her to see what
she's up to these days.

00:12:27.552 --> 00:12:29.650
RICK SMOLAN: You know what
I thought would be fun?

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.316
I realize that we
have very little time,

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:33.370
and thank you all
so much for coming.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.020
I was wondering if we jumped
to the trailer for "Tracks"?

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.130
It's a two-minute trailer.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.740
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, of course.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.989
RICK SMOLAN: Mei-Mei, can I
set it up just one second?

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:41.310
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.200
So yeah.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.480
So Rick has also been working on
a book for the movie "Tracks."

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.660
So "Tracks" is a movie
that-- you know what?

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.450
I'm just going to
let Rick tell you.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.340
But it's about Rick's
journey through Australia.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.557
And it originally was a
book made into a movie.

00:13:02.557 --> 00:13:04.515
And now Rick is writing
a book about the movie.

00:13:04.515 --> 00:13:06.030
RICK SMOLAN: And about
the original trip.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.530
It's sort of one of those--
what is it?-- the Russian dolls.

00:13:09.437 --> 00:13:11.770
MEI-MEI ZHAO: [INAUDIBLE],
but it was quite interesting.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.120
So yeah.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.620
So please give us a little
description about the project.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.786
RICK SMOLAN: So I'll set
it up really quickly, which

00:13:16.786 --> 00:13:19.230
is before the Natasha story,
before the Amerasian story,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.354
"Time Magazine" sent me to
the Outback of Australia

00:13:21.354 --> 00:13:23.281
to do a cover story
on Aborigines.

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:24.780
And there was a
woman I've been told

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.600
to contact who was
a social worker that

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.641
worked with Aborigines to
take me into the campus

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.550
to get permission.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.850
And so I checked into
my hotel, and the woman

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.880
who I had hired-- I
hadn't met her yet,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.270
but she lived down the street.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.500
I meet her down the street.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.950
I walked into my
hotel, and I looked up,

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.158
and the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen in my life

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:42.970
is washing the
windows of my hotel.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.942
And I was 20 years old.

00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:45.400
I had three cameras
around my neck.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.310
And I took some pictures of
her, and she got really angry

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.560
and started yelling at me
to put my damn cameras down,

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.601
and who the hell are you?

00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:53.580
And so I walked
over and apologized,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.250
but I couldn't really
calm her down, so I left.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.090
And I shot pictures
of Aborigines all day

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.532
with this woman who
took me to the camps.

00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.490
And the woman working
for me said, what are you

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.330
doing for dinner tonight?

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.290
I said, I'm going to go
back and work on captions.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.740
And she said, well, a group of
us that work with Aborigines

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.330
are having dinner
at a friend's house.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.050
Would you like to come and
meet some other people involved

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.900
in the aboriginal
community and movement?

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.572
So I went to this house
on the outside of town,

00:14:15.572 --> 00:14:17.780
and it was falling down and
the walls were crumbling.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.154
There was no roof,
and I thought,

00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:20.900
this can't be the right address.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.580
And I knocked on the
door, and of course

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.190
who opens the door
but the woman who'd

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.155
been watching the
windows of my hotel

00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:29.194
who was not happy to see me and
told me to put my cameras down.

00:14:29.194 --> 00:14:30.610
I couldn't photograph
her friends.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.790
It's like, OK.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.440
So I walk in and she's got
camels tied up in the backyard.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.350
And I said, why do
you have camels?

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.829
And she wouldn't tell me.

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:39.370
So I went to the
woman working for me

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.630
and said, why does
your friend have camels

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.434
and why is she so mean?

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:45.600
Sorry I took a picture of
her, but I didn't actually

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.890
kill anybody or anything.

00:14:47.996 --> 00:14:49.620
And she said, oh,
Robyn's going to walk

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.890
2,000 miles across the
Outback of Australia

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.450
from here through the desert
out to the Indian Ocean.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.330
And said, why?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.200
And she said, we
don't know, and we

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.060
want to go because we're afraid
she's going to die out there.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.893
She won't let any of
us come, and we're just

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:02.757
terrified that she's
going to disappear.

00:15:02.757 --> 00:15:05.090
So anyway, during the week,
I kept meeting these people.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.734
At the end of the week,
the woman working for me--

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:08.775
it was my last day there.

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:11.400
And she said, Robin
wants to ask you a favor,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.942
but she's been kind of mean to
you and now she's embarrassed.

00:15:13.942 --> 00:15:15.149
And I said, what's the favor?

00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:17.966
I thought maybe she wants copies
of my pictures or something.

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:20.590
And she said, well, she wrote to
National Geographic a year ago

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.715
and asked if they would
give her money so she could

00:15:22.715 --> 00:15:24.750
buy the saddles and
the special equipment

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.560
that she needs to
survive out there,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.784
and they never even answered.

00:15:27.784 --> 00:15:29.700
And she thought maybe
you might know somebody,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.600
if she could use your
name, because she doesn't

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.849
want to spend another year
washing windows and waiting

00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.660
on idiots in pubs.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.380
And I said, well, I've met some
of the editors at workshops.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.570
I mean, working for National
Geographic was something when

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.630
I'm 90 years old,
if you're lucky.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.120
So I said sure, thinking
that would be the end of it.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.050
I went back to New
York and I got a call

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.100
a week later from the editor
of National Geographic, who

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.870
said that they'd gotten
a letter from this woman.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.840
It sounded interesting.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.140
They were thinking
of funding her trip.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.149
But was she a nut case?

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:58.440
Was she going to die out there?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.140
Because they didn't want
"National Geographic-funded

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.456
explorer dies on week two."

00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:04.955
And I said, well,
she's very intent.

00:16:04.955 --> 00:16:05.746
She's very serious.

00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:06.780
I've seen her maps.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.657
I've seen the camels.

00:16:07.657 --> 00:16:09.990
And he said, well, since you
guys are such good friends,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.239
would you like to be the
photographer that we send out

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.350
to find her along the way?

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.495
So anyway, if we can
jump to the trailer.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.390
This is a movie, which opened
last week all over the United

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.760
States.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.762
Mia Wasikowska, this wonderful
actress, just-- it's so eerie.

00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:28.220
I'll show you some
of the pictures,

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.140
but she looks exactly like
Robyn did during this trip.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.430
And it's produced
by the same people

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.910
who did "The King's Speech."

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.390
And they're already talking
Oscar nominations for Mia.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.350
So can we roll that?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.120
OK, here we go.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.383
Maybe bring the lights down
on us a little bit here.

00:16:42.383 --> 00:16:43.049

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.890
When people ask me why I'm
doing it, my usual answer is,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.390
why not?

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.810
-Your plan is ridiculous.

00:17:01.098 --> 00:17:03.235
-Why don't you just
show them the trip?

00:17:03.235 --> 00:17:04.464
Talina will come to you.

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:06.544
-I just want to be by myself.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.080
-You must be mad, girly.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.819
You know, that's about 2,000
miles, six months of hard walk.

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:20.760
-You want to die out
there or something?

Go away!

00:18:02.508 --> 00:18:03.999

[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.734
RICK SMOLAN: The
cinematographer,

00:18:35.734 --> 00:18:39.830
a woman named Mandy Walker,
she did most incredible job

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.235
of capturing what it
felt like out there--

00:18:42.235 --> 00:18:44.610
what the lake was
like, the dust.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.620
Mia gives this amazing, very
understated performance,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.040
where she says very little
and she communicate so much

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.680
in the film.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.720
It was so eerie sitting
in the movie theater,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.816
as you can probably
imagine, watching

00:18:54.816 --> 00:18:56.940
literally my photographs
come to life, because they

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.231
took a lot of the pictures
and actually built the sets.

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:02.360
Actually, maybe if you could
jump to some of the pictures

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.002
while we're talking,
It would be fun.

00:19:04.002 --> 00:19:05.460
I'll show you some
of the pictures.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.640
And you see the real Robyn.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.054
You see Mia back and forth,
and it's just really eerie.

00:19:11.054 --> 00:19:12.720
MEI-MEI ZHAO: I got
to ask, what does it

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.632
feel like to see yourself
portrayed on film?

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:15.840
And did you pick Adam Driver?

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.658
RICK SMOLAN: No, no,
they chose that one.

00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:18.930
MEI-MEI ZHAO: They
chose that one?

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:19.470
RICK SMOLAN: He's great.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.710
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Did you
feel like he portrayed you

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.190
in an accurate manner?

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.240
I can't imagine watching
someone play me on a big screen.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.680
So how does that feel?

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.530
RICK SMOLAN: It was
very odd and eerie.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.610
My brother is a
director in Hollywood

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.670
and said, look, you need
to realize that they're

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.349
going to-- those of you
who are into movies--

00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:41.390
the arc of the character,
you have to start here.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.190
And in real life, most
people don't change.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.439
But in movies, everybody
starts here and ends up here.

00:19:45.439 --> 00:19:47.310
So he said, basically,
they're going

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.100
to make you the irritating pest
at the beginning of the movie.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.090
And then as you go on hopefully
by the end of the movie,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.410
you redeem yourself.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.136
And that was pretty
much what they did.

00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:57.510
I mean, I think
they exaggerated.

00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:00.160
As I said, I'm not a
fashion photographer.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.360
And, of course, they had him
posing me and say, turn left.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.860
Turn right.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.850
Move your shoulders like this.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.530
Which that would be like a "New
York Times" reporter making up

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.700
a quote.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.960
But I'm fine with it.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.820
I mean, I think the
director, John Curran,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.170
did a wonderful job.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.030
And we're doing a new book,
which is this book here.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.240
I got to go back.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.987
I shot tens of
thousands of photographs

00:20:20.987 --> 00:20:21.820
during Robyn's trip.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.880
And even though
National Geographic

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.840
did this-- where is it?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.644
It's buried here.

00:20:26.644 --> 00:20:27.560
So this was the cover.

00:20:28.522 --> 00:20:29.480
You can be Vanna White.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.438
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Now, this
was the original cover.

00:20:33.972 --> 00:20:36.430
RICK SMOLAN: So even though
they did a 32-page cover story,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.450
which for any photographer,
32 pages is just unbelievable.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.150
But I shot literally tens
of thousands of pictures.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.770
And it's almost like
which of your children

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:46.880
make it into the lifeboat?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.338
You have to choose
just-- you know?

00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:50.270
So that's Robyn on
the left with her dog,

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.407
Diggity, and that's
Mia on the right.

00:20:52.407 --> 00:20:53.990
They even put here
in the same blouse.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.920
They went and manufactured
the same clothes

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.720
that we wore back then.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.570
If you go to the next
picture, I sort of put

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:00.660
a lot of comparisons.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.189
That's us on the left.

00:21:02.189 --> 00:21:03.730
And that's Mia and
Adam on the right.

00:21:04.907 --> 00:21:06.740
I don't know why they
felt it was necessary,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.190
why they wanted to have
the actors look like us

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.370
or wear our clothes,
but it was kind of cool.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.210
I mean, who would know the
difference other than you

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.500
now that we've kind of met?

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.720
But, I mean, it doesn't change
the entertainment value of it.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.050
If you go to the next picture,
he's a little taller than me.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.565
Roby's still gorgeous
as she was back then.

00:21:28.565 --> 00:21:30.690
Actually at the end of the
movie it's kind of cool,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.892
because they show-- at the very
end of the movie, Mia swims

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.350
underwater and the
credits come up,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.960
and they go to the
original pictures

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.470
in National Geographic.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.100
I've seen the movie quite a few
times now at film festivals.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.340
And you hear people in the
audience go, oh my god,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:43.881
that's right.

00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:45.270
This actually happened.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.270
Because you going in it's
based on a real story,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.780
but when you actually see the
real Robyn and the real camels,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.612
it makes the story
even more touching.

00:21:52.612 --> 00:21:54.320
Can I share something
with your audience?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.570
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, of course.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.170
RICK SMOLAN: I'm a
technology junkie.

00:21:58.264 --> 00:21:59.930
So many of our books
have done something

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.600
like-- we were the first ones
ever to put a CD-ROM in a book.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.900
It seems like a long time ago.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.610
We were the first
people to ever do

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.740
a mass-customized best seller,
where every copy of "America

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.197
24/7" you could upload
your own photographs,

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:13.780
and you were on the
cover of our book,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.488
but it was a "New York
Times" bestseller.

00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:18.190
So this new book combines a
number of different things.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.700
So first of all, it's really,
I think, kind of cool.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.730
Pictures from Robyn's
original journey.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.222
And this is a big wide book.

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:27.430
We're actually doing a
Kickstarter campaign right now

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.930
for this.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.980
And so the first part
of it is actually

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.990
taking you through
her original journey.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.390
She wrote a book
called "Tracks,"

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.510
which is why the
movie's called "Tracks,"

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.222
and she sold a million
copies in 18 languages.

00:22:39.222 --> 00:22:40.680
But I'll show you
the coolest part,

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.640
which is that we have an app,
if can find the page here.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.810
There's a free app you can
download called Aurasma.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.630
It's made by HP.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.049
And so throughout
the book, we've

00:22:50.049 --> 00:22:51.590
done something kind
of cool-- I think

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.320
it's cool-- which
is you simply point

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.950
your phone at photographs.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.990
There's a little picture of a
little icon of a phone here.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.540
And this works on
Android or iOS.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.055
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Would it be
easier if I helped you hold it?

00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:03.470
RICK SMOLAN: Yeah.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.428
OK, so you can do that.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.183
And then all I do is point
my phone at that photograph.

00:23:10.183 --> 00:23:12.480
Let's see if I'm getting
good Wi-Fi in here.

00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:14.380
Let's see.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.200
Is it working?

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.270
I'm probably not getting
good signal here.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.360
There we go.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.539
And now it's playing
that scene in the movie.

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:25.080
So this is the scene of Robyn
writing to National Geographic.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.997
Well, it's Mia writing
to National Geographic.

00:23:26.997 --> 00:23:28.413
And so throughout
the whole book--

00:23:28.413 --> 00:23:29.176
[RINGTONE CHIMING]

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:29.884
--you get to see.

00:23:29.884 --> 00:23:30.627
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.627 --> 00:23:32.085
MEI-MEI ZHAO:
Perfect time to call.

00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:33.267
RICK SMOLAN: It's probably
Harvey Weinstein saying,

00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:34.201
you can't do that.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.430
So it's really kind of fun
to see the original Robyn

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.610
in the book, and then you
to see that scene as it

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.740
came to life in the movie.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.617
And then-- I can do this
part-- so halfway-- sorry?

00:23:46.617 --> 00:23:48.450
AUDIENCE: Were you the
first one to do this?

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:48.900
RICK SMOLAN: I think so.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.530
I've never seen this done.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.240
Before.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.920
HP uses it for advertising.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.630
So like in a magazine,
you point at a sneaker,

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.660
and then you can
rotate the sneaker.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.270
But I think using this
in an editorial context

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.530
is really cool.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.850
We did this actually last
year in "The Human Face

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.876
of Big Data," which
Google was a sponsor of.

00:24:05.876 --> 00:24:08.250
And you could actually point
to different people in here.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.370
They would give you their
TED Talk, basically.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.590
So the still image--
what's so cool about it

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.640
is if I point to a
picture-- so here.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.890
You'll get a kick out of this.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.200
Here's National Geographic
from 1978, right?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.590
Let me find this picture.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.770
There's a picture Robyn sitting
by the campfire learning

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.210
to speak aboriginal dialects.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.470
So this is the original copy.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.230
Nothing's been done to it.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.360
And I'll show you.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.420
It actually works on an issue of
National Geographic from 1978.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.170
People said, wait.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.100
How did you embed something
in the picture in 1978?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.120
And I didn't.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.020
Let's see if this works.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.520
OK.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.250
So this is the scene of Adam.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.760
This is Robyn by
the fire at night.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.887
This is Adam and Mia
by the fire at night.

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:52.845
So it's actually like a
fingerprint technology.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:56.106
It actually recognizes the
picture as a unique pattern.

00:24:56.106 --> 00:24:57.730
And anywhere it sees
that, whether it's

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.210
a poster, on the internet, even
a fuzzy black and white picture

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.820
in a magazine, it'll trigger
that video, which is so cool.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.040
MEI-MEI ZHAO: That's amazing.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:06.650
RICK SMOLAN: The
fact that you can

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.625
do this with an old National
Geographic is just so freaky.

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:10.385
MEI-MEI ZHAO: That's incredible.

00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:12.460
RICK SMOLAN: The Kickstarter
campaign that we're doing

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.960
is-- people said,
well, can't I just

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.580
buy this eventually on
Amazon if you get funded?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.730
And the answer is yes.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.040
But one of the
rewards is you get

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.030
a copy of the original
National Geographic

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.770
together with the book.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.470
We've also got
prints from the book.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.610
Anyway, I'm not
trying to sell you,

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.776
but if you're looking for
a cool gift for somebody--

00:25:29.776 --> 00:25:32.767
But the second half of the
book is actually the movie.

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:33.850
So let me go back to that.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.370
So these are now images.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.890
The filmmakers allowed me to go
into the movie footage itself

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.069
and actually take still
frames out of the movie.

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:44.110
And this woman, Mandy
Walker, the cinematographer

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.544
I mentioned, was so good.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.210
So I went through the
movie at one frame

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.600
a second on my
MacBook Air and found

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.690
images that looked
like still photographs

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.140
that a photojournalist
would take,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.056
and then we associated
the screenplay with it.

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:56.520
So you get to meet
the real Robin.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.130
Then you go back and you see
this is the campfire scene.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.090
This is six color
printing spot varnish.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.260
I couldn't find
anybody to publish it.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.551
I went to all these publishers.

00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:08.210
I mean, I've done pretty well
as a publisher over the years.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.959
But they all said, oh,
it's too expensive.

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:11.510
What if the movie
doesn't do well?

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.950
I said, I want
six-color printing,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.060
thick matte paper, spot varnish.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.810
So my friends say, do
it as a Kickstarter.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.935
And there's so many people
that love Robyn's story.

00:26:18.935 --> 00:26:20.160
It's so inspiring.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.630
And there's sort
of a mystery to it

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.705
also, which is that the
question is probably

00:26:23.705 --> 00:26:25.830
the first question each of
you has is, why on earth

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.210
would somebody do this?

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.062
And I always think of
it like the Mona Lisa.

00:26:32.062 --> 00:26:33.770
If we knew why the
Mona Lisa was smiling,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.690
we wouldn't be talking
about the Mona Lisa.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.680
And she didn't do
this purposely.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.340
But I think it's a very
complicated answer of what

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.900
drove her to let go of society.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.830
Imagine no GPS.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.570
No phones.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.530
No satellites.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.940
I made her take a Flying
Doctor radio, which

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.480
is the one time she needed it.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.500
It didn't work.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.357
She was attacked by wild camels.

00:26:54.357 --> 00:26:56.690
She said, sometimes on the
map, she'd come up to a place

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.106
where it would
show one road going

00:26:58.106 --> 00:27:00.979
to the right, like a path, a
dirt road, and one to the left.

00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:02.895
And she'd get there and
there'd be five roads.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.589
Because since the
maps were done,

00:27:05.589 --> 00:27:07.130
farmers would be
out there, ranchers.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.350
People were just
basically driven so far

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.684
in this one direction, it
would become another road.

00:27:11.684 --> 00:27:14.100
And she said on the map it
says, take the road on the left

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.680
and there'll be a well
two weeks along that road.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.449
And she'd be walking
for two weeks going,

00:27:19.449 --> 00:27:20.490
what if I took the wrong?

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.100
So she did right out of water.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.610
I mean, it's an amazing
story how she survived.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.275
And it isn't just luck.

00:27:27.275 --> 00:27:29.220
I mean, so many of
the ways that she

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.750
solved your problems
were just so clever.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:37.650
There's a scene in the movie
where she is with her dog

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.244
and she gets
separated the camel.

00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:40.910
She's lost and she
goes back to find it.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.880
And she finds the
thing that she's loss.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.030
And then she turns around
and can't figure out

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.870
where she left the camels.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.530
And she didn't take any
water, and she's with her dog,

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.380
and she's totally
freaking out and trying

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.810
to figure out what to do.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.744
And I'm not going to
ruin it, but if you

00:27:55.744 --> 00:27:57.160
want to see a movie
that you can't

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.000
stop thinking about afterwards,
it's playing at the Angelica

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.451
down here and at the Lincoln
Plaza Cinemas uptown.

00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:05.200
But there's so many
things like that movie

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.450
where you see the fierce
intelligence of this woman.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.210
And she's one of the
few people I've ever

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.410
met in my life who-- most of
us spend our lives avoiding

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.074
the things that frighten us.

00:28:15.074 --> 00:28:17.240
And sometimes this negative
center of gravity-- it's

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.199
always pushing it away.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:19.990
And I think she's the
only person I've ever

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.790
met that actually goes
towards the things

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.730
not in a masochistic
way but to see it as,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.920
is that really worthy of
my spending my whole life

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.620
not doing something?

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.190
So I've never met anybody that
actually challenges themselves

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.731
all the time.

00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:33.630
I was very inspired
spending time with her.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.838
MEI-MEI ZHAO: That's amazing.

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:36.960
And she sounds incredible
and so does this film.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.850
But how did you
feel about the trip,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.300
especially now looking
retrospectively?

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.090
Was it as more difficult
and challenging

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.690
than you had expected?

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.450
RICK SMOLAN: I wasn't
even a Boy Scout.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.645
So my friends said, you're
the ones getting back out

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:50.036
there, not her.

00:28:50.036 --> 00:28:51.120
At least she's been
preparing for this.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.680
MEI-MEI ZHAO: So, I'm going
to say, you did the trip too,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:52.900
yeah.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.790
You did the trip too.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.800
RICK SMOLAN: I mean, I
had a four-wheel drive,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.260
air-conditioned car, listening
to Jackson Browne in my care.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.010
I'm really digging myself here.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.510
I was 28 at the time, but
emotionally, I was about 19.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.480
So every girlfriend
I'd had lasted a week,

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.350
and I'd get an assignment and it
never worked through anything.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.487
And Robyn was one of these
people that would challenge.

00:29:17.487 --> 00:29:19.320
There were just ways
she challenged herself.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.230
She was always challenging me.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.854
I remember earlier on the trip
on day one of the first times

00:29:24.854 --> 00:29:27.020
I went out with her, we
were sitting around talking.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.790
And she said, when
are you get here?

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.760
And I said, what?

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.010
And she'd been out there
about too much at that point.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.510
And she said, when are
you going to get here?

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.970
And I thought, oh,
she'd gone nuts.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.110
I mean, being out
there alone that much,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.010
you get a little crazy.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.670
And I said, Robyn, I'm sitting
right here in front of you.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.070
I just couldn't imagine
what she was talking about.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.650
And she said, no, you're not.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.700
She said, since you
got here a day ago,

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.050
you've been talking about
your Time cover story

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.810
for Taiwan, where you're going
to leave the car in two weeks.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.210
It's like you come out
here and you're everywhere

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.000
except with me.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.420
It's like if you're going to
come out here, damn it, then

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:57.920
be here.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.639
But don't spend the
whole time with me

00:29:59.639 --> 00:30:01.180
planning what you're
going to do next

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.040
or thinking about what
you should done yesterday.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.930
And it was one of those
things where somebody

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.560
goes like that to you, and
you kind of go, you know what?

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560
You're absolutely right.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.000
I mean, so many of us
spend our time in the past

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.810
or in the future and
never where we are.

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.320
I kept saying to her
throughout the trip,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.530
you've got to keep a journal?

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.390
I mean, someday
you're going to want

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.515
to write a book about this.

00:30:18.515 --> 00:30:22.086
And she said, why do you have to
turn everything into a product?

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.960
Like, why can't you
experience things and not

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.820
be always marketing and
packaging it and doing this?

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.670
MEI-MEI ZHAO: I
was going to say.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.211
RICK SMOLAN: I guess I didn't
listen to that advice too well.

00:30:32.211 --> 00:30:36.030
But it was like going to school.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.246
And, of course, I
was smitten with her.

00:30:38.246 --> 00:30:38.745
And--

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.870
MEI-MEI ZHAO: And this
blossoming romance.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.310
RICK SMOLAN: It was
somewhat mutual.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.976
I think it was probably
more on my side.

00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:46.361
But it was the most
interesting year of my life.

00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:47.860
And we're really
good friends still,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.730
and we talk all the time.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.850
The most fun thing
with the movie

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.660
was that I got to
go to Australia when

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.490
the movie came out.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:57.060
And the filmmakers put us on
a two-week publicity tour.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.552
We didn't keep
watching the movie.

00:30:58.552 --> 00:31:00.260
We'd show up at the
end of the screenings

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.551
and do a Q&amp;A with the audience.

00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:04.260
And it was just so much
fun being with her again

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.230
and just comparing
memories, because we

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.690
are very different memories
of some of the trip as well.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.975
It was just normal.

00:31:09.975 --> 00:31:11.350
MEI-MEI ZHAO: So
part two of this

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.530
is bringing her in and
asking her side of the story.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.820
RICK SMOLAN: Yeah,
when she's in New York,

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.510
she should come
and visit you guys.

00:31:17.574 --> 00:31:19.240
Just one of the most
interesting people.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.450
And everything's just
constantly original thinking.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.680
It comes with things from
a different perspective

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.090
than most people.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.340
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Now, what is
she doing in New York City?

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.250
RICK SMOLAN: Right now,
she's back in Australia.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.541
Actually, she's in Bali today
at a writer's conference.

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:37.450
Remember when we all
read "Catcher in the Rye"

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.844
growing up in school?

00:31:38.844 --> 00:31:40.760
Her book, "Tracks," is
like that in Australia.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.130
Every school kid reads "Tracks."

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.625
They actually have a
29-page study guide,

00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:46.500
which we're actually
offering with this, too,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.720
as the Kickstarter
thing, because it's

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.011
sort of very thought-provoking.

00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:50.630
The kids talk
about, what is Robyn

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.010
say about aboriginal rights?

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.640
And why did she want to spend
time with the Aborigines?

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.655
And what was her
relationship with the camels?

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.092
I'll give you one
back story if you're

00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:01.800
going to see the movie
that will actually

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.990
make you enjoy the
movie more, which

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.670
is that she had this wonderful
dog with her named Diggity.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.330
And Diggity saved her life
many times during the trip.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.860
It was like her daughter, her
companion, her sleeping bag,

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.610
confidant.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.070
You talk to Diggity
all day long.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.317
And this is not in the movie.

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:19.400
It's not even in her book.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.910
But two years before
the camel trip,

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.181
Robyn was working as a janitor
at a hospital in Brisbane.

00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:27.680
And so she'd come in at night
and clean all the garbage out.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.470
And she heard these terrible
cries coming from the basement

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.250
and found out that they
were taking animals

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.860
from kill shelters
and using them

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.400
to experiment on dogs and cats.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.490
And she just said she
couldn't stand it.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.860
And she waited till
everybody was gone one night

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.430
and came back with the keys
and opened up all the cages,

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.526
opened all the doors, and
let all the animals out.

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:48.400
And there was one puppy
that had been brought

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.605
in that morning that
didn't run away.

00:32:51.605 --> 00:32:52.480
And that was Diggity.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.510
That became her dog.

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:56.050
MEI-MEI ZHAO: I'm
getting a tear in my ear.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.549
RICK SMOLAN: When
you see the movie,

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:59.660
that story will
resonate with you.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.400
Reviewers been saying that
amongst many other things

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.480
about this movie, the
relationship between Robyn

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.380
and her dog is something
you'll never forget.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.505
It's just extraordinary.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.546
Anyway, I'm getting
tears in my eyes too.

00:33:14.974 --> 00:33:17.070
MEI-MEI ZHAO: All
right, so that's great.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.950
I think I'm definitely
going to go see the movie.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.710
I can't wait.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.905
And now I think everyone in the
audience feels the same way.

00:33:23.905 --> 00:33:26.889
So I do want to leave some
time to talk about "The Human

00:33:26.889 --> 00:33:29.055
Face of Big Data," which
is a very exciting project.

00:33:31.034 --> 00:33:32.700
Do you mind telling
us a little bit more

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.860
about "The Human
Face of Big Data"?

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.390
I think this would be the
audience who would enjoy it.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.640
RICK SMOLAN: I'm a TED junkie.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:45.310
I love going to TED and other
conferences-- ideacity and EEG.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.520
And Marissa Mayer,
an old friend--

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.450
I met her at TED
probably 10 years ago.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.270
And when she was
still at Google,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.580
we were talking at TED one day.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.329
And she said, so what's
your next project?

00:33:57.329 --> 00:33:59.950
And I started doing these
geographic projects.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.320
You know, "One Day in the
Life of America," coming out

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.390
of that first "Life"
assignment or Australia

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.410
or other countries.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.500
And then I thought, what if
you could take the same idea?

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.375
So the concept of the
"Day in the Life" books

00:34:09.375 --> 00:34:11.510
was I invited my
heroes, my peers,

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.074
and some young
photographers, and we

00:34:13.074 --> 00:34:14.449
would spend months
getting ready.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.976
But we'd fly them to a country
and we'd say, on your mark,

00:34:16.976 --> 00:34:17.670
get set, go.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.460
We'd distribute them
around the country

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.774
geographically and thematically
and say, OK, you got 24 hours.

00:34:22.774 --> 00:34:25.190
Again, it got turned down by
every publisher in the world.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.170
They said, what a stupid idea.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.794
It's like, who would care about
a bunch of photographers taking

00:34:28.794 --> 00:34:31.232
pictures on a day in
some godforsaken country?

00:34:31.232 --> 00:34:33.190
And it became the
bestselling photography books

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.815
ever published.

00:34:33.815 --> 00:34:35.449
I think we sold
five million copies.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.530
20,000 was a best seller.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.239
So I thought, what if we took
that same idea, and instead

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.630
of a geographic sort of random
"what happens in a day," what

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.949
if we did a deep dive on how the
human race is learning to heal

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:51.159
itself, or the global water
crisis, or-- Marissa's idea

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.699
was, why don't you
look at big data?

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:53.710
Because I was trying
figure out what to do?

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.112
And I said, what's that?

00:34:55.112 --> 00:34:56.570
And she said, well,
some people say

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.685
it's so much
information it doesn't

00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:58.785
fit in your personal computer.

00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:00.710
And I said, that doesn't
sound very interesting.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.293
And she said, well,
other people think

00:35:02.293 --> 00:35:04.370
it's overlapping data
sets to find patterns.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.320
And I said, I'm a photographer
and I don't get it.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.446
And she said, OK,
a lot of us think

00:35:10.446 --> 00:35:11.820
we're watching
the planet develop

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.430
a rudimentary nervous
system and that all

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.090
of us with our
smartphones are starting

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.030
to become sensors and nodes
on this growing brain.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.420
And I said, whoa,
say that again.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.509
And it was such a cool idea.

00:35:23.509 --> 00:35:24.925
So she and her
husband, Zack, came

00:35:24.925 --> 00:35:26.450
and spent a day
with us in New York

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.600
brainstorming how
to do this project.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.800
She was so generous.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.140
And the first thing
she pointing me to-- I

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.339
decide Eric Schmidt walking out
as we walked in this morning.

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:36.880
The first thing
Marissa pointed me to

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.080
was this wonderful
quote of Eric's saying

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.382
that of all the data from the
dawn of humanity to 2003--

00:35:42.382 --> 00:35:44.920
I don't know how he figure
this out-- was five exabytes.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.960
And now every two
days, the human race

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.200
is generating five exabytes.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.070
Now, even if you don't know
what an exabyte is, and you all

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.690
do but I didn't
at the time-- I'm

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.390
still not quite sure I
do-- the fact that we're

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.460
seeing a straight vertical
line is unbelievable.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:03.485
She also told me
that the first day

00:36:03.485 --> 00:36:05.609
of a baby's life,
the human race is now

00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:07.900
generating 70 times the amount
of information contained

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.110
in the Library of Congress
and that people walking

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.880
through Times Square are exposed
to as much information in one

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.220
day as our ancestors
from the 15th century

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.240
were exposed to in
their entire life.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.360
So in every one of these, we're
seeing a straight vertical line

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.276
that's unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:36:23.276 --> 00:36:25.541
So we figured, well, how
do you photograph that?

00:36:25.541 --> 00:36:27.540
I mean, it's very
interesting, and these are all

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.530
great statistics.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:35.530
So we did this book called
"The Human Face of Big Data."

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.480
And it's actually
remarkably human.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.460
I'm just going to
open it anywhere.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.650
And let's see if I can
find a story to give you.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.900
And here's an example.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.984
This is our Google
graphic that opened nicely

00:36:46.984 --> 00:36:49.400
in the right place of all the
different arms and tentacles

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.900
of Google and all
the different ways

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.645
that your technologies
affect the world.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.600
But there was a
really cool story.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.060
Remember the earthquake
about five years ago?

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.492
This terrible earthquake.

00:37:01.492 --> 00:37:03.700
And we're all talking about
the terrible destruction.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.150
And I was listening to Kai
Ryssdal on National Public

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.650
Radio on "Marketplace," and
he was the only reporter

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.215
that talked about
that earthquake.

00:37:11.215 --> 00:37:12.920
And he told us a
story-- I think it

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.710
was Steve Henn
was the reporter--

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:18.150
and said that 15 seconds
before the earthquake hit,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.750
before the earthquake
hit, that every bullet

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.315
train, every factory in Japan
came to a halt, actually

00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:23.815
stopped.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.464
And they had put an early
warning system all over Japan.

00:37:27.464 --> 00:37:29.380
I'm trying to find the
picture here somewhere.

00:37:30.535 --> 00:37:31.370
I want to find it.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.820
But they found that they
could actually put sensors

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.360
all over Japan that would
sense this P-wave that

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.030
became before the wave that was
actually the destructive wave.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.310
And I thought, that's so cool.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.990
They use these data centers.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.950
But then I found out there's a
group of guys in Palo Alto that

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.140
realized that all of our
laptops have accelerometers

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.150
in them down.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.250
And they wrote a program
called Quake-Catcher.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.960
So before people
go to bed at night,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.610
they fire up Quake-Catcher,
and they just leave it running.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.370
And it actually is this
low-cost, ubiquitous,

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.580
completely free early
earthquake warning

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.990
system, which is amazing.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.680
So the whole book is full
of stories like that.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.527
There's a group--

00:38:07.527 --> 00:38:08.860
MEI-MEI ZHAO: "A Day in a Life."

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.610
RICK SMOLAN: Yeah.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:13.490
It's sort of how we're starting
to be able to understand cause

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.050
and effect in real time
in a way that we've never

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.070
been able to as
a species before.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.190
An we put Eric's quote as
the opening page of the book.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.000
MEI-MEI ZHAO: There's a quote
in here by Albert Einstein.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.130
"Not everything that
can be counted counts

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.542
and not everything that
counts can be counted."

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:29.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.992
[LAUGHING]

00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:32.700
RICK SMOLAN: It's very
thought-provoking.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.491
MEI-MEI ZHAO: It takes
a moment to process.

00:38:34.972 --> 00:38:35.930
This is really amazing.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.300
RICK SMOLAN: We had some
wonderful essays in it.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.060
But it sounds like, well,
what would you photograph?

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.761
Like the Google data
servers with lights

00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:44.010
blinking on them or something?

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.346
But it actually is
very, very human.

00:38:46.346 --> 00:38:47.720
All the stories
in here-- we want

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.095
to put stories
where you couldn't

00:38:49.095 --> 00:38:51.509
wait to tell your
friends, you've

00:38:51.509 --> 00:38:52.550
got to look at the story.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.570
It's so compelling.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.640
Here, I'll give you one example.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.098
I know we're probably
running late.

00:38:56.098 --> 00:38:59.890
But there's a guy named Shwetak
Patel, who's 28 years old,

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.490
and this is his third startup.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.050
And he said, imagine if you
got your America Express credit

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.150
card tomorrow, and there
was no itemization.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.630
Would you pay your credit
card if it break down

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.150
what you spent your money on?

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.520
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Some months
it might be better that way.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.750
RICK SMOLAN: But
most people wouldn't.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.550
And yet, we get an
electrical bill every month,

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.758
and we have no idea what
we're spending our money on.

00:39:18.758 --> 00:39:21.420
So he invented a little gadget,
which he just sold the Belkin.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.240
You plug it in
anywhere in your house,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.580
and it'll give you literally
a read-out by device

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.330
in your house.

00:39:28.235 --> 00:39:30.610
Every device doesn't have to
be plugged into this gadget.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.193
You just plug it in
once in the house,

00:39:32.193 --> 00:39:35.610
and it recognizes the digital
signature of every appliance.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.559
And so now he can show
you what you spent.

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:39.100
And I said, well,
that's pretty cool,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.365
but you still have
to pay the bill.

00:39:41.365 --> 00:39:42.700
And he said, yeah.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.800
I said, but did
you get an insight

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.037
from this data that makes
you change your behavior?

00:39:48.037 --> 00:39:50.120
And he thought about it
for a minute, and he said,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:50.703
you know what?

00:39:50.703 --> 00:39:52.740
We actually found that
the average American

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.210
spends 11% of their monthly
electric bill on their DVR

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.660
that these devices weren't
designed to spin down.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.590
So if you only record "The
Blacklist" on Monday night,

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.830
and the rest of the week
it's sitting there not

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.020
doing anything, it's
still spinning away.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.340
So maybe we could lower
America's energy consumption

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.630
by just redesigning
the damn DVR.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.380
So there's these
wonderful little insights

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.580
like that that came
out of the book.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.770
Can I give you one last one?

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.520
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, of course.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.190
RICK SMOLAN: There's a company
in Boston called Ginger.io that

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.300
can predict you're going to get
depressed two days before you

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.495
get depressed, before you
show any outward signs

00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:28.344
of depression.

00:40:28.344 --> 00:40:30.760
So I said, well, first of all,
that sounded kind of wacky.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.114
And I also said, why
would you want to do that?

00:40:34.114 --> 00:40:35.530
And he said, well,
actually, we're

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.870
using it for medical purposes.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.010
He said that people
with diabetes

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.432
apparently have very high
correlation with depression.

00:40:42.432 --> 00:40:43.890
And when people
get depressed, they

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.060
stop taking their medicine.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.640
And if you have diabetes,
you don't take your medicine,

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.470
there's very dire consequences.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.980
So he said, we have this app.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.897
It's called Ginger.io.

00:40:51.897 --> 00:40:54.438
And basically, you install it
on your Android phone, your iOS

00:40:54.438 --> 00:40:55.010
phone.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.190
And it basically
creates a baseline

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.980
of what's normal for you.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.330
And then two days before
you're showing any outward sign

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.710
of depression-- there's
20 different data points,

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.300
but it says your tweets and
emails and text are going down.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.240
The amount of time you
spend at home goes up.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.035
I mean, it has all
these different ways

00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:14.035
of looking at a pattern.

00:41:14.035 --> 00:41:16.160
I said, well, wouldn't that
just mean you're getting sick?

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.576
He said, no, we
have other things.

00:41:17.576 --> 00:41:20.245
And he said, people actually
put this on their own phone.

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:21.620
And it says, if
it looks like I'm

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.950
going into one of those
terrible deep depressions,

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.350
call my neighbor or my doctor
or my brother or my sister,

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.066
whatever, just to make sure that
somebody checks in with them.

00:41:30.066 --> 00:41:31.440
So again it's sort
of like-- they

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.920
call it the nurse
in your pocket.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.740
And a lot of the new
medical applications

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.520
that you guys are
looking at Google

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.853
are using these sort of devices
that we're all carrying.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.840
Some people get creeped
out by, and other people

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.880
think this is so cool.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.180
It's a way of looking at
your life from 30,000 feet

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.690
and seeing the
pattern of your life.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.410
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, definitely.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.690
I see that you're
wearing a Jawbone there.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:52.140
I have one as well--

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.570
RICK SMOLAN: Yeah, I love this.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.210
MEI-MEI ZHAO: --that
I'm not sporting.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.597
But yeah, personalized data,
making informed decisions

00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:56.930
with data is really [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.888
RICK SMOLAN: I was
surprised that the new Apple

00:41:58.888 --> 00:42:00.412
Watch didn't mention sleep.

00:42:00.412 --> 00:42:02.120
To me, sleep is the
most interesting part

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.670
of this little device.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.390
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yeah, me too.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.220
Well, wonderful.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.320
So I think with the last
10, 15 minutes or so, we're

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.027
going to open it up
for audience Q&amp;A. We've

00:42:13.027 --> 00:42:14.610
covered a lot of
ground today, and I'm

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.710
sure there's some questions
out in the audience.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.710
RICK SMOLAN: They're
putting a spotlight on you.

00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:21.400
MEI-MEI ZHAO: There's
a spotlight over there.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.734
Well there's two mics,
one on each side.

00:42:23.734 --> 00:42:25.900
Just for recording purposes,
if you have a question,

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.752
maybe you can step up to the
mic and ask Rick a question

00:42:30.752 --> 00:42:31.710
on any of these topics.

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.690
RICK SMOLAN: I numbed
everybody into silence?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.970
AUDIENCE: This is a
really quick question,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:42.289
but did you go back to college
after you got the "Time" job?

00:42:42.289 --> 00:42:43.080
RICK SMOLAN: I did.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.966
In fact, I actually
stayed for two years

00:42:45.966 --> 00:42:48.090
after I graduated, because
it was just too much fun

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.923
living at Dickinson
College in Pennsylvania.

00:42:49.923 --> 00:42:52.310
So I stayed as the
yearbook photographer

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.100
after I was no longer
even a student.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.880
It was really hard
to leave college.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.240
I mean, I always think
of you actually you

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.198
at Google the same way.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.010
I always remember the
stories of Larry and Sergey.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.622
So I'm going from
college to Google.

00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:06.330
And when I visited
Google the first time,

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:07.746
it felt like a big
college campus.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.380
The thing that I love about
organizations like Google

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.970
is this idea of collisions,
this idea that you build

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.360
a facility where people run
into each other by accident.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.040
And you overhear somebody
at the water cooler.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.264
Or you're in a room
where suddenly a problem

00:43:24.264 --> 00:43:26.680
you're trying to solve, you
run into just the right person

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.600
at the right time, because
the facility is designed

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.265
to allow those random meetings.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.450
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Fantastic.

00:43:34.902 --> 00:43:35.813
Yes.

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:36.354
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:36.354 --> 00:43:39.079
So a problem that I'm
guessing you run into a lot--

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:41.120
and you told us a story
about running into this--

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.530
is a lot of times
people don't like

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.780
to get their picture taken.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.840
So I'm wondering
how you approach

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.540
this when you're taking pictures
of strangers, how you handle

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.849
that and get them OK with
you taking their picture?

00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:53.640
RICK SMOLAN: That's a
really good question.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.650
And, oddly enough, I
find that most people--

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.400
[RINGTONE CHIMING]

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:56.920
I'm sorry.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.862
I turned the sound on so you
could hear the videos working.

00:44:02.862 --> 00:44:04.600
I actually find
most people don't

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.180
mind being photographed
as long as you

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.350
are comfortable
photographing them.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.330
If you're taking a picture
sneakily of somebody

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.990
or-- I find the
people that get upset

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.960
are usually the ones that feel
like you're making fun of them.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.562
So the one thing that my
wiser, older friends told me

00:44:19.562 --> 00:44:21.395
when I was getting
started as a photographer

00:44:21.395 --> 00:44:24.290
is if people get upset,
always walk over to them

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.500
and apologize and tell them why
you were taking the picture.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.430
You look just like
my grandmother,

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.950
or I love the light on
you, or I'm a photographer,

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.999
and I'm sorry.

00:44:33.999 --> 00:44:35.290
I didn't need to get you upset.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.760
And 99% of the
time, people are--

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.670
as long as you don't
slunk away like you just

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.210
did something bad, they're fine.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.780
It's so funny how
your being confident

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.197
makes them feel comfortable.

00:44:46.197 --> 00:44:47.780
A lot of times,
especially when you're

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.113
working in countries where
you don't speak the language,

00:44:50.113 --> 00:44:52.750
just making eye contact and
smiling and saying-- you

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.144
get really good
at sign language.

00:44:55.144 --> 00:44:56.560
And sometimes
people do get upset.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.445
I find-- this is my
bad generalization.

00:44:59.445 --> 00:45:01.992
I'm sure somebody who's
watching this afterwards

00:45:01.992 --> 00:45:03.200
will write me a nasty letter.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.012
But I find that a
lot of times when

00:45:05.012 --> 00:45:06.700
people don't like
being photographed,

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.500
it's because they have a
negative opinion of themselves.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.430
They've been made fun of,
or they're feeling somehow

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.440
your taking a picture of them
is ridiculing in some way.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.310
And mostly when I
photograph people,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.490
it's because I find
them or where they are

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.100
or what's happening interesting.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.760
I don't know if that answers
your question or not.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, definitely.

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:24.660
Thank you.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.110
RICK SMOLAN: Cool.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:25.690
Thanks.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.481
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Do you
find these days with--

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.300
RICK SMOLAN: Everyone's
now taking pictures of me.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.175
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Everyone's
now taking pictures.

00:45:31.175 --> 00:45:33.509
But I think the
privacy issue of now

00:45:33.509 --> 00:45:35.675
if you take a picture of
someone, you can upload it,

00:45:35.675 --> 00:45:37.220
and it becomes public entity.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.830
You find it a little bit more
difficult to take pictures now?

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.580
Or is it just because
photos are so common

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.512
now that people are desensitized
to others taking photos?

00:45:44.512 --> 00:45:46.970
RICK SMOLAN: I'm going to answer
your question a little bit

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.290
differently, because
I'm thinking about this.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:50.760
Some of you may
remember the time

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.220
where it was a novel
idea to actually put

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.742
a modem in a computer.

00:45:54.742 --> 00:45:56.200
Like, gee, you mean
computers might

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.700
want to actually
talk to each other?

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.013
And you'd actually have a
separate 300-baud modem,

00:46:00.013 --> 00:46:02.570
and it would make this
[SCREECHING] noise.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:07.485
And the first time someone
said to me "always on"-- like,

00:46:07.485 --> 00:46:09.360
you would have a Wi-Fi
network in your house,

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.497
and you wouldn't dial in.

00:46:10.497 --> 00:46:12.205
You wouldn't turn the
internet on or off.

00:46:12.205 --> 00:46:13.540
It would always be on.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.630
It's like, why would you
want it to always be on?

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.330
What would you
possibly do with it?

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.600
Well, this actually
correlates to Google Glass.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.558
And some of the things
I've been thinking about

00:46:21.558 --> 00:46:23.180
is, what if we start
wearing devices

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.330
that record everything in 360?

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.450
There's a company here in New
York called [? Bemuse ?] that

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.150
has a football helmet with
a little bubble on top.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.890
And literally as the guys
are running down the field,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.740
it's not spinning.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.700
It's actually reporting in 360.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.980
And then you at home
can sit there and decide

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.760
if you want to look to the
right or the left to the player,

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.210
either in real
time or afterwards.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.820
So I'm wondering
what the world's

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.760
like, just the way that
it seemed odd to me

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.540
that you'd want
always-on internet.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.850
What if, as we all
walk around, there's

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:54.050
this 360 degrees
sphere of recording

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.510
where a year from now,
somebody could literally

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.260
fly from one side of
the room to the other

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.020
just by going through this
sphere around that was recorded

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.180
around, where it's free?

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:02.940
It's ubiquitous.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.270
It's everywhere.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.247
And what does that
do to privacy?

00:47:06.247 --> 00:47:08.330
MEI-MEI ZHAO: I just reread
"Nineteen Eighty-Four"

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.240
recently, and that right
now really scares me

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.821
with the whole idea of
Big Brother and privacy.

00:47:13.821 --> 00:47:15.320
But that's a whole
other discussion.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.790
RICK SMOLAN: Do you remember
in "Nineteen Eighty-Four,"

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.070
the TVs would watch you?

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:20.120
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Yes.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:20.690
Exactly that.

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.106
RICK SMOLAN: So
Apple has a patent

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:24.940
that they recorded
nine years ago where

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.940
every pixel on the
screen is not only

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.520
emitting light but recording it.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.610
When you guys make a conference
call and you're doing Skype

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.242
or whatever it is,
the camera's here

00:47:34.242 --> 00:47:35.950
and the person you're
talking to is here.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.950
So you're looking up here,
and you're not really

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:38.870
making eye contact.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.714
Well, I'm just thinking
of this Apple patent.

00:47:41.714 --> 00:47:43.380
I don't know what
they're doing with it.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.639
I have a friend who follows
patents, and he always,

00:47:45.639 --> 00:47:46.180
look at this.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:46.804
The is so cool.

00:47:46.804 --> 00:47:48.714
Apple may do this
and or Google might.

00:47:48.714 --> 00:47:50.130
But this idea that
you're actually

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.660
looking into the
eye of other person,

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.860
making eye contact
through the screen

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.800
may have an
incredible difference

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.560
in terms of this whole idea
of virtual conferencing.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.060
Sorry.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.850
You could tell my brain is
goes at 40 directions at once.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:03.590
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Is everywhere.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.100
All right, I think I
have one more question.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.080
I have time for
one more question.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.227
We have one more question.

00:48:07.227 --> 00:48:08.060
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.210
So I really admire your
work as a photographer.

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.765
And I'm sure you get this
question a lot of times.

00:48:13.765 --> 00:48:15.890
But I was wondering
if you have any advice

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:19.300
to give someone who's looking
to stand out or succeed

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.287
as a photographer today,
especially when I think

00:48:22.287 --> 00:48:23.870
photography has been
more democratized

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.764
with the digital
cameras and everything?

00:48:25.764 --> 00:48:27.180
RICK SMOLAN: Well,
first of all, I

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.174
think people appreciate
photography more now,

00:48:29.174 --> 00:48:30.840
because everyone's
doing it and using it

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.010
and we all incorporate it into
our PowerPoint presentations

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.580
in Keynote.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.549
If you see the movie,
I do the opposite

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:41.840
of what Adam does in the movie.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.460
Adam is in her face saying,
do this, do that, turn here,

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.780
and do that.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.310
I actually kind of
disappear into the woodwork.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.800
When I photograph
people, they get board.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.820
I mean, I want them to.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.490
I want them to forget
I'm even there.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:57.417
It's really hard.

00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:59.000
You know how we all
have a photo face?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.680
When somebody has
a camera, we have

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.710
the same look that we all have.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:06.810
But if somebody actually spent
a week photographing you,

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.170
they would get the real you,
because eventually you'd

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:10.836
just go back to what
you're going to do,

00:49:10.836 --> 00:49:13.740
because you just can't
keep the photo face on.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.210
And so I always felt
like the pictures

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.760
I took of Robyn and Natasha
and my best pictures were

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.680
when people just literally
forgot I was there.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.790
I mean, I don't
know if I'm boring.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.414
But I'm pretty quiet.

00:49:26.414 --> 00:49:28.080
You wouldn't believe
that for this talk.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:34.267
And Olivia, who sort of runs
my life now as my assistant,

00:49:34.267 --> 00:49:35.350
doesn't believe I'm quiet.

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.100
But anyway, when
I'm shooting, I try

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.560
to blend into the wallpaper.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.460
And I figured that I
think that's a secret

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.990
that most people-- they take
the picture and they leave.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.610
It's sort of fly-by photography.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.380
And I had the luxury
as a photographer

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.619
of spending a lot
of time with people.

00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:55.160
Even when I got a
one-day assignment,

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.734
if the person I
was photographing

00:49:56.734 --> 00:49:59.150
would let me stay there, I
would spend three or four days.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.680
The magazine wouldn't
pay me for it,

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.554
but I just felt like I
would do a better job.

00:50:02.554 --> 00:50:04.252
So I would always
over-deliver, and I

00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:05.835
think that's why I
kept getting hired.

00:50:07.039 --> 00:50:08.580
So I don't know if
that helps or not.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.460
AUDIENCE: No, that's good.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:09.960
Thank you.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.035
RICK SMOLAN: OK, sure.

00:50:11.035 --> 00:50:13.440
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Great, and one
last question that I want

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.840
to ask you is,
"Humans of New York"--

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.590
RICK SMOLAN: Yeah.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.000
MEI-MEI ZHAO: -- the series--

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.400
RICK SMOLAN: It's very cool.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.870
MEI-MEI ZHAO: --has
really taken off.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:20.030
What are your thoughts on that?

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.770
And you think that's a
modern day of-- you know,

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.520
"A Day in the Life"
and just really trying

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.740
to capture moments of various
people, various cultures

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.472
across in a very real way.

00:50:28.472 --> 00:50:29.930
So now they have
a picture and they

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:30.860
have a little
description, a quote.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.310
RICK SMOLAN: Of the
day or something.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.476
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Of the people.

00:50:33.476 --> 00:50:35.350
So it'll ask a
question like, what

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.600
was the saddest
time of your life?

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.040
What was your last best
memory or something?

00:50:41.695 --> 00:50:42.696
I don't know what your--

00:50:42.696 --> 00:50:45.028
RICK SMOLAN: The thing I like
about "Humans of New York"

00:50:45.028 --> 00:50:47.320
is the acknowledgment that
every single one of us

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.230
has a story to tell.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.627
And you don't have to be famous.

00:50:49.627 --> 00:50:50.710
You don't have to be rich.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:53.220
I mean, if you ask
the right questions

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.335
and you talk to people,
every single person

00:50:55.335 --> 00:50:57.460
that you meet has got an
interesting story to tell.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.070
And I think, to me,
that's what really

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.403
emerged from that whole project.

00:51:00.403 --> 00:51:03.035
I think I really admire
the guy that did it.

00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:03.885
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Good.

00:51:03.885 --> 00:51:06.586
Well, I think that's all
we have time for today.

00:51:06.586 --> 00:51:07.960
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.210
RICK SMOLAN: Thank you so much.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.418
MEI-MEI ZHAO: I think this
has been a fantastic hour.

00:51:10.418 --> 00:51:13.200
And thank you everyone here
for coming to our talk.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.991
RICK SMOLAN: Please
tell your friends about

00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:17.440
out Kickstarter campaign,
"Inside Tracks."

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.640
MEI-MEI ZHAO: Thank you.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.190
RICK SMOLAN: Thank you.
