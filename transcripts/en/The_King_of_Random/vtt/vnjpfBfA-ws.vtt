00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.520
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today, we've got another fun project for you in the past

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.660
We've had several experiments where we made molds of organic things and then cast them in candy

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.940
We've got one more of those that we want to try today

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.280
I have here a cooked red lobster tail!

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.519
We're gonna see if we can melt down some swedish fish cast it in that mold and make a gummy red candy lobster tail

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.870
The first step is to build a box that we can pour our lobster tail mold in

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.599
There we go, we've got the walls of our box built from some Lego, but to make sure that they're completely

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.489
Watertight or silicone tight, let's just line the sides with tape a little bit

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.860
There we go that looks pretty good, I think

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.680
One more step before we start prepping our silicone

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
We've had a couple of problems in the past with some of the things we're trying to mold floating up

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.199
Inside the silicone, so let's make a couple of small holes in the base of our Lego plate

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.039
And then run some screws through the Lego plate into the lobster tail

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.469
Alright, I think that's done a pretty good job or lobster tail feels like it's fairly well in place now of course the screws sticking

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.299
Out the bottom have made it so it doesn't sit level so let's just add a couple of feet on the bottom

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.559
They won't fit into place on this plate, but let's use a few bricks and spread them out

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
And then we can set our mold on top of those bricks

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.909
There we go, that's sitting nice and level our

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.339
Next step is to mix up a good-sized batch of silicone that can completely cover this lobster tail

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.718
We've got some nice bright yellow catalysts here, and we need to mix it at a ten to one ratio

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.279
So if we have 20 ounces of our silicone then we need two ounces of our catalyst

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.098
There's two and let's just go a little bit more because we have a little over twenty ounces of our silicone

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.429
Looks kind of like a giant fried egg in there

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.269
now just get to stir all of our silicone and catalyst until it is nice and evenly mixed

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.959
and then we'll throw it in the vacuum chamber and pull out all the bubbles

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610
All right, let's start pulling a vacuum

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.190
There it goes

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.140
Here we go

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.639
All right there we go, we've got our silicone poured it's mostly bubble free

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.640
now we just need to let our mold sit for a few hours until it's completely cured

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.390
All right our silicone mold has now had several hours to cure

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.580
And it is nice and rigid it started pushing the tape out on one side, but it didn't spill over anywhere

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.559
So I think we are good, and I think it's time to start pulling this mold apart, and see how it turned out

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.259
Well, that's a good texture

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.170
You can see the little

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.279
Bits and edges of the lobster where it was basically in contact with the plate

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.959
Yeah, see this is the annoying part is the bricks come apart from each other, but then they're stuck to the tape

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.599
on the side wall

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.709
There we go Lego brick walls are free

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.119
I'm off a little bit of extra spilled over silicone here and there

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.779
There we go we've got our block mold now when we just need to free the lobster tail from within

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.649
Now you can see the inside of some lobster tail in there

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.519
Cracking parts of the shell I have already accepted the fact that to get this out we're probably

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.649
Going to have to break the lobster tail into a lot of pieces. That's alright

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.290
We should still have our mold

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.349
That does not smell really great mm-hmm

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.070
Powerful fish smell

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.519
oh there we go all these little pieces that angle down like that those are really digging into the silicone

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.130
There we go, I think at this point

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.110
We've got most of the lobster tail out of the mold we had to cut parts of the mold open where there were long

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.880
Reaching bits of the tail, but I think we've gotten all of it out and at this point

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.380
We just need to wash it to try and get rid of some of that day-old lobster smell

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.449
It's really not a pleasant smell at this point let's try and see how well we can wash this

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.189
There we go, I think we've got our mold pretty well cleaned out at this point

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.318
It doesn't have much in the way of a pour spout

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.509
So let's cut a couple of holes into the bottom of our mold that will let us pour our liquid candy down inside

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.219
There we have it with our mold prepped

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.269
It's time to start melting down our swedish fish into a liquid that we can pour down into our mold

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.449
There we go we've got some swedish fish in a saucepan, let's add some heat and try and melt these things

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.389
Hmm

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.389
These don't really seem to be

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.889
liquefying

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.889
The way I was expecting them to

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.029
staying very stringy

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.989
Like there's no puddle forming on the bottom. It's just

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.568
Looking kind of like melting plastic

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.049
I'll let it go for a little longer and see what happens

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.650
Alright so

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.279
swedish fish

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:26.189
apparently don't liquefy when you heat them up they just turn into a

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.770
gross bubbly burning

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.759
gelatin

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.229
Mess. I don't think I'd be able to get this down inside the mold if I tried

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.809
So we're gonna have to move on to plan B

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.379
We have a jello candy recipe that we've used several times in the past

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.449
We're gonna try a slight variation on that I still want to get the red outside of our shell

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.539
But instead of just casting the whole thing in a red gummy

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.479
we're going to try using some red chocolate to make a nice thin coat on the outside of our shell and then we'll fill the

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.218
Rest of it with our gummy recipe we want it to be white so I found some clear gelatin and after

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:00.029
We've mixed it all up

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:05.369
I'll try adding a little bit of marshmallow cream to make it the opaque white color that we're going for first of course

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.370
Let's melt our chocolate

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.419
All right, we've got our chocolate. It's warm and melted in the bag. Let's try and squirts them down into our mold

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.109
hopefully we can get a nice even coating on the inside and then

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.020
pour out the extra if there is any

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.430
And make sure it gets all the way down into the little tail bits if there's any extra that wants to shake out

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.120
We go that looks like it's pretty well coated on the inside with our chocolate

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.400
But there's still plenty of Hollow in there for our gummy candy to finish it off there we go

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.219
We've got our chocolate coating the inside of our lobster tail mold now

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:54.849
Let's pop this into the freezer to cool down and solidify while we make our gummy recipe

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.810
Let's start with half of a cup of cold water and then add 1/4 cup of corn syrup now

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.959
Let's mix this until all of our corn syrup is nicely dissolved into the water

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.930
We'll know. It's ready when the mixture is completely clear and has no more cloudiness to it with our corn syrup dissolved now

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:17.289
Let's add two packets of gelatin powder into the water remember that at this stage. We haven't added any heat yet

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:21.098
This is still quite cold with our gelatin all mixed into our liquid

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:26.499
Let's add a little bit of heat and stir every minute or two to be sure everything stays evenly mixed there

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.449
We go I think our gelatinous mixture is all ready to go, so let's take it off the heat

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.119
And then add a little bit of our marshmallow cream

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.320
Now I've never done this before so I'm just kind of guessing on how much to add. Hopefully it melts in nicely

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.099
We definitely have a good opaque

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.920
Slightly off-white color. I'm thinking that actually looks pretty darn close to the color of the inside of the lobster

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.770
Let's try pouring this into our mold, and hopefully it won't completely melt the shell that we've already poured chocolate

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.090
Feels pretty nice and solid I think it's cooled off pretty well inside of the mold

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.480
Let's see if we can pour in this gelatin

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.060
All right, I think that's full

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.740
Now let's let that cool, and then we'll try and de molde this sucker there we go

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.319
We've let the candy cool down inside of our mold for several hours now

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.140
So it's time to see if we can pull this thing out in one piece

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.059
Almost seal itself back together. I've seen some good

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:42.820
results, but I think I'm also getting some cracking chocolate as long as it's held together in the long term like if

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.249
It's stuck to the candy well then I'm not too worried

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.340
This is all a bit of an experiment

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:55.029
Well, we've got some cracking and breaking there the chocolate may not have flowed very nicely into the very thin parts of this mold

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.189
We're D shelling or lobster tail

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.680
Chocolate seems to stick fairly well to the silicon more than I was hoping

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.100
Lobster puzzle here, I don't think I'm good enough at solving puzzles to fiddle these pieces back on

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.469
Feeling I know how this is gonna go, but let's see if we can get it out over the other side any better

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.269
Pretty good interior

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.130
Lobster

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.350
Unfortunately our shell

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.080
Does not like to participate?

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.340
at all

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.930
well the inside of our lobster tail is looking pretty great the

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.750
outside of our lobster tail

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.060
Really does not want to turn out very well

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.100
Sticking to the mold more than just about anything I've ever seen stick to the mold

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.879
Well making a red shell over our white inside didn't really work

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.610
the red shell wasn't strong enough to survive being d molded so I do want to try making a pure gummy lobster tail so let's

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.529
Mix up another batch of our gummy recipe pretty quick try pouring that in here and let's see what happens when that sets

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.030
Our mold is filled it has the two different layers with the red and the white gummy now

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:39.329
Hopefully when we let this cool down it will solidify into one beautiful lobster tail that has a red outside and a white inside

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.769
There we go what is hopefully our final gummy test has solidified

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.869
and now it's time to try and take it out and see if we managed to keep those layers of the top red and the

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.870
inner white

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.750
Good things

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.859
Uh-huh, yes

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.200
Ah

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.240
There we go a

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.749
lobster tail made of gummy candy

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.650
we don't have the

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:17.970
Perfect separation between the red layer and the white layer it looks like some of it managed to dissolve its way through in some spots

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.679
And of course there's a little bit of red that's bled onto the bottom, but for the most part

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.580
This is looking like a lobster tail we do have the red outside. We do have the white inside

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.640
That is what we want

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:39.119
Right now. I'm just cutting off the pour spouts because as I may have mentioned before real lobsters. Do not have pour spouts I

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.250
Don't want to set unrealistic expectations for all the other lobster out there

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.910
You're beautiful the way you are you don't need a pour spout

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.619
And just to try and match the look of the real lobster tail a little bit more

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:58.410
I'm taking a little bit of food coloring and a bamboo skewer and just painting on some details

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.290
At this point I would say there's only one step left to try and that is eating it all right, I think

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:14.609
You're supposed to split lobster using the knife to crack it Danny. I don't know

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.150
That's the official way right there

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.340
There's a cross-section some of the red definitely bled through all of the white we have almost a gradient

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.220
But you can see the different layer. This is our red layer

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.269
Separating just a little bit from our not so white layer

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.749
Now to eat our lobs. This is gonna turn my mouth so red because I've painted on it with food coloring

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.660
Alright, let's see how this goes

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:49.589
It's really

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:55.099
Really, sweet and a really weird texture. I think adding the marshmallow cream

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:59.539
Introduces a lot more air into this because usually with this gummy candy recipe

00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:02.959
It's just kind of like a gummy candy. This is more like

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:06.799
Candy styrofoam

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.489
It's edible

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:15.019
But I wouldn't recommend it not my favorite candy. We've ever made, but one of my favorite looking candy things

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:16.920
We've ever made there you have it

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.999
Molding a lobster tail and casting it in gummy candy

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:21.999
We had a few hiccups along the way our

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:23.639
swedish fish did not work our

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:28.878
Chocolate with the gummy core didn't really work since our chocolate broke off and didn't stick to the gummy at all

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:34.849
But eventually we did get a read outside and a white inside all made of gummy candy, which looked really good

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.949
Especially after painting it with a little bit of food coloring

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.529
Thanks for joining us for this video today and remember to come grab your hats shirts another cool merchandise at the king of random calm

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.709
See you there

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.970
Mmm

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.220
Lobster not just for New England

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:57.139
Doesn't even make sense to eat lobster all over. Oh now a lobster tail is edible. Who'd have thought you couldn't eat them before oh
