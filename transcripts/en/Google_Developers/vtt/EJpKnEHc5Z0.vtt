[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.440
ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.370
I'm agent Brogdon and welcome
back to the Mobile Ads Garage.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.182
Today, with the help of my
partner, Gary the Graphics Guy,

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:13.600
[SWOOSH]

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.210
We're going to cover some new
resources for Unity Publishers

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.250
using AdMob mediation.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.750
Now, a while back,
we did an episode

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.660
in this series that talked about
open source mediation adapters

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.460
for Android and iOS.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.890
I think, we had three or four
adapters for each platform

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.739
at that point.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.530
But since then, we've
gotten that number up

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.944
to an even dozen, which
we maintain in partnership

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:34.360
with some of the networks that
have joined our open source

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.370
initiative.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.270
So that's 12 ad
sources for which

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.270
we can offer Android and
iOS publishers a simplified

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.350
mediation integration.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.530
[SWOOSH]

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.550
Good question.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.380
The Android and iOS
adapters can really

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.720
simplify things for
publishers on those platforms.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.910
But Unity is its own thing.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.060
You can't easily call into the
native adapters from C# land

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.029
to get constants out of
them or use an extras class.

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:00.070
And, of course, if you're
building your Unity app

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.840
for both platforms,
you still have

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.349
to go out and get two native
adapters and two matching SDKs.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.230
So to simplify these
complexities for our Unity

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.370
publishers--

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.430
get the trumpets ready--

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.080
we're releasing
network-specific Unity packages

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.230
for AdMob mediation.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.330
[TRUMPET SOUNDS]

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.850
These packages work with
the AdMob Unity plug-in

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.880
to automatically fetch and
include the appropriate iOS

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.190
and Android adapters for
their matching network,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.250
and where possible,
the mediated SDKs too.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.460
In addition, there's Unity
code that wires a C# interface

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.520
to things like bundle
builders and extras classes--

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.160
all those little details
found in some of the adapters.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.590
That way, you can access them
without leaving the comfort

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.280
of your C# code.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370
So let's take a look
at how this works

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.990
and import a few
of these packages

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.356
into a sample Unity Project.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.480
OK, so here we are
in a fresh terminal.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.090
And I'm going to start by
cloning the Google Mobile Ads

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
Unity repo, which
is hosted on GitHub.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.400
That includes the source
for our Hello World sample

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.500
app, which I'm going to
be using in this video,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.720
just to give me a project
to import the mediation

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.170
packages into.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.420
Here we go.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.870
We get into Samples.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.780
Cool.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.970
Now, when you open Hello
World and the Unity editor,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.650
you get this.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.290
It's an empty scene because
all the action takes place

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.015
in a script file, which
is perfect for this demo

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.890
because we're going to
be talking about code.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.210
So first things first.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
I need to get the AdMob plug-in
for Unity from this page.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.130
And this is the Releases
tab from the repo you just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.820
saw me clone--

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.740
Google Ads Mobile Unity.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.350
It has handy prepackaged
builds of the plug-in.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.154
And when you import one of them,
you see something like this.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:38.570
There's a bunch
of stuff in there.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.447
And you should import all of it.

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:42.530
Now, once that's done,
Unity is going to chug away

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.400
for a second or two.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.560
And there we go.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.950
So now, the plug-in is
imported and AdMob is now

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.550
available in my Game Scripts.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.600
So let me open that up.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.720
And there it is.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.870
This script builds an entire
UI in the OnGUI Handler.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.090
And when it runs, the
UI looks like this.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.840
So you can see, I've
got a test ad loaded.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.160
So the plug-in is working.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.970
And if I were just using AdMob,
I can actually stop here.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.010
I've got everything I
need to show AdMob ads.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.210
But I want to use mediation.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.560
So the next stop is the
AdMob Unity Mediation Guide.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.870
It lists a bunch of details
about how mediation works.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.280
But more importantly
for our purposes,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.594
it has the list of open-sourced
and versioned adapters.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.260
And these are the
ones we're rolling out

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.210
Unity packages for
though we don't

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.740
have total coverage already.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.504
Now, I'm just going to pick one.

00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:31.670
Let's go with AppLovin here.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.003
I'm going to open up this guide.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.080
And this is the end-to-end
guide for mediating

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.870
AppLovin with AdMob in Unity.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.872
Now, if you haven't seen
one of these guides,

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:43.330
they walk you
through all the steps

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.490
of configuring AppLovin
and AdMob to work together,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.810
including step 3 here,
Importing the Adapter and SDK

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.620
with the Plug-In.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.080
So now, I'm on [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.790
Let me write to this zip file.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.400
And this is where we're
hosting our Unity packages.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.694
And I can click right
here and grab it.

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:03.360
Now, once I do that,
and I've downloaded

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.374
three of these in advance,
you can watch me import them.

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:08.040
They're going to be
imported right here.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.123
They got a bunch of files.

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:12.220
Again, you want to make sure you
get everything in the package.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.460
So that's AppLovin.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.880
And Unity check away.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.269
Now, I'm going to
grab another one.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.370
Let me back out here.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.440
And let's go with Unity Ads.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.670
You can see, there's a lot
less code and assets included

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.082
with the Unity Ads package.

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:30.540
And that's because with Unity,
there isn't anything that we

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.240
have to wrap a C# skin around,
like we do with AppLovin,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.050
as you'll see you in a second.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.810
So the package there
is much simpler.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.690
It's just pulling in the
SDK and the native adapters.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.610
Vungle, again-- this
has an extras class

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.130
that comes with it to
make adding extras easier.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.300
So that has a lot of stuff.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.604
And again, make sure
you import everything.

00:04:47.604 --> 00:04:48.270
And there we go.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.311
I'm going to build and
run just to make sure I've

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.820
got everything right here.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.880
We'll let Unity chug away
as it pulls it all together.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.930
And there's my app once more.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.460
And it's running just fine.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.580
So now, I've got the AdMob
plug-in plus three mediation

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.570
packages in there.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.919
And I'm ready to go.

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.960
So that's the basics of
where to get the adapters

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.820
and how to get them
into your project.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.520
Now, let me show you how to get
at the custom Unity code that's

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.740
in some of these adapters,
and how it can make tasks

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.540
like adding extras easier.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.430
Back into the IDE.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.770
OK, so say you're reading
through our Vungle Mediation

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.870
Guide for Unity, and
you hit this spot.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.600
Now, Vungle's SDK needs to
be initialized at app launch.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.150
With every Vungle placement,
you're going to load ads for it

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.080
during the execution of the app.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.870
And that's not a
paradigm that maps well

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.160
to AdMob's architecture
for adapters.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.850
But because we have a
Unity package specifically

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.620
for Vungle, it can
offer this extras class.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.490
So if I go back to
my Game Scripts,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.170
I can import the
namespace for Vungle

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.810
mediation right up here,
alongside the rest of my using

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.470
statements.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.110
Dot mediation-- there we go.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.720
And then, I can scroll
down and reference it

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.019
while building my request.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.560
And I'm actually just going to
paste in the code you just saw

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.060
in the Vungle Mediation Guide.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.320
There it is.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.510
This builds an instance
of that extras class

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.330
and adds some example
Vungle placement IDs to it.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.910
This class is coming straight
out of the Vungle package.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.500
And I can use a
compiler directive

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.000
to fill it with
different placements

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.140
based on the platform.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.260
Now, I just need to use
the Add Mediation extras

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.090
method in the Add
Request Builder

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.930
to get the object I just created
included with my add request.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.360
And the Mobilize SDK will
take care of the rest.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.340
There we go.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.080
Let me get this tabbed over.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.750
So that's an example
of an extras class

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.875
that's included with one
of the mediation packages.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.230
But how about just a method?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.150
If you've ever used
AppLovin, for example,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.280
you know that they require
you to run your app

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.070
and initialize the AppLovin
SDK as part of the registration

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.200
process.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.880
In Unity, that could be a real
han-up since you'd have to wire

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.430
up C# code to a client that
would call the appropriate init

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.300
method on iOS or Android.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.550
So we've done that work
for you in the package.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.680
Included in the AppLovin
mediation package

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.990
is a static
initialize method that

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.620
will invoke the right method in
the date of SDKs for AppLovin.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.150
You can just import
the namespace

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.120
and put it to work in your start
method as I'm doing right here.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.351
And if we go back to the
end-to-end guide for AppLovin,

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.100
you'll see detailed
instructions for where

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.330
to put your AppLovin SDK key as
well, so their SDK can find it.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.280
And that's the goal for
us-- for each network

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.040
to have an end-to-end
guide and Unity package,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.310
making the integration
process as smooth as possible.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.200
All right, so that's
it for this episode.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.691
But as always, I've got
some resources for you.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.500
Actually, yes, there's really
only one page you need.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.264
And that's our Unity
Mediation Guide.

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:41.680
It's got a list
of the networks we

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.950
support for Unity and an
individual guide for each one.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.530
I put a link down below
in the description.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.457
There's also a link to
our SDK Support Forum,

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:51.040
where you can post
technical questions

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.600
and get answers from our team.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.970
And of course, if you have
a question about this video,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.320
or an idea for a topic
you'd like us to cover,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.480
leave a comment below.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.063
And Gary and I will
see you next time.
