00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
I discovered that he had put images up

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.880
on a porn site, of me.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.380
So did the cops help you?

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.440
No, they didn’t.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.020
Law enforcement doesn’t take crimes that occur online

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.720
as seriously as they should

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.460
My apartment door was kicked in.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.840
They threatened to murder our children.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.600
They threatened to murder our pets.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.100
They stalked us…

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.440
I’m Ahmed Shihab-Eldin and this is a story about three women

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.400
with all-too-common stories of targeted,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.620
online harassment.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.900
I spoke with a domestic violence survivor,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.680
attacked with revenge porn…

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.280
A former banker who was stalked online…

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.560
And a game developer,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.660
relentlessly harassed

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.880
during what became known as Gamergate.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.060
If you’ve ever heard the term Gamergate,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.660
you’ve probably also heard the name Brianna Wu.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.820
I went to see Brianna present her case

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.480
to a caucus meeting in Cohasset, Massachusetts.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.600
Why is this such a serious issue?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.680
Because the internet

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.360
in 2018 is our public sphere.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.140
This is our coffee shop. This is our town hall

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.140
She spoke out about the male-dominated

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.000
gaming industry and got responses like this:

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.120
I hope you enjoy your last moments alive on this earth.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.100
You did nothing worthwhile with your life…

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.940
even a video of a man with a skull mask

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.280
holding a knife up to the camera

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.860
and saying, "Brianna, this is going to be the last thing

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.500
you ever feel tonight, me stabbing this through you."

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.640
In 2017, 41 percent of Americans reported facing online

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.240
harassment during their lifetime,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.620
an increase from 35 percent in 2014.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.040
Of those, nearly one in five experienced

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.420
serious, targeted

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080
harassment like stalking or physical threats.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.040
Young women are especially likely to experience

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.280
sexualized abuse. One fifth of women between ages

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.440
18 and 29 report online sexual harassment.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.180
It would have been so much easier for me to just sit

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.540
down, to be quiet, to keep my mouth shut, to do nothing

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.920
and just wait for them to go attack some other woman.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.700
I was looking at lot of research, reading about your case

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.720
and here’s a lot of information that is purposely

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.420
intending to mislead people.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.420
People love to click on dirt, whether it's true or not.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.140
And right now Google's algorithm deliberately

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.080
rewards that behavior.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.120
I wanted to understand why technology

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.920
platforms struggle to build safer spaces.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.060
And why law enforcement sometimes

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.620
fail to take Internet harassment seriously.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.360
I'm Liz Lee.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm the founder and executive director of Online SOS.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.540
Online SOS is a non-profit I started it to help targets of online harassment.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.260
And why did you start it?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.120
Well, the issue is pretty personal to me.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.100
I was just a girl out of college, I just graduated, moved

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.500
back to New York City, starting my first

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
job in finance, excited to be in the real world

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.780
and getting these strange emails.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.240
I got an email that had kind of an implicit threat in it,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.220
where like, "if you don't show up on this day,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.220
I will do x, y, and z."

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.280
I didn't know what to do about it.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.760
Do I tell my employer? Do I tell my parents?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640
It's one on one.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.500
It doesn't matter if anybody knows about it.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.740
It's just meant for the target to be afraid.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.760
So, you said you were stalked.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.340
My apartment door was kicked in, yes.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.120
I was getting a ton of phone calls.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.460
At this point, I knew who it was,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.280
and it was an ex partner, and they were stalking me,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.500
and I couldn't do anything to stop the phone calls.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.760
Non-profits like Online SOS are often targeted,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.220
simply for being outspoken.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.700
An organization called Crash Override,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.660
that started in the wake of Gamergate,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.420
disconnected their hotline because of overwhelming

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.560
need for assistance with online abuse

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.860
outpacing their current resources.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.440
I don't want people to suffer alone.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.220
I think suffering alone and in silence

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.060
is the worst

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.020
outcome.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.720
The benefits of an open Internet and the connectivity of

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.480
platforms have a downside

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.380
allowing people to harass others,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.300
anonymously and easily.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.420
My name is Adam Dodge, I'm the Legal Director

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.760
at Laura's House, which is a domestic violence agency

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.460
serving all of Orange County.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.920
The Internet has also become the weapon of choice

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.900
for exerting power and control in

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.180
domestic relationships.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.960
We don't typically see a case come in for a restraining

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.060
order that doesn't have some type of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.420
virtual, or online, harassment component to it.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.400
It’s a public health crisis hiding in plain sight.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.560
Domestic violence hotlines in America

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.660
get 20,000 calls per day.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.680
One in three women has been a victim of violence

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.200
by a partner during their lifetime.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.040
We do over 1,000 restraining order cases every year.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.440
A lot of those cases don't involve physical violence.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.800
They involve harassment, online shaming, virtual abuse.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.140
Next I wanted to hear from a woman

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.860
who was targeted by her ex-husband

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.640
with so-called revenge porn.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.720
I discovered that he had put images up on a porn site,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.640
of me.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:29.100
These were images that he took of me, and… sorry.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.560
One in 25 Americans have experienced

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560
non-consensual, explicit image sharing

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.280
or been threatened with it.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.340
That number rises to one in ten for women

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100
who are under thirty.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.700
What would you say to young people, to teenagers,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.320
who share these kinds of photos?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.420
I would just say, don't do it.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.520
We had children. We went to church.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.220
We did all the things that made us the perfect family.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.540
We looked like the perfect family to everybody.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.080
It was when I got out of the shower, and he took them.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.940
How did you feel when you saw them on the site?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.880
I felt completely violated and betrayed.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.360
So did the cops help you?

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.740
No, they didn't. They

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.540
actually, one of the police officers

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.500
told me he wasn’t sure

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.620
if it was a crime, because I was his wife.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.880
It just… doesn’t go anywhere…

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.080
a sheriff investigator filed it criminally,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.140
with the DA, and then they rejected it.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.960
Most states now have laws banning

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.640
nonconsenual pornography

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.180
but a national law has been stymied, in some cases,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.580
even by free speech advocates

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.860
like the American Civil Liberties Union.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.440
It's really important that we craft the law appropriately

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.660
to make sure that we aren't sweeping in protected speech.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.940
Why is intent so critical?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.620
Without a strong intent requirement, it could be a crime,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.720
for example, to share an image of the famous Napalm girl,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.440
the Vietnam protest photo.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.960
The burden of proof often lands on survivors.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.160
Both law enforcement and platforms

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.000
ask for documentation of images.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.740
It’s a very humiliating thing.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.020
It’s not something you wanted someone to know.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.840
I asked her about trying to use the legal system

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.260
to get images taken down.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.960
It wasn’t easy to do

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.980
but I got the courage to go to court.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.560
I had to show the images.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.440
Facebook also asks survivors

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.440
to submit images that can be flagged.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.540
My name is Karuna Nain, I manage global safety

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.300
policy programs at Facebook.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.080
We do rely very heavily on the community

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.140
to flag content

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.280
that violates our community standards.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.240
We have some tools that run that catch

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.480
content like nudity,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.040
like the photo DNA tool I talked about for catching child

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.200
sexual abuse images,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.640
but we do rely on the community

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.200
to report content as well.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.980
Just in the first quarter of this year,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.100
Facebook reported deleting

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.920
more than 21 million pieces of adult nudity.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.820
When you're building a social network

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.000
and you're excited about connecting people,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.800
it's much harder to think about "Oh people are going to

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.860
find their ... stalkers are going to find them online

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.240
and they're going to harass them there."

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.500
Rahul focuses on algorithms

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.280
and the design of platforms.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.960
It's important to note that the business models have

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.600
dictated how those algorithms behave.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.380
Not any technology limitation.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.600
Algorithms should be talked about like mirrors.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.900
These mirrors reflect our society.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.140
Three quarters of women who have been harassed

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.860
online changed the way they used platforms like Twitter

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.000
and Facebook.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.740
And 32 percent of women stopped expressing their

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.840
opinion online on certain issues.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.440
In order to do this work, I have to be more public.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.560
If that leads to harassment, at this point,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.400
I’m okay with it.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.800
Numerous talented, outspoken women refused to do

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.240
interviews for this story for fear of being harassed.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.620
I know a lot of women that,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.100
when I'll say, "Hey, do you want to talk to this particular

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.020
media outlet about feminism?"

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.280
They'll say, "No. It's just too risky.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.780
I don't want to be targeted."

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.460
We have a system right now
