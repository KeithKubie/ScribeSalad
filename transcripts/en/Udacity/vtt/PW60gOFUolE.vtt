00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.480
So the first personality theory that we're going to discuss is Psychoanalytic

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.310
Theory, which was created by Sigmund Freud. And Freud made, at least, four

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.122
major assumptions in explaining personality. The first assumption he made was

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.857
about the power of the unconscious. And that is, the unconscious mind is much

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:22.747
more important in shaping our personality than the conscious mind. And, in

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:28.012
fact, the metaphor that he used is of the iceberg. And, the tip of the iceberg

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:32.395
is consciousness, just a small little part of who we are. What' really

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.834
important is below the surface and that's the unconscious mind. So the second

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.546
major assumption that Sigmund Freud made was that the human mind has three

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:48.900
provinces. So the first province of mind is what, Sigmund Freud, called the Id.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.563
And that's the seat of our impulses, our desires, pleasure oriented. It's all

00:00:54.563 --> 00:01:00.088
about want. The second province of mind, was what he called the Ego. And the

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:05.819
ego is our sense of self. And it's realistic and finally we have the super ego

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:11.474
and that is a sense of control of our impulses, conscience, knowing right from

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:17.107
wrong. So what makes these three provinces so interesting is that there is a

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:21.198
conflict. Inherent conflict between the Id on one hand and the Super ego on the

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:27.486
other. Between the impulse wanting something and controlling that impulse, in

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:32.122
fact we often can depict this as a fight that we have ourselves between our

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:38.879
angel side and our devil side. The devil tells us to do it, we want it, the

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:43.980
angel says no. So the third assumption that Sigmund Freud made is that

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.685
personality is shaped by early childhood experiences. Now this may not seem so

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:53.455
radical to us, but understand that in the day, people did not make that

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:58.940
assumption. They assumed childhood experiences didn't really matter much. Freud

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.067
argued otherwise. So the last major assumption that Freud made, one of his big

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:09.895
contributions, was the idea of defense mechanisms. And defence mechanism, are

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:14.626
like our immune system but for our mind. They keep threatening ideas, thoughts

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:18.885
and motives out of consciousness. So to the better known, defence mechanism

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:23.640
that Freud talked about were repression, and reaction formation. And in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.642
repression, we're keeping these threatening ideas and thoughts and feelings out

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:32.456
of consciousness. And the main thoughts and feelings and impulses that we

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:39.180
repress are sexual and aggressive impulses. So with reaction formation, we turn

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.754
a threatening impulse into it's exact opposite. So for instance, a parent who

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:49.718
might harbor unconscious feelings of hostility towards a child. But those

00:02:49.718 --> 00:02:52.570
feelings are too threatening so they turn it into it's opposite and become

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.364
smothering with affection. Likewise, another example might be homophobia. When

00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:02.979
someone is threatened by their own latent homosexual impulses and turns that

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:08.890
impulse into hostility towards those who express homosexual behavior.
