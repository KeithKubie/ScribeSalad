 However, it extends the limits of use. 

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.366
 The multidimensional design is the spirit of design 

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.966

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.633
 The application of smart phones does not necessarily mean 

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.966
 It'll be a great app for your tablet, Wear, or TV. 

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.433
 So do not copy your app to other form factors. 

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:04.466
 But must be configured according to each usage situation. 

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.133
 Tablet users will want to try your app, 

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.633
 So take advantage of the extra screen space. 

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.933
 A Wear user will want to provide information in a timely manner. 

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.633

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.566
 And what it really needs to do. 

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.033
 You will be given quality guidelines 

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.400

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.066
 Compatible with your app, you can ensure that your app 

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.466

 Upload results of your app 

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.333

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.066
 From different geographical areas. 

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.066

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.400
 Let them appreciate what your app offers first. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.633
 Ask them to sign in, when that makes sense, 

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.200

 Inform users that repair will not be an immediate update. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.600
 Try to win the loyalty of the followers. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.466
