but to me that doesn't make it any real
 

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.460
but to me that doesn't make it any real
to me that doesn't make it worse for it

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:22.470
to me that doesn't make it worse for it
 

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.049

it's one of the best examples to how to

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419
it's one of the best examples to how to
 

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:21.169
it's one of the best examples to how to
really use mythical archetypes and do

00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179
really use mythical archetypes and do
 

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.609
