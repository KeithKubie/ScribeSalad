00:00:00.602 --> 00:00:03.330
So would you use commonsense reasoning to design an agent that could answer

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.760
Raven's progressive matrices? Here you might make two connections. First you

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.320
could connect primitive actions of agents, to primitive transformations in

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.800
these matrices. Different problems could be composed out of a finite set of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.190
possible transformations. What would those primitive transformations be?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.470
And what would the action frames involved in each transformation look like?

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.390
Second, you might connect those individual primitive actions to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.090
higher level transformations. What would your primitive transformations be?

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.000
And what common higher level transformations are possible?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.930
What primitive actions would result in those higher level transformations? And

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.640
how would composing these like this, actually help you

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.040
solve Raven's progressive matrices? In a way that you couldn't do otherwise?
