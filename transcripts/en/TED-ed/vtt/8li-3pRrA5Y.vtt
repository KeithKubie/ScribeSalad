00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:09.903
Sadness is part of the human experience,

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:12.511
but for centuries there has 
been vast disagreement

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.377
over what exactly it is and what,
if anything, to do about it.

00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.085
In its simplest terms,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.723
sadness is often thought of

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:23.966
as the natural reaction 
to a difficult situation.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.843
You feel sad when a friend moves away
or when a pet dies.

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:29.683
When a friend says, "I'm sad,"

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:32.503
you often respond by asking,
"What happened?"

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:37.064
But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:39.711
is a relatively new idea.

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.478
Ancient Greek doctors didn't
view sadness that way.

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:46.256
They believed it was a dark fluid
inside the body.

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:48.576
According to their humoral system,

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:53.383
the human body and soul were controlled
by four fluids, known as humors,

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:58.155
and their balance directly influenced
a person's health and temperament.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:00.985
Melancholia comes from
melaina kole,

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:05.644
the word for black bile,
the humor believed to cause sadness.

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:08.270
By changing your diet
and through medical practices,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.606
you could bring your humors
into balance.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:13.628
Even though we now know
much more about the systems

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:15.351
that govern the human body,

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.210
these Greek ideas about sadness

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.817
resonate with current views,

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:21.506
not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel,

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.750
but on clinical depression.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.086
Doctors believe that certain 
kinds of long-term,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:32.211
unexplained emotional states are at least
partially related to brain chemistry,

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.948
the balance of various chemicals 
present inside the brain.

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:37.238
Like the Greek system,

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:39.932
changing the balance of these chemicals
can deeply alter

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:44.148
how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances.

00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:46.921
There's also a long tradition
of attempting to discern

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.911
the value of sadness,

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:50.175
and in that discussion,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.752
you'll find a strong argument
that sadness is not only

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.438
an inevitable part of life
but an essential one.

00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:58.237
If you've never felt melancholy,

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:01.795
you've missed out on part of
what it means to be human.

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:06.245
Many thinkers contend that melancholy
is necessary in gaining wisdom.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.798
Robert Burton, born in 1577,

00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:13.176
spent his life studying the causes
and experience of sadness.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:16.171
In his masterpiece
"The Anatomy of Melancholy,"

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.909
Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow."

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.758
The Romantic poets of 
the early 19th century

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:29.016
believed melancholy allows us to more
deeply understand other profound emotions,

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:30.603
like beauty and joy.

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:34.643
To understand the sadness of the trees
losing their leaves in the fall

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:40.150
is to more fully understand the cycle
of life that brings flowers in the spring.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.501
But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem
pretty high on the hierarchy of needs.

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.646
Does sadness have value on
a more basic, tangible,

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:51.252
maybe even evolutionary level?

00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:54.065
Scientists think that crying
and feeling withdrawn

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.437
is what originally helped our
ancestors secure social bonds

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:01.073
and helped them get the support they needed.

00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:05.335
Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,
was an expression of suffering

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:09.188
that could immediately bring people closer
to the suffering person,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:13.545
and this helped both the person
and the larger community to thrive.

00:03:13.545 --> 00:03:16.606
Perhaps sadness helped generate
the unity we needed to survive,

00:03:16.606 --> 00:03:20.320
but many have wondered whether
the suffering felt by others

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.067
is anything like the suffering
we experience ourselves.

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.864
The poet Emily Dickinson wrote,

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:30.396
"I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing Eyes -

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:35.487
I wonder if it weighs like MIne -
Or has an Easier size."

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:36.998
And in the 20th century,

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.609
medical anthropologists,
like Arthur Kleinman,

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.853
gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:47.035
to suggest that emotions aren't
universal at all,

00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:50.460
and that culture, particularly the way
we use language,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.841
can influence how we feel.

00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:54.303
When we talk about heartbreak,

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:58.146
the feeling of brokenness 
becomes part of our experience,

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:00.882
where as in a culture that talks 
about a bruised heart,

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:05.044
there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.221
Some contemporary thinkers 
aren't interested

00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:10.426
in sadness' subjectivity 
versus universality,

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:14.981
and would rather use technology to
eliminate suffering in all its forms.

00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.267
David Pearce has suggested
that genetic engineering

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.680
and other contemporary processes

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.847
cannot only alter the way humans
experience emotional and physical pain,

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.202
but that world ecosystems 
ought to be redesigned

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.817
so that animals don't suffer in the wild.

00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:34.133
He calls his project 
"paradise engineering."

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:37.337
But is there something sad about
a world without sadness?

00:04:37.337 --> 00:04:40.120
Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.919
might not want any part 
of such a paradise.

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.136
In fact, the only things about sadness
that seem universally agreed upon

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:51.409
are that it has been felt by most
people throughout time,

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.334
and that for thousands of years,

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:56.576
one of the best ways we have to deal
with this difficult emotion

00:04:56.576 --> 00:05:01.452
is to articulate it, to try to express
what feels inexpressable.

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:03.344
In the words of Emily Dickinson,

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:08.281
"'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul -

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:12.850
"And sings the tune without the words -
And never stops - at all -"
