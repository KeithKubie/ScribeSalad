00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.420
Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.700
Reviewing Commercials.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.060
"Like You Give A Shit."

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.860
COMMERCIALS!!!!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.900
After these messages X4

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.640
We'll be right back!

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.920
Uh-oh! What's the Green Goblin up to now?

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.639
Oh no, he's forcing Spider-Man to play his own Atari game!

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.000
Actually, that is kind of evil.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240
"Watch yourself fall, silk-slinger!"

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.980
This is an enjoyably goofy commercial, but what really sells it is the guy playing the Goblin.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.930
"Try to get there in time, Spider-Man!" *Laughs*

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.240
I think his dentist put meth in his laughing gas.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.140
"If don't get you web-head, my gang of nasties will!"

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.160
"Holy Hannah!"

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.540
I love this guy, he can't even leave the frame without going nuts!

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
*Goblin proceeds to laugh hysterically*

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.420
Stop presenting! Show some dignity when you're in that costume!

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.360
Holy Heck!

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.920
"And you're running out of fluid!"

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.120
What's he even saying here? He's so excited, I can't make it out.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.660
"You're running out of fluid!"

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.640
What?!

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100
"You're running out of fluid!"

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
Okay, I've watched this over a hundred times, I've studied it, I've analyzed every possibility,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.480
I still don't know what the hell he's saying!

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.060
"You're running out of fluid!"

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.100
*Sighs* Here are my closest guesses.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
You're running out of blue whip

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.560
You're running out of glue lids

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.180
You're running out of Blu Wigs

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.660
You're running out of FLU WEED!!!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.900
WOO HOO!!!!!!!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.100
We laugh at this, but honestly it's not too far off from what some of the movies have.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.100
If Goblin and Spider-Man can relax on a roof in those ridiculous outfits,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.380
Playing an Atari game isn't too far off!

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.189
I could crush you like a bug right now, but let's play video games instead.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.860
*Spiderman Atari game playing*

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.660
Seriously, you told her you hunch?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.420
Yeah, I thought was a good pick up line for some reason.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.300
It's gotta be less awkward than how I cut a Thanksgiving turkey or crawl on the floor to a chair with a Spencer's mask on it.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.060
Yeah, let's hope nothing gets ridiculous as this in our near future.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.620
Outside of a song and dance number, how could it?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.760
What can I say, but web-slinging fun never looked so... Pixelated.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.720
"Is this more action than even Spider-Man can handle?"

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.120
"Spider-Man, a video game from Parker Brothers, the ones to beat."

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.660
*Commercial #2*

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.600
"Here comes Federal Express!"

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.520
Whoa, stand back, the world's most exciting toys are here!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.379
"Ready on the ground!"
"This is the Federal Express air cargo playset."

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.640
Yeah, I remember how jealous I was of the kids that have Federal Express playsets.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.819
Here I was watching the side of my painted house dry, I had no idea there's something even more boring!

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.899
"The door is opened and a real conveyor system inside the plane moves the containers into the cargo bay."

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.940
Hey, slow down, there's only so much excitement we can take!

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.400
"Now Federal Express takes off again with cargo for Phoenix."

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.680
I have enough intensity with my pet rock, thank you very much.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.700
"They're put in containers, loaded on trailers, and taken to the plane."
*Offscreen "wow"*

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.840
wait what

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.900
Did that really deserve a "wow"? I can barely muster an... "Eh".

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.760
"The van delivers packages to the airport."
*Another offscreen "wow"*

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.840
I prepared for a lifetime of disappointment

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.959
"New York, Miami-"

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.139
Yeah, this commercial's pretty much as boring as it sounds.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.280
Come on guys, you had the Micro-Machine man working for you!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.940
Couldn't you utilize him somehow?!

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.920
This is so boring, my skin is actually turning into cardboard!

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.240
"The Federal Express air cargo play set comes with everything you see here, from Playskool."

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.660
FedEx. Putting "return to sender" on your kid's imagination.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.600
*Commercial #3*

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.700
"Think we'll beat that time?"
"Sure we will, after this complete breakfast including my Frosted Flakes!"

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.740
Ah, Tony the Tiger. you represent everything youthful and strong with the voice of an eighty-year-old.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.340
"Let's see if you're any good." 
"Frosted Flakes good? They're grrrrrreat!"

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.820
Though Tony is of course still around, there was a distinct formula that was used in the 80s and 90s ads.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.800
You see, it always starts with Tony befriending some random kid in some random sport, who's always being made fun of by bullies.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940
"You two wanna take a horsey ride?"

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.380
"You two up for a little game?"

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.720
"Hey you two, the kiddy hill's over there!"

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.960
"You two coming in? 
"They'll just wipe out!"

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.360
Time to tie our sweaters around our chests and throw Cadillacs at puppies. *Snort*

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.840
"Hope your serve is good."

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.320
"You guys can have the new kid."
"We don't want him, you're stuck with him."

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.760
What's wrong with these dipshits, you're making fun of a kid that has a killer predator on his side!

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.400
This is not gonna end well!

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.940
"We'll see how good you are."

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.220
What're you gonna do? Sic your giant animated tiger on me- AAAHH!!

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.160
But of course, it's the great taste of Frosted Flakes that brings out their inner tiger and transforms them into a sports star.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.200
"He's bad at doing good."
"Good? They're grrrrrreat!"

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.380
"♪ Show them you're a tiger, show them what you can do ♪"

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.680
I see some false advertising in that.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.980
Some meat, protein bars, vegetables, these are things that can make you a better athlete.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.440
Sugar-frosted newspaper cannot.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.040
Nobody says "You know what'd make people who eat Wheaties even stronger? Candy flavoring!".

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.900
There's even CHOCOLATE-covered versions with MARSHMALLOWS!

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.140
How is any of this supposed to make you a sports star?!

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.780
If they really wanted to be honest with the ads they be like:

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.500
Hey loser, sad that your parents died in a car crash?

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.660
I'll never be as cool as those guys...

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.060
That's what you think!

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.740
Tuffy the Tiger?!

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.900
What you need is a helping of my Tuffy Flakes. It brings out the toughness in you!

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.500
So you think you're any good?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.100
Tuffy Flakes good? They're grrrrrr-andulated sugar!

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.580
-Wait what? 
-Oh yeah, there's no wheat in this.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.580
We just scrape off the top of sugar cubes and dye them brown.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.480
-That sounds incredibly unhealthy. 
-Go get 'em tiger!

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.360
♪ Show 'em that you're a toughie, show them what you can do ♪

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.240
-I'm sluggish and slow.
-You just need more Tuffy Flakes.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.440
Keep 'em guessing, tiger!

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.460
♪ You make some weird grring sounds because you know what's cool ♪

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.080
-Problem?
-I feel dizzy and weak.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.620
That's just the diabetes setting in. What you need is some insulin.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.280
What you need is some insulin.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.080
WHAAAAaAaAAaaAA

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920
Keep 'em on their toes, tiger.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.440

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.280
♪ When you have a taste of Tuffy's Tuffy Flakes, it brings out the toughness in you ♪

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.840
They're grrrrrrrossly mis-advertised!

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.800
Well, it's still fun and Tony's such a great mascot, it's hard not to get sucked into all the sports-tastic propaganda.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.000
"It brings out the tiger in you!

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.120
"(and you!)"

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.160
*Commercial #4*

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.800
Whoa, what are all these kids gathered around for?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.740
"It's Johnny."

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.500
"He's gonna play Simon."
"Nobody beats Simon."

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.300
Hey, hey, stand back! Son of a bitch thinks he can take on Simon!

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.280
Wow girl, I think that jacket just put you through early puberty!

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.420
I will smell Johnny's jacket all through the night... Smells like SpaghettiOs and victory.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.900
"I want you, Simon."

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.020
I want to blow away this easily impressed group of fourth graders.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.040
"Simon is the challenge you've been waiting for."

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.840
"And if you get very good at Simon, great rewards await you."

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.440
Yes, if you take on the challenge of pushing beeping buttons, you get the great reward of them beeping without you pushing them!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.820
"It takes coordination of hand and mind just to play the game."

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.400
"Thank you, Simon."

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.900
(VICTORY IS OURS)

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.400
(VICTORY IS OURS)

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.920
I love how politely he thanks the machine before he soaks up the victory.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.420
 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.780
AHHHHH- I want to thank you for a challenging game, it really did well to enhance my reflexes. AHHHHH!

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.540
Look at these kids, it's just Simon, guys! I mean, what do you think this is, Crossfire?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.320
You may be cool Simon, but you're not "Crossfire being played by Dante Basco dressed as Firebender Zuko" cool.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.520
"CROSSFIRE!"

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.680
Check out the look he gives when the girl puts the jacket on him. He's just like:

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.280
"Girl, you my bitch now. Simon says I own your ass."

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.980
It's ain't Crossfire, but as game commercials go, it's a close second.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.160
"Simon is waiting for you. From Milton Bradley."

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.240
You my bitch now.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.180
*Commercial #5*

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.240
"One kids meal!"

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.390
-"Please?" 
-"Right away!"

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480
So we all know McDonald's has Ronald McDonald, but for a while

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.670
Burger King had the Burger King Kid's Club.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.380
It lasted for a good chunk of time until they realized the 90s wanted to die, and this was the last remaining threat of it.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.860
I mean look at 'em. They're drenched in the 90s!

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.220
It even has all the 90s token characters:

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.820
The token geeky kid, the token Hispanic kid, the token black kid, the token wheelchair kid, and-

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.760
Ooh! TWO token girls? The nineties aren't ready!

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.500
Truth be told, it was kinda neat to have such a wide variety, but they never really had any characteristics like the McDonalds commercials.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.760
Ronald was confidently goofy, Grimace was a doofus, Hamburglar was a troublemaker...

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.150
What are these kids' story?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.760
Umm... They kidnap kids through black magic?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.880
-"And don't forget to clean your room!"
-"It's not that bad!"

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.040
*yeah we totally believe you*

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.520
This will take you away from your ethical obligations!

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.680
"Alright!"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.320
They... take pictures of boys... bathing?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.920
Okay, you and this girl need a talk-in-two.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.880
...Turn away people they don't like...

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.280
"Who belongs in the Burger King Kids Club?"

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.800
"He does..."

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.240
"She does..."

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.560
"I don't think so..."

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.360
You're turning away dinosaurs, what's wrong with you?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.080
Your coolness would have gone up 1,000,000% if you had a T-Rex as a member!

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.800
"Definitely yes."

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.680
"Definitely not."

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.120
For a crew that's trying to be so "open and accepting" you sure say "no" to a lot of people!

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.680
"Definitely not."

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.520
Screw bagpipe players, they can go to Hell!

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.400
No wonder your characters never sold that great...

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.960
"Hey guys, wanna go to the toy store?"

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.640
"Nah..."

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.840
Burger King made toys boring. I don't know if they'll ever get a reaction from us agai- AHH!

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.720
Spoke too soon!

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.200
A valiant attempt, but they don't even mention their names in the commercials,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.400
all we can see them as the black kid, the Hispanic kid, and the Cyclops.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.320
"What do they call you, 'Wheels?'"

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.280
Actually, yes.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.880
Awkward.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.560
"The Burger King Kids Club! It's just for fun, and just for you!

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.200
"This is the stupidest thing I ever heard."

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.900
*Commercial #6*

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.140
🎵Oh oh oh, bright ideas in an Oreo cookie🎵

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.760
Always a classic jingle for a classic product.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.750
But while we all remember how to dunk and eat an Oreo cookie,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.380
what is up with these kids' reaction to them?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:41.320
I swear, you could freeze any of these, and it looks like the Oreos are opening up the Dark Dimension from 'Doctor Strange.'

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.480
Look, they even transformed this kid into a young Bill Cosby!

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.480
...which is probably gonna be very bad in the future

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.360
"You got the wiggles and the jiggles all over the place!"

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.660
That takes on a whole new meaning.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.140
Don't look directly into this boy's eyes, it will send you directly to hell!

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.700
I EAT JESUS!

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.500
*Commercial #7*

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.600
"They said it wasn't humanly possible."

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.900
Well here it is folks the first-ever Game-boy commercial!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.540
And I'm not gonna lie...

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.900
They may have over hyped it.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.500
Now you can have all the power and excitement of

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.990
Nintendo right in the palm of your hand!

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.400
Really? All the power and excitement of Nintendo huh?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.440
Is that why in this 30-second commercial

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.200
there's only one second of game play in it?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.500
I'm not even kidding this is the only

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.800
clip of game footage they show.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.840
But, look! Giant robots on "Doctor Who" sets like it!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.850
And even that's a little awkward I'm sorry but

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.470
seeing a giant machine come out and hold

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.240
a calculator like a texting gourd

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.500
doesn't look especially intimidating.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.600
The loser has to watch the Keanu Reeves version.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.300
"and it's games are interchangeable."

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.580
Plus Game-boy comes with

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.900
the outrageous new game Tetris!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.400
"Outrageous Tetris", huh? There are many words to

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.950
describe Tetris but outrageous isn't

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.080
usually one of them.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.440
so outrageous that

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.630
only one second of it can be shown to

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.920
show the rest of it would blow your mind

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.480
to much!

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.190
ok if you want to do an ad truthfully

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.600
you do it like this.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.820
Now you can have all the power and

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.830
excitement of an Nintendo right in the

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.650
palm of your hands by all we mean

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.780
literally one color, roughly four bits,

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.910
and a variety of maybe five sound effect

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.710
really crappy robots from the sixties love it.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.960
You could get a game gear which

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.310
in hindsight was a million times better

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.960
about because ours was a tiny bit

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.660
smaller it bombed!

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.340
Enjoy what your mom will be playing on her phone in 20 years!

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.300
"Wait does my existence rely on this?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.360
I totally didn't know that!"

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.500
"Gameboy, only from Nintendo."

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.000
A fun ad, even if it is over hyped.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.500
"Now you're playing with power! Portable power!"

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.600
*Commercial #8*

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.930
"Every morning at this time, Dad cooks one of

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.800
those great Eggo Waffles in the toaster."

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.500
NC: Yep, who can forget "leggo my eggo".

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.890
The catchphrase nobody said because nobody

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.000
would ever fight for one.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.940
"No leggo my Eggo"

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.900
But in the commercials, everybody wanted one and we'll go to crazy lengths to get it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.320
Even though there were clearly many left behind,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.180
I feel like these are some extreme lengths to go to get one of them.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.300
What do they come in, like packs of 8, 12, y-you can.. c'mon, guys.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.080
"Time is right for the eggo stuff suit!"

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.720
Probably, the most extreme as a kid that created an invisiblity suit. WITH SCIENCE!

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.960
"Hey, leggo my eggo!"

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.420
You're sinning against time in nature for an eggo waffle.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.020
The world is not ready for such technology!

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.200
...or deliciousness!

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.320
It's cute and all but if these ideas were done today, I think they might've gone a different direction.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.060
My dad always tries to get my eggo waffle on the morning before I do,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.200
But with my black arts magic, the advantage is mine!

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.380
*SORCERY *

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.000
*THE WAFFLE IS ALIVE! RUN! D:*

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.420
And that's how it's done!

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.080
Oh no you don't 11. This eggo waffle is mine!

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:29.240
*MAGIC FIGHT THAT PROBABLY WASN'T INSPIRED BY HARRY POTTER*

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.840
Eggo waffles is part of a complete breakfast. 
Leggo my egg-

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.260
I'll shut up...

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.180
Weird, but harmless enough,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.700
Eggo knows how to focus on stranger things.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.700
"You down there, daddy?"

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.300
*Commercial #?*

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.400
NC: And there are weird ones like this that either show you an advertisement or show you nothing but black.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.600
I never got them tell me what you think.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.380
*a great advertisement*

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.340
Weird right? So random.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:15.900
*Commercial #9*

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.000
Birthday-Bear: Shopping makes me hungry love-a-lot bear!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.830
Love-A-Lot Bear: Birthday Cake! My favorite!

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.230
yes many of you know the characters were

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.110
thing for a while and that included toys

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.029
I'm not even sure I always got them like

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:31.060
one was for dress-up did girls like to

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:39.700
dress up bears was that a thing is a

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.430
proud but strangely enough the most

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.779
frightening thing is when they would

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:46.360
speak i know that doesn't sound like

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.040
anything but just listen to when they

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:57.640
talk someone start to power Christ you

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.170
should take voice lessons from the girl

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:05.529
in the ring 7 days they also make chief

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:07.390
novelties when you can't afford actual

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.060
presence help you cheer from the

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.200
sidelines

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.820
no seriously what to give me my goddamn

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.640
leg is broken as well as ruining

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.700
birthdays

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.520
no wonder he has no friends at this

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.190
party is excited to get a carebear stay

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.570
there i'm gonna beat you up after this

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.020
review continued good beer and what

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.070
don't crowd give us know that was not a

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.200
good frame to freeze on this is it to

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.760
say even the toddler's figure out

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.680
quickly they're being jipped hey as long

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.870
as they don't talk to yourself lucky kid

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.430
I guess I got the job done but did they

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.310
have to be so curiously freaky and share

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.520
your special feelings today

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.600
*Commercial #10*

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.680
when that clock this character was kind

00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.250
of cool

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.140

say a classy place to hang out at night

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.220
at the answer is no you may not dare to

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.120
say that

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.390
tonight it's look cool on the character

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.790
was pretty neat but I'm sorry this will

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.100
never convince anyone mcdonalds is an

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.199
upscale place to be

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:28.900
it just ain't gonna happen mmm these

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.940
mcnuggets are especially chickenless

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.809
today

00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:35.230
oh hello Andre Alexander was busy having

yes yes that is

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:54.130
i guess it doesn't help

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.200
that this moon guy is also a little

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.179
creepy just watch what happens when you

00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:00.309

he tried he tried very very hard to look

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.480
inside himself to find something

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.700
anything that he could offer but in the

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.260
