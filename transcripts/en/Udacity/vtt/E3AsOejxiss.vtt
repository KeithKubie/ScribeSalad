00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.730
The final step in your
custom view creation

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.460
is adding interactivity.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.270
You can listen for user input events

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.360
including key presses, 
trackball movement,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.370
and most importantly, 
screen touch events.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.450
All by overriding the 
corresponding event handlers.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.820
Android supports tracking of 
up to 11 individual contact points

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.760
in what we like to call,
jazzhands mode

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.260
which enables you
to complete

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.080
complex, multi-finger
interaction models.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.940
Now, there's really no interaction
required for a wind gauge,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.180
but you can find out more 
about handling input events

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.040
by checking the motion event docs 
or the developer guide

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.320
describing how to create your own, 
fully interactive custom views,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.680
both from the instruction notes below.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.110
Now, be careful not to let this
new found power go to your head.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.460
By definition, your users
will have never encountered

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670
your brand spanking new control.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.746
So learning how to use it 
is going to add friction

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:50.232
to the use of your app.

00:00:50.232 --> 00:00:53.650
At the very least, it should behave 
consistently with the rest of the system

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.420
and you should avoid creating
your own versions of system controls.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.560
If it looks kind of like a button 
and works kind of like a button,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.894
you should probably
just go ahead and use a button.

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:08.225
But I think this non sequitur 
has gone on long enough.
