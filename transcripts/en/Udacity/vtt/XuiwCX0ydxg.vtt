00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.115
Just like we've been doing with the z test and t test, we want to compare the

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:10.044
F-statistic to the critical value that marks a low probability. Usually 5% of

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:14.650
obtaining a particular F-statistic. We do this using the F table. There's a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.666
different F table for different alpha levels. If you already clicked the F

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:23.016
table link, you'll see that we need two degrees of freedom. Those are the

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:27.960
degrees of freedom for between group variability and within group variability.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.730
Try to use the F table now to find the critical value.
