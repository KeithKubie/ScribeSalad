00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.600
We often operate in romantic life under the
mistaken view – unconsciously imported from

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.911
law courts and school debating traditions
– that the person who is ‘right’ or

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:17.250
has the stronger case should, legitimately,
‘win’ any argument. But this is fundamentally

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.420
to misunderstand what the point of relationships
might be. It is not to defeat an opponent

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.140
(there are no prizes for ‘winning’ other
than self-satisfied loneliness) so much as

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.140
to try to help each other to evolve into the
best versions of ourselves. There’s a kind

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.550
of argument that erupts when one partner has
a largely correct insight into the problems

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.969
of their partner. With a stern, masterful
and almost gleeful tone, they may declare:

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.159
‘you’ve been drinking too much’; ‘you
hogged the conversation at the party’; ‘you’re

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.460
always boasting’; ‘you don’t take enough
responsibility’, ‘you waste too much time

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.260
online’ or ‘you never take enough exercise’.
The insight is not wrong; that is what is

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.220
so tricky. The critic is correct but they
are unable to ‘win’ because there are

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.730
no prizes in love for correctly discerning
the flaws of our partners. Indeed, paradoxically,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.290
by attacking a partner with clinical energy,
we reduce our chances of ever reaching the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.340
real goal: the evolution of the person we
have to live with. When we’re on the receiving

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.310
end of a difficult insight into our failings,
what makes us bristle and deny everything

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.250
isn’t generally the accusation itself (we
know our flaws all too well), it’s the surrounding

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.990
atmosphere. We know the other is right, we
just can’t bear to take their criticism

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.660
on board, given how severely it has been delivered.
We start to deny everything, not because the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.770
accusations are wrong, but because we are
terrified: the light of truth is shining too

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.140
brightly. The fear is that if we admitted
our failings, we would be crushed, shown up

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.980
as worthless, required to attempt an arduous,
miserable process of change without requisite

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.110
sympathy – and that – unless and until
we reform ourselves – we would have no claim

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.250
on the affections or forgiveness of the other.
That’s why we insist that we do actually

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.910
do enough exercise, that we have been working
very hard and that we have never wasted time

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.420
on any embarrassing websites. We feel so burdened
with shame and guilt already, a lover’s

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.190
further upbraiding feels impossible to listen
to. There’s too much pre-existing fragility

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.050
in our psyches for us to admit to another
difficult insight into what’s wrong with

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.520
us. The irony of the defensive argument is
that it’s the overly-confrontational pursuit

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.980
of truth that will make the truth impossible
to reach. In the philosophy of lying there’s

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.240
a central historical example of what is termed
the ‘just lie’ outlined by the ancient

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.569
Greek philosopher Plato. If a crazed person
comes to us and asks ‘where’s the axe?’

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.819
we are entitled to lie and say we don’t
know – because we understand that were we

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.880
to tell them the truth, they would probably
use the tool to do something horrendous to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.300
us. That is, we can reasonably tell a lie
when our life is in danger. In a couple, our

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.770
partner may not literally be searching for
an axe when they ask us an inquisitorial question,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.880
but psychologically, this is precisely how
we might experience them – which makes it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.400
at least a little understandable if we say
we simply don’t know what they are talking

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.940
about. It may feel unfair to ask an accuser
to take responsibility for our vulnerability.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.580
But if they want to help their relationship,
they will need to make it abundantly clear

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.239
that they won’t ever use the truth (if it
is acknowledged) as a weapon. What is so sad

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.590
is how easily we (as the accused) might, if
only the circumstances were more sympathetic,

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.459
confess to everything. We would in fact love
to unburden ourselves and admit to what is

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.400
broken and wounded in us. The answer is to
create a situation where both partners accept

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.710
that they are flawed but not – on this basis
– ever beyond a need for love and kindness,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.000
where the mutual need for evolution is taken
as a given – and where every well-considered

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.030
criticism is handled as both correct and yet
needing to be wrapped up in extraordinary

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.530
layers of reassurance. There should be a recognition
that people don’t change when they are told

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.440
what’s wrong with them; they change when
they feel sufficiently supported to undertake

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.020
the change they (almost always) already know
is due. It isn’t enough to be sometimes

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.460
right in relationships, we need to be generous
enough in our love in order that our partner

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.520
can admit when they are in the wrong.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.960
