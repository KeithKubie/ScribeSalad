Vsauce!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.320
Kevin here.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.499
Competitive eating or speed eating features
contestants clashing to consume the largest

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:09.750
quantity of food in a short period of time.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.100
The competitors are referred to as gurgitators
and a 2007 study found that their stomachs

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.029
can grow four times that of the average person's
and can hold 4 liters.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.330
According to 13th century Norse mythology,
the God Loki engaged in an eating contest

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.550
with his servant.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.419
The servant won after eating the plate.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.050
Pie eating competitions have been held at
local fairs and festivals in the United States

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.050
for generations.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.330
Today, the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog eating
contest is one of the most popular and dates

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.400
back to 1916.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.000
The sport gained major popularity in the 90's
when the Shea brothers took the Nathan's hot

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.370
dog eating contest to new levels by increasing
the attendance and creating the International

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620
Federation of Competitive Eating.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.970
Now called Major League Eating, they hold
around 80 events annually.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.120
Kobayashi became the face of competitive eating
after devouring a record 50 hot dogs during

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.670
his rookie appearance at Nathan's Coney Island
contest.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
The Kobayashi Shake is a body wiggle he uses
to force food down his esophagus and settle

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.190
in his stomach.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.310
And he holds Guiness World Records in hot
dogs, meatballs, Twinkies, burgers, pizza

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.580

7 years in a row - recently breaking his own

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.200
world record by eating 69 hot dogs.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.780
His favorite food is Prime Rib and the only
thing he won't eat competitively is oysters.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.170
Patrick "Deep Dish" Bertoletti is currently

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.850

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.549

a mask painted on his face while he competes.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.950
He was the third person in history to eat
more than 50 hot dogs and buns.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.950
And tried to be the first person to ever get
legally drunk off non alcoholic beer - he

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.670
drank almost 30 in hour got to blood alcohol
level of .02 and vomited.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.390
In 2012, he was crowned the world burping

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.520
Miki Sudo is one of the most famous female
competitive eaters and is ranked number 4

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.160

She recently set a new record eating 8 and
a quarter pounds of food in 6 minutes on What's

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.370
Trending and somehow consumed 50 Cadbury creme
eggs in just over 6 minutes living up to the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.260
tagline on her website "because everybody's
good at something".

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.000
44 year old, 98 pound Sonya Thomas is known

so far in at least one contest except for

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.060
the one who inspired her to start competing
- Kobayashi.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.590
Competitive eaters train by drinking large
amounts of fluids and eating low calorie foods

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.840
like lettuce to expand the capacity of their
stomachs.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.430
Some even chew massive amounts of gum to build
jaw strength.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.770
Bob Shoudt chews 25 pieces at a time to strengthen
his masticators in order to chew faster.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.560
There are hundreds of competitive eating records
around the world - here are a few of most

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.560
interesting...

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.520
11 pounds of cheesecake in 9 minutes, 17 pounds
of cow brains in 15 minutes, 275 pickled jalapeÃ±os

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.360
in 8 minutes, and 141 pieces of nigiri sushi
in 6 minutes.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.540
Doctors say the competitions are dangerous
with stomach perforations potentially occurring

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.159
for those with undiagnosed ulcers and water
intoxication occurring from gulping massive

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.650
quantities of water.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.099
But so far the only documented injury from
a competition has been a fracture jaw.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.800
..... and as always, thanks for watching.
