00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here are the definitions I came up with.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Note that I decided here to define plus and opt in terms of things that we had already defined--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
sequence and alt and star and lit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You could've just defined them to be similar to the other ones if you prefer that representation.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's just a question of whether you want more work to go on here

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in the constructors for the patterns or here in the definition of match set.
