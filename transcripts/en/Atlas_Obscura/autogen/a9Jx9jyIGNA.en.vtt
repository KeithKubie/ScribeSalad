00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.230
 before 2005 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.860
 and we all looked at the waterfall but 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.860
 they never went to the waterfall we were afraid 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.750
 they also said children is not 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.169
 dangerous to go there that they are going to die 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.079
 they're going to love they're going to be short is 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.320
 the mother of all cataracts counts 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.839
 the story that there is a mermaid 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.930
 lovely then nobody all the 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:41.480
 generation came the children the grandchildren 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.690
 the great-grandchildren came families but 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.420
 nobody was going there 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.110
 let's exhaust we're going to disappear 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.870
 that at one time a little man was 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.480
 had disappeared at the beginning of the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.690
 water and that was the fear that none 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.910
 person had gone to visit the copla 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.630
 up to a day 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.220
 a tourist is called stefan ziemendorff 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.580
 how is design 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.570
 well well 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 doing and nobody wanted to go with him 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.010
 says he climbed one of the walls 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.880
 then he saw the gocta waterfall but 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.850
 in rainy season as a water was 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.370
 spectacular was very beautiful 2006 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.270
 He returned as a civilian miner 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.600
 they took it out in February and it was approved 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 as the third cataract 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.159
 from 2005 to back June July August 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.400
 everything was small farms 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.040
 to plant ripoll corn no no no 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.750
 much, much, we already suffered more like 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 I'm seeing what 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.270
 to improve the quality of life in these 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.780
 five years that we are working in the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.680
 tourism activity 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.319
 so not such both forests do not 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.780
 We make many farms 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.690
 protecting 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.459
 almost all were dangerous and from here 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.150
 we looked at it that well because the rain 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.440
 when I was growing up with nothing else but 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.750
 we have never decided to go for a walk 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.750
 every time we go we see it more beautiful 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.280
 them being very spectacular for 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.680
 We are not happy because I was already in 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.960
 our boat hand were already in the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.290
 week I was afraid to go scary 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.770
 but I had the impression that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.320
 there can happen something like that the mind 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.340
 I had it while we did not have it there 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.400
 near the goalkeeper 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.450
 we have never visited him 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.709
 and it was very nice 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.709
 in a libya
