WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.760
And the Djs no longer picked their own records.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.270
Program directors picked the records.
Okay.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.130
And it became very specific target demo.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.290
We want a home in and whatever.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.560
And keep in mind when Howard stern left regular radio,

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.570
terrestrial radio for the stratosphere,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.020
I got his job in New York City.
Oh,
that's right.

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:29.940
I was broadcasting in seven different cities.
I forgot you did that.
Okay.

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.290
Dallas,
New York,
Philly,
I think I was in and Cetera,
cetera.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.080
And it turns out,

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:41.730
I think what they wanted was a version of Howard Stern.
Okay,
great.

12
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.940
I'll be a third class.
Howard stern or a first class David Lee.

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
My approach to it is very different than his would be.

14
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.760
We're two very different people.
Um,
he's talking,
he's a personality.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
It's all about interaction.
I see myself as show people.

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.870
I'm music first.
Okay.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.950
So the first thing I'm going to pick when we throw a barbecue is not the food or

18
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.940
the guest list,
but what's the music?
Right.
Well,

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.690
white people listen to Bob Marley when we're on vacation and when we celebrate

20
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.410
things,
we listened to Kool and the gang.
Right?
Right.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.620
And I would play those and the ratings were going up and they were pissing off

22
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.270
management really well.

23
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.020
They said we feel that Leonard Skinner to Nickelback are more appropriate for

24
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.900
your audience.
So the ratings were going up and they were upset?
Yes.

25
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.120
And because you couldn't rein me in.
Okay.

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.830
Now keep in mind I hired cooling the ganged open for van Halen tour before last.

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.940
You have never seen so many people dancing in one place.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.150
That's the sound of every wedding.

29
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.180
Bar Mitzvah from Bachelor party cause this is ladies night and the fees awarded

30
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:05.040
I and you've got to sing that.
Look at each other as you're driving like whoa.

31
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.790
Dot.
What did they say to you before you took the job?
Like what was the,

32
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.160
what was the conversation when you agreed to do it?

33
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:15.990
What did you think was going to happen as opposed to what did happen?
Well,

34
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.770
what you say and what is real.
Yeah,
that's the problem right now.
I,

35
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.170
we've discussed doing commercials for example,

36
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.490
and I don't feel comfortable doing commercials unless it's something I actually

37
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:30.050
use,
you know,
like sunglasses or cigarettes.
Right.

38
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.680
Beyond that.
I know

39
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.720
Vermont tear bear kind of a thing.
I don't know.
Right.

40
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.140
So it was uncomfortable from the beginning.

41
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.570
I got fired for playing too much ethnic music and uh,

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.040
for late night humor too early in the morning.

43
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.030
But that was Howard Stern's whole deals.
Late nine.
Humor.
No,
it's not.

44
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.260
It's a different kind of humor.
What was your deal as opposed to his,

45
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.010
well,
whenever we brought on porn,
stars actually knew him.

46
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.190
There were no died.
I,
we'd already gone through.

47
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.910
They're getting to know you phase seasons earlier,

48
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.990
kind of you to do all talk or did they want you to play music as well as my

49
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.730
sense of humor is different,
unique as you,
as is his and as is yours.
Okay.

50
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.564
You can't eat.

51
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.050
We have old league of imitations in our end of the business in broadcasting.

52
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.430
Okay.
But,
um,
there's no snare drum and high hat,

53
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.240
nor is there for Howard.
You follow?
Um,

54
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.290
he very,
again,
I start with the music.

55
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890
I start with the ambiance and if humor arises or personalities or rise or we

56
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.400
have guests,
great.
If we don't,
that's fine too.
Um,

57
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.390
uh,
and I think they expected other,

58
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.670
what I showed up with was it also ranged.

59
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.670
Uh,
it wasn't always funny.

60
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.070
<v 1>Hmm.
Okay.</v>

61
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.860
Do you think that it was just maybe something you would have excelled at if they

62
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.190
had different expectations?
Like instead of following Howard Stern,

63
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.570
they just did the David Lee you,
yeah.
Do you think you'd still be doing it?

64
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.840
<v 0>Uh,
yes.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

65
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.560
Their expectations was the funny,
the funny interview.

66
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.560
The guests have pop culture,

67
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.110
funny guests and the subject matter,

68
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.560
just as we've touched on subjects here that are hilarious and subjects that are

69
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.610
pretty dense.
Yeah.
As I call it,
you know,

70
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.210
it's going to detonate halfway down the turnpike.
Oh,

71
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.590
that's what he fucking meant.
It's not stuff that's going to go away real quick.

72
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.280
Do you

73
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.180
<v 1>about doing that now?</v>

74
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.510
Like what if apple came to you or one of these streaming services came to you

75
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:44.650
and wanted to do something like that?

76
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.740
<v 0>They always arrive with expectations</v>

77
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.540
and the expectations,
uh,

78
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.690
just as we discussed the three phases of Anna Nicole Smith and Elvis.
Yeah.

79
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.480
Which Dave are you referring to?

80
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 1>Well,
I just think you just with someone like you,</v>

81
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:06.630
I mean I'm not a program director,
but if I was,
I would say just let him be him.

82
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.750
Just figure it out.
Just let it give it time to grow.

83
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.700
That's why people don't do they metal,
the metal they like you're going to do.

84
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.830
I look from what I know of you,

85
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.990
you're going to do your best at everything.
Everything you do,

86
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.320
you're going to do your best.
If I was going to hire you,
that's what I would say.

87
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.760
Everybody get the fuck away from him.

88
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.840
He's going to do his best now let them hire who he wants to hire and do what he

89
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:33.540
wants to do and put what he wants to put on and let him figure it out.

90
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.250
But you hired David Lee Roth.

91
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:40.251
He didn't hire Mike Fitzgerald and and and can Buchanan whatever the fuck the

92
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:43.830
other people are that work in the office.
It also wants to ges in the soup.
No,

93
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:45.270
you hired David Lee Roth.

94
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.540
Let David Lee Roth Be David Lee Roth and let him find his legs.

95
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.860
<v 0>A difficult entity because it comes with a lot of history.
Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.850
You know,
and then the people will start,
folks will start conducting,
well,

97
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.470
you gotta play this.
Yeah.
I got a play.

98
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.360
And it has very specific expectations.
Usually.
