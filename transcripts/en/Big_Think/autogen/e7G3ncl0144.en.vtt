00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.980
they're out they're done they're happy
and you know that's okay but it's really

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990
and you know that's okay but it's really
 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.539
and you know that's okay but it's really
that's doing nothing to build a movement

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549
that's doing nothing to build a movement
 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.100
that's doing nothing to build a movement
and it's not engaging the students at

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
and it's not engaging the students at
 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.719
and it's not engaging the students at
all so if anything it really turns them

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729
all so if anything it really turns them
 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.190
all so if anything it really turns them
away from wanting to get involved with

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
away from wanting to get involved with
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.899
away from wanting to get involved with
things like this in the future so I

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909
things like this in the future so I
 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.690
things like this in the future so I
think that you know students should be

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700
think that you know students should be
 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.399
think that you know students should be
given an opportunity to choose what

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409
given an opportunity to choose what
 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.870
given an opportunity to choose what
issues they want to work on and and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880
issues they want to work on and and
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.970
issues they want to work on and and
that's why we always have the forums and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980
that's why we always have the forums and
 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.470
that's why we always have the forums and
workshops about student leadership so

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480
workshops about student leadership so
 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.330
workshops about student leadership so
that they can learn that historically

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340
that they can learn that historically
 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.060
that they can learn that historically
students have been a huge part of every

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070
students have been a huge part of every
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.770
students have been a huge part of every
single movement this country in this

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780
single movement this country in this
 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.780
single movement this country in this
world has ever had and that's not really

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
world has ever had and that's not really
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.399
world has ever had and that's not really
told in our textbooks very much you know

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409
told in our textbooks very much you know
 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.140

it's not really taught to us in school

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150
it's not really taught to us in school
 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.430
it's not really taught to us in school
that that's the fact that it really is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440
that that's the fact that it really is
 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.820
that that's the fact that it really is
and I think when students see that in

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830
and I think when students see that in
 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.969
and I think when students see that in
the past students have been so powerful

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
the past students have been so powerful
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.500
the past students have been so powerful
in movements and creating social change

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510
in movements and creating social change
 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.480
in movements and creating social change
