00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.440
Hey guy's  BackyardScientist here and today we are gonna be making a fidget spinner.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.640
No, wait! Come back, come back! It's gonna be a BIG fidget spinner.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.900
Oh, man. Uh. It's gonna be made out of aluminum! Uh, and rockets!

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.960
Alright, nice!

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.780
Man, you guys had me worried for a second, so thank you! I''ll also throw in a cat.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.720
And a plasma cutter!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.720
[loud pressuirzed air sound]

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.040
The first thing I did was cut out the shape of the spinner in a piece of plywood.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.860
I'm using it as a template to cut the aluminum, using a plasma cutter.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.540
I used a 2-inch hole saw to make the holes in the fidget spinner,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.720
and that perfectly matches the outside dimensions of the bearing.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.780
I made supports to hold the bearing in place. I used a 3-inch and a 1 and 3/4-inch

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.100
hole saw. That should keep the bearing centered, and keep it from falling out.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.860
I'm using commercially available E-sized rocket engines and pipe strapping to hold it to the fidget spinner.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.200
Okay, we got the fidget spinner all wired up.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.320
I have sandbags to hold the base down because even though I tried to make sure it's super balanced,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.220
it still might go a little crazy and,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.280
who knows what will happen.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.040
So, this should hold it down.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.280
Everything looks good to go.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.460
Are you ready?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.740
I'm ready.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.340
I don't think that's the best spot.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.140
Maybe hide behind your car. I don't know why you -

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.880
- I don't know why she parked her car so close.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.420
2! 1!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.860
[loud rocket propulsion sounds]

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.080
Oh, I forgot to trigger it!

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.360
Alright guys, that was totally nuts!

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.360
Like, there was so much stuff happening at the same time,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.280
I couldn't even really tell what was happening.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.440
So, I had to go back and re-watch the footage and-

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.080
-well, let's have a quick recap.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.540
First of all you'll notice that there is only two rockets left on the fidget spinner.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.080
The first rocket broke free and made a beeline right towards my car.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800
It hit the wheel and then started ping ponging around, on the inside of the wheel well.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.620
And, that's pretty ironic

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.860
because I was giving Sandra a hard time about parking so close to the rocket setup.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.360
The next rocket worked fine.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.400
It was actually the only rocket that was powering it,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.220
because-

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.240
the third rocket exploded instantly as soon as I lit it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.060
and unfortunately it was pointed at Sandra, and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.760
it shot like a piece of gunpowder right through the plastic table, and it ended up under her ankle and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.640
she was sitting cross legged,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.400
so.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.460
She's totally fine, she just doesn't want to play with the rockets any more,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.300
and I totally understand that.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.980
I mean, so far it's fidget spinner- 2 backyard scientist- 0,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.403
because its burned Sandra, its burned me ... this thing is a death trap.

00:02:24.403 --> 00:02:26.700
Let's put some more rockets in it and try again.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.520
Alright guys, here I go, before I go I want you to comment how long you think it will spin for, alright?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.720
Alright here we go... 3, 2, 1.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:56.300

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:12.000
♪♫

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.060
I was filming at 1500 FPS and I counted 17 frames per revolution.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.900
That means it was going around 88 times per second or 5,294 times per minute.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.100
AAAAAH!!

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.920
And...

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.840
call it.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.860
Alright, I'll see what that time is and I'll see who got that right.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.620
I'm just so happy that this payed off in the end.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.480
You know, I think I know what one of the problems was.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.060
This thing was spinning around so fast,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.320
the gun powder in it was being like forced out the back or something.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.960
You can tell that-

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.020
on the high speed camera you just see these random showers of sparks shooting out of the thing.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.100
And I think that was

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.280
you know, a structural failure inside of the rocket engine.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.280
That's probably what all these holes are,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.580
On the side of the rocket engine like this.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960
When it was spinning around, the gunpowder-

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.700
the burning gunpowder was being pressed up against the wall, and...

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.960
eventually flung out. I think that that's probably nothing that I can do any better. That'll just...

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.140
that's the results that we got.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.680
I'd like to give a shout out to Stephen Sharer.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.820
He's the one that gave me the idea for the video.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.560
He originally tried it on his channel and...

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.540
he had his own set of difficulties you know...

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.640
just like I did but... you know.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.320
He's got a pretty cool channel, a lot of fidget spinner, a lot of nerf stuff.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.640
I met him at Playlist Live, he's a super cool guy, so.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.660
I'll see you guys next video.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.160
Bye.
