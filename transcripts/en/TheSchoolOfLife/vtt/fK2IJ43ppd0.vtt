00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.540
The strange thing about love is that even though we experienced it in a deeply personal

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.060
and apparently instinctive way,  it has a history.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.040
In other words people around the world haven't always fallen in love the way they do now.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.160
The point of rehearsing a few of the telling moments in love's history is to remind ourselves

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.320
that there are different ways of arranging relationships depending on what a given society happens to believe in.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.900
Love is a cultural invention, and we are not at the end of its evolution.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.640
We may in fact be still only at the early stages of the history of love;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.680
we're still learning what we need and how we might get more successful at love

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.250
the Euphrates Mary's ship to the
princess of the neighboring Kingdom of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.020
young had far from being the outcome of
love this marriage like that of many

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
between powerful people in the ancient
world is purely transactional mari

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
occupies a critical position in the
trade routes between Syria and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.280
Mesopotamia and marrying ship to will
allow them real in to expand his wealth

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.119
and power

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.930
Henry Lin's attitude to marriage
continues with his children he marries

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.650
off eight of his daughters two rulers of
neighboring cities forcing each of his

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.460
new son in laws to sign a document
pledging themselves to him

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.119
the people of mari are in effect saying
that what gives a marriage meaning isn't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
how much the couple happened to love one
another but whether it's beneficial in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.159
terms of trade connections and wore this
is so alien to us

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.540
it's worth reflecting on just how much
we nowadays refuse to entertain at least

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.439
in public

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.149
any practical considerations when Mary
feelings are meant to be our only load

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.350
starts and yet for thousands of years
until only a minute ago on the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.840
historical clock it was unambiguously
meant to be only about land power and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.500
money

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.520
the notion that you should love your
spouse would have seemed plain laughable

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.250
this may have created a collective
trauma we're still in flight from.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.470
France, 1147AD. Jaufré Rudel, the Prince of Blaye

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.680
set sail for Tripoli in modern-day
northern Lebanon

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.190
he has off to see the Countess of
Tripoli with whom he has fallen deeply

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.150
in love

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.460
rudel is one of the earliest known
troubadours or skilled court poets who

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.290
rise to prominence in southern France in
the 12th century and write poetry on one

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.850
subject exclusively love rudel has
written many poems in honor of the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.950
countess and want to write some more in
her presence but Rudy's idea of love is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.360
very particular and at that time
dramatically new it's love that's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
utterly divorce from practical
considerations that doesn't involve

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.300
children money dynasties or even any
kind of reciprocation the troubadour

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.440
poets never tried to have sex with the
objects of their love their focuses

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.970
exclusively on what we would call the
infatuation or more colloquially the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.800
crush side of love

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.459
rudel has fallen in love with the
countess without ever having set eyes on

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.970
her

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.480
pining away for his lady from hundreds
of miles away

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.530
he composes and sets to music many songs
expressing grief and joy

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.600
unfortunately he falls ill on route to
his lady and has to be stretched into

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.320
Tripoli whether counters hears about him
and visit him in his chamber

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.350
rudel recovers momentarily before dying

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.440
finally at peace very chase Lee in her
arms

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.030
the troubadours took love very seriously
only they didn't see it is linked to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.900
marriage

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.410
romantic love is something you fell for
someone you were never going to do

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.090
household chores with and that may be
the secret of its intensity this kind of

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.000
love was spared too much contact with
daily life

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.810
rudel could imagine how lovely the
Countess of Tripoli was without ever

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.440
having to dispute with her about the
right place to hang a tapestry will get

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.920
frustrated if she didn't particularly
want to do a special embarrassing thing

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.930
for him in bed that love could remain
pristine the troubadours show us a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.489
historical moment when the idea of love
was not tied to the notion of moving in

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.080
together or to the intertwining of two
practical economic and social lives

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.980
using the same toilet Sharon utility
bills and trying to go on camping

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.989
holidays with your partner's friends

weeks general 28 price on a 23 year old

enters the cabinet de conseils, approaches
can do with the fifteenth and curtsies

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.840
three times. This simple gesture makes it
official. Jeanne-Antoinette is the King's maitresse

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.310
déclaré, or chief mistress and from now on
she will be known as madame de pompadour

and resided court with the King the king
has by this point been married for 20

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.449
years but marriage doesn't mean fidelity. You marry for reasons of State and you

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.340
have mistresses on the side

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.330

happens with the 15th has several

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.860
mistresses including 14 year-old Mary
Louise Oh Murphy who is painted in a

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.000
famous semi pornographic painting by
force where she at Versailles in the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.080
18th century there was an acceptance of
the imperfect fit between marriage and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.770
love it was understood that they would
always be attention between the two

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.539
marriage was for children

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.789
practicality and continuity love was for
excitement drama and sex

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.650
one should never try to blend the two
rather than be under hand or deceitful

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.389
like many people are today

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.699
the King of France simply split love for
marriage and without shame or guilt made

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.050
his romantic attachments and organized
and public part of his life with his

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.240
wife

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.910
gretna green Scotland first of January
1812 a couple has just got married in a

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.139
secret ceremony

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.590
John Lampton the first Earl of Durham
who is portion has land and

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.160
responsibilities and Harriet the
illegitimate daughter of the Earl of

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.780
john daly who has no money and little
social status but is very pretty are now

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.860
man and wife

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.949
their families are furious and have
tried desperately to stop the wedding

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.539
but the couple are modern which means
that they believe that in marriage

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.199
love should come first and practical
considerations second

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.490
they've gone to Gretna Green a village
just inside Scotland to escape english

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.690
law and they are examples of a new
philosophy of Romanticism which

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.650
privileges feeling over reason and
impulse over tradition

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.630
romanticism transforms love the old
system of marrying for political or

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.889
economic advantage

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.430
Stoli crumbles around the world the
village of Gretna Green become

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.479
synonymous with illicit marriages and
John and Harriet are among hundreds of

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.990
English couples in the late eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries to reload their

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.639
the public appetite for stories of
romantic descent is such that the local

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.120
priest publishers some best-selling
memoirs of his time they're full of

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.530
daring coach right across the border and
the wrath of one consulted fathers who

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.050
reached the runaway children just too
late

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.159
gretna green becomes an important place
because there's a growing belief that

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.120
marriage should be the consequence of
love and that if two people love each

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.780
other

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.909
that alone is what matters in come the
standing of the wider family career and

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.199
how the parents and/or might get on
seems irrelevant and more than that they

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.789
begin to be cast not as wise serious
matters which really ought to be taken

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:25.840
into account

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.800
but as things that could only seem
relevant to County father's snobbish

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.270
arms and dried up conventional people
with no care for the happiness of a

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.069
couple mostly when we want to do
something we take advice if we can from

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:40.539
people who've done it before

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.840
gretna green stands for a remarkable
shift in thinking around relationships

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.099
which is still powerful today the
assumption that people who have already

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:53.979
had marriages are likely to be very poor
advisors and guides to the young love is

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:57.129
understood to be an enthusiasm not as

London England 1813

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.479
Readers of Jane Austen's latest
novel are on the edge of their seats as

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:11.349
Fitzwilliam Darcy stumbles his way
through a proposal to Elizabeth Bennet

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:14.530
his offer of marriage promises to fix
all her problems

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.389
not only is he handsome but he's rich
and Elizabeth family with for unmarried

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:22.479
daughters to support badly needs all the
cash they can get

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.020
but Elizabeth says no Darcy for all his
gifts is also arrogant and a snob pride

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.399
and prejudice may suggest women marry
for money but Elizabeth actions reveal a

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:38.260
new and some first of belief rapidly
gaining currency in English society that

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.310
they should love the man they betrothed
themselves - it's an idea

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:47.320
Austin support strongly 11 years earlier
she had herself rejected a proposal of

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.279
marriage claiming anything is to be
preferred or injured rather than

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.810
marrying without affection in her
greatest novel however things turn out

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.830
for the best

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.550
eventually after many twists and turns
and despite her lack of standing and

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.180
money

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.160
Elizabeth and Darcy Mary what continues
to strike readers today is that Jane

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.250
Austen is deeply concerned about romance
and about money to marry only for money

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.350
is she argues a disaster but equally she
holds that to marry only for love is a

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.540
terrible folly to in Austin's eyes a
good marriage requires warmth and

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.300
tenderness of heart and strong practical
worldly managerial competence and from

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.829
this austin draws the conclusion that
few people are actually that well suited

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:33.820
for marriage

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.480
she's unsurprised that many marriages
are a little hollow or a little grim

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.190
Austen's novels to pick numerous
unsatisfactory relationships and only a

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.579
few very happy ones in the early years
of the 19th century

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.130
Jane Austen is defining the wise ideal
of modern love she sees marriage as a

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.270
hybrid enterprise in some respects it's
like running a small business or

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.250
organizing a village fete

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.640
if you don't keep track of the practical
details and don't have quite an

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.779
efficient turn for administration things
are going to go badly wrong but at the

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:05.560
same time

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.329
marriage is a profoundly complex
emotional encounter and to thrive in it

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:12.390
one needs emotional maturity

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.870
affection playfulness and warmth through
her novels

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.530
Jane Austen is trying to present the
reader with an education in a truly

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.430
classical way she believes we can do a
few things well if we leave our

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.250
performance to nature luck and chance

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.960
happy relationship depends on the
maturity of both parties in Pride and

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.890
Prejudice with Elizabeth Bennet and
Darcy have to be improved

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.220
he has to lose his pride and she has to
shed her prejudice

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.540
if they're to be capable of living well
together love is something we need to

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.820
learn

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.310
london 24th of november 1859
it's the day Charles Darwin publishes

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.440
the origin of species

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.070
there is a huge initial resistance but
eventually much of the world is

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.720
convinced by his arguments

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.530
human beings are descended from the
primates and that means that we've

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.790
inherited not just the skeletal
structure but also a lot of their drives

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.320
and basic psychology

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.040
Darwin's detractors are aghast at the
implied humiliation

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.940
but that's consolation and Darwin -
because he suggests that our inability

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.750
to live up to our ideals is not wholly
our own fault

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.540
we are anytime half apes and apes to aim
for faithful life long passionate

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.070
egalitarians relationships is to attempt
to pull off something hugely difficult

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.830
starting from a very unpromising base

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.510
no wonder we often fail without
particularly intending to Darwin rushes

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.100
in a strategic and useful pessimism
about relationships rather than being

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.170
for instance essentially monogamous

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.000
he implies that human beings might by
nature at least be predisposed to as

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.830

hold up signs and charge the phrase sex

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.030
hastily assembled group of reporters

this event is one of many organized by
groups advocating free love in the

nineteen sixties in America they argue
that society's rules against nudity

questioned in an enlightened world they

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.660
argue sexually liberated men and women

along with it jealousy adultery and

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.569
idea of what love could be and it

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:11.029
belgium 2015 the country achieved a
notorious distinction

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:14.449
it is the nation with the highest rate
of divorce in the developed world and

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:17.449
astonishing 71 percent of couples will
split up here

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:22.639
a newspaper in the country asks why and
the answer comes back clearly initial

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:27.379
expectations were not met other
countries are not far behind in the UK

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:31.399
the divorce rate is forty-two percent in
the US fifty three percent in Hungary

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:35.300
sixty-seven percent and in Portugal
sixty-eight percent part of the reason

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.870
lies in the disappointment people feel
with what had apparently been promised

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.160
to them by the freewheeling nineteen
sixties and before that by 19th century

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.290
romanticism the dream of love survives
but it disappoints constantly at dinner

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.699
tables around the world

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:53.540
otherwise intelligent people complain
that they simply can't understand

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.449
strange and tricky subject of love the
future hope for love lies in the notion

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:03.949
of sacrifice that is in accepting that
we won't get everything we want from

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:06.350
love relationships or marriage

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.949
we're trying to do something highly
ambitious in our modern ideals of

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:15.529
relationships unite sex affection the
raising of a family a career and

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.630
adequate material security

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:23.480
we will by necessity fail to get all of
these the idea of sacrifice though helps

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.709
us if we consider getting half of what
we really want and need might still be

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:31.250
quite a lot in comparison with what it
would be like if we avoided

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.990
relationships all together

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.699
clearly solitary life can work out
really well for a few people but mostly

00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.380
we hate living alone

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.769
the question should not be so much
whether relationships live up to our

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:47.240
ideal hopes of mutual happiness but
whether they are better if only a little

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.089
than not having relationships at all

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:55.250
the future of love needs us to get
interested in ambivalence that is in the

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.059
capacity to keep on thinking that
something is quite good

00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:03.589
even while we're painfully conscious of its many and striking day-to-day

00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:04.790
imperfections.
