00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.660
You know Hollywood has a talent for taking symbols of our cherished childhood and smashing them to Indescribable amounts of fecal matter.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.720
And nowhere is that more prominent than in the the horrors of the Super Mario Brothers movie.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.880
The game about two Italian plumbers who rescue a princess from a Dragon was such a huge hit that they put it on everything. Candy, magazines, comic books, The Works.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.240
so it only figure to put together a Super Mario Brothers movie as quickly as possible.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.240
And when we saw the trailer for this movie we realized that it wasn't just Super Mario Brothers, it was Super Mario Brothers on steroids!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.900
I'm serious dude this movie was packing the flamethrowers, rocket boots, giant monsters, and a bad ass looking City. So, naturally, we got hyped.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.180
It was opening day there was lines around the block and we are about to see the bad ass action film of the year. we sat down in our seats and the film began.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.620
Alright the traditional Mario music this is gonna be just like the game.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.780
A long long time ago the Earth was ruled by dinosaurs, they were big so not a lot of people went around hassling them.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.380
You know it just don't get no better than this.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.480
Then a giant meteorite struck the Earth, goodbye dinosaurs.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:26.580
But what if the dinosaurs weren't all destroyed. What if the impact of that meteorite created a parallel dimension where the dinosaurs continue to thrive and evolve into intelligent, vicious, aggressive, beings.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.960
And hey, what if they found a way back.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460
Oh my god, this movie's gonna blow.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.900
So let's see what's wrong with this horse's ass of a movie, well for starters the graphics in the game are actually better then the graphics in the opening. That's strike one.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.780
Koopa is a human being instead of a dragon. That's strike two.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440
And two Italian plumbers are played by a British man and a Latino.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.660
And that's strike three, you know what what the hell, five minutes into this movie and already is has three strikes against it. This is going to suck ass.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.380
Alright so the film centers around a love story between Luigi and the only good-looking archaeologist in the entire world Daisy.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.640
There chemistry is about as awkward as Tom Cruise and well I guess anyone he's dated.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.700
I want to apologize right now, in case well when I start to get talking and I start to say things that sound really weird.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.740
Don't worry Luigi, it's not you, it's just bad writing.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.980
Upon taking her out to dinner we find out the Mario brothers aren't even brothers at all they're father and son.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.060
Mario here brought me up

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.800
But wait a minute doesn't Mario specifically at one point say Mario Brothers Plumbing and isn't the title of the stinking movie?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.980
So wait what are you trying to say they're- they're father and son and brothers

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.080
He's been my mother my whole life.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.000
You're messed up movie you're f**king messed up.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:05.640
So after that incestuous moment we find that Daisy is abducted and taken to a parallel world where humans evolved from lizards instead of evolving from monkeys. Suck on that creationism!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.980
And in the horrifying City of- name not announced there's an evil Tyrannosaurus Rex known as King Koopa played by Dennis Hopper.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.900
only he doesn't breathe fire and throw hammers like in the video game, no this Koopa is more like a mix between Donald Trump and Dr. Evil.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.840
See you later alligator.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.760
Disney's Reluctant Dragon would have been scarier than this.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.000
How nice.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.060
his plan is to merge our two Dimensions together and de-evolve mankind. He does this by using a rock from a meteorite that hit Earth thousands of years ago that Daisy apparently keeps around her neck

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.900
or some shit like that, I don't know, I'm usually asleep at this point.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.400
Stupid.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.500
His evil henchmen in this movie are creatures known as Goombas and I have to admit I honestly think they went out of their way to make sure these creatures look nothing like the original game.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.920
It's like they're trying to piss us off.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.780
Yeah I bet.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.720
Name!?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.340
Mario

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.400
Last Name!?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.120
Whoa! Whoa! We're gonna hear Mario's last name? Dude we've never heard Mario's last name before, this ought a be interesting, uh, cool alright so, uh, what's Mario's last name?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.140
Mario

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.020
Yeah, now what's your last name?

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.940
Mario

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.160
No, no, no, no what's your last name?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.240
Mario

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.660
No, no, okay what's your first name?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.440
Mario

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.700
Alright, now what's your last name?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.420
Mario

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.240
F*ck you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.740
What's your first name?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.680
Luigi

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.780
And what's your last name?

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.580
Mario

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.900
Shut up! What's your last name?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.840
Luigi Mario

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.780
Those are both first names, what's your last name?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.460
Mario

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.820
Shut it, what's your full name?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.700
Luigi Mario

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.500
Those are both fir- Okay, what's your first name?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.500
Luigi

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.620
And what's your last name?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.340
Mario

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.400
Shut the f*ck- What's your full name?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.200
Luigi Mario

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.380
what is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.920
Mario Mario and Luigi Mario.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.080
Are you f**king kidding me?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.300
They couldn't think of last names, so they just gave them their first names again? That's like something a kid writes down when he doesn't know the answer on a test.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.900
Mario's last name is Dur Mario.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.300
And Luigi's last name is Mario too because they're brothers you see,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.640
Wait no, no, no, father and son.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.100
Now one of the things you might be asking yourself is why in this version as opposed to the game is it Luigi that ultimately gets the hot princess booty.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.000
I mean who does that leave Mario with?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.420
WAH!

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.440
Whoa boy!

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.540
Sorry Mario, but our princess is in another White Castle.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.560
Unfortunately, the Duchess of Dairy Queen also has the rock and steals it from our heroes, which, unfortunately means a lot of these shots.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.640
The only way to get it back is for Mario to use his balding, Italian charm to seduce her.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.560
What some people will do for a role.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.320
Sadly though most of the performances in this movie are downright terrible.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.260
I mean I love Bob Hoskins, but half the time it sounds like he's coughing up a hairball.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.440
Hey what is this!?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.940
Get out of here!

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.940
and everytime I hear that New York accent, I keep expecting Roger Rabbit to pop up.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.020
But by far, the biggest award for killing a performance goes to the poopa scoopa Koopa himself, Dennis Hopper.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.900
It's literally like he woke up every morning and just said to himself, I'm not going to act today I don't know what I'm going to do, but it's not going to be acting.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.460
In fact we haven't seen Dennis Hopper in a while, have we? But what do you expect when you're movies that have you saying lines like,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.820
Ba-Bomb!

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.680
Let's hear that again.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.320
Ba-Bomb!

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.940
and this is why you don't see Dennis Hopper anymore.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.160
In fact, if you watch it slow motion you can hear actually pinpoint the moment where his career implodes in on himself. Watch!

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.020
Ba-Bomb!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.220
There is no other line in this movie that can destroy an actor's career so quickly.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.100
Monkey!

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.300
Okay maybe one other line. In fact, let's see those two back to back.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.920
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.420
Monkey!

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.920
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.440
Monkey!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.980
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.480
Monkey!

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.000
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.500
Monkey!

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.000
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.500
Monkey!

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.020
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.520
Monkey!

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.020
Ba-Bomb.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.520
Monkey!

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.060
The only thing that's kinda cool about this movie is the way they teleport from one world to another.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.380
It's not a great effect, but it's pretty inventive when you consider it comes from a city covered in shroom.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.580
Oh, shut up and say Ba-Bomb.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.380
Ba-Bomb!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:05.380
So, on top of the bad acting and the lame story line, there are several lines of dialogue that are just entirely pointless. For example there's a strange running joke where Koopa tries to order a pizza.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.800
I'd like the Koopa special.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.040
Pterodactyl tail on that?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.480
Yes. Dino, lizard, hold the mammal, no worms, and, uh, spicy.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.840
Ok, not funny.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.620
Prepare for destiny! Where's my pizza?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.120
Okay, still not funny.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.140
Sir, your pizza's here! Not now. Looks like I win.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.080
and altogether, not funny.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.520
So, the final conclusion we have to draw from this is, not funny plus not funny equals not f**king funny!

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:42.980
I mean do these people have to go back to film 101? If you want a joke to work, you need humor. Don't you know that!?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.520
Jesus, I can't imagine this film getting any worse.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.300
I know this is going to sound a little strange, but I want you to meet my father.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.280
Well, it's an honor to meet you sir and a pleasure and I just- I just wanna, thank you for all your help.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.880
Okay, I'm going to wrap this up before I puke. The Mario Brothers get the rock back, stop the evil Koopa, turn him into a Muppet,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.180
and return back home, Daisy can't go because she has to figure out where she belongs, and they have themselves a happy ending.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.600
Or do they!?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.580
Luigi, Mario?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.920
Woah! woah! whats wrong!?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.600
You're never gonna believe this.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.280
I believe it. You do? I believe.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.200
And I'm not kidding this is where it ends, on a f**king cliffhanger.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.060
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's wrong? How does Mario know what's wrong? Why does Daisy have a flamethrower?

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:41.260
Well thank heavenly Jesus we'll never find out the answer to those Questions. Super Mario Brothers ba-bombed at the box office and thus, never had a crappy Hollywood sequel.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.860
Word of advice guys, concentrate on botching up the first shtty ass movie before you start thinking about ideas about how to f*ck up the next one.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.740
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie is the fact that somebody actually wrote it.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.500
Not one, but three people actually played a part in putting this together

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.620
and would you believe that this movie actually had two directors?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.180
because one director can't possibly make a film this bad alone, it takes two with a concerted effort.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.420
But to their credit could you imagine anyone else that could possibly direct a superior film?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.660
Monkey!

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.840
It's got me there.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.880
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it, so you don't have too.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.920
Ba-Bomb.
