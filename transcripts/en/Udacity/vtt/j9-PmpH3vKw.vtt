00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.390
Moving down the list of LinkedIn
sections, let's get started

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.910
with how to create an interesting and
memorable summary section.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.080
The summary section is typically
one to four sentences.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.330
And it functions somewhat like a short
elevator pitch where you get to

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.050
convey the most important information of
what you're all about professionally.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.378
Remember the results
of your Rs activity.

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:22.896
Write for your intended recruiters and
employers.

00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:26.410
Use clear, action-oriented language.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.540
Integrate key words
generated in your three Rs.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.280
Highlight your strengths, skills,
past accomplishments, and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.140
current projects that are especially
relevant to the field or

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.160
position that you'd like
to transition into.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.260
Finally, treat your profile
like a cover letter and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.200
frame your professional interest as
passions that you want to pursue.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.860
If you love doing something, don't wash
it down and say you like or enjoy it.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.670
A quick example is that I love
learning from my teammates at work.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.051
Rather than stating I enjoy
collaborative environments,

00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:01.590
my summary statement says passionate
about collaboration and peer coaching.
