[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:07.290
SPEAKER: Scott Berkun
is a bestselling author

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.960
and popular speaker on
creativity, culture,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.520
and technology.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.605
He's written seven books.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:13.980
A couple of them
are bestsellers,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.220
like "The Year Without Pants,"
"The Myths of Innovation,"

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.260
and "Confessions of
a Public Speaker."

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.280
He's been featured in some
popular magazines and stuff,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.070
like "The Wall Street Journal,"
"The Economist," and "Forbes."

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.670
And he's the emcee and
speaker for Seattle Ignite.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.580
And so without further ado,
let's give a warm round

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.147
of applause for Scott.

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:35.499
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.582
SCOTT BERKUN: Thanks, man.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.900
In 1884, two young
entrepreneurs,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.165
engineers by trade, decided to
pitch and propose a project--

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.370
a technological project--

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.100
that would change the world.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.340
Now, in 1884, given
how far back in history

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.070
that is, the hot
technology of the day,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.390
we're not cloud computing or
mobile web application design.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.080
If you were a young person who
was ambitious, that had skills,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.770
were interested in
engineering and using

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.050
technology to make
the human condition

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.150
better, the field
you would be working

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.360
in would be construction.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.970
Now, for us, we think of
construction as really boring.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.510
It's people with
hardhats and backhoes.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.030
But in 1884, this is the
rise of the industrial age.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.090
This is the rise of railroads
and telegraphy and telephones.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.500
It was also the rise
of industrialization

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.850
for construction.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.150
At the time, in 1884, most
buildings in the world

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.010
were not more than
a few stories high--

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.620
five or six stories high--
because the technology

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.050
at the time, the tools at
the time, the materials,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.130
were stone.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.680
And stone is not
reliable at scale.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.960
Generally speaking, it's
not affordable scale

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.570
beyond a certain height.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.330
So these two young men in Paris,
France, Koechlin and Nouguier,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.030
they came up with a proposal for
how to use iron, wrought iron--

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.330
which was a relatively
new tool and technology

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.790
for the age-- to construct
what would be the largest

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.204
building in the world.

00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:15.745
Now, as all of us would do if
we were in a similar situation,

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:19.170
we had similar ambition, we had
an idea, we had a skill set,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.910
we would put together
a plan or proposal.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.800
We'd want to pitch
people on that idea.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.060
So that's what they did.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.190
And this is what their
pitch looked like.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.010
They drew, on paper, the
design for this building.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.820
And for those of you who have
ever been to Paris or France,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.405
this looks kind
of familiar, now.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.196
One thing they did in
this pitch-- and this

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:38.700
is my first bit of
advice for you--

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060
is the grander the idea
is that you are pitching,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.490
the scarier it is for
people you are pitching to.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.500
You're asking them to
think in a bigger scale

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.099
or take a larger amount of risk.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.640
So the first bit of advice I
can give you from my first story

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.100
here is that whenever you're
pitching something grand,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.470
you need to find a way to
tell a story about it that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530
ties it back to things
people already know.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.560
So in this little diagram
here, on the margins,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.855
they were smart
enough to put to scale

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.840
six or seven of the
other tallest buildings

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840
in the world that are
already being constructed.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.020
So in the bottom, or
in the right corner,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.300
that's Notre-Dame.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.330
On top of it's the Statue of
Liberty, and on and on it goes.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.630
It so happens that one of
the good fortunes these two

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.400
young men had is
they were employed,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.227
they worked for a
man named Eiffel.

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:24.810
Eiffel, one of the
other contributions

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.310
he had made before
the Eiffel Tower

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.945
was working on the
Statue of Liberty.

00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:29.970
So I think they were
trying to say in here, hey,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.052
you could build something
seven times grander

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:33.760
than this other thing
that you worked on.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.600
And it was much some highlight
in the quality of their pitch.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.530
The bad news is that
this pitch failed.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.400
Eiffel was like, eh, it's
tall, but it doesn't really

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.660
do anything.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
It's kind of like
stunt technology.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.340
It's the tallest or the
fastest, but so what?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.750
It doesn't solve a problem.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.640
And also, from
Eiffel's point of view,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.040
it's not even really that
interesting to look at.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.540
So they rejected the pitch.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.340
But Eiffel, to his
credit, didn't tell them

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.665
to stop working on the idea.

00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:02.790
He was like, you guys are
passion-- and by the way,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.706
I'm paraphrasing here.

00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:06.290
This is not literally
what Eiffel said.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.130
He's like, hey, guys,
I'm not into it.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.381
But you guys are passionate
about it, so keep working.

00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:10.921
And they did.

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.340
They took his feedback to heart.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.880
They realized they needed
another element to the design

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.380
to make it reach
Eiffel's standards.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.350
So they got a third architect
involved, a third engineer,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.640
named Sauvestre.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.850
If you think of the final
design of the Eiffel Tower,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.920
the bottom has those
beautiful arches.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.390
Sauvestre contributed
that design idea.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.240
So all the latticework,
and the fine

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.690
patterns, and what looks
like an application

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.310
of the golden ratio,
had the shapes

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.920
of all these little
windows and this nice feel

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.200
to them that draws
your eye in and makes

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.760
you want to keep looking at it.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.990
That was Sauvestre's
contribution.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.900
They put together a
new pitch and proposal

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.010
and they brought
that back to Eiffel.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.650
And of course, we all know,
this story has a happy ending.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.360
Yay, the Eiffel Tower exists.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.320
And it's probably the most
popular building in the world

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.670
that people pay to go see.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.740
Certainly one of the most
popular buildings in history.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.006
And I tell you the story--

00:05:01.006 --> 00:05:01.755
I know where I am.

00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:03.012
I know I'm at Google.

00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:04.470
I know I'm talking
about technology

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.910
that's more than 100 years old.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.200
But I'm here because
of a mission--

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.710
one of my missions--
which is that we discount

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.470
the value of history and what
we can apply from lessons

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.428
from history, things that
happened in the past,

00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:18.300
to situations and problems
we're trying to solve today.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.010
And this book that
I just wrote called

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.930
"The Dance of the
Possible," one of the things

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.346
about it is a lot
of the stories I

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.770
tell about how to solve
modern problems with working

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.460
with ideas come from the past.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.380
Now, history is often
maligned in the tech sector.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.470
But part of what we know about
how all of our brains work

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.240
is that whenever you
are making a decision

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.573
or you're doing anything
actively today, in the present,

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:41.590
in your life, guess what
is driving your thinking?

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.430
History.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.170
Your history from last week,
your history from the meeting

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.640
you had yesterday,
your history from what

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.780
you learned in school.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.400
All of our decision
making is based

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.690
on history, or our ability
to pull lessons out from what

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.200
we've already experienced.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.980
So with that in mind, my first
lesson for you from the book

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.220
is that all ideas are
made from other ideas.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.640
That all ideas, every idea,
every concept, every product,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.800
every methodology,
every philosophy,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.906
is comprised of other ideas
that came from somewhere else.

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:11.030
So I'm going to ask you to
indulge me for a moment.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.454
I want you all to say this
sentence with me when I say so.

00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:16.870
OK, are you going
to do it for me?

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.680
SCOTT BERKUN: I think so.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.920
Good.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.430
OK.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.471
So on the count of three.

00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:20.658
One, two, three.

00:06:20.658 --> 00:06:23.590
AUDIENCE: All ideas are
made of other ideas.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.740
SCOTT BERKUN: Very good.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.700
Sound like a little
cult. This is good.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.511
We're forming a little
idea cult. Fantastic.

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.510
Now, in the abstract, of
course, intellectually,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.860
we all know, yeah, of course.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.360
All ideas are made
from other ideas.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.730
Every mathematical formula
comes from other formulas.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.440
Every bit of
scientific progress is

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.132
based on things that
were sorted out before.

00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:42.590
That's not really
what I mean here.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.740
What I mean here,
and the application

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.110
of this that makes
it useful, is that we

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.980
come across ideas, or
products, or notions

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.230
that we have so
much respect for,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.624
that we forget this about them.

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.540
And the Eiffel Tower's
an interesting example.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.930
How many of you have ever
seen before, that sketch?

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.420
The original sketch
of the tower?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.080
No one.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.520
This is one of the most
significant buildings

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.686
in the history of the world,
most popular buildings.

00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:07.450
But somehow, we
just forget that it

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.080
had a back story and a history.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.480
That someone had to pitch
it and it got rejected.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.454
And they had the fortitude
and the grit to keep going.

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:16.870
They had to incorporate and
collaborate with other people,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.880
that all of the stuff
contributed to this thing

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.729
that we take for granted today.

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.270
So the lesson here,
or the advice is,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.479
whenever you are stuck,
you're working on a problem--

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.103
and it could be a
mathematical problem,

00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:27.670
it could be an
engineering problem--

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.920
and you are stuck,
it probably means

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.450
you're forgetting this lesson.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.395
Because when you're stuck, you
don't see any other way to go.

00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:36.020
But if you stop and
say, wait a second.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.103
I'm stuck on this problem.

00:07:37.103 --> 00:07:38.830
All ideas are made
from other ideas.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.730
What is this thing I am
working on comprised of?

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.680
What are the component parts?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.340
Let me step back and go, OK,
has this algorithm, this thing,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.645
this bit of UI, OK.

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:48.770
I'm going to take it apart.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.140
Now I have these six pieces.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.020
Well, what happens if I order
them in a different way.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.880
Or I take two of them and
I add some new thing to it.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.180
Now, all of a sudden,
you're not stuck anymore.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.680
Now, by combining
things, you're not

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.220
guaranteed to have a good idea.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.212
But you will be back in
the state of progress

00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:05.170
where you are still
exploring and experimenting

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.040
to learn more about the problem
that you were trying to solve.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.710
Now, before I
continue this lesson,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.840
my name is Scott Berkun.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.970
Nothing I am sharing with you
up here today is confidential.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.450
I am not a Google employee.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.950
So you are free to take
pictures, post on Twitter--

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.090
that's my Twitter handle--

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.926
all of my books and
anything else about me,

00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:22.300
including my email
address should

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.383
you have a question that
we didn't have time for--

00:08:24.383 --> 00:08:26.764
Q&amp;A today-- just go
to scottberkun.com

00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:28.180
and everything is
there, including

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.670
free chapters from the book.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.860
That said, let's get
back to all ideas being

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.990
made of other ideas.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.101
So what you see here--

00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:37.600
so Eiffel's only known, really,
in most of the Western world

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.030
for one product, for one thing.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.632
The tower, the Eiffel Tower.

00:08:41.632 --> 00:08:43.840
This is one of the first
buildings that Eiffel worked

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.630
on, one of his first projects.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.250
And by comparison, it
is not so exciting.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.960
It's just a square box girder
bridge, and it's workman like,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.552
it functions, I
mean, it's reliable.

00:08:57.552 --> 00:08:59.260
It was built to have
trains go across it,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.420
which again, this was a
new technology of the day.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.234
A lot of people were
very scared of trains

00:09:03.234 --> 00:09:05.650
so building this really stable
and robust looking building

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.660
was probably a good
design criteria.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.910
But there's nothing that
exciting about this building.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.680
This building doesn't
make it into history books

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.640
unless you're
someone like me that

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.476
wants to go back and find out
well, what did they do before.

00:09:15.476 --> 00:09:17.350
But he did incorporate
a whole bunch of ideas

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.640
from engineering history.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.627
These grid systems for bridges.

00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:22.960
You can see wood bridges that
are made of the same truss

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.130
structure, the square
structure repeated over a span.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.070
Later on in his career, this
was maybe five years or so

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.590
before the Eiffel
Tower project, now you

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.692
can see that his ability
to work with iron--

00:09:34.692 --> 00:09:36.650
with wrought iron, which
was the primary medium

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.690
he liked to use--

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.340
has gotten a lot more detailed.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.180
Some of what Eiffel became--

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.030
at least in his
profession was famous for,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.370
was developing techniques
for using wrought iron

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.320
more efficiently and
more effectively.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.986
So you look at this
design and it starts

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:50.290
to have some magic to it.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.661
There's some appeal here.

00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.910
And a particular note to
this theme of all ideas being

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.150
made of other ideas.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.990
The central element of
this bridge is an arch.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.050
An arch is one of the
oldest technologies

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.170
for engineering construction
we have in the world.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.980
Hundreds and hundreds
of years old.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.570
So he took an old idea here, but
by combining it with something

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.254
new he was working with, that
combination-- wrought iron,

00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:15.670
which had different properties
for strength and tension, ,

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.430
didn't need as much material
to be just as strong--

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.440
now it becomes transparent.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.330
You can see through
the arch, which

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.560
gives it this dynamic effect.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.360
It's not just a
building anymore.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.151
It's a building that,
when you look at it--

00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:29.550
and to some
experience you have--

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.615
in your brain, it's just
interesting to look at.

00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:32.740
It almost seems like magic.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.720
And you can imagine in
the 1850s and 1860s,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.690
1870s, around the
time this was built,

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.530
how magical it must have been
to see this use of an old idea

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.420
combine with something new.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.980
We also know that
he had influences,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.067
that Eiffel had thought earlier
on about building a huge tower.

00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:50.650
This is the Latting
Observatory, which

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.029
was a World's Fair creation in
the 1950s in New York state.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:55.570
And this building,
when it was built,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.070
was the tallest building.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.127
But Eiffel saw this and had
the same complaint that he had

00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:01.960
to his two young engineers
when he saw this.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.120
He said, it's tall
and it's impressive,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.650
but it's basically
built to serve

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.080
an abstract,
egotistical function.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.680
It's just the tallest building.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.346
And you could argue,
in a way, that when

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:13.810
he saw this building in the
1850s, many years before he'd

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.780
get pitched on the tower
idea, a problem space

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.550
was created in his mind.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.956
And building a tall
tower was not enough.

00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:23.080
But there could be some
other kind of tall building

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.910
that would satisfy
what he thought

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.630
was the good use of a
technological innovation.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:34.390
A more local notion
or example for ideas

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.210
being made of other ideas
is this famous drawing

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.160
by da Vinci.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.792
Anyone know the name
of this drawing?

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:41.875
AUDIENCE: "Vitruvian Man?"

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.583
SCOTT BERKUN: "Vitruvian
Man," very good.

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:45.970
So "Vitruvian Man," that's
the name of this drawing.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.886
And when we hear that,
"Vitruvian Man," we go,

00:11:47.886 --> 00:11:51.550
oh, "Vitruvian Man" must be
like the dude in the drawing.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.232
Maybe it was da Vinci's
neighbor, or the model,

00:11:54.232 --> 00:11:55.940
it's the name of the
model that he hired.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.680
No.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.650
Vitruvian is a reference
to Vitruvius and Vitruvius

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.650
was a Roman architect who lived
a thousand years plus before da

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.080
Vinci was even born.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.980
And Vitruvius wrote a book.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.529
That book is called "The
Ten Books on Architecture."

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.320
Now, many of you are
engineers or designers

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.550
or project managers.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.340
We like to think that art
industry, design patterns,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.590
that we concede to this
notion of putting together

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.170
the blueprints for
how these patterns

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.480
that repeat in our
work and sharing them.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.030
But Vitruvius wrote
this book called

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.738
"The Ten Books on
Architecture," and it's

00:12:25.738 --> 00:12:28.694
the first design patterns
book in "The Western Canon."

00:12:28.694 --> 00:12:30.610
It's not about software
engineering of course,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.770
but it is about
actual engineering,

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.360
actual architecture engineering.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.310
And da Vinci read a
passage in this book that

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.015
was about scale proportion.

00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:40.390
And this goes back
to the Greeks.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.265
So this Roman guy, as
many of the Romans did,

00:12:42.265 --> 00:12:44.920
took ideas from the
Greeks, repurposed them.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.207
Like all the Greek
god names, the Romans

00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:49.540
took the same gods, basically,
just put a label on them.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.020
A lot of repurposing went
on in all those traditions.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.860
But specific to
this story, there's

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.830
a passage in here that's
purely about the human form.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.620
And it's a passage that talks
about the size of your head

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.870
should be about one eighth
of the size of your body,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.020
and the ratio between your
arm length to how long

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.080
your legs are.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.810
And da Vinci read this passage
and was inspired enough to say,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.760
I want to make a drawing that
expresses this written idea.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.800
So that's where "Vitruvian
Man" comes from.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.420
But "Vitruvian
Man" is so popular

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.450
because da Vinci is so
popular in our culture.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.320
This thing now is
a pattern, an idea,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.640
that's been reused and reused
again and again and again.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.160
Often without any knowledge
of where the idea came from

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.680
or what the meaning of it was.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.090
And so now this idea, it's
been reused and recombined

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.800
and recombined and recombined.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.690
And you see this
pattern everywhere.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.986
Now, often ideas get reused
in a way that's very ignorant.

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:39.610
It's just this visual
thing that people

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.735
go, oh, that's interesting.

00:13:40.735 --> 00:13:43.720
I know it's iconic I'm not going
to know why it became iconic,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.796
I'm just going to reuse it.

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.170
But then you see
things like this

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.230
where the show "Westworld"
has a version of "Vitruvian

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.770
Man" in the logo.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.950
And now that you know some
of the history of what

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.860
this drawing is from and what
it means, their use of this

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.300
is actually very smart.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.190
They're talking about
reinventing man,

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.900
reinventing the
idea of proportion,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.250
reinventing the
idea of perfection.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.000
So in these simple notions,
when you start peeling back

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.700
the layers of what an idea
is and you want to tear them

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.040
apart, the landscape of
possibilities for what

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.990
you can do now gets much wider.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.220
Now, to make this more practical
and more about products

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.910
and creative thinking for
products, the advice for you

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.330
that I have is this.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.030
That if you study the
history of a problem--

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.210
the history of the problem.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.480
Not the technology,
but the problem,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.980
you'll find new ideas
for trying to solve it.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.830
The history of the
idea of the problem.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.810
An example that is close to
home, to drive this point home.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.900
Google, the first
major invention,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.460
back when the
company started, was

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.460
PageRank, which I'm sure all
of you are very familiar with

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.050
and can lecture me about.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.640
But what I know
about PageRank is

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.410
that PageRank, the idea that you
can find the value of one page

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.336
by examining how well
referenced it is by other pages

00:14:58.336 --> 00:14:59.710
and extending that
mathematically

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.000
entirely through the network,
is an idea that was not invented

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.680
by the founders of Google.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.140
That was an idea that
was, in some sense,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.980
originated from research
papers themselves.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.140
Research papers, academic
papers, footnote at the bottom,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.491
all the people they are
referencing in their paper.

00:15:15.491 --> 00:15:17.490
And you can build an
index, and people did this.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.770
There are databases
and academic sources

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.151
in colleges that
do the same thing.

00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:24.025
They see how many people
reference this paper

00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:26.960
and they build an index to find
the most referenced papers.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.490
So the very foundation of
the company that you work for

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.080
was the recasting
of an idea that

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.040
existed already and applied
to a different medium.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.960
Instead of research
papers, applied to the web.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.790
By understanding the
history of a problem,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.289
you will see different ways of
looking at the problem, which

00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:43.980
will invite new ideas and
points of view you would never

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.280
find if you didn't go back
and study that history.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.820
Speaking of your competitors,
Amazon is a similar story.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.810
This is an ad from the early
1900s for Sears, Roebuck.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.550
And Sears, Roebuck,
for those of you

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.960
who don't know, in the
industrial age, 1890s, 1900,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.480
they were the Amazon of America.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.550
They had a book,
this printed book,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.402
that contained every
product available

00:16:07.402 --> 00:16:09.360
that you could possibly
get through mail order.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.094
And mail order itself
was a new idea.

00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:12.510
If you read their
little tag line,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.850
it sounds a lot like
Amazon's ads today.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.890
We sell everything
by mail order only.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.760
Your money we promptly return if
you're not perfectly satisfied.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.230
This is basically playbook out
of Amazon's marketing campaign.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.670
And I tell you that
not because I'm

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.040
trying to convince you to go
work at Amazon or anything,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.380
but if you compete
with Amazon, this

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.100
is another competitive
strategy to use.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.280
Study the history
of the problem.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.990
Some ideas were
successful, but they

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.190
were abandoned because the
person who ran with the idea

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.140
ran out of money or that
industry, for a time,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.772
took a big hit.

00:16:43.772 --> 00:16:44.730
The whole industry did.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.302
So these good ideas are sitting
there for solving a problem

00:16:48.302 --> 00:16:49.010
but they're gone.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.130
They've been forgotten.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.140
You go back, have a better
view of the problem,

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.530
and those ideas become yours.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.060
From a later catalog
in the 1940s,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.480
this is what basically
the conversion page--

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.090
the equivalent of a conversion
web page-- the conversion page

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.536
in that catalog looked like.

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:05.119
And if you look at
this catalog design

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.819
compared to conversion
pages on the web,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.310
there's a lot of smart
stuff going on here.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.540
You have anchoring,
price anchoring,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.630
using cognitive
science to help figure

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.450
out how to convince people
to buy stuff, value leader.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.950
You have zoomed in versions
of the guitar strut.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.450
There's all kinds of ideas here
that you can go back and go,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.290
wait a second.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.947
There's things we've lost
in all of our progress.

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.780
We've made things a lot
better in some ways,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.430
but there's ideas
here that could

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.650
be reused and experimented
with and re-applied.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.157
My second lesson for you,
and I only have two more

00:17:40.157 --> 00:17:41.990
and then we'll open the
floor for questions.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.420
My second lesson for you
is that great ideas often

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.200
look weird at first.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.270
If you are dealing
with a notion that

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.310
is so much superior to
what you are familiar with,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.230
it's not going to
look normal to you.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.925
It's not going to make sense
in the worldview that you have.

00:18:01.925 --> 00:18:04.050
And when you go back and
look at the history of how

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.716
we developed all these
technologies that

00:18:05.716 --> 00:18:06.810
we now take for granted--

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.970
railroads being one,
the internet and the web

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.215
being the second, mobile
devices being third.

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.840
Go back and read
about the first couple

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.297
of years of those devices
being products and people just

00:18:15.297 --> 00:18:17.130
looking at them, why
would you use that for?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.570
What would that do for me?

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.780
That's the common response
even if the idea is sound.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.060
So to tie this back
home to the first story.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.510
When Eiffel proposed the tower
idea to the Parisian World's

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:31.057
Fair committee, they accepted
it, which we all know.

00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:31.890
Two things happened.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.380
One, they told them we accept
it but only at half the budget

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.921
you proposed.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.010
Half the budget.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.260
Eiffel was a businessman.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.270
We like to think of it
now as an arts project.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.770
This was purely done for
the beauty of the world.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.130
No, he was a businessman.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.095
So he saw this as
an opportunity.

00:18:47.095 --> 00:18:49.511
He's like, fine, I'll put up
the other half of the capital

00:18:49.511 --> 00:18:51.790
if I get ticket concessions.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.430
I get to sell
baguettes when people

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.080
get inside the Eiffel Tower.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.440
I get all that money.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.010
So it's a business proposition
for him first and foremost.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.487
Second, and this is the
most shocking thing.

00:19:03.487 --> 00:19:04.320
Agree on the budget.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.220
They started working.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.490
They broke ground on
building the Eiffel Tower.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.720
300 or more of the leaders
of the cultural Zeitgeist

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.235
in Paris, which is the
world leader at the time

00:19:15.235 --> 00:19:16.950
of the arts in world--

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.490
poets, architects, musicians,
writers, politicians all

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.920
got together in
outrage at how much

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.950
they hated the idea
of the Eiffel Tower.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.106
They hated it.

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:29.730
They thought it was a rejection
of all the norms of aesthetics.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.770
It was a rejection of the idea
of what technology should do.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.280
300 got together--
300 of these experts

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.000
got together and wrote
an essay that they

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.990
made into a pamphlet-- it also
published in newspapers-- where

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.150
they basically said, we
have to kill this project.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.826
I'm going to read a small
passage of this to you.

00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:46.200
"We writers,
painters, sculptors,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.320
architects protest with
all of our strength,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.060
with all our
indignation in the name

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.340
of slighted French taste--"
which is a powerful force--

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.080
"slighted French taste
against this tower."

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.740
They also call it this mass of
iron gymnasium apparatus, which

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.700
is pretty insulting.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.420
And all of us look at this and
go, these people were so wrong.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.337
How could they say this
about this great work?

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:13.920
And that's how I
felt about this, too,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.360
when I first heard about this.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.950
But that's where this notion
of good ideas seeming weird

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.530
is important, because we have
to put our heads back in time.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.730
We know too much now.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.950
Go back to 1885.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.170
Tallest buildings in
Paris, other than some

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.310
of the churches, six stories
high, five stories high.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.002
You're walking around these
great promenades and parks,

00:20:34.002 --> 00:20:36.460
you're eating a baguette and
some cheese, having some wine.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.030
You're walking and
strolling along.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.630
And then, you turn a
corner and you see this.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.440
It does look kind of
monstrous in that context.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.070
It does look really foreign.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.269
Iron, wrought iron,
is a new technology.

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:51.810
This is not something
people are used

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.550
to, used to seeing
or understanding

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.110
or even feeling is safe.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.510
So they saw this and
that was their response.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.120
And from that perspective,
it's entirely understandable.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.530
How can they
conceive of why this

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.904
has merit when it's the first
time they've seen something

00:21:03.904 --> 00:21:06.390
like it.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.840
A more recent example.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.480
I know that I have forced all of
you to go back in time to ages

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.730
when there was no electricity.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.770
So I'm going to give
you an example that's

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.300
a little bit more
recent, actually,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.425
in the time of electricity.

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:18.600
I'm going to show you
a picture of a device,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.420
a prototype, a prototype
of a device that's

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.180
one of the most important
inventions in the last 50

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.729
years, and I want to see if
you can guess what it is.

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:28.020
So I'm going to show it to you.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.890
If you think you know what
it is, just raise your hand.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.015
And again, it's a prototype,
not the final version.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.570
I saw one hand, just
hold on a second.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.529
Two hands.

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:43.070
OK, I'll make it a
little bit easier.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.984
So I pulled a
dirty trick on you.

00:21:44.984 --> 00:21:46.150
This picture is upside down.

00:21:49.104 --> 00:21:50.020
Does that help at all?

00:21:53.842 --> 00:21:54.550
I'm just kidding.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.620
It was right side up before.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.940
No, I'm just screwing
with you, now.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.330
Actually, this is the right way.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.700
This is the right way.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.033
So two people raised their hand.

00:22:00.033 --> 00:22:01.650
Do have still the guess?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.150
Anybody?

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.585
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but it's too recent.

00:22:04.585 --> 00:22:07.510
So this is an electrical box.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.785
SCOTT BERKUN: Electrical box?

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:09.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.820
SCOTT BERKUN: Like for
shock therapy or something?

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.690
Like what--

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.836
AUDIENCE: The thing
you put in a wall.

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:13.220
SCOTT BERKUN: Put in a wall.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.720
OK.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.910
Other guesses?

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:15.802
Yeah?

00:22:15.802 --> 00:22:17.010
AUDIENCE: Is that a doorbell?

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.218
SCOTT BERKUN: Doorbell, nope.

00:22:18.218 --> 00:22:19.250
So I'll give you a hint.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.144
This object here
is a human knee.

00:22:22.144 --> 00:22:22.940
AUDIENCE: A what?

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.710
SCOTT BERKUN: A human knee.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:25.340
Human knee.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.300
Part of your body.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.760
You're knee, middle of your leg.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.570
Prototype.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.850
OK, so I'll cut
to the chase here.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.070
This is a prototype that
was made by Doug Engelbart

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.110
and Doug Engelbart is the
inventor of the mouse.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.150
And what he was thinking at
the time-- this is late 1860s--

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.910
he's thinking of how do I make
human-computer interaction

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.350
better?

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.230
How do people interact with
computers and machines in 1865?

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.690
Well, there's not
that many devices yet.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.251
There's cars.

00:22:53.251 --> 00:22:53.750
Sorry?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.670
AUDIENCE: 18 or 19?

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.770
SCOTT BERKUN: 19.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.500
Yeah.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.940
That would be
impressive if he was

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.320
working on the mouse in 1865.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.619
So in 1965, how did people
interact with machines?

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:05.410
What's the interaction
models that we have?

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:05.992
Cars.

00:23:05.992 --> 00:23:08.200
You drive with your car and
you drive with your hands

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.380
you drive with your
feet, foot on the pedal.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.127
So that's one mode
that could be used.

00:23:12.127 --> 00:23:14.710
Also, sewing machines, which is
really the primary inspiration

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.460
for this.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.880
Sewing machine, you
work with your hands,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.005
you have a foot on the
floor controlling something.

00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:21.220
So what he was thinking
here, his hypothesis

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.690
in this experiment, was, why
not use this part of your body

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:29.290
that goes unused to do xy,
pointing on the screen.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.885
Then, you have two hands free.

00:23:31.885 --> 00:23:33.760
It's actually kind of
a brilliant hypothesis.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.010
Even today, most
of our work, we're

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.680
trying so hard to input all
this stuff into a computer.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.350
50% of our limbs don't
get used for that at all.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.410
This is fine if Wendy
wants to go quit Google

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.280
and start up on extra
limb interface design.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.680
You're welcome to do it
because this is an old idea.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.152
But he was on the right track.

00:23:52.152 --> 00:23:54.610
He was thinking about how do
people interact with machines.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.820
Eventually, he developed
the model that we know,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.960
this direction.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.330
But even in 1970, 1971,
if he had shown this to us

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.310
and we were alive then,
not from time travel,

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.340
but we were alive then and
said this is the future,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.440
we'd be like, what
are you talking about?

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.710
This is like a box on a string.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.070
The idea is expressing a whole
bunch of assumptions that are

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.447
foreign and it will seem weird.

00:24:21.447 --> 00:24:23.530
The last piece of advice
here, to drive this home.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.738
I know a lot of this is
history and my promise to you

00:24:25.738 --> 00:24:27.790
was to apply history to today.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.230
So what this means
is, all of you

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.820
are in meetings when
you're working on products,

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.870
you're trying to
solve something,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.580
you're building something, where
you're discussing alternatives.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.966
There's proposal
a, proposal b, c.

00:24:36.966 --> 00:24:38.590
And maybe you have
some criteria you're

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.716
using to vet them, like
user scenarios or the goals

00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:42.840
for your project, whatever.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.830
So you look at idea
a in this discussion

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.570
and you say, oh, it's
good in these ways.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.480
Well, that's a good idea.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.030
We'll put it in
the good idea pile.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.025
Then, you go to
idea b and you're

00:24:50.025 --> 00:24:51.550
like, oh, we can
see already it's

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.700
going to have these issues.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.158
That's going to go
in the bad pile.

00:24:54.158 --> 00:24:55.283
And you go through c and d.

00:24:55.283 --> 00:24:57.574
Every now and then, you're
going to have an idea that's

00:24:57.574 --> 00:24:59.650
proposed that you look at
it in these discussions

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.017
and you go, that's,
that's really weird.

00:25:03.017 --> 00:25:05.350
And you turn to the person
who proposed it, you're like,

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.570
can you explain this?

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.770
And they'll probably go,
yeah that's a weird one.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.290
I feel like there's something
really to it that's good,

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.037
but I haven't
figured it out yet.

00:25:13.037 --> 00:25:15.370
And the natural thing that
we do, since we're efficiency

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.740
minded, we have
project deadlines,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.320
we take the weird ideas
and we throw them away

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.180
with all the bad ideas.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.800
That's a mistake.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.420
The advice to you is to
keep weird ideas around.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.250
A weird idea means
you don't understand

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.960
enough about the
problem or about

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.210
the potential of the
idea to evaluate it.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.275
You can't judge it.

00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:37.900
And of course, if
you're on a deadline,

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.390
you shouldn't ship this
idea you can't evaluate.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.830
But it also means there's
probably potential in it

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.475
and if you study it more,
you pay attention to it,

00:25:45.475 --> 00:25:46.970
you come back to
it a week later,

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.511
two weeks later, your point of
view is going to be different.

00:25:49.511 --> 00:25:51.500
You're going to ask
different questions of it.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.030
And you might find something
that leads to a discovery.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.385
Much of the history
of inventors, people

00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:59.920
who get credited with
inventing and discovering,

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.332
a lot of what--

00:26:01.332 --> 00:26:03.040
I shouldn't say a lot
because this is not

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.373
a guaranteed method, but there
are no guaranteed methods

00:26:05.373 --> 00:26:06.340
in the sort of work.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.710
But many of their
breakthroughs occurred

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.110
because of things that
were weird to them,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.900
they kept around, and
kept experimenting on

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.025
until they found its value.

00:26:15.025 --> 00:26:17.566
And the canonical example of
the story that's most well-known

00:26:17.566 --> 00:26:18.480
is the Post-it Note.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.110
The Post-it Note story.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.380
The cliche version is someone
had weak glue, accidentally

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.065
discovered weak glue, and that's
how we got the Post-it Note.

00:26:26.065 --> 00:26:28.630
But that's a
shallow, empty story.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.090
The true part of the story,
which ties all this together,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.320
yes it's true.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.870
An engineer, at 3M,
was working on trying

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.280
to make a strong glue.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.310
And by accident,
he made a weak one.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.880
But he didn't throw it away.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.227
He looked at it and was
like, this is weird.

00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:44.060
And he put it aside.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.726
Then, the next day
or a week later, he's

00:26:45.726 --> 00:26:48.265
like, what can I do with this?

00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:51.100
It can't solve the
intended problem,

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.870
but maybe it's good
for something else.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.480
And he kept it around
for years, continually

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.740
trying-- let me try it here.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.730
Let me try it there.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.200
He'd go to his
coworkers, go, hey,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.060
I had this stuff--
he didn't tell them

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.500
what it was designed for.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.570
He just said, hey,
I got this stuff.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.100
What would you do with it?

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.660
Sort of like an improv question.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.160
And he did all sorts
of experiments.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.697
Eventually, one of his coworkers
looked at that and said,

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:12.280
you know what?

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.720
Maybe I can use this.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.280
Because he had a problem.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.310
He sang in a choir and he wanted
to put notation on the choir

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.860
sheets, the music sheets.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.870
So he said with that soft
glue, that weak glue,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.370
I could possibly
put something on it

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.939
that I can easily take off.

00:27:24.939 --> 00:27:26.230
That's the breakthrough moment.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.280
What's often not said.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.220
It took years now of refining
that product and convincing

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.810
people of its value
for the Post-it

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.580
Note to become the product
that we know today.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.390
So in summation, any
story that you know of,

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.220
any legendary creation--

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.840
in the tech sector,
maybe you think

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.790
the iPhone is one of the
greatest things ever made.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.440
Maybe you think PageRank
is a breakthrough

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.730
in the history of technology.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.220
Whatever thing you
think of as perfect,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.340
being this masterpiece, they
all have a history where

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.350
they started as experiments.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.590
And if you want to be someone
who makes masterpieces or makes

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.380
great things, you
want to understand

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.130
what that experimental
part of the process

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.590
was like because
that's what you're

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.964
going to have to emulate in
projects that you are working

00:28:03.964 --> 00:28:06.910
on and making something today.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.160
Now, my last lesson for you--

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.100
purely about creative
thinking and how

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.620
to develop that
skill in yourself--

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.380
is that our minds are
naturally creative.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.430
It is wired into us, it's
part of our brain function.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:26.460
Anyone who is not in prison,
not in a psych ward, functions

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.280
in a decent way, can
get to work and home,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.100
has a brain that is
functioning, and creativity

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.420
is part of that brain function.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.460
And the best way to
illustrate this to you

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.000
is a common scenario that occurs
to us in everyday life, which

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.950
is losing your keys.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.282
So imagine tomorrow,
you wake up,

00:28:43.282 --> 00:28:45.740
you're getting ready for work--
actually, let's say Monday,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.760
unless some of you are
working on Saturday.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.860
Monday you wake up, you're
going to go to work.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.596
You do your normal
routine and you

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:56.100
do your pre-airlock check of
like wallet, purse, phone,

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.960
keys.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.251
And you reach for your keys
and the keys are not there.

00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:00.267
You go, OK.

00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:02.600
And your brain automatically
goes into first level mode.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.709
Well, where are my keys?

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:06.000
Oh, normally when I come
home, I put them in the basket

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.660
by the front door.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:06.990
OK.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.610
So you go there,
look at the basket.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:10.380
And if they're not
there, you go, hmm.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.080
Brain goes to level two,
like fault tolerance,

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.890
error checking.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.480
Maybe the keys fell
behind the basket,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.800
so you look behind the basket.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.240
Not there.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.660
Now your brain automatically
goes to level three.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.750
Creativity starts to
ensue without any ideation

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.164
methods, any
brainstorming techniques.

00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:29.580
All of a sudden,
you start looking

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.440
in your closet of
clothes that you have not

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.330
worn in like a month.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.560
You just do it.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.070
You know it's a little
weird, but it could be.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.539
Somehow they could be there.

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:41.580
When that doesn't work,
you go to the next level.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.860
You probably check
your pants again,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.580
somehow assuming that in the
time that you've been looking,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.125
they have rematerialized
where they should have been.

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:50.250
Then, you go to level four.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.200
Maybe someone broke into
my house and stole them.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.520
But that doesn't make any sense,
of course, because they would

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.510
have stolen other stuff, too.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.020
No.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.010
Maybe your cat took--

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.770
your brain automatically
goes to these places.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:29:59.610
Biologically.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.230
You can't prevent it.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.810
The explanation is
this is the asset

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.070
that we have as a species.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.100
We're not the strongest species,
we're not the fastest species.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.250
But our brains are good at
solving problems and inventing

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.910
experiments and hypotheses
to try to solve problems.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.390
This situation is
an unpleasant one,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.306
so we're motivated by
a certain kind of fear.

00:30:20.306 --> 00:30:22.680
Our brains kick in in a way,
even though losing your keys

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.255
is not the end of the world,
it does feel that way.

00:30:25.255 --> 00:30:27.600
Your amygdala, the
fight-or-flight response part

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.180
of your brain is triggered
in these moments.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.680
And it's not
filtering out anymore.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.180
That's why these
ideas can bubble up

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.720
from your subconscious and
you're willing to try them.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.300
Normally, in everyday life,
in ordinary situations,

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.460
in work situations,
we have lots and lots

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.420
of filters we are
automatically placing on what

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.899
our subconscious can do.

00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:46.440
In workplaces, it's
often just simply

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.929
about wanting to sound smart.

00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:49.470
If you have a filter,
you always want

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.590
to sound smart in
conversations or you

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.632
want to impress your boss
enough to get promoted.

00:30:54.632 --> 00:30:56.840
You're going to have a filter
on things that come out

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.550
of your mind or come
out of your brain

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.050
because you're
trying to be perfect.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.500
But as we've talked
about already,

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.250
you have to be willing
to say weird things

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.620
and experiment to find
the right way to go.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.140
So there is a mismatch here.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.730
Natural brain function allows
these things to happen,

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.521
but there's all these
things and inhibitors

00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:14.230
we put on top of
it that prevent it.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.220
To sum this up in a neat little
phrase, when we are suitably

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.090
motivated by a hard
problem, creativity ensues.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.320
It just happens.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.810
On its own.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.000
The two things that are
important, suitably motivated,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.080
hard problem.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.285
If you're suitably motivated
to solve an easy problem,

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:33.160
the creativity stuff
doesn't have to kick in.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.160
Losing your keys and if it's
the first place you look, done.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.510
Our brains are lazy.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.620
Why invent all these
weird scenarios?

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.490
Suitably motivated
by a hard problem.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.440
Now, to wrap up, I
have three pieces

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.972
of specific advice
about creative thinking.

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:48.930
This will be the last
set of points that I make

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.880
and then I'll open the
floor for questions.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.360
So number one is
just a summation

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.730
of what we talked about before.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.370
Everything I showed you,
Eiffel's work, Doug Engelbart,

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.440
da Vinci, when you look at
it from a broad perspective,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.580
what were they all doing?

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.350
They were all working.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.880
They had notions for things.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.510
da Vinci was inspired
by the passage he read.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.510
There was an idea there.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.490
But he got to work,
he said I want

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.781
to express [INAUDIBLE] I'm
going to try this thing out.

00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:17.052
The two young engineers
had an idea, a concept.

00:32:17.052 --> 00:32:19.510
They didn't just let it sit as
a concept, they got to work.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.270
They made a sketch,
they made a prototype.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.460
Creativity is best thought of
in the smaller form of the word.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:25.960
Create.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.320
It's a verb, it's
something that you do.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.180
In the process of
making things, that's

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.920
where creativity
can be expressed.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.640
It's not some abstract
thing, some abstract skill

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.920
you develop on its own.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.980
It has to be done through
the process of work.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.140
Second, false constraints.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.000
So what I said to
you just a minute

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.535
ago about keys
and the inhibitors

00:32:44.535 --> 00:32:47.410
that we put upon our brain,
our natural creative brain

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.420
function.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.101
There are false constraints
that we put upon our thinking.

00:32:51.101 --> 00:32:52.600
And there's a stupid
puzzle that I'm

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.790
going to share with you that
you probably have seen before.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.770
How many of you have
seen this puzzle before?

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.580
A couple of you.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.800
How many of you heard the
phrase, think outside the box?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.590
How many of you hate the
phrase, think outside the box?

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.020
Think out-- I want all
of you to say it with me.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.490
One, two, three.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.912
AUDIENCE: Think outside the box.

00:33:08.912 --> 00:33:09.620
SCOTT BERKUN: OK.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.244
That was not as good
as the first time.

00:33:11.244 --> 00:33:12.740
Our cult is falling apart here.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.160
I feel very bad.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.450
AUDIENCE: You said,
say it with me.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.320
SCOTT BERKUN: I screwed it up.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.460
I totally screwed it up.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.950
My fault. I'd make
you do it again,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.144
but I'd rather get
to Q&amp;A. But this

00:33:20.144 --> 00:33:22.310
is the source of that saying,
think outside the box.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.740
And the puzzle--
for those of you

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.156
who want to solve
it for yourself,

00:33:25.156 --> 00:33:27.750
cover your ears and your
eyes for 20 seconds.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.744
No one cares, good.

00:33:29.744 --> 00:33:31.910
This puzzle, you're supposed
to connect all the dots

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.720
using only straight lines.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.300
And so the solution
of the puzzle

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.485
involves you having to
go outside of the box.

00:33:39.485 --> 00:33:40.529
And it's a stupid puzzle.

00:33:40.529 --> 00:33:41.820
It's not really that important.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.403
The implication here,
though, is good.

00:33:43.403 --> 00:33:45.110
It's about false constraints.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.180
The whole notion here
is that no one told you

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.750
in solving the problem that you
couldn't work outside the box.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.180
We presume it.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.510
To live in society, we
presume lots of constraints.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.280
When you came in this
room, none of you

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.490
sat down up here, next to me.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.176
None of you were standing up in
the middle of my presentation.

00:34:04.176 --> 00:34:06.050
There's all these
conventions and constraints

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.633
that we naturally
apply to situations.

00:34:07.633 --> 00:34:10.670
That's how society
and civilization work.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.037
But we're talking
about creativity here.

00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:14.620
The exercise here
that you're trying--

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.600
the message they're trying to
get across in this puzzle is

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.630
if you work through a list of
all the constraints you think

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.710
are true--

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.460
let's say you come up
with seven of them--

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.480
and it turns out one of
those constraints is false,

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.540
that's a window of
possibilities now that opens up.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.400
And that's where ideas are.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.830
It's not this generative
thing, it's actually reductive.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.120
Oh, if I don't have to
worry about budget for this,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.620
OK, now--

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.619
If I don't have to worry
about schedule for this

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:40.190
or I have an extra
week, I assumed

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.315
this had to be done Friday.

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:42.440
Oh, it's Monday?

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.670
Possibilities open up.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:45.679
So it's a logical exercise.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.659
Any time you're
stuck on a problem,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.270
make a list of the constraints
that you are assuming are true.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.103
Show it to a coworker,
show it to your boss.

00:34:52.103 --> 00:34:53.300
They'll go, really?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.510
That's not the goal.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.730
The goal-- you go, ah.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.740
Now, the window of
possibilities opens up.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.770
For fun, there are many other
possible solutions for this.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.020
Infinite in fact.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.020
You could do it in three
lines if you go really

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.560
outside the box.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.890
You can do it in one
line, if it's a fat line.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.020
No one told you the
size of the line.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.670
You could do it
in one line if it

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.850
goes all the way around the
world and goes back around.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.200
The more absurd you're
willing to get, the more silly

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.630
you're willing to get, the more
solutions you can come up with.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.129
But there should be an infinite
number of solutions to this.

00:35:24.129 --> 00:35:26.181
So an exercise for you
could be see if you

00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:28.370
can come up with more of them.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.157
Then, my last note for
you is about self-respect.

00:35:32.157 --> 00:35:33.740
So I told you all
that your brains are

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.610
wired by design to be creative.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.280
That stuff is in you.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.834
Society, and as we get older,
and we try to get good grades,

00:35:39.834 --> 00:35:41.750
and try to get good jobs,
and good performance

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.925
reviews, constraints.

00:35:42.925 --> 00:35:44.870
We pile constraints
on and we forget

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.580
that natural part of ourselves.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.900
So the best single habit
to learn and practice

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.690
is to have a place for
yourself where your ideas can

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.682
go that no one will see.

00:35:55.682 --> 00:35:57.140
And the most obvious
way to do this

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.790
is a journal, some
kind of journal.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.890
A book, it could
be a Google Doc.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.587
It could be anything
where you can

00:36:02.587 --> 00:36:04.420
put stuff that's in
your brain, you're like,

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.544
that's an interesting idea,
and you can put it down

00:36:06.544 --> 00:36:08.016
and no one else is
going to see it.

00:36:08.016 --> 00:36:09.740
You are training
your subconscious

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.039
to start talking to you again.

00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:13.580
And you're going to listen more
carefully now because there's

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.140
a place for it to go.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.790
Even more importantly,
our memories are terrible.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.130
We have terrible memories.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.520
Once you put something in the
world, there's some chance--

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.222
even if it's a small chance--

00:36:24.222 --> 00:36:26.180
that you can come back
to it and go, oh, right.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.796
I can use this in
my next project.

00:36:27.796 --> 00:36:30.170
But if it just goes through
your mind and out your brain,

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.580
you'll never see it again.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.820
So most artists,
scientists, researchers

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.720
keep some kind of journal.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.700
Even people who work
on curing cancer.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.010
They have lab notes.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.800
They put down their observations
and thoughts habitually

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.230
so that they can come back
later and go, oh, right.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.105
I forgot about this,
and I thought about this

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.690
four days ago.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.520
Put these two pieces
together, boom.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.190
I got something new.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.090
So keeping a journal.

00:36:56.227 --> 00:36:57.810
There's an element
of courage to this.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.780
Those two young engineers
had to have the courage

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.870
to pitch their
boss and the idea.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.272
Even if you're creative
and you keep a journal

00:37:05.272 --> 00:37:06.730
and you develop
your ideas, there's

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.090
some element of courage
required because you

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.722
are working into the unknown.

00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:12.180
If you're pitching
something that's

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.650
been done before that you
know is going to work,

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.020
there's not much risk there.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.340
We're talking about progress.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.881
We're talking about
good ideas, we're

00:37:18.881 --> 00:37:20.350
talking about bigger ideas.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.090
There's going to be risk there.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.840
You're going to be
going into the unknown.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.550
And part of what makes a
good team or a good boss

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.870
are people who make you
feel comfortable offering up

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.310
things that might not work.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.260
There's some room and
margin for saying things

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.210
that are weird or unexpected.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.100
Just like Eiffel
offered his team,

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.840
hey, I don't fully
get what you're doing,

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.340
but I want you to
keep going and see

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.630
if you can develop it further.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.490
And with that, I will end
with some sparkle razzle

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.800
dazzle of the book cover.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.760
The book is out now.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.230
The audio book released today.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.990
It's gotten great reviews.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.740
It's got some famous
other creative people

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.174
who said good things about it.

00:37:54.174 --> 00:37:55.590
And with the rest
of our time, I'm

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.250
happy to answer any
questions that you have.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.810
Thank you for listening.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.639
Thanks.

00:38:01.639 --> 00:38:04.633
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.850
SCOTT BERKUN: I'm also happy
to be your Snopes for history

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.230
of inventions.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.150
It's one of my
hobbies, the history

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.935
of inventions of many,
many famous things

00:38:16.935 --> 00:38:18.430
that you may know the story
of that you want to know

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:19.770
did that really happen?

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.964
Like Newton and the apple
or Alexander Graham Bell.

00:38:21.964 --> 00:38:23.880
If you have any of those
legends, you're like,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.713
is that really true?

00:38:24.713 --> 00:38:30.590
I'm happy to be your
invention Snopes.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.827
AUDIENCE: Do you plan
a book about those?

00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:33.826
SCOTT BERKUN: I'm sorry?

00:38:33.826 --> 00:38:35.710
AUDIENCE: Do you plan
a book about those?

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.085
SCOTT BERKUN: A
book about those?

00:38:37.085 --> 00:38:37.870
I wrote one.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.260
"The Myths of Innovation"
is, in part, that book.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.030
The book isn't anchored
strictly on that.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.890
It's similar to the
lecture I just gave you

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.300
about these stories
we think we know,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.390
but trying to use those
stories to apply in real life.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.030
Making decisions
and building stuff.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.120
Yes, sir?

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.277
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:58.277 --> 00:38:59.110
There was a process.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.100
I broke the process.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.297
Yes, sir?

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:02.130
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.690
Is this on?

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.190
OK.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.040
So if all ideas are
formed from other ideas,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.210
clearly there's value
in exposing yourself

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.060
to as many ideas as possible.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.820
I find personally even in my
software engineering work,

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.440
I use ideas from TV shows
I watch, video games I

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.940
play, all sorts of things.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.210
So what are some things
that you would recommend

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.520
doing in your free
time to expose yourself

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.020
to as many ideas as possible?

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.603
SCOTT BERKUN: That's
a great question.

00:39:24.603 --> 00:39:26.540
I think that the one
thing I would say,

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.910
you're already well
ahead of the curve.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.500
You've already
realized that this is--

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.990
you see the potential in
experiencing other things just

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.650
coincidentally.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.570
Like, oh, I can take
this and use it here.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.278
And a lot of the
history of breakthroughs

00:39:39.278 --> 00:39:42.100
are these sorts of stories
of a pattern or a method

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.500
that's well-known in one
field, being used in another.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.630
The thing I might
encourage you to do

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:51.019
is to pick fields or subjects
you know nothing about.

00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:52.810
Because when you go to
a field or a subject

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.840
you know nothing about,
you don't have any pressure

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.460
of sounding stupid.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.360
So a lot of people who want
to be more inventive and they

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.844
work in the tech
sector, they try

00:40:02.844 --> 00:40:04.510
to find another tech
sector event that's

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.384
more about invention.

00:40:05.384 --> 00:40:06.670
And I'm like, no.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.900
Go to an event that's about
a different field, preferably

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.399
one where they are inventing
things, but not technological.

00:40:13.399 --> 00:40:15.190
And you will hear things
and observe things

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.390
that will make you curious.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.990
And that curiosity,
you'll ask questions.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.573
And then asking those
questions you'll

00:40:19.573 --> 00:40:22.720
say, well, when I'm
building something,

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.660
this is how we do it.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.637
How do you do this?

00:40:25.637 --> 00:40:27.220
And those kinds of
conversations, now,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.674
where you're comparing
across fields--

00:40:29.674 --> 00:40:31.090
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.590
there's probably someone
just like you in the plumbing

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:40.070
industry or the-- you
mentioned games or like the--

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.400
someone who makes board
games for a living or someone

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.255
who's like a medical engineer.

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:46.630
The closer you
can get to someone

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.460
who is a parallel to you
but has the completely

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.543
different background, those
kinds of conversations

00:40:50.543 --> 00:40:51.802
are the powerful ones.

00:40:51.802 --> 00:40:53.260
It's hard to find
those connections

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.670
because you have to reach out
across your comfort level.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:59.590
But again, it's about
going into the unknown.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.849
Next question?

00:41:00.849 --> 00:41:02.890
AUDIENCE: So the computers
that we're using today

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.970
are based on technology that was
invented in the 20th century.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.980
But in the 19th century, we
had Boole, who did the math,

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.890
and Babbage made the the engine.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.960
What were those based on?

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.480
What was previous
technology that

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.809
was basically the forerunner
of those computers?

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:19.600
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.683
So that's a good question.

00:41:20.683 --> 00:41:22.160
I don't know about Boole.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.030
Boole was a mathematician
so he would probably

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.217
say there was mathematical
theories and hypotheses he

00:41:29.217 --> 00:41:29.800
was following.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.830
Babbage, I'm sure was
influenced by clock making.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.240
For sure.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.450
At that time, the most
sophisticated engineering

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.000
for mechanical gear
work were clock makers.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.326
And there's a long history and
tradition of that design work

00:41:43.326 --> 00:41:44.200
and engineering work.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.630
I have to believe that
when he started his work,

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.437
he looked at clocks first.

00:41:48.437 --> 00:41:50.020
And the gearing, I
mean, just the fact

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.880
of how do you make intricate
gearing and that kind

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.660
of sophistication?

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.080
Where would you look if you
were alive at that time?

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.080
It had to be clockwork.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.612
For sure.

00:42:00.612 --> 00:42:01.320
Another question?

00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:07.180
AUDIENCE: Well, I was
hoping to have a little bit

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.160
more time to think about it.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.868
SCOTT BERKUN: OK.

00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:11.470
Is there an interstitial
question someone

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.952
can ask to save your coworker?

00:42:13.952 --> 00:42:14.785
You have a question.

00:42:14.785 --> 00:42:16.492
AUDIENCE: So about
creativity, is it

00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:17.700
something that you can force?

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.930
Or are you saying maybe
to carve out time daily

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.970
to be creative, or
have ideas, or journal?

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.650
SCOTT BERKUN: I think
that the answer is both.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.440
It's an unfair answer.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.400
You can force it.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.710
The key example is a
good example of that.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.127
If you're really desperate,
you're going to be--

00:42:35.127 --> 00:42:36.710
again, without even
thinking about it,

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.722
without trying to summon your
creative gods or anything,

00:42:39.722 --> 00:42:41.680
those ideas just start
going through your mind.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.280
So there is something to be
said for putting yourself

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.230
in situations that
will test you.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.176
But the habits of it,
the habits of creation,

00:42:51.176 --> 00:42:53.300
are something that you
really need to do every day.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.520
That's what a journal is for.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.935
I mean, to drive the
journal example--

00:42:55.935 --> 00:42:57.730
to tie his question
to the journal thing

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.750
I was trying to say.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.080
If I had this habit for myself
of I think of some notion

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.190
and I put it down.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.960
I think of some notion
and I put it down.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.210
And I come back a week later
and I look at that notion

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.160
and I go, ah, and
I expand it out.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.280
My own confidence in my
ability to come up with ideas

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.290
and to talk to my
own subconscious

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.531
improves and improves over time.

00:43:16.531 --> 00:43:17.530
So that's like a muscle.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.382
It's like practicing
anything else.

00:43:19.382 --> 00:43:20.840
But there are some
situations where

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.423
you're going get-- some people
feel most creative when they're

00:43:23.423 --> 00:43:25.870
at a deadline or when they
are working on a high stress

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.667
project, for some people.

00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:29.500
There's no universal
answer to these things,

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.450
of course, because
we're all different.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.366
And that's part of why
I hate all these recipe

00:43:33.366 --> 00:43:36.460
books, the seven killer
steps, the six secret silver

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.680
bullets, because
the goal here is

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.140
for you to apply
your unique worldview

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.352
and experiences to a problem.

00:43:42.352 --> 00:43:44.560
That's what you're trying
to be when you're creative.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.101
So sort of like the
joke where I made

00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:49.350
you all say at the same time
all ideas come from other ideas.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.551
There can't be any
universal way to do this.

00:43:51.551 --> 00:43:53.050
Part of what you
have to do is to be

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.020
more self aware of your
own habits and tendencies.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.610
And a lot of people are
really afraid of journaling

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.510
because they're afraid of what
thing they will put in there.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.150
But if you're afraid
of your own ideas then

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.770
you probably need
to seek therapy.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.360
No, therapy's a good thing.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.460
It's not a pejorative.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.954
But if really that's
the inhibitor,

00:44:10.954 --> 00:44:13.120
it's got nothing to do with
the world or your brain.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.430
It's your own psychology
and your fear of what

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.629
your brain may come up with.

00:44:16.629 --> 00:44:18.170
You can't be afraid
of that any more.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.930
That's why journaling
helps so much.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.540
You get comfortable and
familiar with the weird things

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.760
your subconscious
tends to suggest.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.392
Are you ready for
your question now?

00:44:26.392 --> 00:44:27.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think so.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.190
So my question is
at the other end

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:34.050
of the spectrum, where you
constantly think of, oh, maybe

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:34.760
I can do this.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.380
And well, before you're about
to do that you're like, oh, what

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.360
about this other idea.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.340
SCOTT BERKUN: Ah, OK.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.940
AUDIENCE: And you have this
infinite loop about new ideas.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940
Any suggestion for that?

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.356
SCOTT BERKUN: I
have a suggestion,

00:44:45.356 --> 00:44:46.450
but it's similar to--

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.200
let's take this example and
put it into everyday terms.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.110
Let's say I was single and
I go on a first date and I

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.220
kind of like that person.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:54.800
Then, I go on another date.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.280
I kind of like that person.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.940
And I never-- what
would you say?

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.012
I never?

00:44:59.012 --> 00:44:59.720
AUDIENCE: Commit.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.595
SCOTT BERKUN: Commit.

00:45:00.595 --> 00:45:01.810
Never commit.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.680
If you never commit
to something,

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:09.230
that means that you maybe don't
really want to do this thing.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.360
That all those ideas
are good, but maybe you

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.690
find it more fun to just play
with the idea in your mind.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.190
For a lot of
people, that's true.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.787
Because as I said,
creativity is work.

00:45:17.787 --> 00:45:19.370
Once you say, I want
to write a novel,

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:21.027
I want to start a company.

00:45:21.027 --> 00:45:22.610
Hey, it's an epiphany,
it feels great.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:23.990
Over dinner and wine
with your friends,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.695
I'm going to start a company.

00:45:24.695 --> 00:45:25.760
They go, yeah.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.450
Then, the next day, you're
like, oh, I got to call people,

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.220
I got to write
documents, I got to--

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.046
this doesn't feel
so creative anymore.

00:45:33.046 --> 00:45:33.920
This feels like work.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.962
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

00:45:34.962 --> 00:45:36.503
Go to dinner with
your friends again.

00:45:36.503 --> 00:45:37.970
Hey, I'm going to make a movie.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.610
And you go through the
same loop of confusing

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:43.550
the fun of coming up with
the idea with the reality

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:46.530
of the work of actually
putting that idea in the world.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.160
So I would say to you
that it doesn't matter.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.720
All of the ideas
you come up with

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.570
are probably good, good enough
to put a weekend of time

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:54.309
into them.

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:55.850
But until you put
that commitment in,

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.130
you're never going to learn
enough about yourself.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.520
And your own true
interests, they'll

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.900
just keep going
along the surface.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.724
Which could be
fine, but you have

00:46:04.724 --> 00:46:06.140
to realize that
that's really what

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.806
you like to do rather
than being someone

00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:12.350
who's committed to an idea to
build it, to build something.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:13.190
Question?

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.954
All right.

00:46:13.954 --> 00:46:16.370
AUDIENCE: So this question is
stemming from my discussions

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.770
with a friend about creativity.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.260
So personally, in
my free time, I

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.460
like listening to podcasts
about various things.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.380
I don't like listening
to music that much.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.850
For example, on
my way to work, I

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:30.920
listen to audio books and stuff.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.290
And according to my
friend, keeping my brain

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.710
this occupied, even
in my free time,

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.910
it may be destroying
my creativity.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.220
So do you think that
has any validity?

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.932
Or--

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.640
SCOTT BERKUN: That
should be the podcast.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.290
Creativity destroyer.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:49.130
Listen to this, you will
never have an idea again.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.730
Yes and no.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:50.780
Everybody's different.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.580
And the way people
relax and what

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.710
makes them feel
comfortable is different.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.480
So there's no universal answer.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.090
I can say though, and there
is neuroscience and cognitive

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:04.220
psychology behind this, why
you get ideas in the shower.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.230
Who here has gotten
an idea in the shower?

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.501
Who here showers?

00:47:07.501 --> 00:47:08.000
Good.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.730
All right.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.010
Excellent.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.200
What goes on there
is, the reason why

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.790
it's become like
a sacred place is

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.820
that it's one of the few places
where there's no screens,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.950
there's no music by default,
your body is relaxed,

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.770
it's comfortable, and
your higher brain--

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:26.170
the logical part of
your brain-- is quieter.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.490
And there's no input.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.530
So your subconscious, which
is where all the associations

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.890
between things the source of
our ideas it's easier for ideas

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:35.300
to bubble up.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.460
So as long as there's some
time regularly for you

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.940
where that's true--

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.860
and it could be when
you go for a walk,

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.835
it could be when
you're running, it

00:47:43.835 --> 00:47:45.020
could be when you're at the gym.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.561
As long as there's
some state of mind

00:47:46.561 --> 00:47:50.514
that you reach where your
higher brain is quiet,

00:47:50.514 --> 00:47:51.680
that's when it could happen.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.600
And for some people listening
to podcasts and stuff.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.810
I listen to the
radio all the time,

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.934
I listen to podcasts all
the time, even at the gym.

00:47:56.934 --> 00:47:59.410
Sometimes I'm tuned in
and sometimes it's on

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.650
and my brain is somewhere else.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:05.270
So just the fact that that
input is there doesn't mean it

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:07.820
doesn't necessarily define
what's going on in your brain.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.730
But there's lots of
evidence for this.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.440
Often, it's physical
activity where

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.040
our higher brains are more
quiet and the subconscious

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:16.670
can bubble up.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.340
So for some people it's
running, or going for a walk,

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.650
going for a hike.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.030
So you should think
about what habit you have

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.164
where your higher brain
is idle and you're not

00:48:25.164 --> 00:48:27.830
problem solving but there's some
other passive thing that you're

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.780
doing that works for you.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.470
And you'll have to
experiment to find it.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.080
We have time for maybe
one or two more questions.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.502
Yes, sir?

00:48:37.502 --> 00:48:41.110
AUDIENCE: So these days
when we have a problem

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.310
or are trying to solve
something, we frequently

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.426
go search the web or go to
YouTube, how to do this,

00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:48.050
how to do that.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.530
That could be a
little bit similar

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.440
to what that [INAUDIBLE]
before me asked.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.360
Now, what's the right
thing to do here?

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.120
Now, if you have a problem
and you look it up,

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.830
you'll solve the
problem quickly.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.550
But then, you blocked
yourself from finding

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.140
a solution yourself.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.330
But on the other hand, you
expose yourself to other ideas.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.940
This is good, as you said.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.790
If you expose yourself
to other ideas,

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.710
you will come up with new ideas.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.407
But then, if you don't try
to come up with ideas--

00:49:18.407 --> 00:49:19.740
you see the contradiction there?

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.550
SCOTT BERKUN: I do.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.440
I guess it's usually
not a problem

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.960
because if you were
to say, decide,

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.020
that you wanted to
start a company, well

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.880
you'd Google, how do
I start a company?

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.505
And you'd find a list of things
that you now have to go and do,

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:35.632
like I said before.

00:49:35.632 --> 00:49:37.340
Once you start going
and do those things,

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.939
you may realize or recognize
that there's a better way

00:49:39.939 --> 00:49:42.230
to do them, will be frustrated
with one of those steps,

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:43.452
you'll seek out other ones.

00:49:43.452 --> 00:49:45.410
But most of the things
you're likely to look up

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.226
as ways to solve the problem
are going to be very abstract.

00:49:49.226 --> 00:49:51.850
Like if you were to do a Google
search for how to write a book.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.230
It's going to give you some
basic construction of it,

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.188
but it's not going to
tell you whether to write

00:49:56.188 --> 00:50:00.242
a novel or a thriller
or a Victorian drama.

00:50:00.242 --> 00:50:01.950
There's always going
to be a lot of space

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:03.600
that you need to
fill out yourself.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.100
And so I guess what
I would say is--

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:09.270
it's a very practical answer--
is do the things that actually

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:11.209
help you produce.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:12.750
If you produce stuff
and you're like,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:17.290
my solutions and the things I
create are really boring to me,

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.260
then maybe say for
the next project,

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.540
I'm not going to
research anything.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.171
And experiment that way.

00:50:23.171 --> 00:50:25.670
Every project is going to be
different, especially if you're

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:26.850
trying to do ambitious work.

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.500
Every project is
going to be different

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.541
and it's going to demand
different things of you,

00:50:30.541 --> 00:50:33.210
it's going to require different
techniques or skills to try.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:37.880
So there's no universal
answer, unfortunately.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.070
And that is the case for
a lot of these questions.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.960
A common question I get asked
is how do I know when I'm done?

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.650
How do I know when I'm done?

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:49.230
And I'm like, have you
ever consumed something

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:53.020
like a movie or software product
or a book and you're like,

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.270
this is terrible.

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:57.220
Yet you paid money for it
and it exists in the world.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.420
Lots of finished stuff, many
people think isn't very good.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.660
Is not done.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:02.810
I'm sure you have arguments
with your coworkers.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.065
They're like, we need
to ship this today.

00:51:04.065 --> 00:51:05.400
And you're like, no
this is terrible.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.050
It's got all these
bugs and problems.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.650
It's inherently debatable,
when is it done.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.910
Inherently debatable.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.090
And the way you solve
those discussions

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.960
is with a group of
people, some consensus

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.460
on what the criteria is for
actually shipping something.

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.710
And you do that with yourself.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.360
Is this essay good
enough to publish?

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:21.942
I don't know.

00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:23.400
Is this tweet good
enough to tweet?

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.109
I don't know.

00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:25.650
Some people spend
time reviewing them

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.000
and they put them in
their drafts folder.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.125
Other people, you can tell,
just go blah blah blah,

00:51:29.125 --> 00:51:30.810
and push the button.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:31.530
Right?

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.016
So is one right, is one wrong?

00:51:34.016 --> 00:51:36.390
Some of those people who just
don't really think about it

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.450
much have a lot of followers.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.824
Some people who
are very precious

00:51:38.824 --> 00:51:41.310
and care a lot about high
quality don't have many.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.910
Popularity is unfair and
not based on a set criteria

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.089
that we all agree on.

00:51:46.089 --> 00:51:47.880
And that's part of the
world you enter when

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.200
you're doing creative work.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.650
Eiffel Tower, lots of
people at the time hated it.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.424
Were they right,
were they wrong?

00:51:54.424 --> 00:51:56.340
Depends on your point
of view and perspective.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.173
And the more creative
the work you're doing,

00:51:58.173 --> 00:52:00.990
the more subjective the
ways to evaluate it will be.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.700
So one more?

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.990
Yes, sir.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.174
That's OK.

00:52:06.174 --> 00:52:07.590
AUDIENCE: So in
education, there's

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:09.690
been a big push
towards preparing

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.462
kids for the future, whatever
the jobs of the future are.

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:15.276
And so my own kids, I see them
being pushed in science, math,

00:52:15.276 --> 00:52:17.050
computer programming.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.687
You mentioned history
at the beginning.

00:52:18.687 --> 00:52:20.270
Are there things you
would like to see

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.592
done differently in education
in light of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:52:22.592 --> 00:52:23.550
SCOTT BERKUN: Yes, yes.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.650
I think that every
student, everywhere,

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:31.760
should get five copies
of this book and five

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:36.450
for each of their parents, and
that would solve everything.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.610
The creativity answer,
and there's a lot of--

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.940
I'm not an expert on this
and I'm not particularly

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.370
a fan of Montessori
schools, but the notion

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.590
that they have of
self-directed things

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.510
seems like the right path to me.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.290
That part of, in
this conversation,

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.650
how do you decide, how do you--

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.280
it's self-oriented.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.940
That there is less and
less room for that,

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.676
it seems like, in most
curriculums and the assumptions

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.300
we have about what
people should learn.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.010
And so programming
could be that,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:05.520
if the goal wasn't simply
to memorize how to code,

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.950
but the goal was to learn
how to make your own stuff.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.620
That the goal is to,
every quarter, every week,

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.694
you've built something.

00:53:11.694 --> 00:53:13.860
And you had your criteria
for it and you evaluate it

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.350
and you decide for
yourself what is good.

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:23.090
That kind of process, that's
open-ended is central to this.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:27.170
And the more you focus
on grades and that--

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.540
there's no way to grade
these open-ended projects.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.060
So there's a conflict between
what parents and the school

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.610
system often emphasizes--
grades and tests--

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:38.300
versus this psychology and
self-awareness and ability

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.400
to choose for your
own self what's

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:43.020
worth making, what's good,
that work against each other.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.750
So some protection
of that, I think,

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.950
is the thing I would
think about first.

00:53:49.671 --> 00:53:51.170
SPEAKER: Thank you
very much, Scott.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.890
SCOTT BERKUN: Thanks, guys.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:52.765
Thanks for listening.

00:53:52.765 --> 00:53:55.840
[APPLAUSE]
