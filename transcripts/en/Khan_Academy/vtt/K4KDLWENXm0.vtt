00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.780
7 patients blood pressures
have been measured after

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.580
having been given a new
drug for 3 months.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.960
They had blood pressure
increases of, and they give us

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.010
seven data points right here--
who knows, that's in some

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.330
blood pressure units.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.440
Construct a 95% confidence
interval for the true expected

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.510
blood pressure increase for all
patients in a population.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.740
So there's some population
distribution here.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.930
It's a reasonable assumption
to think that it is normal.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.990
It's a biological process.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.560
So if you gave this drug to
every person who has ever

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.630
lived, that will result in some
mean increase in blood

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.730
pressure, or who knows, maybe
it actually will decrease.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970
And there's also going to be
some standard deviation here.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.400
It is a normal distribution.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.850
And the reason why it's
reasonable to assume that it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.580
a normal distribution
is because it's

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.580
a biological process.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.370
It's going to be the sum of many
thousands and millions of

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.440
random events.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.370
And things that are sums of
millions and thousands of

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000
random events tend to be
normal distribution.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.420
So this is a population
distribution.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.410
And we don't know anything
really about it outside of the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.180
sample that we have here.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.980
Now, what we can do is, and this
tends to be a good thing

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.090
to do, when you do have a
sample just figure out

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.980
everything that you can
figure out about that

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.070
sample from the get-go.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.490
So we have our seven
data points.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.010
And you could add them up and
divide by 7 and get your

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.150
sample mean.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.950
So our sample mean
here is 2.34.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.410
And then you can also
calculate your

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.980
sample standard deviation.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.380
Find the square distance from
each of these points to your

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.460
sample mean, add them up, divide
by n minus 1, because

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.810
it's a sample, then take the
square root, and you get your

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.180
sample standard deviation.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.720
I did this ahead of time
just to save time.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.750
Sample standard deviation
is 1.04.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.930
And when you don't know anything
about the population

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.280
distribution, the thing that
we've been doing from the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.210
get-go is estimating that
character with our sample

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.790
standard deviation.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.100
So we've been estimating the
true standard deviation of the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.193
population with our sample
standard deviation.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.340
Now in this problem, this exact
problem, we're going to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.220
run into a problem.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.940
We're estimating our standard
deviation with an n of only 7.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.410
So this is probably going to
be a not so good estimate

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:40.780
because-- let me just write--
because n is small.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.140
In general, this is considered
a bad estimate if n

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.800
is less than 30.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
Above 30 you're dealing
in the realm

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.880
of pretty good estimates.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.720
So the whole focus of this video
is when we think about

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.300
the sampling distribution, which
is what we're going to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.970
use to generate our interval,
instead of assuming that the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.490
sampling distribution is normal
like we did in many

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.180
other videos using the central
limit theorem and all of that,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.290
we're going to tweak the
sampling distribution.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.570
We're not going to assume it's
a normal distribution because

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.060
this is a bad estimate.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.300
We're going to assume that
it's something called a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.850
t-distribution.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.270
And a t-distribution is
essentially, the best way to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.820
think about is it's almost
engineered so it gives a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.340
better estimate of your
confidence intervals and all

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.170
of that when you do have
a small sample size.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.165
It looks very similar to
a normal distribution.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.600
It has some mean, so this is
your mean of your sampling

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.780
distribution still.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.055
But it also has fatter tails.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.990
And the way I think about why
it has fatter tails is when

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.960
you make an assumption that this
is a standard deviation

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840
for-- let me take
one more step.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.090
So normally what we do is we
find the estimate of the true

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.560
standard deviation, and then
we say that the standard

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.950
deviation of the sampling
distribution is equal to the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.360
true standard deviation of our
population divided by the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.130
square root of n.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.640
In this case, n is equal to 7.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.410
And then we say OK, we never
know the true standard, or we

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.660
seldom know-- sometimes you do
know-- we seldom know the true

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.400
standard deviation.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.310
So if we don't know that the
best thing we can put in there

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.870
is our sample standard
deviation.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.000
And this right here, this is the
whole reason why we don't

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.070
say that this is just a 95
probability interval.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.560
This is the whole reason why
we call it a confidence

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.040
interval because we're making
some assumptions.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.690
This thing is going to change
from sample to sample.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.860
And in particular, this is going
to be a particularly bad

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.380
estimate when we have a
small sample size, a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.450
size less than 30.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.810
So when you are estimating the
standard deviation where you

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.920
don't know it, you're estimating
it with your sample

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.320
standard deviation, and your
sample size is small, and

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.490
you're going to use this to
estimate the standard

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.940
deviation of your sampling
distribution, you don't assume

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.795
your sampling distribution
is a normal distribution.

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:17.350
You assume it has
fatter tails.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.540
And it has fatter tails because
you're essentially

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.360
underestimating-- you're
underestimating the standard

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.730
deviation over here.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.230
Anyway, with all of that said,
let's just actually go through

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.150
this problem.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.180
So we need to think about a 95%
confidence interval around

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.450
this mean right over here.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.580
So a 95% confidence interval,
if this was a normal

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.200
distribution you would just
look it up in a Z-table.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.450
But it's not, this is
a t-distribution.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.990
We're looking for a 95%
confidence interval.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.030
So some interval around
the mean that

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.540
encapsulates 95% of the area.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.650
For a t-distribution you use
t-table, and I have a t-table

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.380
ahead of time right over here.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.270
And what you want to do is use
the two-sided row for what

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.390
we're doing right over here.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.720
And the best way to think
about it is that we're

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.860
symmetric around the mean.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.190
And that's why they
call it two-sided.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.310
It would be one-sided if it
was kind of a cumulative

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.990
percentage up to some
critical threshold.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.600
But in this case, it's
two-sided, we're symmetric.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.970
Or another way to think
about it is we're

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.200
excluding the two sides.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.490
So we want the 95%
in the middle.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:33.370
And this is a sampling
distribution of the sample

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.780
mean for n is equal to 7.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.210
And I won't go into the details
here, but when n is

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.330
equal to 7 you have 6 degrees
of freedom, or n minus 1.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.110
And the way that t-tables are
set up, you go and find the

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.030
degrees of freedom.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.710
So you don't go to the n,
you go to the n minus 1.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.560
So you go to the 6 right here.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.650
So if you want to encapsulate
95% of this right over here,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.090
and you have an n of 6, you
have to go 2.447 standard

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.060
deviations in each direction.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.520
And this t-table assumes that
you are approximating that

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.980
standard deviation using your
sample standard deviation.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.680
So another way to think of it
you have to go 2.447 of these

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.850
approximated standard
deviations.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.880
Let me it right here.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:28.380
So you have to go 2.447-- this
distance right here is 2.447

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.455
times this approximated
standard deviation.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.060
And sometimes you'll see this
in some statistics book.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.330
This thing right here,
this exact number,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.580
is shown like this.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.570
They put a little hat on top of
the standard deviation to

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.140
show that it has been
approximated using the sample

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.040
standard deviation.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.380
So we'll put a little hat over
here, because frankly, this is

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.770
the only thing that
we can calculate.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.680
So this is how far you have
to go in each direction.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.880
And we know what
this value is.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.960
We know what the sample
distribution is.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.400
So let's get our
calculator out.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:17.040
So we know our sample standard
deviation is 1.04.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.120
And we want to divide that
by the square root of 7.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.010
So we get 0.39.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:36.140
So this right here is 0.39.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.720
And so if we want to find
the distance around this

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.820
population mean that
encapsulates 95% of the

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.070
population or of the sampling
distribution, we have to

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:51.330
multiply 0.39 times 2.447,
so let's do that.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:09:01.130
So times 2.447 is
equal to 0.96.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:10.090
So this is equal to-- so this
distance right here is 0.96,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.810
and then this distance
right here is 0.96.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.290
So if you take a random sample,
and that's exactly

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.690
what we did when we found
these 7 samples.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.880
When we took these 7 samples and
took their mean, that mean

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.680
can be viewed as a random
sample from the sampling

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.780
distribution.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.560
And so the probability, and so
we can view it, we could say

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.440
that there's a 95% chance-- and
we have to actually caveat

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.340
everything with a confident,
because we're doing all of

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.010
these estimations here.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.720
So it's not a true precise
95% chance.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.870
We're just confident that
there's a 95% chance that our

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.840
random population, our random
sampling mean right here, so

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.870
that 2.34, which we can kind of
use-- we just picked that

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.790
2.34 from this distribution
right here.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:12.160
So there's a 95% chance that
2.34 is within 0.96 of the

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.940
true sampling distribution mean,
which we know is also

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.370
the same thing as the
population mean.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.360
Or we can just rearrange the
sentence and say that there is

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.400
a 95% chance that the mean, the
true mean, which is the

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.770
same thing as a sampling
distribution mean, is within

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.420
0.96 of our sample
mean, of 2.34.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:52.460
So at the low end, so if you go
2.36 minus-- if you go 2.34

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.100
minus 0.96-- that's the low
end of our confidence

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.590
interval, 1.38.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.830
And the high end of our
confidence interval, 2.34 plus

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.260
0.96 is equal to 3.3.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.610
So our 95% confidence interval
is from 1.38 to 3.3.
