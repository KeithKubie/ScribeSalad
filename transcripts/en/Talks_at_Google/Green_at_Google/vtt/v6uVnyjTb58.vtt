VALERA ZAKHAROV: Hello, welcome
to our Green At Google

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.310
and Authors At Google
Talk Series.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.010
My name is Valera Zakharov.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.800
And today, we have a pretty
uncomfortably exciting talk

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.440
for you today.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.370
We have with us, a local
San Francisco-based

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.150
author, Ozzie Zehner.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.090
And the book is called
"Green Illusions--

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720
The Dirty Secrets of Clean
Energy and the Future of

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.170
Environmentalism." And the book
has been causing shock

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.810
waves, as "The Sunday Times"
reported recently.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600
And it's been pretty eye
opening actually, and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.290
interesting to follow some of
the debates raging out there

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.570
on various internet resources.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.570
Meanwhile, Ozzie has been
busy with his book tour.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
So he's done a lot of
appearances on environmental

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.770
segments, some of which would
have been featured on CNN,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.740
PBS, BBC, and Public Radio.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.230
When he's not on the road, Ozzie
is a visiting scholar at

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.970
the University of California,
Berkeley, where he researches

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.360
the social, political, and
economic conditions

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.670
influencing energy policy

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.980
priorities and project outcomes.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.010
I'm also proud to say that
Ozzie a fellow engineer.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.860
He has an engineering degree
from Kettering University and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.150
a graduate degree in science and
technology from University

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.200
of Amsterdam.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590
Before we get started, let
me do a little poll.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.700
How many of you guys own
an electric or a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.400
hybrid vehicle here?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.520
So that's great, because Ozzie
is not planning to talk about

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.990
that part of the book today.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.210
But I think it's going to
be a pretty relevant

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.550
talk to all of us.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.290
We at Google are committed to
building a sustainable future,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.930
both as individuals
and as a company.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.030
And at the same time, we love
and we believe in technology.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.170
So with that in mind, actually
Ozzie told me that he's really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.660
looking forward to our
perspective and so he's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.650
looking forward to your
questions and feedback at the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.400
end of this talk.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.650
So without taking any more time
away from that Q&amp;A, I

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.460
would like to welcome to Google,
the author of "Green

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.710
Illusions," Ozzie Zehner.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.740
OZZIE ZEHNER: Thank you
very much, Valera.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.120
And thank you very much all
of you for coming today.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.170
I really appreciate it.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.820
And thank you for those tuning
in online as well.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.830
I'm going to speak for about a
half an hour and then take

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.810
questions and answers.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.170
So I know you're all very busy,
so if you want to leave

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.910
after the talk, that's fine.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080
If it's that bad, you can
leave during the talk.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.730
This is not going to be a
lecture about how we must

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.340
think or how we must talk.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.240
Rather, I'm going to consider
how we might think and talk

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.430
differently about our
energy challenges.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.170
Now, you will all be designing
the built and conceptual

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.660
environment that we live in.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.360
And as such, I suspect you will
be answering a lot of the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.840
questions that I'm
struggling with.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.990
And so the story we
will lay bare

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.460
today is far from settled.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.870
And it really is my hope that
you will help complete it.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.550
So let's get started.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.350
The premise of my book, "Green
Illusions," is essentially

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.190
that green technologies are
not what they seem.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.040
They might not be what
you think they are.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.950
They might not be the saviors
that they're made out to be.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.310
And I argue that alternative
energy technologies rely on a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.200
way of legacy thinking.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.400
But anyway, I'm getting
ahead of myself.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.710
So I wanted to start actually
with a little

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.495
bit about my history.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.920
I wasn't always a green energy
questioner, I guess.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.370
It actually was just
the opposite.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.720
And I once founded and
operated a vertically

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.040
integrated wind power operation
in Michigan, when I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.910
was 12 years old.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.600
And I was very stylish
at that time.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.020
And I ran my short-lived wind
power operation out of my

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.220
parents' house.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.250
And behind our house was a
garage, and inside that garage

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.430
was a turbine, thanks to my
dad's job at an industrial fan

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.090
manufacturer.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.600
And I found a rusty steel pipe
to kind of use as an axle.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.680
And I had to build a kind
of a wooden frame.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.380
My parents had neglected to
teach me to weld, so I had to

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.710
go with wood.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.060
And I also had not secured any
funding for a tower and so I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.779
used a picnic table.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.380
And then one windy day, I hauled
the contraption out,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.480
onto the picnic table.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.260
I lifted it up on there.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.580
I weighed it down with bricks,
inserted the turbine assembly.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.770
And there was very little time
to appreciate my work, because

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.220
it started spinning,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.530
uncomfortably fast, very rapidly.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.170
And at that point, it had become
apparent that I had

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.330
neglected to install a
braking mechanism.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.170
So I grabbed a brick and I
shoved it against the axle.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.640
And it was like sparking
and hissing.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.730
And the steel sails just
effortlessly accumulated

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.400
greater speed.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.000
And in a sense, I had created
an upended lawn mower, that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.370
was kind of thumping with
an increasing rhythm.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.090
And at first, the frame was
vibrating and then the whole

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.980
picnic table started
vibrating.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.060
And really what happened

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.880
thereafter can only be deduced.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.800
Because by that time, my
adrenaline-filled legs had

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.260
already carried me halfway
around the house.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.200
But when I returned,
I found an empty

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.450
picnic table, in flames.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.910
So this was the first of many
failures in my life, actually.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.210
There was another one,
we don't have to go

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.780
through all of them.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.300
But what I was 17, I build a
hybrid electric car, that also

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.970
ran on natural gas.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.260
And it was not very fast.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.530
I'm pretty sure it
was not safe.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.980
And it got stranded in the halls
of my high school and so

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.660
forth, but not before I got a
photo op with the local paper.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.800
And after that, I went to
engineering school.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.890
And I worked in green tech in
Europe for several years.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.210
And when I moved back to the
United States, I decided to

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.670
start a green architectural firm
in a historic district of

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.980
Washington, DC.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.090
One of my first clients was a
diplomat, who wanted to live

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.740
in a solar house.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.180
And of course, I loved
solar cells, so it

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.640
seemed like a good fit.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.880
And he already had
the building.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.000
It was this 100-year-old house
that had seen better days.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.480
And about the same time the
house was built, someone had

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.790
planted two oak trees on the
western side of the house.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.090
By the way, would anyone like to
guess why they planted the

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.160
oak trees there?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.500
AUDIENCE: To block
solar cells.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.050
OZZIE ZEHNER: To block solar--

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.064
this guy's thinking ahead.

00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:31.010
AUDIENCE: Privacy.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.940
OZZIE ZEHNER: Privacy.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.200
I heard a lot of people
say shade.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.740
I think you're absolutely
right, for all of these

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.540
reasons probably.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.890
Well, actually I have no idea.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.870
I wasn't there 100 years
ago to witness who

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.510
exactly planted the trees.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.700
But I can guess that that
was probably the reason.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.010
But regardless, these
trees were great.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.020
Because they blocked
the summer sun.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.840
And in the winter, the leaves
would fall off and they will

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.640
allow the Sun to shine through
the branches and warm the

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.440
home's exterior.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.780
And this kind of passive solar
technology is eons old.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.960
So as a result, the annual
utility bills for this house

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.760
were thousands of dollars less
than a house that was just

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.450
down the street that
was brand new.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.520
And these trees had been
doing this every

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.140
year, for 100 years.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.680
And as a green architect,
my first job was

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.960
to chop them down.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.620
And the solar cells demanded it,
as this man pointed out.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.660
You can't put solar cells on
the roof of a shaded house.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.670
And I would soon find out that
this was first of many demands

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.805
that the solar cells
would make.

00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:35.630
And demand number two, was
for lots of money.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.770
And if you read anything about
solar cells these days, you'll

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.290
likely be left with the
impression that solar cell

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.730
costs are dropping and
the price curve looks

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.710
something like this.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.560
But over the past decade, the
installed cost of solar cells

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.810
actually looked like this.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.010
So why is there such
a discrepancy?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.930
Well, part of the reason has
to do with subsidies.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.550
Subsidies give the illusion of a
price drop, when really just

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.060
someone else is paying for it.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.150
But there's a little bit more
to the story than that.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.300
Journalists, for instance,
point to the price of

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.660
polysilicon and the technical
components of solar cells.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.230
And indeed, those costs
are dropping.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.280
But polysilicon for instance,
represents just a fifth of the

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.950
cost of an installed
solar system.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.860
The bulk of a solar system is
low tech things like copper,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.070
glass, aluminum, framing,
transportation, installation.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.240
You'd still have to pay for
all of those, even if the

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.260
price of polysilicon were
to drop to zero.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.440
And so those things get pretty
expensive, especially when you

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.030
start getting into things like
the rare earth metals and

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.320
heavy metals, which incidentally
brings us to our

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.790
next demand of solar cells, is
that they require some pretty

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.880
toxic stuff.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.280
Now, solar cell manufacturing
involves the use or release of

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.560
numerous compounds explosive,
compounds and toxic, compounds

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.190
like the cell here, which
contains cadmium, like most

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.760
thin-film technologies, which
the EPA recognize as a toxin.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.230
Now, what happens with this
at the end of its life?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.730
If we incinerate this, it goes
up into the air and eventually

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.810
into the waterways.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.655
And if we bury it, then
it can leak in

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:20.210
the groundwater supplies.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.520
And not very much of this
is biodegradable.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.880
So today, that's
not a big deal.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.820
Solar cell generation is tiny.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.730
In fact, the supplies is
less than 1/10 of 1%

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.560
of America's power.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.950
If this bucket represented US
energy consumption, then this

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.560
is what the solar cell share
would look like.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.490
Now as social production
grows, then so will the

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.180
associated side effects.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.010
But to my dismay, the demands
of the solar cells did not

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.510
stop there.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.630
The United Arab Emirates
recently conducted one of the

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.270
largest cross-comparison tests
of solar technologies to date.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.970
And they did so because they
were building this

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.040
eco-metropolis called
Masdar City.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.940
You might have heard of it.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.760
For this test, they gathered a
whole lot of solar cells from

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.450
a lot of different
manufacturers.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.000
And their goal was to find which
manufacturer had the

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.670
best solar cell.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.320
But once this test begin, it
drew attention to something

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.840
else, which was the
disadvantages and limitations

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.540
that all of the solar cells
shared in common.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.770
So a desert might seem
like the best place

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.530
to put a solar cell.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.570
And indeed, it's one
of the best.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.390
But there were problems.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.150
The first was haze and humidity,
which reflect and

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.340
disperse the Sun's rays.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.100
The next was dust, which
technicians had to scrape off

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.730
almost daily.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.610
And in other parts of the world,
you have to deal with

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.640
pollution, hail, snow, ice,
these sorts of factors.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.330
And the third was heat.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.120
So right in the middle of the
day when the solar cells

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.800
should have been producing their
highest output, they got

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.070
incredibly hot, which hobbled
their output across the board.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.260
Now, in addition
to all of these

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.970
effects, solar cells age.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.720
And their output fades
by about 1% a year.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.340
The newer technologies degrade
even more rapidly than that.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.850
But an even larger surprise
awaits solar cell owners.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.970
After about five to 10 years,
their solar array will

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.590
suddenly stop producing power.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.260
And that's because a key
component of the solar system,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.970
the inverter, will
eventually fail.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.130
Now, solar cells can last
20 to 30 years,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:20.930
something like that.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.370
But inverters don't.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.660
The inverters have to be
replaced about two to five

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.850
times during the life
of a solar system.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.590
This is by the way, what
one looks like.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.170
Fortunately, any electrician
can easily swap

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.760
one of these out.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.580
But unfortunately, each
one costs about

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.550
the same as a furnace.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.525
And incidentally, there's one
more reason I'll mention why a

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:41.490
solar array can stop working.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.550
This is Glenda Hoffman's roof.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.170
She woke up one morning to
discover that thieves stole 16

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.650
panels off her roof
as she slept.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.790
And in fact, solar thefts are
on the rise nationally.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.090
And the cost to replace her
system chimed in at about

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.580
$95,000, an expense that her
insurance company covered.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.740
But nevertheless, she
intends to protect

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.900
the new panels herself.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:09.460
And this is what you told
the "New York Times."

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.465
Now, a lot of people say that
these demands are worth it.

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:19.470
If solar power yields less CO2
than fossil fuel power, then

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.430
does this offer justification
for subsidizing solar cells?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.720
Well, first we have
to consider costs.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.170
Even some of the most expensive
options for dealing

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.270
with CO2 would become cost
competitive long before

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.700
today's solar technologies,
making solar cells perhaps

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.350
seem like a rather wasteful
strategy.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.210
Why would we for instance
mitigate one ton of CO2 using

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.920
solar, when we could mitigate
five tons or 10 tons elsewhere

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.490
for the same cost?

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.130
Secondly, solar cell
manufacturing involves the use

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.500
or release of other types
of greenhouse gases.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.290
And these are used to
make solar cells.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.950
And they make CEO
seem harmless.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.490
These greenhouse gases are
10,000 to 25,000 times more

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.290
potent than CO2, according
to the IPCC.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:13.100
And we are now learning that
one of the fastest growing

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.140
emitters of these gases is
the solar cell industry.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.840
So I was in the position
of having to explain

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.740
all this to my client.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.810
And I didn't really know
where to start.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.560
But I had to like list
off these demands.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.260
I mean they demanded that
we retrofit the

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.290
roof, first of all.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.490
They demanded that we purchase
lots of insurance.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.150
The solar cells demanded
regular cleaning.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.610
They demanded expensive
inverters

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.720
every five to 10 years.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.070
They demanded a lot of money.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.520
They demanded an expensive
funeral.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.200
They demanded to be buried in
a specially sealed, toxic

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.820
waste plot.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.580
And of course, they demanded
that those pesky trees would

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.940
have to be chopped down.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.170
Now, think for a moment what
would you have done if you are

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.270
in my position?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.220
What would you have advised
my client to do?

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.140
Well, here's what the
numbers looked like.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.560
For every $100 he spent on solar
panels, he would produce

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.840
this much energy.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.870
For every $100 that he spent
on LED lighting, he

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.420
would save this much.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.210
The value of the trees, the
added insulation, and the

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.500
efficient appliances would
be even greater.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.590
In the end, I advised him
against a solar cell

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.350
installation.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.900
And instead, told him that he
should keep the trees and

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.380
spend the money on energy
efficiency and energy

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.060
reduction techniques.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.540
And the long story short
is that I was fired.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.360
And that's because he had
already made his decision.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.310
The solar cells were
going to stay.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.330
And the trees, well--

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.090
Now, my experience
was not unique.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.640
For instance, an old grove north
of here was chopped down

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.400
to install solar cells.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.430
And the oil company BP, chopped
down 42,000 trees

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.370
outside Brookhaven National
Laboratories for solar.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.190
And the oil--

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.360
a company, not an oil company,
but another company in New

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.920
Jersey, took down about five
acres of trees to build a

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.640
solar array that would power a
facility to make plastic bags.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.030
I kind of think that
puts a new spin on

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.740
paper versus plastic.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.140
Again, we might think
it's worth it to

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.890
offset dirty coal use.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.920
But it's important to note
that none of these solar

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.700
projects will offset the CO2
debt from clear-cutting the

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.640
forests that they sit
on, for reasons we

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.100
will come to shortly.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.920
The solar cells also will not
replace the other benefits of

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.760
the forests, such as things
like air cleansing, water

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:55.000
filtration, and trails,
and other benefits.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.560
But the fate of these trees is
ultimately a casualty of a

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.300
certain way of thinking, a
presumption that the way to

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.320
solve our energy problems is
to produce more energy.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.440
The ethical implications of this
remind me of a movie that

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.750
I just saw last month, a classic
film, "2001, A Space

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.850
Odyssey." Has anyone here
seen the movie?

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.880
Oh, wow.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.590
Let the record show that
almost every one

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.580
raised their hand.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.590
So you might remember a
computer named Hal.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.960
Hal was programmed to carry
out a certain mission.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.970
And he followed that mission
without consideration of the

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.860
changes around him or
respect for human

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.080
life, as it turns out.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.850
Hal thought if the astronauts
are endangering the mission,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.020
then turn off their
life support.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.880
If the trees are blocking
the solar cells, then

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.080
chop down the trees.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.640
This is a kind of
mission-directed ethical trap

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.150
that we sometimes fall into
because we're human.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.870
And that's typically because we
think we have a good idea,

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.020
a good sense of our
ethical bearings.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.910
And our job is to apply them
to our daily life.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.240
But as you all know, ethics can
often be more than that.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.487
You'll recognize this
motto, I'm sure.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.950
Now as you all know, Google
ventured into China, for

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:26.609
instance, to expand its mission
of bringing more

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.510
information to more people.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.100
But in order to expand its
mission, it was required to

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.240
censor search results.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.190
Now, Google refused to censor
the search results.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.510
And this is a good example of
how ethical reasoning is more

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.030
than just applying our
ideals to the world.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.780
It's more than just a mission.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.000
It also involves looking at the
world, seeing what we can

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.990
see, and then letting
those visions

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.600
inform our ethical thoughts.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.300
But there's a lot that
can get in the way.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.990
For instance, when I spoke with
my client, I made the

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.710
mistake of thinking that the
facts could speak for

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.190
themselves.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.510
I made a mistake of thinking
that my crude calculations

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.340
would be enough.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.300
But this wasn't about
the facts.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.060
This was about something else.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.120
Now, we've been told that
solar cells are clean.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.110
And we know the energy from
the Sun is limitless.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.770
And we've been promised that
they will be cheap.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.160
And we've been seduced
by solar cells.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.380
And this isn't the first time
that this has happened.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.600
For generations, our energy
bucket has been leaking.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.490
And the leaks here represent
energy waste.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.710
And in the United States,
most energy does nothing

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.450
productive at all.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.700
It just leaks out, according to
the Department of Energy.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.290
But that's not all, the leaky
bucket is also getting larger.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.510
And that's because we
love cheap energy.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.830
Politicians subsidize
energy production.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.280
And when cheap energy is
available, demand of course

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.930
goes up, because people
want more of it.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.160
And so it brings us right back
to where we started, with

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.910
so-called insufficient supply.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.960
And this applies to alternative
energy, as well.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.050
And in fact, there is no
evidence that alternative

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:21.070
energy offsets fossil fuel
use in the United States.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.440
I know that doesn't seem
to make sense at first.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.300
But consider the expansion of
hydropower and nuclear power.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.730
They would both presumably
decrease coal use.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.690
As recently as 1950 in fact,
hydropower filled a third of

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.040
the nation's electrical grid.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.250
That's hard to imagine today.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.180
But they did not quench
increasing demand.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.880
And demand increased.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.190
And the United States met that
demand by building more fossil

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.290
fuel plants, not fewer.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.550
Today, hydropower fills just
7% of the electrical grid.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.600
This is a boomerang effect.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.980
The harder we throw energy
into the grid, the harder

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.150
demand comes around and
hit us on the head.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.930
So larger solar cells and taller
wind turbines are just

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.030
ways of throwing the energy
boomerang harder.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.960
And in fact, the history of
energy in this country is very

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.580
much a story of throwing the
energy boomerang harder.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.370
Long ago, whale oil was
considered to be clean, cheap,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.140
and limitless.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.160
I mean one whale might contain
three tons of oil.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.050
Who could want more than that?

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.710
And we poured into
the leaky bucket.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.440
And eventually, whales
were in short supply.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.520
And they were expensive.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.820
But explorers had found
something better.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.120
Their fossil fuels were cheap,
they were cleaner than whale

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.010
oil, and as any driller could
tell you, they were limitless.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.590
But that was still not enough
for the leaky bucket.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.540
And physicists had found
something else.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.630
Nuclear power was clean, it was

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.770
cheap, and it was limitless.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.230
Well, of course that
turned out not to

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.750
be the entire story.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.540
But the bucket was still growing
and really leaking.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.570
Which brings us to the next.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.610
Now, there are ways to stop
the boomerang effect.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.350
And there are ways to lower
fossil fuel demand and we'll

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.490
consider those soon.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.000
But first I have a
few questions for

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.330
you about this bucket.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:43.430
What amount of solar energy
would fill this bucket?

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.190
Will this much do it?

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.940
What if we double or triple
the solar cells

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.770
in the United States?

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.525
I mean it would be possible.

00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:53.000
It would cost a lot of money,
but it's possible.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.530
What if we multiply solar cells
by a 100, which would

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.070
incidentally bankrupt the
federal government.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.790
And then we added in 10,000
utility scale wind turbines,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.790
would that fill the bucket?

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.620
Or will it fuel the bucket's
growth and make us even more

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.860
reliant on fossil fuels?

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.750
Now, common knowledge presumes
that we have a choice between

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.960
fossil fuels and green energy.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.990
But alternative energy
technologies rely on fossil

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.320
fuels through every stage
of their life cycle.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.110
Most importantly, alternative
energy financing relies

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.820
ultimately on the kind of
economic growth that fossil

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.470
fuels provide.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.880
Alternative energy technologies
rely on fossil

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.010
fuels for raw material
extraction, for fabrication,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:51.360
for installation and
maintenance, for backup, as

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.400
well as decommissioning
and disposal.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.755
And at this point there's even
a larger question, where will

00:22:58.755 --> 00:23:03.450
we get the energy to build the
next generation of wind power

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.990
and solar cells?

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.820
Wind is renewable, but
turbines are not.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.600
And although alternative energy
technologies rely on

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.670
fossil fuels, they
are in essence a

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.130
product of fossil fuels.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.860
They thrive within economic
systems that are themselves

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.650
reliant on fossil fuels.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.090
Now, I'm no fan of
fossil fuels.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.840
Fossil fuel are finite.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.370
They're dirty.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.770
But we use them for five
principal reasons.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.090
Fossil fuels our dense.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.590
Their energy is storable,
portable, fungible, which

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.690
means they can easily
trade it.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.460
And they are transformable
into other products, like

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.160
pesticides, fertilizers,
and plastics.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.530
Now, these qualities cannot
be measured in kilowatts.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:57.730
So what happens when we spend
our precious fossil fuels on

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.590
building alternative energy?

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.450
Well, then we get energy that
is not dense, but diffuse.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.360
It's not easily storable.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.820
It's not portable.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.400
It's not fungible.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.160
And it is nontransformable.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.170
Now, to increase the quality of
the energy we then have to

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.900
spend more fossil fuels to
build batteries, to build

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.680
back-up power plants, and
other infrastructure.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.000
And of course, this is
incredibly expensive.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.120
And ultimately, that expense
represents the hidden fossil

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.230
fuels behind the scene.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.540
Now, there's an impression that
clean energy can supply a

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.830
growing population of
high consumers.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.280
There's an impression that
alternative energy can

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.780
displace fossil fuel use.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.170
But the evidence doesn't
show that.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.000
Now before I move on, I should
mention at this point in the

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.650
story, my architectural
firm is toast.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.780
It's gone.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.830
But luckily, I'm somewhat geeky
and willing to spend a

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.110
long time in front
of a computer.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.870
I don't think I'm the only
person here that fits that

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.120
description.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.580
And when gas prices rose from
2003 to 2008, they shot up.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.750
You might remember that.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.310
Then I stayed safely
in a library.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.940
And as part of my academic
research, I studied a data set

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.970
of 50,000 articles that were
written over that period of

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.030
time when the energy prices
were going up.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.360
For every doubling in oil
prices, coverage of solar wind

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.265
and biofuels shot up 400%.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.920
But I also looked at energy
reduction strategies, things

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.230
like home insulation, light
rail, LED bulbs.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.280
We've witnessed the impressive
pay0ff of these technologies

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.690
and so we might expect the
coverage of these technologies

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.300
to also be relatively high.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.390
But this is what the media
coverage looked like.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.330
And this was not just
a media phenomenon.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.450
Does anyone recognize
this building?

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.040
It's quite a ways from here.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.860
This is a green building in
Chicago's Millennium Park.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.710
And to be a green building,
the architects might have

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.330
superinsulated the building,
but they didn't.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.390
They used glass, which allows
the building to bake in the

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.420
summer and lose heat
in the winter.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.050
They might have outfitted
the building with

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.100
energy efficient lighting.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.890
But they didn't do
that either.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.000
They might have incorporated
overhangs to block the high

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.420
summer Sun, but allow the
winter Sun to shine in.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.380
Or they might have used light
shelves to toss more light

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.880
into building's interior.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.170
But they did none of things.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.490
This building is a green
building because

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.710
it has solar cells.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.350
The California Academy of
Sciences, just up the road

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.540
from here, has solar cells
in one of the foggiest

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.090
microclimates on Earth.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.750
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation
has solar cells that are

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.730
partly shaded by the
structure itself.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.050
This BP station has solar
cells and some don't

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.540
even face the Sun.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.580
There are solar cells right here
in Mountain View, being

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.520
consecrated in this photo.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.110
They also don't face the Sun.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.280
In fact, none of these buildings
has solar cells that

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.930
face the Sun.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.200
But you see, that doesn't
really matter.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.730
Because these architects were
not building buildings to be

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.470
energy efficient.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.570
They were not building buildings
to reduce fossil

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.300
fuel years.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.190
They were building temples.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.190
They were building temples to
technology, temples to solar

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.720
energy, temples to the idea
that the way to solve our

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.750
energy problems is to
produce more energy.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:35.780
Now, consider for a moment that
solar cells were a puppy.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.720
So maybe a [INAUDIBLE], maybe
a furball like this one.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.260
If solar cells were a puppy, I
imagine that this is kind of

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.160
what they would look like, not
real big, not real smart, but

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.290
super cute.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.520
And we all like to take
solar for a walk.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.800
And academics get grants for
walking solar, industry gets

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.210
good PR for walking solar,
government enjoys being out

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:57.920
with solar as well.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.145
And when elections roll around,
all the more reason to

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:02.190
take solar out for a stroll.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.450
And media likes to walk solar
and so does the public.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.260
Well maybe, depending
on their political

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.460
affiliation these days.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.140
But even I'm fascinated
by solar.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.560
And I'm not the only person
here that is.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.180
And sometimes being just a
puppy, solar gets tired.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.710
But there's always someone
around to pick solar up and

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.490
keep going.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.290
Even if it's just to walk to the
park and walk in circles.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:34.130
Now, let's consider a walk
with energy reduction.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.535
Now reduction is a huge dog,
with a lot of potential as we

00:28:36.535 --> 00:28:40.100
have seen, although walks with
reduction, differ from walks

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.010
with solar.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:47.550
Reduction's walks include many
more stops to pee, which is

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.220
made up all that more difficult
without the trees.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.050
So why go for walks with
reduction, when the walks with

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.570
solar are so much more fun?

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.860
And that's what we need
to understand.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.080
We need to understand and figure
out ways to organize

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.000
walks with reduction that are
more fun and interest all of

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.720
the dog walkers.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.700
And that's going to be
a lot more exciting

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.150
than you might think.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.940
For instance, how might
we plug the leaks

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.510
in that energy bucket?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.280
I'd like to consider for
a moment, junk mail.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.790
The junk mail industry claims
100 million trees a year,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.200
which producers must grow, cut,
haul, process, print, and

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.930
then ship to homes, where they
are usually immediately thrown

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.620
away, hauled, processed,
and finally dumped.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.330
Now, one study equates the
energy bill of the cycle to 11

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.490
coal-fired power plants running
continuously around

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.600
the clock, at full tilt.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.890
And all of these power plants
go to power something that

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.500
most people don't even like.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.310
So in Germany, this
is what they did.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.970
They created this little
sticker that says no

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.890
thanks to junk mail.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.250
And I have one right here.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.380
And this sticker in Germany
is legally binding.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.420
So most Germans choose
to put this stick

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.890
around their mailbox.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:11.900
In the United States, these
stickers would help to patch a

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.420
small hole in our
energy bucket.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.970
And you might think that's
no big deal.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.900
It's just junk mail.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.410
And in fact, it probably isn't
really that big of a deal.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.820
But it's important to point out
that these stickers would

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.690
have a greater energy impact
than all of the nation's solar

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.130
cells, planned and existing
combined.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.040
We don't have an
energy crisis.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.290
We have a consumption crisis.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.200
And a lot of that consumption
goes toward things that don't

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.080
make us any happier
or healthier.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.070
Let's consider the growth
of that bucket.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.330
Much of this results from

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.010
unsustainable population growth.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.370
But how can we achieve and
ethically achieve a

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.010
sustainable population without
infringing on the reproductive

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.767
rights of individuals?

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:04.900
Now, we know that women who
are entitled to civil and

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.290
economic rights, who are in
control of their own bodies,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.810
can enjoy the freedom of bearing
children at their own

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:14.900
rate, at a pace that
is actually

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.710
perfectly sustainable overall.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.810
But consider this chart in
the United States showing

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.705
pregnancy and abortion rates.

00:31:22.705 --> 00:31:26.680
Oh, so this is the population
chart of pregnancy and

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.600
abortion rates in several
countries.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.780
A girl growing up in the United
States is four times

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780
more likely to become
pregnant than a girl

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.580
growing up in France.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.390
And an American girl is three
times more likely to have an

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.370
abortion than a girl growing
up in France.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.090
And among industrialized
nations, America's teens are

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.740
the least likely to use birth
control due to stigma, lack of

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.830
health care, and high costs.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.530
And we are now treading in
territory where environmental

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.250
and social problems converge.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:04.630
And that is a vast unexplored
wilderness.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.170
Lowering teen pregnancy rates
would greatly benefit the

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:08.960
nation's girls.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.090
There's no doubt about that.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.870
The energy and environmental
benefits could be a welcome

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.720
side effect.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.780
So how do we stop the growth
of the bucket?

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.870
Solar cells, wind turbines,
and biofuels can't do it.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.630
Health care and human
rights can.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.330
And as unlikely as it may seem,
universal health care

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.000
would have a greater energy
impact than all of the

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.830
nation's solar cells, wind
turbines, biofuels, and

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.790
geothermal combined.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.450
And it would cost less too,
a lot less in fact.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.200
In fact, none of these proposals
cost much money.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.800
None of these proposals leads to
lower standards of living,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.140
just the opposite actually.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.360
And while they are not high
tech, they rely on the same

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.680
foundations of human ingenuity
and creativity.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.080
The real clean energy
is less energy.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.300
But this is a shift in the way
of thinking that is not

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.710
available to many people,
because you cannot see energy

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.600
savings in the same way you
can see and even worship a

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.320
solar cell.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.090
I set out to build
a solar house.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:24.030
But what I did not initially
see, what I failed to

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.870
recognize, was that this shabby
house with its two oak

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.285
trees was already
a solar house.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.920
Alternative energy fetishes have
so greatly consumed the

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.940
public imagination, but the
most vital, endurable

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.790
solutions go overlooked
and underfunded.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.220
But therein lies the opportunity
for you.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.430
You may be asked to think of
environmental solutions in

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.920
terms of energy production.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.310
Perhaps you already have.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.190
And when that happens, you might
be willing to think, or

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.680
ask, is that part
of the solution

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.010
or part of the problem?

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.219
If we are to understand the
ethics of alternative energy

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.780
technologies, then we must
first see what they do.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.239
Alternative energy technologies

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.199
don't clean the air.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.840
They don't clean the water.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.530
They don't protect wildlife.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.750
They don't support
human rights.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.179
They don't improve
neighborhoods.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:24.449
Alternative energy
technologies do

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.730
not strengthen democracy.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.380
They do not regulate
themselves.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.719
They do not reduce
consumption.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.830
They don't reduce atmospheric
carbon dioxide.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:36.139
They don't stop the leaky
bucket from growing.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:40.030
Alternative energy technologies
produce power.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.960
And we generally associate
more power with greater

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.949
prosperity.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:47.770
But in fact, if we look to the
world's 10 happiest countries,

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:53.480
they use less energy than
Americans do, 40% less.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.810
So these happy countries value
things like architectural

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.630
techniques that make buildings
more efficient and

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.760
comfortable.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.700
They also prioritize walking,
biking, and public transit.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.280
And finally, successful regions
value human rights and

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.000
health care.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.670
In contrast, alternative energy
technologies yield low

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.270
quality energy and they
rely on fossil fuels.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.460
They also create a host of
negative side effects.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.870
But they don't always only rely
on fossil fuels, they are

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.380
based on fossil fuels, from
their financing, to their

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.720
decommissioning, and eventual
replacement.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.260
Alternative energy technologies
are essentially

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.050
rebranded fossil fuels.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.765
Now, what will people think
about alternative energy 10

00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.296
years from now?

00:35:43.296 --> 00:35:47.720
Will they think of alternative
energies as clean or will they

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.680
see them as the next round of
ecological disaster issues.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.480
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.860
I don't claim to know
all the answers.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.870
I'm just another member of the
search party, like you.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.580
But it certainly seems
that there are a lot

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.230
of unanswered questions.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.470
In fact, it actually seems
that there are a lot of

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.180
unasked questions.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.130
And by asking the hard
questions, you will be better

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.990
prepared than anyone else to
address the rocky times ahead.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.690
And as energy prices become more
volatile, you will have

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:19.460
the conceptual tools to
make a difference.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.160
You will find your skills
to be sought after.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.570
In fact, they will
become necessary.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.710
It's not a question of whether
or not we have the technology

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.730
to create an alternative
energy society.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.840
The real question
is the reverse.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.550
Do we have a society that is
capable of being powered by

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.990
alternative energy?

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.560
And the answer today
is clearly no.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.480
The bucket has too many leaks
and it's still growing.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.500
But we can change that.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.330
As the illusions surrounding
alternative energy

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:54.100
technologies continue to unravel
over the coming years,

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.650
you will have some
choices to make.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.200
Will you remain rigid in
your defense of the

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.250
green legacy empire?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.460
Will you turn off the life
support in order to protect

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.040
the illusory mission?

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.710
Or perhaps you will adapt your
thinking to the larger

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.120
challenges that we face.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.030
Or maybe you will go beyond that
adaptation and anticipate

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.220
those challenges and be an
innovator in the next green

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.140
movement, a green movement
that is not simply a

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.300
receptacle for energy
firms and car

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.440
companies to plug into.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.310
A green movement that looks
beyond the eco-gadgets on the

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.060
stage, to consider the social
and environmental injustices

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.190
behind the curtain.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.210
Clean energy is less energy.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.250
And the future of energy will
not be a story of wind

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.920
turbines, solar cells,
and biofuels.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.310
It will be a story of livable
communities, improved

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.250
governance, health care,
and human rights.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.870
And it is not enough to say
that we would benefit by

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.700
shifting our focus.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.530
Our relevance, your relevance,
may very well depend on it.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:09.780
Thank you very much.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.550
First, thanks tremendously
for your talk and for

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.670
writing this book.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.720
Google's [INAUDIBLE] energy
issues have been on the

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.540
website called The Oil Drum for
many years, where we are

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.430
commonly referring to
alternatives as fossil fuel

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:37.500
extenders, not replacements.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.140
So thank you very much.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.490
I look forward to giving your
book to other people to help

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.210
them, educate them.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.980
But I would like to
ask a somewhat

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.810
personal energy issue.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.720
I'm building a home right now.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.580
We're in the rural part of
the island of Hawaii.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.400
A grid connect is extremely
expensive,

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.990
prohibitively expensive.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:07.310
And even then, the grid is like
70% naphtha burning or

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.520
something like that.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:16.400
So I can do obvious things, like
LED bulbs and the like.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.180
And in fact, the fact that I'm
choosing not to use propane

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.000
for most of my say hot water
needs, whatever, is viewed as

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.050
insane by the status quo, all
the electricians and plumbers

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.300
you might be able to
hire anywhere.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.360
And now, my concept of using
solar for hot water, which is

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.570
limiting solar for solar
electric, has just been shot

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.090
down in flames by your
presentation.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.160
Have you got any advice?

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.970
I'm not alone in this.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:46.370
There tens of thousands
of us off grid in the

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.550
western United States.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.190
OZZIE ZEHNER: Sure.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.860
I'd be happy to comment on it.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.910
Obviously, my research is in the
larger social scale and in

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.270
political context, not in
individual projects.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.860
So I can't really make that
much of a comment on that.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:08.670
But I can say that it probably
doesn't really matter.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:13.880
Because if it's a vacation home
or a home on the Hawaiian

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.970
island and it's far away from
civilization and is

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.770
disconnected from the grid,
there is probably no way you

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.420
can make that green.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.610
So I mean that's just an
unfortunate kind of reality.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.460
I mean unless you were to move
there and sell all your

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.510
possessions and just eating the
food that falls off the

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.310
trees in your yard.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:35.460
And of course, this is
the problem that

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.340
everyone runs into.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.630
None of us can really make
our lives totally green.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.540
And so that's why I feel that
we need to concentrate on

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.800
those ways of moving forward
that bring a lot of people and

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.960
bring a lot of interest in.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.540
And actually when we look there,
when we start to look

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.110
and think about solutions in
those terms, we find out that

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.270
a lot of the solutions don't
really decrease living

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.390
standards and require
sacrifice.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.750
They just require coming
back to basics.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.200
If you were at buildings, that
might be the basics of solar

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.150
insulation and using passive
solar techniques.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.180
And if you're considering the
larger scale, things like

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.600
health care, like I discussed
in the talk, would have

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.390
massive benefits for the
environment and for human

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.970
population.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.160
So they are not always
against one another.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.070
The two can work together.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:26.490
And that's where we find the
sweetest opportunities.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:30.320
AUDIENCE: I totally get your
point about how handling

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.790
consumption is much more
important than generation or

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.640
much more impactful.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.220
That said, I wanted to just get
your ideas on a few things

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.660
in terms of three questions
that come to mind.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:48.000
One is in terms of the solar
panel for providing energy

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.190
versus just using direct heat,
for example hot water

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.010
heating and so on.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.550
That must be, I'd imagine, a lot
less environmentally toxic

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.300
and fairly efficient.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.980
The second one would be, when
you use these energy efficient

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.570
things, such as fluorescent
bulbs and LED lighting, I've

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.980
been concerned about the amount
of pollution that come

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.220
from the fluorescent bulbs.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.880
And I would assume the
LED lighting has its

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.560
own types of things.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.770
The LEDs may last almost
forever, but I'm sure all

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:18.640
sorts of other things in
those lights break.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.710
And then, that's toxic
waste, right?

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.540
So I was wondering if you'd
give guidance on that, the

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:27.700
solar water heating, the energy
efficient lighting.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.700
And the third thing is the
electric vehicles.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:36.650
When I look at whether to buy
a high efficiency combustion

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.160
engine versus to use something
like a hybrid electric

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.210
vehicle, I see that they have
a lot of problems with the

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.710
recycling of the batteries.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.320
Some amount of it enters
the environment.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.960
There's the production of it.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.730
Or even if we consider just
holding on to your old car for

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.200
longer, if it's within emission
specs, you avoid

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.310
putting all that energy
consumption into

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.240
creating a new car.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.070
So I've never really been
convinced that going out and

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.580
buying a new hybrid electric
vehicle is going to be a good

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.356
thing to do.

00:43:05.356 --> 00:43:06.230
OZZIE ZEHNER: Yeah.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.170
Thank you for those questions.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:11.860
So for your first question,
solar hot water.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.960
That's a perfect example of a
low-tech option that makes a

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.850
lot of sense in a lot
of locations.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.180
It doesn't have a lot
of the side effects

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.390
that solar cells have.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:25.090
It has side effects of its own
of course, but they're minimal

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.860
compared to the benefits
that you get.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:31.350
So your second issue was with
other types of light bulbs and

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.350
energy efficiency.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:37.320
And energy efficiency becomes
even an larger issue than what

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.150
you're bringing up with the
toxins in the light bulbs

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.660
themselves.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.890
Because we have rebound effects
that occur with energy

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.800
efficiency.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.760
As things become more efficient,
people use more of

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.150
them and it can overall
increase consumption.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.580
So that's another side of the
energy efficiency story that I

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.070
didn't have time to talk
about today, that I

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.590
cover in the book.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.080
And then there's the issue
of the light bulbs.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.220
And of course, LED light bulbs
also contain all kinds of

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:08.470
nasty stuff and so do mercury,
compact fluorescents.

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:13.130
And I use LED as kind of a
comparison in my research

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.810
because in many ways they're
similar to solar cells.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:16.750
They're high tech.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.820
They were both developed
around the same period.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.620
They were both used in
the space programs.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.820
The were both the associated
with a lot of high-tech

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.080
industries.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.890
And they both contain heavy
metals and toxics

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.800
and things like that.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.890
And so there's no easy
green fix to that.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.300
It's just weighing one set of
side effects against another

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.960
set of side effects, and that's
really difficult to do.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.260
And this also speaks to the
electric car issue that you

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.400
talked about.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.930
Because when we look at
electric cars, we

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.050
see the same thing.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.130
We're used to looking for side
effects in one location, which

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.520
is basically out of
the tailpipe.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.510
But the side effects
in an electric car

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.260
happen somewhere else.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.400
And so it's very difficult to
see them or account for them.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.020
And so we assume that
the electric car

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.270
is clean, of course.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.130
But the National Academy of
Sciences did a study, a life

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.685
cycle analysis.

00:45:04.685 --> 00:45:07.150
This is the broadest life
cycle analysis done on

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.010
electric cars.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.440
And they found that the harms
stemming from electric cars

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.530
are a little bit larger than
the harms stemming from a

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.650
regular internal combustion
engine of a car the same size.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.310
And in fact, the only way that
we can really find that

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:26.300
electric cars are cleaner, is
if we narrow our research to

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.260
just one metric, like CO2.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.860
If we just narrow it to that one
metric, then we might be

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.650
able to make an argument that
electric cars are cleaner.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.370
It looks like it might depend
on where they're charged and

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.170
it starts to get murky
after that.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.840
But if we look at the whole life
cycle-- if we looked at,

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.970
like you were saying, what do
you do with the batteries

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.350
after, or how much energy is
used to get those batteries,

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.580
what are the side effects, what
are the epidemiological

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.540
impacts of the pollution.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.400
And this is what the National
Academy has looked at.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.870
They actually went county by
county and did epidemiological

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.880
studies and figured all that
out and accumulated it all.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.870
And they said, you know what,
your electric cars, they run

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.880
on bullshit.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.010
AUDIENCE: So I've been writing
about a lot of these topics

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.870
and saying many of the same
things that you did in the

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.110
first half of your talk, for a
long time, about the megawatts

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.280
and the bad math that
a lot of people do

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.180
about alternative energy.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.810
But I've not come to the same
conclusions you have.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:24.640
And I'm wondering what you use
to back up the idea that it's

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.470
likely we could conserve our
way through a crisis?

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.440
Is there any examples from
history of people doing that,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.200
being able to solve problems
like this through conservation

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.600
and greater efficiency, rather
than what's usually happened

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.940
throughout history, which is new
technologies coming along

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.730
and changing the equations?

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.860
It's obviously difficult to
say with any accuracy what

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.750
exactly the technology of
the future will be.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.890
But it's always incorrect to
say the technology of the

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.450
future will be the same as the
technologies of today.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.610
And that makes this prediction
difficult.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.480
An example of you making one
of the same mistakes you

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.240
accuse everyone else of making,
I saw on your chart,

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.870
talking about light rail as an
energy efficient technology,

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.100
light rail is the least energy
efficient per passenger mile

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.880
of technology we use
for transportation

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.820
in the United States.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.150
It's worse than an SUV in
terms of the amount

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.850
of energy it uses.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.640
And yet you put up as here's an
example, why aren't people

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.830
writing about this.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.090
We make these mistakes
all the time.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.310
But back to basically the
question is, what examples

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.620
from history can you show
of conserving to

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.350
get through a crisis?

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.960
OZZIE ZEHNER: OK, thank
you for asking that.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.850
Well with regard to light rail,
the benefits from light

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.460
rail come in the context of the

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.830
communities that they enable.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.360
So it's not in the light rail
itself, but it's in the

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.020
ability for people to live
in a dense urban context.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.300
Dense urban contexts are a lot
more energy efficient, because

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.870
people with a smaller buildings,
are closer

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.090
together, they're not losing
as much energy for heat.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:47.281
So you have to look at the whole
context for light rail.

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:48.531
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.390
OZZIE ZEHNER: Oh, yes.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.470
AUDIENCE: This technology,
which means people could

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:55.348
deliver themselves.

00:47:55.348 --> 00:47:58.276
They can take people
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:58.276 --> 00:48:01.390
Is it really going to change
how people move in cities

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.200
And nobody thinks
about it right

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.462
now as we start planning.

00:48:04.462 --> 00:48:06.870
So it's not exactly
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.350
OZZIE ZEHNER: So the future
changes of technology is

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:13.170
certainly something that I'm
aware of and I embrace.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:17.150
I mean the technology
will change.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.200
And we have to be prepared
for that, as well.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.930
But ultimately, a lot of
technologies rely on energy.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:26.090
And so energy becomes a road
block that's very difficult to

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:26.820
get through.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.040
I just listened to a talk,
actually from Bill Gates,

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.480
where he makes this point.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.940
And he says, energy
is not high tech.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.740
It's not Moore's law.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.400
Moore's law does not
apply to energy.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.670
It's because you have to
deal with physics.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:43.800
And unless you can find a way
around the physics, you're

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.580
still left with any technology,
any growth in

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.960
society, any growth physical--

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.560
from a physical perspective--

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.090
is going to have to be
powered in some way.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.500
OZZIE ZEHNER: Yes.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.280
And so of course, Gate's
solution is to have the

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:01.960
nuclear reactor.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.280
Exactly.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.790
So the problem is you either
have to believe that infinite

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:13.130
growth is sustainable over the
long term, an infinitely

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:17.500
growing population is
sustainable the long term, or

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:22.310
we can look to what examples are
there of dealing with the

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.550
whole issue with conservation?

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.770
And there really are no good
large-scale examples of that.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.930
I mean we're watching it happen
with Japan right now,

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.390
which is probably the
place to look.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.500
And one of the other speakers
that was here at Google, James

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.720
Howard Kunstler, I was recently
on a blog cast with

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.620
him in which he mentioned
something really curious.

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.820
And he said, he thinks that--

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.790
I says all kinds of
fascinating things

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.980
that make me think--

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.510
and he said Japan is basically
going back to a craft society.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:57.960
He uses this kind of a thought
experiment to say, look what's

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.710
happening in Japan.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.840
Their population is rapidly
decreasing and they're

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.980
changing their societies in ways
that have never been done

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.290
in advanced industrial
societies before.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:10.170
And so I think we can maybe look
to countries like that

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.600
and see what might be happening
and what might come

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.970
several decades down
the future.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.870
But no, you're right.

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.870
There's no good for it.

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for speaking.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.890
I think your points about
reducing consumption are very

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.670
interesting.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.230
But it was interesting because
almost every single statement

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.900
you made in your talk, I wanted
to ask a follow-up

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.320
question to it, to understand
better, which was provoking.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.660
The one that I think is perhaps
the most important to

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.600
me to clarify at the moment, you
said a lot about how green

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.500
technology and alternative
energies, like solar panels,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.100
require fossil fuels to build
and deploy and recycle.

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.190
And do they require fossil fuels
per se or do they just

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.270
require energy?

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.150
Like if we had hydro and solar,
you could presumably

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:58.510
just take the same electricity
and build

00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:59.320
the plants with those.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.980
They don't logically
require coal.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.720
We just don't have enough
existing infrastructure yet.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.210
Am I right?

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:08.910
Or are you saying something
that I didn't understand?

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.350
OZZIE ZEHNER: No, that's
a really good point.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.570
And this is another big question
that I can't fully

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.550
answer because in a way, in many
ways, it's unanswerable

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.950
about what might happen
in the future.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:20.770
We need the energy.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.010
Yes, you're right.

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.930
The problem is that certain
types of industries rely on

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.070
certain types of energy.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:33.210
So it's difficult to explore
for copper and bring the

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.140
trucks out there, if they are
only running on electricity.

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.370
So that's why we use the
fossil fuels for that.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.750
And so the cost ends up going up
significantly if you try to

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.410
replace certain types of energy
for other types of

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.210
energy in different contexts.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.220
But yeah, ultimately
it's the energy.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:54.210
But there's also qualities
to energy that go beyond

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.010
kilowatts or the amount of
energy, like I brought up the

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.300
fungibility and the storability
and the transport.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.050
And so these are all qualities
that we have to keep in the

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:02.590
back of mind.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.520
And it's difficult to really
put those in a spreadsheet,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.980
because how do you measure those
and how do you compare

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.020
them across different
energy technologies.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.420
AUDIENCE: So let's say you're
declared the dictator of the

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.860
United States tomorrow.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.215
OZZIE ZEHNER: It would be a sad
day for the United States.

00:52:18.215 --> 00:52:19.430
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's
a better goal.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.770
Or the world, whatever
your prefer.

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.540
What changes would you make to
the existing system, let's say

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.655
policy changes or something like
that, to make people move

00:52:30.655 --> 00:52:32.020
in the right direction?

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.250
So for example, like let's say
removing the subsidies and

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.120
making technologies reflect
what they truly cost

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.255
throughout their life cycle,
might be something.

00:52:40.255 --> 00:52:43.880
But you show that it doesn't
work, because solar panels

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.610
really aren't as effective as
just reducing your usage.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:51.005
So what kind of changes
would you make, if

00:52:51.005 --> 00:52:53.080
you were the dictator?

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.245
OZZIE ZEHNER: Whew, well--

00:52:54.245 --> 00:52:55.495
AUDIENCE: Sorry, loaded.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.980
OZZIE ZEHNER: First of all,
there would be Lucky Charms in

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.230
all of the restaurants.

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:10.270
I think probably universal
health care would be the

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.640
number one priority.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.870
I feel like universal health
care has so many benefits.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.420
And we often hear people say oh,
I don't really want to pay

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.900
for that person's health care.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.695
And it's just like that person
is going to go to

00:53:22.695 --> 00:53:24.300
the doctor too much.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.700
Well, first of all that kind of
like a remarkable breakdown

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.960
in civil society.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.250
It represents a kind of
remarkable drawback from that

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.150
perspective.

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.010
But also, most people don't
recognize that we already have

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.860
an emergency universal
health care system

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.630
in the United States.

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:42.640
When a homeless person goes
into the ER with pneumonia

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.690
because they didn't have health
care, they end up

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.410
spending a lot of money
on bringing that

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.390
person back to health.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.070
And of course, that system
is incredibly expensive.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.890
And that's why we could actually
save money by going

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.160
to something like a universal
health care system, like the

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:58.650
ones in Europe.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:01.080
And there's nothing
about the health

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.740
care systems in Europe--

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.190
they're not perfect, I guess
is what I'm trying to say.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.535
But you also don't see Germans
in the streets protesting for

00:54:08.535 --> 00:54:10.120
an American style health
care system.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.630
And I think that's something we
have to keep in mind too,

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:19.300
in all the rhetoric going back
and forth on these issues.

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:23.690
The other things that I would
enable, to make a short list,

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.800
is a kind of energy efficiency
enabling

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.700
technology or research--

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.720
a Department of Efficiency
instead of a

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.880
Department of Energy.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.670
And also things like removing
zoning restrictions that

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.820
prevent density in certain
urban contexts can end up

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.770
having a big impact.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:45.845
And so that's probably the
direction I would do.

00:54:45.845 --> 00:54:47.730
AUDIENCE: Hey, Ozzie--

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:48.580
OZZIE ZEHNER: Yes?

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.310
AUDIENCE: --thanks a lot for
your wonderful talk.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:55.500
I really enjoyed most of the
talk, especially the fact that

00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:00.210
you've taken such a radical
approach to what the

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.330
common belief is.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:07.820
And you're being successful in
conveying the point, which is

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.910
very scientific and
well-grounded.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.190
So I really appreciated the
point that you mentioned the

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.640
real crisis is a crisis of
consumption, not the

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.390
production.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:26.640
However after that, I didn't
quite follow how you link that

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.430
to the population management.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.460
About that, just from what you
said, I would like to share,

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:36.940
like for India as country, the
population has been mostly

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.950
huge for thousands of years.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:43.150
And I usually read a lot of
Sanskrit literature from

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.250
ancient stories, like ancient
history of India.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:49.910
It's been a vast population
all the time.

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:51.510
And it's been sustaining.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:54.910
All the problems that you
mention having to do with

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:58.590
electricity and fossil fuels,
that all started like in only

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.030
the last 100 years or so.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.910
But prior to that danger,
civilization has been running

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:07.700
for years and years and years
without any of these problems.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.290
So I'd just like to point out
that it's not necessarily the

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.300
population.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.560
But it's under a dimension that
I would like to just kind

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.030
of hint at here, which you
might be interested in

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.670
pursuing for further, which
is actually the concept of

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.600
consciousness, like
who we really are.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.360
What bring satisfaction to us as
a person, as a individual.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.170
So the Indian culture is kind
of focused on that spiritual

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:35.880
dimension, which provides the
higher level of satisfaction

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.010
so that you don't depend
on gadgets and material

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.100
technology to fulfill your
demands constantly.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.120
Which is what that the vast
majority of the consumption

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:44.950
comes from.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:49.380
So without providing an
ultimate higher way of

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.170
enjoying your life, you cannot
really take away all the

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.680
gadgets and say that
be [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.760
and solve the energy
problem that way.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.090
Rather, the Indian culture is
focused on the aspect that

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:04.870
you're a spiritual being and you
can be satisfied by other

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:10.300
means spiritually, compared
to you using gadgets.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.300
That's one of the main reasons
that civilization has

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.320
sustained for so many years.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.410
So I'd just like to comment on
that and see if you have any

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:20.900
thoughts about that?

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:23.540
OZZIE ZEHNER: Well, I should
make a clarification that

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.330
probably our views are not
incongruent, in that I'm not

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:30.150
for population control.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.710
I should say that right
off the bat.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.190
In fact, I think the idea of
population control within the

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:37.160
environmental movement, and
there are some people pushing

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.220
for population control,
and I think

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.940
that's a misguided effort.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:46.100
And that's because I do think it
tramples on the ability for

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:50.870
societies and for individuals
to have a free life and

00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:52.400
procreate how they choose to.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.140
But we find that actually
coercion is not

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.260
necessary at all.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.880
If you look in China, the lowest
birth rate is in a

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.780
place where the one-child
policy does not

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.640
apply, in Hong Kong.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.990
And we find that throughout
the world.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:08.930
Actually Shanghai, also.

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:12.570
It doesn't apply and Shanghai
also has a low birth rate.

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:15.830
We find that really by just
instituting human rights and

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:18.750
health care, it allows people to
have the number of children

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:19.860
that they want to have.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.130
And that number happens
to be sustainable

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:24.520
over the long term.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:28.010
And so really the trick I think
is just delivering human

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:29.590
rights and health care
in the first place.

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:34.240
I really see population growth
as a symptom of suboptimal

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.430
social conditions.

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:39.320
So the real thing to do is to
just satisfy those social

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.340
conditions and the population
growth will

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.050
take care of itself.

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:43.180
AUDIENCE: I have one
other question.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.500
I think we're getting
low on time.

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.350
But I was curious what you
thought of the work of like

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.110
Professor Jacobson at Stanford,
and others, who have

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:55.100
come out and said, look, we have
the technology, we have

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.760
the resources to power all of
the energy in the world today

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.150
with existing known
technology, for

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:03.190
wind, water, and solar.

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:06.040
And how you compare that with
your graphs of showing the

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.050
tiny drops compared to
very large buckets?

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.230
Do you think his analysis is
wrong or do you agree with it

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:13.160
and were presenting something
different?

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:18.200
OZZIE ZEHNER: I was actually
just on a radio show, NPR,

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.110
last week, and he
was on the show.

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:24.960
And the issue with this report
which you're referring to, for

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.450
people who don't know, is that
basically there's these ideas

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:30.480
that there's enough solar energy
in the Mojave Desert to

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.930
power the entire world.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.820
There's enough wind power to
power 100 times what we need

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.050
and these kinds of things.

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:37.710
And really, these are
just a failure

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:38.420
in the way of thinking.

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.050
I mean of course if you ask a
ridiculous question, you can

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.850
find a ridiculous answer.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:47.460
And I mean the Mojave
Desert may be the

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.540
Saudi Arabia of solar.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.730
But if we were to cover it with
solar cells, and cover

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:57.310
the world's deserts with solar
cells, it would destroy

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:00.440
civilization as we know it
within a single generation,

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.520
just because of the toxins, the
fossil fuels that would be

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.950
required, the other climate
gases that are produced, that

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.610
are many times worse than CO2.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.160
If you take that little dot of
solar energy that we get

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.790
currently, or wind power that
we get currently, and then

01:00:14.790 --> 01:00:19.820
multiply those side effects by
something like 10,000, that's

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.070
what you're looking at.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.460
So you just get another set of
side effects with alternative

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.470
energy technologies.

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.510
And they all rely
on fossil fuels.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.360
Thermal solar has the
same side effects.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.580
When you get back down to it,
you end up with the same types

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.190
of side effects.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.870
The high cost of thermal solar
reflects the fossil fuels that

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:38.960
are behind the stage.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.180
AUDIENCE: So is it accurate to
say that you think in that

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.760
report, they didn't do a proper
life cycle analysis?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.486
OZZIE ZEHNER: I don't think they
asked the right question.

01:00:45.486 --> 01:00:46.160
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.360
OZZIE ZEHNER: Yeah, that's
what I don't think.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.900
I mean maybe their findings
are correct.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.820
I could ask the question, how
many threads of linen are in

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.380
this carpet.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.970
And I might be able
to find an answer.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.550
But is that really a meaningful

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.340
question to be asking?

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.560
AUDIENCE: In a Google
[INAUDIBLE].

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.510
OZZIE ZEHNER: Thank you.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:08.090
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:08.430
Thank you.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.070
Great talk.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.910
I'm not as well read as some
of the other questioners.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.100
But I'm curious why nuclear is
not mentioned anywhere and

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.490
whether you think that there's
a place for it

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:19.940
in the future world?

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.660
Thank you.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.290
OZZIE ZEHNER: Thank
you for asking.

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:24.860
That's an excellent question
about nuclear.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.000
A nuclear would be a whole
series of talks,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.880
aside from this one.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.360
Which is why I didn't
talk about it here.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.440
I do talk about it
in the book.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.530
So if you're interested in my
views on nuclear power, you

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.550
can look there.

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:40.700
But nuclear is a fascinating
case because it is something

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.100
that is actually scalable and
there is a lot of fissionable

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.220
material on the planet.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.890
And that can be looked at as
a blessing or a curse.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:51.150
And there's people that look
at it from both directions.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.440
The issue with nuclear power
is that we have yet another

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.990
set of side effects and
limitations and consequences.

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:58.430
Some of them, we
know very well.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:01.855
Some of them are risky
situations, that are growing

01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:05.110
and accumulating over time,
such as that with waste

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:08.530
disposal and access
to proliferating

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.120
materials like plutonium.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.140
And the nuclear armaments
industry has even tested

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:19.110
byproducts from the thorium
cycle in anticipation that

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.720
there might be a thorium
push in the future.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.650
So we will look at conflict.

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:26.690
We look at potential for
materials getting diverted.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.460
We look at long term storage
of nuclear waste.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.940
We look at the potential
for explosions or

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.890
like Fukushima disasters.

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:37.040
And so, we just get another
set of side

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.140
effects with nuclear.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.570
But the big issue with nuclear
that shouldn't be

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.880
underestimated is that there
is a lot of fissionable

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.040
material on the planet.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.680
And we're going to run into
different types of barriers

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.970
with nuclear than we're

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.732
encountering with fossil fuels.

01:02:52.732 --> 01:02:53.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:59.380
OZZIE ZEHNER: Oh, I'm not the
right person to ask about

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.340
either projects and the fusion
reactors and things like that.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.910
Fusion has been kind of 30 years
in the future now, for

01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:09.810
very long time.

01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.420
But we're now kind of finding
that the future isn't what it

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.910
used to be.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:17.180
And it's getting more and more
difficult to really see a way

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.490
forward with things
like fusion.

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:20.890
I mean maybe it will
happen some day.

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:23.790
I don't really know.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.040
Thank you very much.
