HENRY SHACKLETON: I would say
that the thing that really

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.810
helped me the most
in Junior Lab develop

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.620
as learning how to do
experimental physics

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.740
is the lack of a super precise
direction in the lab guide.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.140
So the lab guides are vague.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.240
They are very helpful,
but they don't tell you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.454
your sources of error
are this, this, and this.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:27.870
You really have
to think about it.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.290
You have to fill in the gaps
and essentially almost come up

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.530
with your own experiment
to determine how you're

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.280
going to go about the
analysis, how you're

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.800
going to go about the error
propagation-- things like that.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.260
So I think leaving
that room for students

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.060
to figure things
out on their own

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.751
while providing feedback
and advice is very helpful.
