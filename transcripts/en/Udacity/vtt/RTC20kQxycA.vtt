00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.050
&gt;&gt; Programming with objects is the predominant way of developing software today.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.760
&gt;&gt; Code is organized into pieces called objects. You can use objects written by

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.940
other people to create your own programs.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.990
&gt;&gt; That way, you get to stand on the shoulders of giants instead of having to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.225
start from scratch every time.

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:17.900
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, you'll look at lots of different examples of objects. You'll

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.360
learn what they can do and how to make them do it.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write a program that draws a

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.670
rocket, flying from earth to mars. I think you'll be impressed with what you'll

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.930
able to do.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.200
&gt;&gt; I'm really excited of what you're going to learn this lesson. Let's get

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.470
started.
