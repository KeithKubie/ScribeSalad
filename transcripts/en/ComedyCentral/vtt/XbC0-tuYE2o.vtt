00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.302
<i> Alen Harikian is the owner
 of Speers TV,</i>

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.338
<i> a South-Pasadena
 electronics store</i>

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.040
<i> that's been operating
 in the neighborhood</i>

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.608
<i> for over 60 years.</i>

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.210
<i> But ever since a massive
 Best Buy moved in</i>

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.179
<i> just minutes away
 from his tiny shop,</i>

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.680
<i>he's been finding it impossible</i>

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.682
<i> to keep up with their
 aggressive pricing.</i>

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:18.618 line:0%
- Their sales are ridiculous.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.553 line:0%
I mean, there's no way
that I can compete.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:21.854 line:0%
-<i> And if it keeps up,</i>

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:24.323
<i> Speers TV is at risk
 of going extinct.</i>

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:26.893
<i> So I paid Alen a visit
 with an ambitious solution</i>

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:29.495
<i> to undercut
 his biggest competitor.</i>

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0%
Are you familiar with
the Best Buy price-match policy?

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Yeah. It's horrible.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.270 align:end position:100%
I mean, it's bad
for small business.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.704
-<i> One of the main reasons</i>

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.873
<i> Alen has such a hard time
 competing with Best Buy</i>

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.709
<i> is because of their aggressive
 price-match policy,</i>

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.645
<i> which guarantees
 they will match the price</i>

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.346
<i> of any local competitor,</i>

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.083
<i> preventing stores like Speers
 from underselling them,</i>

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.285
<i> but if Alen
 dropped his prices so low</i>

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.320
<i>to make his TVs virtually free,</i>

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:56.422
<i> according to Best Buy's
 own policy,</i>

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.458
<i> they would have to match
 that price, too,</i>

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.093
<i> giving Alen
 a short window of time</i>

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.862
<i> where he could buy up
 all their inventory for $1</i>

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.298
<i> and then resell those TVs
 for any price he wants</i>

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.600
<i> to make a huge profit.</i>

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:11.137
<i> The plan: use Best Buy's
price-match policy against them</i>

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.007
<i>to get Speers an endless supply
 of $1 TVs.</i>

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Um...

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.312 align:start size:56% position:44%
It's a great idea.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.781 align:start position:0%
- It might take a little bit
of work and time to do.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:23.015 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Okay.

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.284 align:start position:0%
- Do you have a lot
going on right now?

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.587 size:84% position:58%
- No, I honestly don't. No.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.122 align:start position:0%
- So you don't
have commitments at home

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.256 align:start position:0%
or anything right now?

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start position:0%
Relationship stuff?

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.159
- I'm not in a relationship, no.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.961 align:start position:0%
- I'm not in a relationship
either, so...

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.229 align:start size:16% position:84%
- Oh.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.665 align:start position:0%
- We can both work on this,
you know, full-time.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:42.468
- Okay. All right. That's fine.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.036
-<i> After a bit more discussion,</i>

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.772
<i> Alen was on board to move
forward with dropping the price</i>

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.775 line:0%
<i> on one of his premium
 Samsung HD TV models</i>

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.944 line:0%
<i> to just $1 apiece,</i>

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.413
<i> but once the new discounted
 price went into effect,</i>

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.216
<i> people would be flocking
 to Speers to get the deal.</i>

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.352
<i> So to help dissuade
 these bargain hunters</i>

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.954
<i> from buying up
 all of Alen's dollar TVs,</i>

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.857
<i> I implemented a strict
dress code, requiring customers</i>

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.727
<i> to wear formal attire
 just to enter the store.</i>

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.229
<i> I then had all the dollar TVs
 moved to an area</i>

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:11.697
<i> at the back of the store</i>

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.367
<i> and had a new wall constructed
 to surround this area</i>

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.568
<i> that could only be entered</i>

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.004
<i> through a tiny,
 two-foot-tall door.</i>

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.606
<i> Finally, in between the door
 and the TVs,</i>

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.275
<i> I added a live alligator,</i>

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.911
<i> which would hopefully force
 customers who made it this far</i>

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.412
<i> to reconsider their decision</i>

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:28.978
<i> to take advantage
 of the great offer.</i>
