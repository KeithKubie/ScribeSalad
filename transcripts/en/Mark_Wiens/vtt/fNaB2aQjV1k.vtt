It's Mark Wiens here, I'm in Delhi, India,
and I'm about to eat one of the coolest ice

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.020
cream, I think I've ever had in my entire
life.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.309
Ok, so I ordered the mango version, and it's
actually a mango hollowed out, and then they

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.900
put cream and other spices and stuff in it,
and then freeze it all in the mango. And then

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.250
they seal it with clay at the top, seal it
up, and then when you order it, it's hard

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.820
in the deep freeze, and they slice it up into
pieces.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.820
So there's actually real mango on the outside
and on the inside is the ice cream, mango

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.540
ice cream, so, by far the coolest mango ice
cream I've ever eaten, kulfi, mango kulfi.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.910
Awww, that's really cold, and really good.
Super creamy, really mango-ey, mmm, that's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.299
fabulous.

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.299
Ohhh, that's very nice. Oh yah!
