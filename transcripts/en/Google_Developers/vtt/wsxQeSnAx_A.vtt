00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.300
man: Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.133
Please welcome Steven
from the Lego company.

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.334
[applause]

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:11.200
Canvin: Hey.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.667
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:13.968
How are you?

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:16.300
It's gonna be
a great day today.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.934
I just want to tell you,

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.400
I've been given 10 minutes

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.868
to actually
do a little presentation

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:22.133
just before the keynote starts.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.734
So in ten minutes
all the excitement will start,

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.801
but I'll show you
a couple things here.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:31.467
I just want to tell you
about how we from Lego

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.634
have embraced
developers out there.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.901
But some of you found
the bricks on your seats,

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.100
and I just have a little
question for you, which is,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.534
so how many
different combinations

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:44.167
do you think you can actually
put these bricks together?

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:45.467
And please do not Google that.

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.067
That would be cheating.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:50.267
You might get the answer before
the end of the presentation.

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.601
So we at Lego,
we have a big mission,

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:55.801
which is to inspire and develop
the builders of tomorrow.

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.234
We want to create
and make children

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.234
become greater thinkers
and problem solvers

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:02.434
and prepare them for the future

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:04.067
and the challenges out there.

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:07.267
We also make products
for children of all ages.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.234
And also we've seen
how people out there

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:11.300
have expanded our products

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.467
and taken it
beyond its boundaries,

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.434
and most of all, with the
Lego MindStorms robotic toolkit,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:19.667
which came out in 1998.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.734
We made a robotic toolkit
that was prepared for children

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.868
from age 12 and up

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:28.033
with proprietary software,

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:32.067
customized hardware,
and software to boot,

00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:33.601
but apparently this product

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.200
also appealed to adults.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.601
So within the first five months
after we launched

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.033
back in 1998,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.801
our product got hacked.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.367
The hardware--

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.167
our proprietary hardware
and software got hacked.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.734
The components,
all our vital components

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.133
were put in a shopping list
on the internet.

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.567
Our legal department
was freaking out.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.033
And they wanted to take action.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:55.901
They wanted
to take these people down

00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:57.434
and stop them right there.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.167
Well, we said,
"Let's see what happens."

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:00.667
And actually,
this was not harmful.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.200
It actually, expanded--

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.968
It actually started
the community around it

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.968
of the adult fans out there.

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.267
So actually
we learned some lessons

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:10.734
that when we in 2004
wanted to introduce

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.367
a new generation
of Lego MindStorms,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.133
which we launched in 2006,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.234
we said, "Let's embrace
all these developers out there,

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:19.567
because they will
hack our products anyway."

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:21.033
That's one of the lessons
we learned.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.234
They will take our pieces apart.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.067
So let's see what we can do and
actually take these people in.

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:28.634
And also, another
important lesson is

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:31.868
that these guys knew more
about our product than we did.

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.667
I certainly believe that.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:38.767
So how do you go about actually
finding these fans out there

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.968
who actually know more about--

00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:41.667
these developers
that we need to bring in?

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.033
Well, as I said,

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.067
there was a community
that had developed and formed

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:46.534
around Lego MindStorms,

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.067
which was quite a first
for Lego.

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:50.701
And as you can see,

00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:52.868
we call adult fans AFOLs--

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:54.234
Adult Fans Of Lego.

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:56.267
Well, it's actually a name
they made up themselves,

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:57.434
but we adapted to that,

00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:59.033
and we work with these guys,

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.033
and I find that
they're really, really strong

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.067
when it comes
to Lego MindStorms products.

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:05.534
So, back in 2004,

00:03:05.534 --> 00:03:07.267
we actually opened up
a little work forum,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:08.300
closed work forum.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.634
Invited four people in.

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:11.901
Which we called--
we called the forum

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:15.701
MindStorms User Panel,
hence the name "the Muppets."

00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.300
It was their own nickname.
They came up with it again.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.067
But what we did was,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.701
we invited these people in,

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:25.400
into our holiest of places,
into our R&amp;D.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400
You wouldn't normally have
people invited into your R&amp;D

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.567
just coming from the outside.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:32.133
Of course
they signed the agreement,

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.801
but we took a calculated risk.

00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:36.267
This time we did not ask
the lawyers for permission,

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.701
because we found
it would be better

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:39.334
to actually ask for forgiveness.

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.000
[laughs]

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.133
[applause]

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.701
Thank you.

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.000
So as you can see
in this picture,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.067
we have,
on the left side here,

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:53.167
Steve and David
talking to our designers,

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.734
sorting out elements.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.300
They actually came up
with new elements

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.467
that we hadn't thought about.

00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.334
They actually suggested
an ultra-sonic sensor

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:00.601
that we hadn't thought about,

00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:03.067
because some of the old--
in the old generation,

00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:04.601
some of the fans
had actually hacked

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.200
and made their own sensors,
right?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.467
So also today,
what we see is a great amount

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.000
of software applications

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.434
that has been made,
because we said,

00:04:17.434 --> 00:04:19.367
"Let's go open-source
with all this.

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:20.834
Let's open up
to the community."

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:24.267
So today, on our website,
you can find

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:27.167
a software developer kit,
a firmware developer kit,

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:29.467
a hardware developer kit,
and a Bluetooth developer kit,

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:32.467
all for the sake of
proliferating our products.

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:35.133
And it's the fans who have
actually born our whole product

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.133
as it is today.

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:37.567
As you can see,
with all the names

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:39.467
of all these different
software applications,

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:40.868
there are no
limits and boundaries

00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:42.334
to what you
can actually do with this.

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:43.901
So if any of you guys
out there

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.667
actually have played
with Lego MindStorms

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.734
or have helped
expand our products,

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:49.534
I salute you and thank you.

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:51.267
Keep pushing.

00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:54.601
We definitely appreciate that.

00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:57.200
But also, of course,
on the model sides,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.267
I could talk for hours

00:04:58.267 --> 00:04:59.667
about the thousands
and thousands

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:01.501
of inventions that fans
have made out there.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.567
Of all ages.

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.467
I guess we're all
children inside.

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:06.133
Especially that's what
we believe at Lego.

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.434
As you can see,

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:09.601
getting a robot
to solve a Rubik's cube,

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.901
yeah, you can make that.

00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.367
There are instructions
for that on the internet.

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:15.133
Getting to interface
with the iPhone,

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:16.467
you can do that as well.

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:18.234
Making it work with Android

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.934
would probably
be the next thing coming.

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:26.133
Also, if you want to have
the perfect game of Wii...

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:28.534
[laughs]

00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:30.567
I actually met
the inventor last night.

00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:31.567
It was really a thrill.

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:34.300
So we recognized
that these guys

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.701
really expanded that.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.567
Getting to fetch
your soda cans.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.667
There's some product placement
right here,

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.567
but, yeah,
you can do that as well.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:43.400
There are no limits
to what you can do with this.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.033
But as I said,

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.667
I salute the guys out there

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:50.367
who are actually
working with this.

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:52.734
Last year in 2008,

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:54.968
we had the ultimate drop test.

00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:57.367
We actually sent some
of our robots up in a balloon

00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:58.767
that went to the edge
of the atmosphere.

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:00.934
And one of them actually
got dropped from up there

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.334
from 80,000 feet up.

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:04.234
It deployed a parachute,

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:05.634
but actually
came down quite safe.

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:07.567
But it was the ultimate
drop test for us.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.534
Native Chris Anderson
from the Bay Area,

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.234
famed from &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt; magazine,

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:14.934
actually made a Lego UAV.

00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:17.667
He wanted to prove
that he could make a UAV,

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.834
Unmanned Aero Vehicle,
for under $1,000,

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:22.400
and he choose our products
as control of the plane,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.367
which is quite amazing.

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:27.567
We also--we've been into space.

00:06:27.567 --> 00:06:29.400
Been cleaning up
the space station

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.033
together with Russians.

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.434
This goes back a while,

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:36.300
but we definitely are going
to go into space again.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.734
So back to my original question.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:41.167
How many different combinations?

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.434
Did you figure out
was in it?

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:45.901
The tally would probably be--

00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:47.367
Some of you
might have this number--

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:51.968
102,981,500
different combinations.

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:54.467
But that has actually been
recalculated

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:56.400
by a Danish math professor,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.634
so in essence,
there are 915,103,765.

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:04.667
If any of you guys
had that combination,

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.234
please email me.

00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:09.667
So enjoy
the rest of the day, guys.

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.400
This is it for me.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.701
And thank you.

00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:15.234
Keep up the development
with MindStorms.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.167
[applause]
