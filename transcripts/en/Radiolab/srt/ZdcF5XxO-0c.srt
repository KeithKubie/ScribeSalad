1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,710
S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey.
Hi. How are you? I'm fine.

3
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,340
How are you Robert? Nice to speak
to you after all these years. Yes,

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,600
it's been quite a few years.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,240
I should let you know the Jad Abumrad
has just wandered in. Hello. Hi Jad,

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,270
this is Adrian Knowi.
Last name is N. O. E. N.

7
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,390
I'm director of the National
Museum of Health and medicine.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,110
So you know why we're calling
you, right? Yes. Okay.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,430
So what's the spring
it on the audience? Um,

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,540
I don't remember how I
happened to bump into you.

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,960
I don't even know how this came
up. I think you and I had, um,

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,170
been coke presenters at a
Ted conference with Amy.

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,450
That's what it was probably a decade
ago. We may have been talking about, um,

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,750
important events in New York
or civic architecture, but I,

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,530
but I do remember perking
up at the phrase grants too.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,580
Trains too. So Robert said something
to you about grant's tomb. Yes.

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,600
And then you turn to and say it again.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,710
Now you may know who's
buried in grant's tomb,

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,030
but I know it's buried in grant's tumor.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,290
Yeah. Yes. He turns it home
at the museum. She works at,

21
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:23,291
there is a tumor that had been excised
from the throat of president grant in the

22
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:28,691
1880s actual tissue from grant's tumor.

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,960
Yes, that's right. Yes. Here we are.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,460
Crouch.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,460
I've been National Museum of Health and
medicine [inaudible] it is kept behind

26
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,700
several locked doors,

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,150
so you guys don't have an inkling of what
you're about to see if we go in there

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,140
now, but it's a privileged
area. This is Brian Spatola.

29
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,100
He's the collections manager and he let
us down a long hallway to some doors

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,200
into what? Me Back. Oh,
holy moly. Oh my God.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,580
There's like a, they're twin
babies and in formaldehyde look,

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,590
Greens heads torsos and majority
of even gotten to the tumors.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,480
Right. So he let us out of that
room and into another one in the,

34
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,050
you're sitting on a table and
waiting for us is this, is this,

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,200
the thing about which we spoke it is
was President Ulysses Simpson grant's

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,970
tumor. Oh Wow. It was resting in
a box. It looked as it happened

37
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,940
exactly like a cigar box.
Oh. Which is a little ironic.

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,120
This was the guy who never ever
stopped having a cigar in his mouth.

39
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,770
He never stopped having cigars.

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,880
He smoked as many as 12 cigars a day. Wow.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
So it was probably the cigars that made
the tumor February of 1885 tissue was

42
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:48,470
removed, examined, and his physicians, um,

43
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,200
concluded that he had a
squamous cell carcinoma. Mm.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,800
And ultimately he was treated
for pain and died in July of 85.

45
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,590
That same year. Well, it's pretty fast.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
So that's what killed president
grant then it was a tumor. Yes.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,380
I didn't know that.

48
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,910
So you see the staining that they use
to bring out the details in the cells is

49
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,880
the darkness, the tumor, the
darkness is the tumor. Wow.

50
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,680
The very stuff that, even though
president grant got through Vicksburg,

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
and then even though he came east and
they fight, tried to kill him here,

52
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,420
they tried to kill him
there. They tried to go.

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,540
Then he goes and becomes president.
This is what actually killed him.

54
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,560
This is what killed him.
Yeah. Can I touch it? Um,

55
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,803
no.

56
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,670
We may not be able to touch the actual
tumor of the president of the United

57
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,910
States, but we can touch on this
subject. We can grasp this subject.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,350
We can examine this subject coming
up on radio lab for the next hour.

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,110
It's totally tumor. Oh, come on.

60
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:54,570
Don't call back because really what we're
going to talk about are not just any

61
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:58,140
tumors but famous tumors,
immortal tumors, deviled tumor,

62
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,900
contagious tumors and
tumors that speak up.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm about
to be confused. The big one.

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,920
And I'm Jad Abumrad this
is Radiolab. Stay with us.

65
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,743
[inaudible]

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,780
wow.

67
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,350
Alright. To get things
to get things rolling.

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,540
This first story is about something
that we thought was not possible that we

69
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,130
hoped was not possible.
We learned it from, uh,

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,060
I'll make it work from this Guy David
Coleman. I'm a science journalist. He is,

71
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,100
I think my favorite in my generation.

72
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,440
I think he is the best writer
that writes about science.

73
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,470
I specialize in evolutionary biology and
travel on assignment to far away places

74
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,690
and interesting situations.
All right, so first of all,

75
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,120
where are you going to take
us to? What part of the world?

76
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,050
I'm going to take you to

77
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,883
Tasmania,

78
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,220
which is the island state off the
south coast of Australia. You know,

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,190
you go to Australia and you think of
rock and deserts and red dirt and heat,

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,770
but you keep going south all
the way off the south coast.

81
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,670
Suddenly you have these
rolling green countrysides,

82
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,170
lots of wallabies.

83
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,610
One was species of kangaroo that like on
New England countryside with wallabies

84
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,580
that the, exactly with small
kangaroos hopping around.

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,470
But our story does not actually
be king in Tasmania. Nope.

86
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,510
It starts in Holland with a gentleman
by the name of Christo Bosh.

87
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,500
Is that bar as in B a r Bosh?

88
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,960
Christo bars is a wonderfully
independent spirited plumber,

89
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,883
a plumber,

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,420
plumber guy do to make a living on the
photographing is for me a big hobby.

91
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,280
We don't know just how
great a plumber he is,

92
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:54,990
but he's a very good wildlife photographer
and he looks for interesting animals

93
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:57,170
to shoot with the camera.
I mean, so over the years,

94
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,810
very often he puts down his
range and he travels. Yeah.

95
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,480
Well we don't have that many
animals here in Holland.

96
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,030
A little bit of road
deer and sometimes a Fox.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
And in the early nineties he goes to
take his latest photography sabbatical in

98
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,170
Tasmania have gone to a Tasmania on boat.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,430
And where you there to take pictures of
Wellby's or Kangaroos? No, no, no, no.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,300
He was there this time to photograph
devils. Tasmanian devils. Yeah.

101
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,200
I quite liked the animals. What
is, I mean, I know the cartoon,

102
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,540
but what does a real Tasmanian
Devil Alexi look like?

103
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,790
Whether are about as big
as a little pit bull,

104
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,170
but look a little bit more like a bear
cub. Huh? White Yolk on its chest.

105
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,700
Big Set of formidable teeth. They'll
eat almost anything. Anything,

106
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:45,660
anything that could [inaudible] Kelp,
maggots and fish, snakes, garbage cans,

107
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,520
the occasional rubber
boot, you name it. Anyway,

108
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,550
when crystal gets to Tasmania,
he drives up the coast.

109
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,980
He finds dead animals on the
road, you know, roadkill,

110
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,180
roadkill from the road to use as bait.
What sort of roadkill? Kangaroos?

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,660
A little devil. Can eat a kangaroo.
Oh yeah. When there are three, four,

112
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:06,260
five together, ate a big
kangaroo in an hour is gone. Wow.

113
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,410
So he takes the dead kangaroo,
drags it to clearing in the forest,

114
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,410
sets up his photography equipment.
Very close. And then what happens?

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Well you just wait

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,960
[inaudible] so he waits and as the
night falls little black ships,

117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
we can creep under the,

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,530
you can hear them sniffing
on the refine the roadkill.

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,013
Ah.

120
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,050
And then I just started eating
and fighting with each other.

121
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,043
[inaudible]

122
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
[inaudible]

123
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,590
this squad scary. If you
don't know what you're eating

124
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,680
as the crystal Danny at a safe
distance English shadows takes,

125
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,283
yeah.

126
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,850
Over the years he's done
this over and over and over,

127
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,930
but he always sees lots of devil
devil's in front of his lenses.

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,910
Sometimes 20 devil's running around,

129
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:21,700
devil's in his kitchen or come
into your tent. Devil's everywhere.

130
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,200
Let after a bunch of trips,

131
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,880
something happened.

132
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,790
It was Easter 1996 he was in the park
watching a dead kangaroo and waiting for

133
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,390
the devils to show. But only
thing I saw was one devil,

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,510
just one. Hey Dadada,

135
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,030
I'll try another spot at another
spot. Tried it at two devils.

136
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,820
They're not gone entirely,
but they're scarce.

137
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,680
And you notice something strange
about one or two of the devils.

138
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,730
It was something on the
faces fasion on the backend,

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,930
on their mouth and something
that looked like a growth,

140
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,880
a large, ugly growth. Well, maybe a,

141
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,550
they've been bitten or fighting
with each other and been on that,

142
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,520
but it was really big, you
know, and blood coming out.

143
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,080
And this was the first alarm bell.

144
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,770
So crystal, you were the first to see it.

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,310
And this was just the beginning,

146
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,510
like a pie out of hell and dark
death is sweeping Tasmania.

147
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,660
Trouble reporters got the stone fronted,

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,900
anything like this and began reporting
that more and more Tasmanian devils had

149
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:39,160
these lumps on their faces. They fill
the ice sockets, they puff out the lips,

150
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,390
they infect the gums. It's really sad
and hideous and whatever they were,

151
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,790
they turned out to beat lethal.
To jump ahead a little bit,

152
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,520
the effect that it's had in
the population, in some cases,

153
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,570
devil populations collapsed
by 90% died off very quickly.

154
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,350
Scientists looked at the disease and
determined that it was some kind of tumor

155
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,540
cancer, a cancerous tumor. And then
the question was what's causing them?

156
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,190
So what, what, what did they think? Well,

157
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,950
the toxic chemical was guest number one,

158
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,800
some poison or pesticide
from the environment. Yes,

159
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:11,110
number two was a virus.

160
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,190
So they tested in places where the doubles
live looking for something toxic or

161
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:18,050
some virus and they found nothing.

162
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,190
And then along comes a woman
named Anne Marie Pierce.

163
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,930
She looked at some tumors close up, um,

164
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,180
very close up from 11 different devils.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,360
So she's looking at the first tumor and
she found that the chromosomes were sort

166
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:38,110
of mangled, which isn't really that
strange because that's what cancer is.

167
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,660
It's like your genetic
stuff gone screwy. Right?

168
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,740
But then she looked at the tumor from the
next devil and she found not just also

169
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:45,730
mangled chromosomes,

170
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:49,510
but chromosomes that were mangled in
exactly the same way as they had been in

171
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:53,910
the first devils. So now she looks at
a third identical metaphor, identical,

172
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,660
and then a fifth identical 11.
Exactly the same pattern in each

173
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,770
[inaudible] does that I,

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,310
I feel the sensation of all,

175
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,540
but I don't quite have these
understanding attachment.

176
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,430
Does that mean that that
these tumors are all brothers?

177
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:16,600
What that meant was that these tumors
were all genetically identical.

178
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,550
They were all the same tumor. How
can they all be the same tumor? Well,

179
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:22,660
they can't because,

180
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,560
because that wouldn't mean that these
Tasmanian devils caught the cancer and

181
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,910
from some other Tasmanian Devil.
Exactly. Wait, what do you mean exactly?

182
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,020
You can't catch cancers.

183
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:37,021
Epidemic of cancer in Tasmanian devils
was a crazy impossible tumor that was

184
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,003
jumping

185
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,360
[inaudible]

186
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,650
that was leaping from
one devil to another.

187
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,140
[inaudible]

188
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,240
raping tumor. Yeah, a leaping tumor.

189
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,243
[inaudible]

190
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,330
[inaudible] point in this tale where we
really have to question everything that

191
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:58,370
we thought. We knew.

192
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,503
No cancer.

193
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Now most people think of cancer as like
a situation in which one of your cells

194
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,323
starts

195
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,560
replicating and it doesn't stop.

196
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,340
It replicates uncontrollably

197
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,510
until it destroys you.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,870
Okay, so that's like the one cell theory,

199
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,460
which is frankly how I thought cancer
worked. Oh Peter, we have to go ahead.

200
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,100
Just start. But then we spoke with this
fellow. Yup. His name is Carlo Maley,

201
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,630
cancer biologists at the Wistar Institute.

202
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,880
And he told us if you really want to
understand what's happening with the

203
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:40,040
devils, you're going to toss
out the ones cell theory.

204
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,310
Cause cancer is not just not
just a cell going haywire. No,

205
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,690
it's actually many cells
competing, competing for space,

206
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,530
competing for resources and in the
process driving each other haywire.

207
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,170
Like if you were to
somehow go into a tumor,

208
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,150
he says what you would find is between
a billion and a trillion cells in there

209
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,290
[inaudible] these are different cells,
this huge clump of cells in there.

210
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,060
They're all fighting out
cause you know space is tight,

211
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,290
food is scarce.

212
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,460
And what will happen is in the
middle of this mailing list,

213
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,560
the cells are competing, each

214
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,160
individual cells trying
to copy itself, copy,

215
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,570
copy Gabby. And somewhere along
the way you get eventually

216
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,460
a copying error. And
every so often says Carla,

217
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:33,360
one of these mistakes we'll
give the new cell a new talent.

218
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,670
And in the case of cancer it
usually starts [inaudible].

219
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,970
Just something pretty simple,
like the ability to slurp up food,

220
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,350
Fester nutrients like oxygen and
glucose. Now with this advantage,

221
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,400
that mutant and all of its progeny
will take over that area of the tissue,

222
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,840
but

223
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,010
not for long because now you got all
these beauties and they start until

224
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,490
randomly again, you get
another copy in state

225
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,820
and maybe this second copying mistake
gives the cell the ability to divide

226
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,900
faster, right?

227
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,220
So there it is proliferating faster than
its neighbors and it takes over growing

228
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,950
and displacing the other cells. But yeah,

229
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:17,400
it just keeps getting worse because
now you've got these double mutants,

230
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,430
they can eat fast, they
can divide quickly,

231
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:24,000
and they start to fight until you
get a third mutation, then a fourth,

232
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:28,620
and then you just keep ratcheting it
up and eventually roughly five to 20

233
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,670
mutations, you end up with a cell
that is so gnarled, so mutated,

234
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,820
and so powerful that it can
literally spit a kind of acid

235
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,490
[inaudible] matrix,

236
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:46,491
metallo protease that allows it to
rip through the membrane barriers.

237
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,790
And this is when you're really in
trouble because now the cell can roam

238
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,600
and so the cells leave the primary tumor,

239
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,680
they've got dissolved their way into
a blood vessel. That's a mutation.

240
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,010
Then they've got to survive in
the blood and another mutation.

241
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,560
Then they've got to stick
somewhere else yet another.

242
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,860
Then they've got it dissolved back
to the RTL heading and another. Yeah.

243
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,630
So it sounds like cancer is always
evolving to be more cancerous. It totally,

244
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,464
yes.

245
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,230
[inaudible]

246
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,720
this also explains why we
haven't been able to cure it.

247
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,960
Why when a person takes chemotherapy
drugs, the cancer will go away for awhile,

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,940
but then it'll come back

249
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,370
stronger cause the cells have
evolved a resistance to those drugs.

250
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,990
When I first got into work on cancer,

251
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:39,991
I was impressed at how malevolent the
disease seems as if it's being designed to

252
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:42,850
kill us. So here's my question. Um,

253
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,860
this leaping tumor in
the devils [inaudible],

254
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,570
is this a case where the tumor is actually
evolving into a new form like after,

255
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,100
say the 50th mutation or whatever?

256
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,160
Like now it doesn't just have
the ability to travel in a body,

257
00:15:57,161 --> 00:16:00,130
but it can somehow leap out
of a body through the air

258
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,040
and into another body. Sure.

259
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,370
You mean the one that's really scary?
Yes, it is. It is pretty scary,

260
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:10,780
but,

261
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,780
but this is amazingly rare and according
to Carlo demands some pretty special

262
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,970
circumstances. Oh,

263
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:21,971
would m a Tasmanian devil would some
tumor get from one individual to another?

264
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,300
What would what? How would
that happen? Tasmanian devils.

265
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,870
God blessing bite one
another in the face a lot.

266
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,890
They're scrambling over carcasses.

267
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,470
They're fighting and biting,
swallowing, crunching.

268
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,700
Yan

269
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,730
males also bite females

270
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,270
during the meeting period. He's

271
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,620
a little bit of a rough lover.

272
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,270
So you have the male and the female
biting each other in the face.

273
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,020
So a devil with a tumor on its face.

274
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,650
Let's say it's meeting with another devil
and it bites that second devil in the

275
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:03,100
face. What exactly happens at that point?
Is it just rubbing its tumor? Okay.

276
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,070
When you think of these big ugly
tumors, think of Feta Cheese

277
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,310
and when one devil bites another, there's
a tendency for the tumor to crumble.

278
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,910
And to shed tumor cells that then fall
into the wounds on the second devil.

279
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,040
But um, some of your,
I don't understand. Um,

280
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,800
why wouldn't the immune system of the
devils kill those sales prevent those

281
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,620
cells from taking root? Yeah. Cause
that's what immune systems do.

282
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,840
And the latest answer is that,

283
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:38,841
well Tasmanian devils don't have as much
genetic diversity as you would expect.

284
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,440
Whether that means David explained to us
is that the Tasmanian devil population

285
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,300
has gotten so inbred,

286
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,330
they are so alike at a genetic level
that their immune systems now confused.

287
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,270
They don't know the difference between
their own cells and invading cells coming

288
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,920
in from other devils. Exactly.

289
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,580
Which doesn't actually sound like
the tumor is all that powerful.

290
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,960
So I asked Carlo Maley,

291
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,500
you got a mutation that this is really
the story of a tumor evolving more

292
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,160
adaptive or is it just the story of
a tumor getting lucky them those,

293
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,560
I think those are the same
story. How do you mean?

294
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,260
I mean evolution is all about dumb luck.

295
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,663
The way you explained it.

296
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,240
It's dumb luck that the tumor
was on the outside of the face.

297
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,430
It's dumb luck that they
bite each other a lot.

298
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,960
That a cell could come along that
could shed and fall into a wound.

299
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,100
It's all dumb luck. But that he
says is what makes evolution happen.

300
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,070
That's natural selection right
there. And when you step back,

301
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,750
sometimes the results are just

302
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,450
nuts. Yeah, just nuts.

303
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,590
And this is the point where we need to
talk about a transmissible tumor in,

304
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,570
in dogs, canine transmissible
venereal tumor. This is a tumor.

305
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:53,920
He says it's evolved way beyond the
one in the devils and way longer.

306
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,330
How long has that been going on?

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Well that's been going on for
somewhere between 220 500 years.

308
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,130
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Between 220 500 years.

309
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah. Yes. Unit. Yes. Over
to millennia. Exactly.

310
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
And if that's the case then it's the
oldest continuous animals cell line in

311
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,460
existence on planet earth. You
might need to say that again

312
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,180
cause that is just too strange.
It is. It is. Even stranger,

313
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,380
it says David Kwaman.

314
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,280
When a tumor lives this long
propagates itself this long,

315
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,750
you can only really call it one thing.
This tumor is essentially an animal

316
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,140
parasite, not a species of parasite,

317
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,740
but one individual parasite
that may never die.

318
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,113
[inaudible]

319

Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

324
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:32,960
The topic is totally tumor. Of course.
That's my line by the way. Oh No, no,

325
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,490
it's okay. Yeah. We've been
talking about tumors this hour,

326
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:39,980
famous tumors and thus far they've been
really bad. Terrible tumors, really bad,

327
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,970
very horrible tumors, but because
we are fair minded about everything,

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,780
even tumors, let us consider the
that sometimes tumors can be rich,

329
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,500
beautiful and desirable. For example,

330
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:53,860
well,

331
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,860
George Malley is an ordinary man who is
about to become extraordinary name as

332
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:03,830
many mammals as you can in 60
seconds. How about alphabet? Are Brock

333
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,390
Bat Caribou Dauphine OHIP
this what is going on?

334
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,690
Or you're taking this 1996
movie. John Travolta plays a guy,

335
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,130
gets a brain tumor and the tumor, the
performance makes him into a genius

336
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,670
[inaudible] into Portuguese language
in 20 minutes. Not all of it phenomenon

337
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,280
the accent though to where
it doesn't give accents,

338
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,530
but it does. It does raise a
feel question, which is like,

339
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,880
is it possible for a tumor
to create something good?

340
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,770
So we paid a visit to a guy,
a doctor named Orrin Devinsky.

341
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm a neurologist at NYU
mango and school of Medicine

342
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,050
and Dr Devinsky has had a
lifelong interest in the
beneficial effects of certain

343
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,190
kinds of brain conditions. Right?

344
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,710
I mean I would just tell you,

345
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,640
I think one of the most fascinating
cases in neurology very quickly,

346
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,850
and this one we were not prepared for.

347
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,870
A gentleman was described who ever since
he was a child would look at safety

348
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:08,550
pins and have an orgasm at
safety pins and safety pins.

349
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,550
The more shiny and the more
numerous, the safety pin,

350
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,870
the stronger the sexual experience. And
this happened from his pubescent period.

351
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,830
He just safety [inaudible] pretty.

352
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,540
He made this association when you looked
at a safety pin, he had an orgasm.

353
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,350
So he got to have been embarrassed by
this. This is worse than being, yeah.

354
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,860
So he would go into pride. He realized
this is not something most people do.

355
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,970
We never talked about it.

356
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,960
And he did it in private and then
he got married after the war.

357
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:38,280
He was honorably discharged and got
married and then started having less sex

358
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,990
with his wife because the safety pin was,

359
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,880
my safety pins were much more enjoyable.

360
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:45,150
Sometimes you just had to think about
a safety pin, not even hold it up.

361
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,000
So wait,

362
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,600
what are we seriously making the case
that this guy is getting a benefit from

363
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,310
furiously pin obsession.

364
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:55,940
But I think actually you could say that
the experiences that this guy was having

365
00:22:55,941 --> 00:23:00,290
with those safety pins gave him a kind
of pleasure that maybe is unavailable to

366
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,620
the rest of us from an odd,
odd source. But you know,

367
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,470
pleasure is pleasure until says Devinsky.

368
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,930
This fellow began to have seizures,

369
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,340
got admitted to a psychiatric hospital
in London and Maudsley one of the big

370
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,750
psychiatric units. They actually got
an EEG. And to make a long story short,

371
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,010
there was a benign tumor.

372
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,620
Oh right in the part that's
called the temporal lobe,

373
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:22,780
sort of in the middle of your
head, right behind your eyes.

374
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,310
But they took it out. They took it,

375
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,350
they took it out and they cured
him of his wonderful experience.

376
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,150
So he, uh, he never was able to, he
could look at safety pins all day long,

377
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:39,440
but he would never again enjoy them
the way he had for his whole life.

378
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,280
How did he feel about that? Um,

379
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,810
I think it was a mixed
blessing as you would imagine.

380
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,550
[inaudible]

381
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,550
blue jeans on sneakers and this idea that
from a tumor you can get something in

382
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,480
the not so good, but also something
good. This is an idea that has, well,

383
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,210
there has been a, a novel
written on this theme.

384
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,240
The title of the book is lying
awake by a friend of mine.

385
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,770
My name is Mark Salzman.

386
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,580
Mark is a writer who lives out
in California and he thought,

387
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm going to imagine a nun or main
characters, sister John of the cross.

388
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,570
This is a woman who had joined a nunnery
because she felt just lonely for a

389
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,030
relationship with God.

390
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,380
Yes. It's just not enough for her
to tell herself. Yes, God is there.

391
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,390
What she longs for is a tangible
sense of God's presence,

392
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,770
a sense that she can really
feel God's presence in her life.

393
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,380
And um, she,

394
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:44,150
she begins having what she thinks are
migraine headaches that the regular doctor

395
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:48,020
that the sisters see tells her that she
seems to be having migraine headaches.

396
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,400
They're coming more and more frequently.

397
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,400
And there comes a point when one of
these headaches changes dramatically and

398
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:59,750
then everything is different. Everything
is different. What's different? Well,

399
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,730
what happens? Shall I
read? Yeah, go ahead. You,

400
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,340
you kind of have to imagine this scene
taking place in an environment of

401
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,510
profound silence.

402
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,820
Okay.

403
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,590
She's in the cloister.

404
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,730
She and one other sister that
working on a sewing project,

405
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:16,990
they're sewing an altar cloth.

406
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,810
One of the pins slipped out of her hand

407
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,320
ringing like a miniature triangle
is it bounced off the floor.

408
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,250
She looked down to the floor and saw that
it looked impossibly distant when she

409
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:33,390
reached down for the pin.

410
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,260
Her hand look strangest of all as
if it belonged to someone else.

411
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,480
[inaudible].

412
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,530
The silence in the room came alive
like the words left out of a poem.

413
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,710
[inaudible]

414
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,830
something buried so deep inside her,
but she'd forgotten it was there.

415
00:25:53,831 --> 00:25:57,730
Rose to the surface sister.
Are you not feeling well?

416
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,270
God was present and sister and
his voice was present in her face.

417
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,970
Nothing was changed yet everything was
changed. God is here. She answered.

418
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,810
You were here all along.

419
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,940
Well this is a field goal, isn't it?

420
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:21,980
For someone seeking a spiritual
connection. She has one.

421
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,450
That's right. She f this is the moment
she's been waiting for all her life,

422
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,930
but there is a problem because when these
things come from, sorry, just give me,

423
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,250
she has a tumor. Let's just get
the non surprise out of the way.

424
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:39,310
The show is called totally tumor. A
cost of all with famous tumors. Okay.

425
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,350
Do we do client? Yes. She has
a meningioma, a benign tumor,

426
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,220
small about the size of a raisin in
the temporal lobe area of her brain.

427
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,920
Right in the same spot where the
safety pin fellow had his tomb.

428
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,870
So the problem for her is
should I have the tumor removed?

429
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,940
Give up the most satisfying and
fulfilling experience of my whole life,

430
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,510
or should I sacrifice my health in order
to share with others the experiences

431
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:09,990
that I'm having? So we
thought, well, Orrin Devinsky,

432
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:11,190
the doctor we spoke with first.

433
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,880
I think every case is unique, and
individuals see patients like this.

434
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,770
This is what he does for them.
So we took the case to him.

435
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,600
Now here's the question.
If a person comes and says,

436
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm having what I want

437
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,280
and you are suspicious that what
she also is having is a disease,

438
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,490
what do you do about
the patient? If I knew

439
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,470
for sure that the tumor, let's say
was benign and would never grow,

440
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,640
and the only thing that person experienced
was this religious feeling that

441
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:44,700
they've found extremely
enjoyable, I would say,

442
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:48,510
let's do nothing but do serial scans to
make sure nothing grows and that you're

443
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:51,810
safe. But in the book, as it
happens, the nun got a little worse.

444
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:52,980
She had a few more

445
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,900
headaches, the more severe,
and they took the tumor out,

446
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,700
the seizure activity stops.

447
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,150
These experiences stopped coming

448
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,900
and she does feel afterwards
a sense of [inaudible],

449
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,143
blah.

450
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,040
She feels as if she sort of tumbled out
of a Himalayan mountain into a muddy

451
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,874
village.

452
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,923
[inaudible]

453
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,830
this is common apparently in patients
after they've been treated. Right.

454
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,690
So my last question then
is really about the,

455
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,590
it seems to me the deepest question
though, all in this case is that, um,

456
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,610
if someone has a very important
and meaningful experience
and you have a sense,

457
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,700
it may be a abnormality, a physical
abnormality that is triggering them,

458
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,570
do you regard them as delusional?

459
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,490
Like there's just the possibility here
that maybe these people are having an

460
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:54,500
actual conversation. So yeah,
there's no question there are just,

461
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,130
you not even consider that.
No, I mean, so science, I think

462
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,190
the question you asked and I think you're
getting at is could it truly be that

463
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,880
this is God's avenue to speak to us? Um,

464
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:08,240
and people in the late 18 hundreds thought
it was through the right hemisphere.

465
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:10,760
And that's often where these cases
occur in the right hemisphere.

466
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:14,690
So it may be that. That's right.
It's the more emotional hemisphere.

467
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:17,720
And when things are in a perturbed state,

468
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,750
you may be more receptive to
experiencing spiritual things.

469
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,520
And I think there probably is some
physiologic basis that allows you to tune

470
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:33,521
into a broader world and maybe some
states of neurologic dysfunction allow you

471
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:37,820
to harmonize or tune in or receive
those messages so to speak.

472
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,100
In which case then your
tumor or your would

473
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,740
be the window where the conduit, right.

474
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,470
I do feel like I need to
place an asterix right here.

475
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,040
We are talking about a
tumor in the end. Well,

476
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,300
but understand that every feeling,

477
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,980
every thought you have comes
from cells in your brain.

478
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:57,670
Yeah.

479
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,290
Any of those cells can produce a glorious
experience than the experienced stands

480
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,520
on its own and sometimes in
very well documented cases.

481
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,420
These are extraordinarily profound,

482
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,800
desirable thing. They're often hard
to put into words. Have you tried,

483
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,450
I mean when, yeah, I mean people,

484
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,690
you know Destro Yefsky is probably the
most articulate person with epilepsy

485
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,720
who's had a religious experience and
who wrote down what he experienced.

486
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't have the quote in front of me,
but it's, you know, this Felicity, this,

487
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,570
this a feeling I get

488
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,060
for several moments. He
was quoting his ashes.

489
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,680
I would experience such joy as would
be inconceivable in ordinary life.

490
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,870
I would feel the most complete harmony
in myself and in the whole world and this

491
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,060
feeling was so strong and sweet.

492
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,730
[inaudible]

493
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,700
that for a few seconds of
such bliss, I would give

494
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,190
[inaudible]

495
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,380
10 or more years of my life

496
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,680
[inaudible]

497
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,270
even my whole life.

498
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,020
[inaudible]

499
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,853
perhaps.

500
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,193
Hi.

501
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,390
Hi. This is Emily calling from
rainy Vancouver, Washington.

506
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,150
hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

507
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,260
This is Radiolab and our topic today
is totally two minutes. Yeah, yeah,

508
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:41,410
totally. What you call it, what
you want. It doesn't matter.

509
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,090
It doesn't matter because
the topic is tumors,

510
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,650
famous tumors and our next and
final tumor related tale is one.

511
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,170
We're wanting to do this particular
tumor story for [inaudible]

512
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,270
forever or after like two years ago,
I think. Oh, longer than that. Yeah.

513
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,180
It's a story that comes from a
friend of mine, Rebecca Skloot.

514
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,460
You want me to talk,
make noise. That's true.

515
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,690
I think we can move me closer to him.

516
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,140
She's a journalist and she
has been wanting to tell
this story even longer since

517
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:08,590
she was in the womb. I mean, she's been
researching the story for 10 years.

518
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,483
Hello, hello, hello.

519
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,060
And she just wrote a book
called the immortal life of
Henrietta lacks and in the

520
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:17,470
story, okay, it's about a tumor
that expands and never stops.

521
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Begins in 1950 a black woman in Baltimore
is in her bathroom and she discovers

522
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:27,760
pretty much all on her own. Did
she has cancer? Um, it's all,

523
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,490
it's a little bit of a mystery
how she initially knew this,

524
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,020
but she knew it was there.

525
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,770
[inaudible]

526
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,190
I'm not, she called it. She
had told to her for a while

527
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,790
that she thought there was something
wrong with her, with her womb,

528
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,800
and she climbed into her bathroom and
she slid her fingers up inside of herself

529
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,330
and found this lump

530
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,613
chapter one

531
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,580
first she went into her local doctor.

532
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,200
I happened to be an
attending at that time.

533
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,500
The guy she eventually ended up
seeing at Johns Hopkins University.

534
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,560
Who is this fellow? Dr.
Howard Jones. I'm 98.

535
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:09,580
Next month I'll be 99 wow. So
when she came in to see you,

536
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,930
can you tell me anything about what
she was like? Well, she was a uh,

537
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,970
uh, you didn't remember
anything? No, I really don't.

538
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,100
But you remember her tumor,
right? Well, absolutely.

539
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,990
I never saw anything
like it before or after

540
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,250
[inaudible]

541
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,040
and this didn't look like
a normal tumor. It was,

542
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,990
it was deep purple and about as
big as a quarter, sort of shiny,

543
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,150
very soft. That was another
thing. I bet it on examination,

544
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,760
slightly raised when you touched it,
you might think it was a red Jello.

545
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,470
There was something very
strange about the way it looks.

546
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,880
[inaudible]

547
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,010
so doctors took a sample? Yeah.

548
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:50,040
So they would cut off these little
teeny tiny pieces and see Haley,

549
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,890
small King Dang bite or two,
they would take a piece,

550
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,350
put it in a tube and one would
go to the lab for diagnosis.

551
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
And in this case since it was Hopkins,

552
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,810
they would take an extra piece and
give it to the man named George Guy

553
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,070
too. So George Guy was a
researcher who worked at Hopkins.

554
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,490
He had a deal with the clinic that
anytime they got a patient with cervical

555
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:13,600
cancer, they'd give him a tiny piece of
the tumor. What he really wanted to do,

556
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:16,750
his main mission, actually, not
just his scientists everywhere,

557
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,860
we're trying to do this.

558
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,950
They want it to find a way to grow human
cells outside of a human being in a

559
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:26,590
dish, in a dish. George Guy
had been trying to do this,

560
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,300
working on this for decades. And
why exactly. Um, it's sort of like,

561
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,910
it's sort of like having a
little tiny bit of a person in a,

562
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:37,750
in a lab that's detached from them so
that you can do whatever you want with

563
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:38,590
them. You know,

564
00:34:38,591 --> 00:34:42,430
you can't bombard some person with a
bunch of drugs and just wait to see how

565
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:44,680
much they can tolerate before
their cells all explode.

566
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,830
But you can do that in cell
culture. So, oh, so this is like,

567
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,740
this is like the basic thing
you need to study human biology.

568
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,660
You need cells in a dish. Yes.

569
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,760
Problem was anytime they tried
to grow human cells in a dish,

570
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,810
my daughters, they would
die. Yeah, they die.

571
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,200
This is George Guy's former lab
assistant. Can you just tell me your name?

572
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,660
You know, my name is so
and so. My name is Mary.

573
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,170
I'll put my maiden name in there.
Oh sure. Toy Cooper cheque.

574
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,510
Mary lives just outside of Baltimore.

575
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:20,590
About an hour from where she used to
work with George guys. This is Dr. Guy.

576
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,140
Just show me some pictures and he's
sitting at, at a microscope we can have,

577
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,940
he looks, he's a, he seems like a
really big guy. Like a really tall guy.

578
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,600
He was a big guy. At least six, five
judging from the picture. Yeah, he was.

579
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,140
And in every slide that she showed me,
he had kind of a crazy smile on his face.

580
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,040
Like he's got a, like he's
having a good bear if a man,

581
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,140
that's what I always thought up.

582
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,370
Oh yeah. In any case.

583
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,270
Mary says they were completely stumped
at why the human cells always died,

584
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,460
but they just did. Yeah. So on
the day that George Guy Walked in,

585
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,910
handed Mary a two with a little chunk
of a nameless woman cervical cancer

586
00:35:52,911 --> 00:35:55,760
inside, I knew nothing about
her. No one expected anything.

587
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,680
No. He was doing that. Well he probably,
yeah, ever hopeful. But you know,

588
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,740
I was eating lunch and I thought,
oh the heck with it. You know,

589
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:07,910
it's not going to grow. I'm going to
finish the sandwich. And that's what I did

590
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
three. Then I went in and
she gave the, sell some food,

591
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,650
get my usual turn on all
the machines and left,

592
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,710
came back the next day they hadn't died.

593
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,030
So she came back the next day and they
were growing and then the next day still

594
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,710
growing. They just kept

595
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,720
plugging along in the next through a lot.

596
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,400
Rebecca says they doubled in size
every 24 hours. Yeah, they just grew.

597
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,480
All of a sudden, you know, I kept
transferring them and making more tubes,

598
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,330
transferring them, making
more tubes to transferring.

599
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,210
They weren't very reliable and stronger.

600
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,610
They just kept plugging
along and alone. Meanwhile,

601
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:50,930
the woman had spawned all
these cells die right?

602
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,890
Officially she died of uremia,

603
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,760
which is a like toxicity of the blood
because she wasn't able to get rid of the

604
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,650
toxic waste. That usually goes out in
your urine log in the log in the wall,

605
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,563
not herself,

606
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,480
and to tell us this story, is it
privileged to introduce Dr. George Guy?

607
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,600
It wasn't long after the
George Guy appeared on TV
holding in his hand a little

608
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,000
bottle.

609
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,980
Now let me show you a bottle,

610
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,780
which we have rolling my fifth
quantity of caster style.

611
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,460
So did you want to look at the photos?

612
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,120
Yeah.

613
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,960
You can't really get a sense of how
aggressive this tumor was until you go to

614
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:27,410
the Hopkins Archives and looked at
George guys pictures and videos. Okay,

615
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,490
this is Ken here. Halo Cell
Film. Then it hits you.

616
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,900
They use her in large 10,000 times.

617
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,680
Oh my God. Swirling hurricanes of cells,

618
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,073
just like thousands of them,

619
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,490
some small and some very large together.

620
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,640
Kept transferring them and making
more to them under the mic.

621
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,380
It's like something is just
explode. You're going to

622
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,280
[inaudible] just keeps getting
bigger and bigger and stronger.

623
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,150
It's indestructable, it's
indescribable. Nothing can stop me.

624
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,410
Why? Hers just sort of took off and grew
and the other ones that they had tried

625
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:09,170
before, it didn't is just
a little bit of a mystery.

626
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,770
Nobody really knows fore unless
George Guy knew what he had.

627
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,260
This new cell line was what they'd
all been waiting for. So early on,

628
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,730
right after this woman died,

629
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,140
George Guy sent Mary back down to get
more cancer cells from the [inaudible].

630
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,750
Oh, he sent me down to the
morgue. Yeah. Really? Oh yeah.

631
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,610
So I went down there and the
coroner, I don't know who he was.

632
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,260
Dr. Guy was there too and they were
standing down at her feet sort of. Yeah.

633
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,830
Meanwhile, she's like, she's flying
out there. She's already open.

634
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,950
I got some samples, coroner. We're
taking them out and getting a, Timmy,

635
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,900
what'd she look like? I couldn't look
at her face. I couldn't look at her.

636
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,310
The only thing I looked at were her toes
and they had chip nail Polish on them.

637
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,430
And that was really like,
oh this is a real person.

638
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,030
What was it about the
nail Polish that hit you?

639
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,320
Oh cause it was chipped cause you know
that she hadn't been able to take care of

640
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:11,990
her nails for a long time if
they got chipped like that.

641
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,620
And it's showed that she
was proud of herself.

642
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,860
Not everyone wears nail
Polish on their toes. Yeah.

643
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,313
Yeah.

644
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,650
Over the next several months while this
woman's body lay decomposing in the

645
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:25,484
ground,

646
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,590
George Guy and Mary produced hundreds
of thousands of her cells or tumor cells

647
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:34,550
and he named them the heela
strain. Heela like Heela,

648
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,060
h e l a [inaudible].

649
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,410
No one would actually know why he had
named them that for about two decades.

650
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,670
But what he did with these cells,
you know, we'd be unusual nowadays,

651
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:46,130
like if somebody now found
a cell that was special,

652
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:49,880
they'd run off to the patent office
and then sell it to Merck for 1 billion

653
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,060
bucks. But George Guy, hey,
just pass them out freely.

654
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,910
Didn't try and make any
money off it. It was just

655
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,450
nice, nice new thing
that could help science.

656
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,250
It's Mary says that George Guy began
to send Hilo all over the world. Yup.

657
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,320
And pretty soon she was in
hundreds of labs. And you know,

658
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:09,310
this was in the midst of
the polio epidemic season
when polio was at its worst.

659
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,720
We're talking early fifties right?
Yeah. So there's 1951 52 you know,

660
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,710
schools are being closed,
kids are being kept inside

661
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,490
today's cruel disease. Medical
science still has no complete onset.

662
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,500
There was this enormous effort
to develop a polio vaccine.

663
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,000
Problem was in order to develop a vaccine,
you had to have enough polio virus,

664
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,400
you know enough quantity to be
able to study it in the lab.

665
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,020
And they had no way of making enough. So
whether they do, well, one of the guys,

666
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:38,560
that guy, one of the guys that
guy had sent the cells to,

667
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,890
this collaborator friend of guys
discovered something kind of amazing,

668
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,890
which was that polio loved the heela sell,

669
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,550
put polio inside a Hilo cell healer
would copy and in the process make more

670
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:52,350
polio, which the Super Xerox sale, no
matter what you want to do, they'll look,

671
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,310
make a copy, make a copy
and make it a copy. Yeah.

672
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,240
So now they had a way of making polio
that could just be a polio factory.

673
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,220
And so the government made a factory
at the Tuskegee Institute, a real one,

674
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:04,690
literally a factory. So they had

675
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,240
these big, you know,

676
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,210
stainless steel and have that sort of
culture medium that were sort of rotated

677
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,470
constantly autoclaves for
sterilizing all equipment,

678
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,430
five microscopes, crazy
frankensteinish gizmos.

679
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,710
They had this machine that was like an
automatic settle dispenser and it had

680
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:29,090
this sort of long mechanical arm in
Squirt a certain amount of this cultural

681
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:32,390
medium filled with Hilo
cells into it to wow,

682
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:35,360
this is like the beauty of industry
right here. Yeah, it is absolutely.

683
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,580
The cells that were produced
at this factory. She says,

684
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,980
we're used to test the polio
vaccine back clean to prevent that,

685
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,000
but rather disease. The test
that they were doing in north,

686
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,410
it was the largest field
trial ever done at its peak.

687
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,303
The tests [inaudible]

688
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,700
he lived production center was producing
about 6 trillion cells a week. Wow.

689
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,400
Um, which is kind of inconceivable,

690
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,530
but that was actually only
the beginning says Rebecca,

691
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:03,580
because this factory led to an even
bigger one that was for profit. Right.

692
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,590
And that second factory was the first
time any human biological material was

693
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:12,130
commercialized. So this was the first
biotech company? Yeah, basically. Okay.

694
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,710
When they first started
mass producing healer, uh,

695
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,660
what sorts of things
were done to these cells?

696
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:20,430
What sorts of problems were investigated?
Like anything you can imagine.

697
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,190
So they infected the Hilo cells with
every kind of virus and hepatitis e Coyne

698
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:31,870
and cephalitis virus, yellow fever,
herpes, measles, mumps, rabies, whatever.

699
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,970
Like you, just any, any
backs. And this was just as,

700
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,530
there's a revolution for scientists
in certain chemotherapy drugs.

701
00:42:38,531 --> 00:42:42,750
He loves sales went up and some of the
first space missions. Really? Yeah.

702
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,580
So they were, Hilo went
into space, into space.

703
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,900
And every time I hear
what I think you'd be like

704
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,060
[inaudible] why?

705
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:56,140
I mean just because the premise was to
see what happens to human cells in zero

706
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:56,831
gravity, you know,

707
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:59,050
if we're going to be sending people up
into space and what's gonna happen to

708
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:02,780
them up there? No. So Hilo went
up before any humans did. Um,

709
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,440
and then she eventually
went up his, she the cells.

710
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,900
There was actually an interesting
little slip up there. Yeah, I know.

711
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,200
Okay. So let's actually skip forward
in the story to the point where that,

712
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,700
that slip up,

713
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,700
you just heard that pronoun
confusion gets personal.

714
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,260
No. Well it happens. Okay.

715
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:28,150
It's a late sixties and a Hilo has it
led to a revolution in science and now

716
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:29,650
there are hundreds of cell lines,

717
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,350
not just he live at hundreds
and somewhere along the way,

718
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,850
scientists discover that Hella is so
aggressive that she's actually been

719
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:41,020
contaminating and taking over all of
these other cell lines where you just had

720
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:43,170
she, but I get your point. Yeah.

721
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,950
And she does it in the way it
does it in the strangest way.

722
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,140
Keela cells can, you know, they can
float on dust particles [inaudible]

723
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,840
they can what? Um, they can
float on dust particles.

724
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,140
Yeah. So they can, you mean
they can hop out of addition,

725
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:04,070
just get on a particle and
just float out the door,

726
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,310
up the stairs, down the hall, and
he'll sell into a lab rops into,

727
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,930
into a dish or cell culture where
there's other sales growing.

728
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,880
And because he was cells, her sort
of powerful cells, they takeover.

729
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:26,120
So on the heels of this catastrophe,
someone at Hopkins decides to make a test.

730
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,650
Let's make a test that will allow us to
genetically determine if a cell is heela

731
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:31,980
or if

732
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,600
it isn't. And to make a long story short,

733
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:39,170
this desire for a genetic
test led scientists and
journalists to ask a question,

734
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:44,790
which amazingly, for 25 years had
not been asked who was this woman?

735
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,430
And that's when we found out
her name Henrietta lacks.

736
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,190
This is the sound of Rebecca reading.

737
00:44:57,191 --> 00:44:59,080
Henry had his medical
records for the first time.

738
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,390
This is a 30 year old colored woman.

739
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,440
She's sitting with Henrietta's,
his youngest daughter,
Deborah, second November.

740
00:45:08,441 --> 00:45:12,700
So this is again when she was pregnant
with you and Brianna had five kids when

741
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:16,540
she died at the age of 31 most have
no memory of her because they were too

742
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,480
young. And that's
especially true of Debbie.

743
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,890
That was only 15 months old and I don't
remember anything about my mother.

744
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,820
Yeah. So she, you know, she,

745
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,650
she had been her entire life just sort
of longing to know who her mother was.

746
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:31,450
And did she like dancing? You know,

747
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:35,770
I always wanted to know what
she liked to do, what she went,

748
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,650
where she liked to eat.
Did she breastfeed Deborah?

749
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,470
She was really sort of
almost fixated on that idea.

750
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,300
She wanted to know if she was breasted.

751
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,170
Oh, well, you know, I don't know
what I would give up just to,

752
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,540
just to have her here
as hey, just to see her

753
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,800
the whole, Huh.

754
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,160
So in 1973 when a scientist calls the
lacks family and Deborah hears that little

755
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:05,041
bits of the mother that she never knew
are still alive and oh by the way,

756
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,030
can we take a blood test
from you and your family?

757
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,940
Cause we're having some contamination
problem. We need these genetic markers,

758
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:11,710
blah, blah, blah. Well,
as you could imagine,

759
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,980
took me by surprise. It really did.

760
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,300
It was really confusing.

761
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,380
I mean, how much is it, how much of
ourselves is out there? You know,

762
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,980
eventually she went online,

763
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,970
did some searches and found thousands
and thousands of hits. Like for instance,

764
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:26,900
on Heela clones. And
Deborah had heard, you know,

765
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,060
various journalists in the past had
come to her and mentioned, you know,

766
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,260
Dolly the clone sheep and
sad, you know, your mom,

767
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,910
they did this with your mom too.

768
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,220
Meaning that's actually
where the technology started.

769
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:41,060
The first cells of our cloned were Hila
cells. But that was just cloning a cell,

770
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,200
not cloning an entire being. But
that distinction is very complicated,

771
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,320
particularly for somebody who doesn't
know what a cell is. Yeah. Um, so Deborah,

772
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,510
between what journalists had told her
and googling Henrietta lacks and clone

773
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,700
thought there were thousands of clones
of her mother around. And really,

774
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,660
you mean like a bunch of Henrietta's
thousands walking the streets,

775
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:01,494
walking around.

776
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,060
And Rebecca says that one
of Debra's biggest fears was
bumping into one of these

777
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:06,590
clones. She said, you know, she would say,

778
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:09,710
I would have to go talk to her and she
wouldn't know that I was her daughter

779
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:12,470
and, and, and I don't know
that I could handle that. Wow.

780
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,170
It sounds so fantastical. Like
how could someone believe that?

781
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,790
Are Copies of her mother walking around?

782
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,290
But at one point 25 years after their
mother died, someone called and said, Hey,

783
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,820
part of her still alive. And you know,

784
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:26,180
we've grown enough of her so that it
could wrap around the earth several times.

785
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,670
At that point, all bets are
off. Yeah, right, exactly.

786
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,960
Not to mention that it's actually not
that crazy because your DNA is in your

787
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:38,740
cells. So if your cells are taken
out of you and they still grow,

788
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,840
well, isn't that still
you alive? It's of you.

789
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,260
But it's clearly not you
and the then it's going on.

790
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,370
[inaudible] it's a funny middle
space, that's for sure. Yeah,

791
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,890
so here's what happened is Rebecca
went off in search of Henrietta lacks.

792
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,480
Every so often Deborah would come along
and sit with her as they interviewed,

793
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:05,500
you know, anyone they could find friends,
family, and eventually over many,

794
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:09,280
many years, a picture does emerge

795
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,980
of who this woman is. She
was born in, in Roanoke,

796
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,040
1920 Virginia and I think she
was the 10th of the 11 children,

797
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,450
but apparently she was
the one that stood out.

798
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,700
Everybody talked about her as just
being, you know, she was the cat.

799
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,540
Oh my goodness. I don't
think I could top her.

800
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,050
This is Sadie Sturdivan
Henrietta's cousin.

801
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:35,090
That's a beautiful girl.
I was doing it for myself,

802
00:48:35,091 --> 00:48:39,310
but hit it was very pretty Grana. Oh Hey.

803
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,220
And this is Henrietta's sister Gladys

804
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,780
and completion.

805
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,140
Everyone that they spoke with
zeroed in on the same few points.

806
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,210
Like first she was really meticulous
about her nails, always painted them red.

807
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,840
It's very deep. Red And second
Henrietta just had this,

808
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,980
she was very strength,
forthright, very sassy.

809
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,860
Like yourselves. Now,

810
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,110
the unfortunate thing is that when it
comes to her life, you know how she lived.

811
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,150
There's not a ton of detail.

812
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,700
Totally. So this is when she
crushed my hand with your cancer.

813
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,120
But in that hotel room,
when the two of them,

814
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:18,450
we're flipping through the medical
records, they did start to get some detail

815
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,480
about how she died. Things
I want to take notes about.

816
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,160
Was she in a lot of pain
when she died? Yeah,

817
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:30,810
I heard this was the hardest thing that
she was eventually in an unbelievable

818
00:49:30,811 --> 00:49:31,460
amount,

819
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,020
Dean's complains of pain in
the right lower quadrant,

820
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,390
wailing and crying and you know,
moaning for the Lord to help her.

821
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:41,510
And according to the records,
doctors tried everything. Morphine,

822
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,570
they injected a hundred percent
alcohol straight into her spine.

823
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,380
I the pain spider, the
alcohol injection last week.

824
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,000
And she would have these fits of pain

825
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:52,720
[inaudible]

826
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,750
to spasms where this waves of pain would
hit her and she would rise up out of

827
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,130
the bed and thrash around.

828
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,780
So they strapped her to the
bed and her sister will,

829
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,000
along with one of her friends,

830
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:06,321
you know,

831
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:09,050
one of them would tighten the straps and
the other one would put a pillow in her

832
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:10,820
mouth so that she
wouldn't bite her tongue.

833
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,790
Yes, if I only just had the chair.

834
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,570
So take care of her.

835
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:23,980
Now dealing with how her
mother died was one thing,

836
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,710
but the cells made it more complicated.

837
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,180
Whatever apparent her mother was
alive in these cells somehow.

838
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,600
So if that's true, that
left very big questions.

839
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,610
And the first of them for Debra was,

840
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,640
how can Henrietta rest in peace if part
of her with part of her soul is being,

841
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,311
you know,

842
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:43,550
shot up to the moon and injected with
all these chemicals in a radiated and

843
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,384
bombarded,

844
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,140
painful. No one, you know,

845
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,940
that had her shelves on the back
of a donkey going to Turkey,

846
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,900
you know, in the air planes
just going all over the world.

847
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,730
Uh, uh, I just don't know

848
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,550
if she worried about them. She
worried that it hurts her mother.

849
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:06,550
When you infect the cells with Ebola,

850
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:11,230
does somehow her mother feel the pain
that comes with Ebola and a scientist ever

851
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,790
like sat down with her and yeah,

852
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:19,280
me just explained to her like this
is no, never, nothing cause it's spy.

853
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,760
It just strikes me that it wouldn't
be that hard to explain it.

854
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:23,770
Like when you take cells out of a body,

855
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:27,130
it's kind of like when you cut your
fingernail off, it just doesn't,

856
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:29,950
but your finger nail doesn't keep
growing and living after you cut it off.

857
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,390
It's a, it's really hard.

858
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:35,260
There is no other example of some way
that you can take something from someone's

859
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:40,261
body and have it keep living and not have
a person feel it and all these worries

860
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,770
says Rebecca began to build in
Deborah's mind and build and build.

861
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,390
There came at this point, wait,
so we were at her cousin's house.

862
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,800
This is her cousin Gary.

863
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,000
She was broken out in hives and she was
telling him all the stuff that she'd

864
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,790
recently learned. You can almost
hear it on the tape. She says to him,

865
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,820
[inaudible]

866
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,230
she can't carry the burden of these
cells anymore. She can't [inaudible]

867
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,190
okay. I don't want to cut.

868
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,720
And I had been sort of trying to talk
her down and he was trying to talk her

869
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:11,554
down

870
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,600
[inaudible]

871
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,330
and then just out of
nowhere, he just started

872
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,383
singing

873
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,343
[inaudible] Yo,

874
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,140
no. [inaudible] [inaudible]

875
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,543
Ooh.

876
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:38,040
[inaudible] no, those [inaudible]

877
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,610
and he started preaching
thing that doctors came,

878
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,630
that he held her head in his
hands and we'd come to you,

879
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,360
not the offer and the
finish of about Wifi.

880
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,120
And we thank you for being awake.
Mic. You make a path in the middle.

881
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,260
You call the Milton's a
skip lego rams and the Luma.

882
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,650
We thank you today.
Thank you all. Thank you.

883
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,980
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

884
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,040
[inaudible] hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah.

885
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,580
Hey Man. Hey Man.

886
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,803
[inaudible] [inaudible]

887
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,910
and she just relaxed. I like it, man.

888
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,600
I feel like, Huh?

889
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,170
She didn't realize it then, but that
night Debra was on the verge of a stroke.

890
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,380
Want to walk up into the
building? My Wall. Okay.

891
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:45,940
Do you mean he said
it's just up this hill.

892
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,120
One of the most striking moments of this
story is when the two of them, yeah,

893
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,300
visit Hopkins, I feel, yeah,
they'll lots of good and yeah.

894
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,750
Deborah meets her mother's
cells for the first time.

895
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,870
I shouldn't have, I'll show
you the bathroom and I can
show you by itself. Okay.

896
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,980
Because the scientists had finally
contacted. Sure. Christopher Lingara,

897
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:06,740
the scientist who invited us
into his lab to see the cells,

898
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,200
he had projected them onto a screen.

899
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,600
Big confused. They look green here. Okay.

900
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,210
They're so neon green
in this particular case,

901
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:17,010
because of the way they were
stained and projected. Um,

902
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,910
so they're very ethereal looking.
They're very [inaudible].

903
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:23,760
It's sort of there. The glow, you know,
I mean, when you think about angels,

904
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,320
right? You think of something glowing.

905
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,270
Christoph turned on this
screen and she just, I mean,

906
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,400
Deborah just gasp. She just,

907
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,400
Oh, [inaudible]

908
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,700
what was I saying? About 200 times
bigger than what they really are.

909
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,080
The swirling hurricane. Okay.

910
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,790
Did you say all that's my mother.

911
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,710
Yeah. Yeah.

912
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,010
Oh Christopher gave, he gave her a,

913
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:03,960
a vial of the cells that she could hold
in her hand and they came out of it out

914
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,860
of freezer. So they, they're very
cold and she sort of, you know,

915
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,070
rubbed her hands together with the bile
in her hands to sort of warm them up and

916
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,240
sort of blew on them
to keep them warm. Um,

917
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,990
and then she just sort of
whispered to the cells. It was, um,

918
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,980
sort of incredible. She just raised
them up to her lips and she said,

919
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,620
you're famous, but nobody knows it.

920
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,030
Before we close, I want to thank Rebecca
Skloot for giving us her raw tapes.

921
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,780
Her book,

922
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,620
the immortal life of Henrietta lacks is
truly spellbinding everything that we

923
00:56:11,621 --> 00:56:14,650
just did, very, very condensed
version of what's in that book.

924
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,580
You can get more information@radiolab.org
sign up for our podcast there,

925
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,960
radio lab.org before we go, we just want
to give a nod to our producer Layla.

926
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,850
We want to give a waved to her because
she's coming home. She's heading off.

927
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,760
She's leaving us after four and a half
years to go and be a writer at Grad

928
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:34,780
school. She writes a pretty good radio
piece, and you're gonna miss her for it.

929
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,350
And also for her great
awesomeness all around. So Lulu,

930
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:42,430
we love you and good
luck. I'm Jad Abumrad.

931
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,570
I'm Robert Krulwich.
