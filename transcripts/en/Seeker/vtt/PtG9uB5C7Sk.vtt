00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.610
I find it incredible that scientists can look
at a skull, just the skull… and determine

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.220
almost exactly who that person was.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.429
Skulls hold clues to our race, age, and sex.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.179
For example, just from a skull found in the
woods in 1988.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.410
Police were able to solve the case of a young
Asian woman whose husband was ultimately charged

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.859
with her murder.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.109
You probably know we all have fingerprints
but no two person’s prints are the same,

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.289
skulls are like this too; every individual’s
skull is different.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.900
Your parents determine how your skull is shaped
but your ancestry helps scientists identify

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.730
where you came from, and who you are.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700
Our skulls underlie how we look…

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.740
Things like the height of our cheekbones,
and the shape of our jaw determine our facial

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.420
features, but those don’t necessarily help
solve cases, they’re called nonmetric features

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.730
-- they’re too personal.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.210
But there are some general features all skulls
have that help identify who a skull belonged

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
to.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.420
One of the first questions anyone would have
looking at a solitary skull is whether it

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.210
came from a man or a woman.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.560
Men tend to have larger, thicker, heavier
skulls with a more pronounced ridge here...

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.590
in their temporal line, and a more pronounced
ridge over top of the eyes.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.240
Women have a slightly sharper surface on the
edge of their eye socket.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000
Skulls hold clues to age as well.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.280
The bones that make up the skull are separated
in babies but held together by fibrous bands

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.370
of tissue to allow the brain to grow.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.070
These are unique fibrous joints called cranial
sutures.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.810
As we age, the bones grow closer together
and the joints start to fuse.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260
The older we get, the more the sutures close.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.140
I’m sure someone is already down in the
comments asking about race.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.730
Skulls can reveal a lot about our race as
well, but, like with any of these characteristics

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.890
they’re not 100-percent.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.670
In fact, often skulls seem to indicate they
come from more than one racial group.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.909
Humans have evolved different features over
time as we’ve adapted to different environments,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.630
and our skulls show those clues to our ancestry.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.030
Take the nose for example.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.080
The nasal spine, the tiny little bit of bone
that supports the cartilage separating the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080
nostrils.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.100
In Asian populations, that bone tends to be
of moderate height.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.280
In Caucasian populations, it’s more prominent
and straighter.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.530
In African populations, it’s significantly
smaller or sometimes totally absent.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.850
And shapes of noses differ, too, anthropologists
think because of the climates we evolved in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.099
[re], and this is reflected in the shape and
size of the nasal cavities.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.629
Populations in the cooler climates of Europe
adapted by forming narrower noses to more

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.239
efficiently heat inhaled air, while populations
in warmer climates like Africa and South Asia

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.519
adapted with broader noses.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.079
And there are other distinguishing factors,
as well!

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.459
An oval-shaped window in the inner ear is
seen more in Caucasian populations than Native

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.219
American populations.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.659
There are also subtle differences between
populations in the shape of eye orbits, projection

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.420
of the lower jaw or forehead, shape and distance
between cheekbones, and forehead.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.769
There is so much you can learn from looking
at the big bone that makes up your face!

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.489
Of course, studying a skull alone isn’t
perfect.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.529
The case of the murdered woman hinged on the
skull, but also involved routine police work

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.560
and facial reconstruction…

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.129
But in any case, knowing a victim’s sex,
age and possible heritage can absolutely help

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.219
narrow the search and find a killer.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.689

as Trace explains in this video right here.
