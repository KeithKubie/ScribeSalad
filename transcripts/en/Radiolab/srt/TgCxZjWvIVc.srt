1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich. We are in Saint Paul,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,970
Minnesota. Coming to you live
from the Fitzgerald Theater.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,870
Our subject today is the
war of the worlds broadcast.

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:12,750
Originally on October 30th, 1938

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,930
okay, now I'm gonna ask the
house for a show of hands.

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,670
The question for the house is,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,910
do you think that somebody else could
imagine the broadcast using the exact same

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:26,310
script more or less? Also
with Martians also invading,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,500
also interrupting the musical things.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,310
Same deal after all the publicity
from the 1938 broadcast.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,220
Could you do it twice?
Show of hands, please. Oh,

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,350
some of you don't think
so. Look, if we could, if,

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,290
if there wasn't another one of these,
what would we be doing for the next one?

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,520
Well, so those of you
who've raised your hands,

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,870
let's say it's about 75% of you,

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,520
you are correct because it has happened
again and I want to tell you a story.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,530
It an amazing story,

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,550
really an underreported story of a war
of the worlds reenactment happened in the

19
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:05,620
mountains of Quito, Ecuador,
1949 we were very lucky.

20
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,410
We had a reporter, Tony Fields who
happened to be traveling there.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,090
We asked him to do a couple of interviews
for people who heard it or were there

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,030
and he brought back some tape and
played it for me in studio. Alright,

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,980
so Tony set the scene for
me. 1949 Kito. Where's Quito?

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,600
Quito is the capital of Ecuador.

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,000
Quito is in the middle of the
mountains in the Andes mountains.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,780
[inaudible] and small town, big
town. Quito. Now is a big city.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,340
At the time it was a pretty small city.
It had a quarter of a million people,

28
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:36,100
you know, 300,000 tops. Um,

29
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,060
the word that everybody who I spoke to
use to describe the way the Kito was in

30
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,470
1949 was trying, Hilo

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,060
[inaudible] said, I want to see that.
And we drank like tranquil. Exactly.

32
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,930
It is what it sounds like.
Tranquil, calm, chill and radio.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,470
Quito was the most popular radio station.

34
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,230
Everybody listened to it. So
those are your basic ingredients.

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,650
You've got a small town
population, 250,000.

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,840
You have one major radio station,

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,830
which also happened to be in the same
building as the one major newspaper,

38
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,850
El Comercio and the leader of the
radio station. The guy who ran it,

39
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,350
he a devious fellow by the
name of Leonardo pious.

40
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,820
One day someone shows up with a
script for Orson wells, not HD wills.

41
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,810
Orson Welles version of war of the world
gives it to Leonardo Paez. He reads,

42
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:32,860
it says, brilliant, we've
got to do this here in Quito.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,840
They insert local place names, you know,

44
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,790
so instead of the Martians
landing in New Jersey,

45
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,940
they would land and click the core Yao,
which is on the outskirts of Quito.

46
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,930
They write in parts for government
officials. The minister of the interior,

47
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,440
the mayor of Quito is their
actors or real government.

48
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,590
These would be actors doing impressions
and doing impressions. That's right.

49
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,150
Not only that, pious got
his bosses at the newspaper,

50
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:59,590
El Comercio to agree to run little
articles in the newspaper in the two days

51
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,690
leading up to the broadcast reporting.

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,800
That strange objects had been
seen in a sky's over Keith though.

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,950
Wow. So he set out to screw
with people basically. I mean,

54
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,600
he was planting paranoia.

55
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,690
It really seems like he wanted people
to believe what they were hearing that

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,713
night.

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,793
[inaudible]

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,820
okay, so Saturday, February 12th,
1949 the day of the broadcast,

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,320
all day long listeners
here and announcement.

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,390
When does notice and [inaudible] that
there's going to be a special performance

61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,460
by duo Benitez balance? Yeah.
They need this balance here.

62
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,493
[inaudible] at that time,

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,470
we're one of the most popular
musical acts in town in Rodeo. Quito.

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,470
Why don't you cue up a
track number four? Hmm.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:53,950
[inaudible]

66
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,180
eight o'clock rolls around Beneatha's
Valencia launches into their performance.

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,740
They play a few songs

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:02,710
[inaudible]

69
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,490
and suddenly there's an interruption.

70
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,180
[inaudible]

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,590
some sort of strange kind of
interference like sound. Okay.

72
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,800
Hell, what do you mean? Like

73
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,030
static signal, the static, the signals,
you know, something's wrong with it.

74
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:20,150
It's not coming in quite right.
Wait, what was that? Well,

75
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:21,320
it turns out that Leonardo,

76
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,600
the pies in addition to the other
tricks they had up his sleeve,

77
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,020
he had a sound effects guy in the
corner that was creating this sounds

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,220
like when it garrison
Keillor's guys kind of thing.

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,890
That's right. Can keep everyone

80
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:42,950
[inaudible].

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,760
Eventually the music stops and
Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,940
[inaudible] dear listeners,
excuse the technical difficulties.

83
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:57,830
There seems to be some sort of atmospheric
conditions interfering with the radio

84
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,760
Quito signal. But you are the thing to
radio. Keep those brought to you by,

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,990
you know, such and such. And
now back to this balance. Yeah.

86
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,780
[inaudible]

87
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,300
so we hear another couple songs and then
there's another interruption up in soon

88
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,930
it's laying out the payers again. And
this time, this time it's a news flash.

89
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,150
What do I do? So now we're on
script. That's right. That's right.

90
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:25,300
They send Paez out to
report from the scene.

91
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,230
We'll go Kojo and pies is doing the
play by play. You know, what is this?

92
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,880
Oh my God, the cops in school,
you know, from the clinicals.

93
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,340
And here come the heat rate.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,150
Hi, is this fry?

95
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,440
You can wait, wait, wait, wait.
Do we have forget reenactments?

96
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,650
Do we have a copy of the, the
real broadcast from that night?

97
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,420
All we have are descriptions.

98
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,890
There is no existing recording
of what was broadcast that night.

99
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,080
And, and you'll understand
why in a second.

100
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,190
[inaudible]

101
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,420
so while I was down there in Quito,

102
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,770
I interviewed a bunch of people about
what happened that night by all accounts

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,263
at work.

104
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,383
Oh,

105
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,950
outside, it was sheer Mei.

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,730
Everything that happened next
happened extremely quickly.

107
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,540
People poured out into the
streets, people were running,

108
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,730
but they didn't know where to run.

109
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,820
The spaceship supposedly was
in the north of the city,

110
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:34,140
but there's black cloud of gas was
in the south. And a lot of them,

111
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,060
they actually did what any
good Catholic would do.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,390
They made a beeline for the church

113
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,960
[inaudible]

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,250
the church because, because they were,

115
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,770
they thought they'd be
safe there or perhaps,

116
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,940
or perhaps they just wanted to get right
with God before the world ended their

117
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,860
even reports. And I wasn't
able to confirm this,

118
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:55,130
but there were reports of men confessing
to adultery right there in front of

119
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:59,720
their wives and priests.
Absolving whole crowds at once.

120
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,810
Queue up at track track 10

121
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,063
[inaudible] in

122
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,390
[inaudible] [inaudible] who
is a long time journalist,

123
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,630
worked for many years at the newspaper.
He was listening with his family.

124
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,970
They all believed it.
They all ran outside,

125
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:22,970
found a taxi cab to the kids and rest
them ran behind the taxi cab. Eh,

126
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,210
they were gonna [inaudible] the city

127
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,450
[inaudible] and he tells me that
he sees going the other way.

128
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,350
This convoy military trucks

129
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,820
filled with soldiers. Do we
real trucks, real military bans,

130
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:41,840
real military vans of the real soldiers
and cops behind them and they're

131
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:45,200
screaming towards the north of
the city. Where are they going?

132
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,650
They're going to cut the coal
yow to fight the Martians. Yeah.

133
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,020
So if you, if you had any doubt at this
point that this was a, well maybe it's,

134
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,540
maybe it's real, maybe it's not. And
once you saw this military events,

135
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,990
you were like, oh, bleep, I've
got to get the hell out. Right.

136
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,960
Wa does. Does everybody in
Quito believe like the army?

137
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,330
Peep, didn't someone call
the general beforehand?

138
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,630
Say Tonight we're having a broad day.

139
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,370
The mayor or someone who sounded an awful
like the mayor was on the radio saying

140
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:15,950
Martians were invading. And
so if you're the army guy,

141
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,350
you're going to go check it
out or you have to protect.

142
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:21,210
But the mayor didn't call
the general before a no, no.

143
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,720
So then what happens
at the end of the show?

144
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,010
It assuming it ends the way they
always do [inaudible] then what?

145
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,770
Well, they a storm, the radio station,

146
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,960
let's go ahead. By the time of
broadcast ended and it was announced,

147
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,840
but the whole thing was a play.

148
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,050
A huge crowds were in the streets and
word that it was a hoax spread pretty

149
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:50,830
quickly. All that fear turned
pretty quickly to anger

150
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,120
by nine 30 there's a few
hundred outside the station.

151
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,010
At some point this boxer shows up.

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,860
They're just been a match in the Central
Plaza and the boxer shows up and he's

153
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:04,620
driving this truck and the
truck is full of rocks.

154
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,400
So what rocks is full of rocks? Yeah.

155
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,430
And people start hurling
the rocks at the station,

156
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,670
at the windows and windows or shattering.
They managed to break into the,

157
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,630
to the ground floor where
the printing presses,

158
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,710
they're smashing printing presses.

159
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,850
At some point some people in the crowd
materialize and they have these flaming

160
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,240
torches and it just goes up
like a matched it. So, so,

161
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,950
so where people hurt during this

162
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,520
six people died. Oh
really? Yeah, most escaped.

163
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,520
There was about 50 people in the
building. Most got up to the roof,

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,230
jump to adjoining buildings, but six
people died according to a reporter, Tony,

165
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,900
uh, one guy stayed behind.

166
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,670
The last guy on the air that night
was a man by the name of Luis Beltran.

167
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,683
Maria, are you there?

168
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,643
Yes, I'm here.

169
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,220
Okay. This is Maria
Beltran Testagrossa, uh,

170
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,350
Louis Beltran's daughter and Maria,

171
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,070
you are listening to everything
that just came before this. Yeah.

172
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,300
Tell us the story from Your Dad's
perspective. Uh, from here forward.

173
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,130
He was on the air. What was he doing?

174
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,130
Uh, well he was, he was on
the air. He was the, I guess,

175
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:17,600
hosting the music program and also doing
some of the interruption with the, uh,

176
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,790
with the bogus, uh,

177
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,750
[inaudible] at the point at which
the fire started. What was he saying?

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,160
Well, at that point when he realized
the magnitude of the situation,

179
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:32,161
he went back on the air and began pleading
for help pleading for assistance from

180
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,980
the police and the fire department.
But uh, as you said before,

181
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,550
no help came because the police
were going to fight the Martian.

182
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,763
Yeah.

183
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,930
And uh, eventually he was
the last one left and uh,

184
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,330
and he jumped out the window.

185
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:50,220
I'd get from the either the
third or fourth floor onto a, uh,

186
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,800
second floor balcony
and to break the fall,

187
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,810
I guess instinctively you
want to break the fall,

188
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:01,760
he grabbed onto the railing of that
balcony and he was completely engulfed in

189
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,740
flames at that point. And the skin on
his hands just remained on the balcony.

190
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:09,560
It was like a barbecue grill. And, uh,

191
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,120
from there he jumped to the
ground, but before he jumped,

192
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:19,100
he was pleading to the crowd to I
guess catch him, but they didn't.

193
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,780
He landed on some men, broke legs, arm,

194
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,100
ribs, everything. And
compounded by the very,

195
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:31,220
very serious burns that
he had all over his body.

196
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,460
So he landed at the feet
of an angry mob. What a,

197
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,160
an angry mob. And He, uh,

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,500
he recall that as he's losing
consciousness, he just heard somebody say,

199
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,030
just let him die in peace. Although
some of the articles that I read,

200
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,640
they try to throw him
back into the building.

201
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,330
Oh, really? If someone,

202
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,100
uh, grabbed him and put him in a
jeep to take him to the hospital,

203
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,440
just the bystander and you know,

204
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,980
he had so many scars here as
children, like my brother and I would,

205
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,560
would play with his scars.

206
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,710
You would trace them with our finger in
and ask them what happened. You know,

207
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:09,190
how we got the scars? And he would
tell us about the fire that, you know,

208
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,190
the building had burned and
he would tell us about that.

209
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,330
What would he tell you? The whole
story or how much of this did you know?

210
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,620
Dory, he would just give
us in just in broad terms,

211
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,450
but he had been in a building that caught
fire. Uh, he also told us, you know,

212
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,680
he had been a radio announcer, but, uh,
as children we didn't really ask him.

213
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,070
Maybe had we been older and asked them,
he would have told us the whole story.

214
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,910
Hmm.

215
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,700
And we should say that your dad stayed
behind to try and help other people get

216
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,280
out of the building. Well, let
me ask you a question though. Uh,

217
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,290
your dad obviously is a hero,

218
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,460
but given the fact that he was one
of the voices that created the panic,

219
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,060
do you feel some sort
of ambivalence about,

220
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,310
did he feel some sort
of ambivalence about,

221
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,710
I don't know, in retrospect
whether he did or not.

222
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:56,310
I'm sure there must've been some
ambivalence. But from what I understand,

223
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,540
the story was kept,

224
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:02,541
it was very top secret so that even the
employees did not know what was going to

225
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,330
be broadcast during that
music program. Really.

226
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,520
I don't know at what point he
was informed of the details.

227
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,550
So I don't know really
how we felt about it.

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,380
I wish I had had an
opportunity to ask him.

229
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,470
Hmm. Well listen, Maria,

230
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:20,330
thank you so much for your time and
joining us here and yeah, thanks. Perfect.

231
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,873
[inaudible]

232
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,910
I just want to know what happened to the
guy who planned the hoax. Uh, well, uh,

233
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:34,100
he uh, he got out through the
roof like a lot of others.

234
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:37,610
He hopped to the next building,
hid out for a few days,

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,060
and then fled the country to
Venezuelan. Never to return,

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,480
never to return, never to return.

237
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,220
But I should say that among the six
people who died that night was his

238
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:54,140
girlfriend and a nephew of his. Okay.

239
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:57,830
So the 1949 Quito broadcast
caused a whole lot of trouble.

240
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:01,400
The 1938 New York broadcasts
caused a whole lot of trouble.

241
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,400
Now everybody here before who raised
their hand and thought that this could

242
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,730
happen again. You are right again,

243
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,530
Lau, Buffalo, 1968

244
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,360
on a weird night, nobody came in.

245
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,300
Nobody with Jackson off
shore on the radio hunting,

246
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,770
going to get it all together between
now and about midnight a little bit

247
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,470
thereafter, whatever. It's
the height of the Vietnam war,

248
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,080
Wk BW broadcast.

249
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,760
It's a fascinating version of the war
of the worlds updated for the time.

250
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,250
It sounds kind of like your [inaudible]

251
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,610
basic DJ set until you hear this.

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,100
What is your toe down?

253
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,920
And you just handed me something here
that I'm much supposed to read. Thank you.

254
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,380
Thank you Joe. Uh, let's
see. The NASA national,

255
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,670
the national spatial and there
are not exert administration.

256
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,020
Those people have alerted
all their space watch and uh,

257
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,770
facilities to be on the alert for unusual
communication difficulties tonight,

258
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,731
I suppose before the,

259
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:55,310
a federal referred to the explosions on
the planet Mars and study was not known

260
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,760
if they would have the same effect on
earth communications as similar explosions

261
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,960
on the surface of the sun have,

262
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,660
I guess you're talking about sun
spots and things like that. So, uh,

263
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,900
I don't know what it's shadowed.

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,680
It means that it's going to be hard
to hear communications from national.

265
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,770
I don't, can you hear me? Daughters' South
Carolina. As long as you can hear kv,

266
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:11,830
whatever's you'd make about
communication, rock and roll.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,313
[inaudible] any objection off?

268
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,130
Can you take what your hand Halloween
night getting it all together.

269
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,430
Where it will you KBW

270
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,270
w KBW broadcast followed the same
structure as the original broadcast.

271
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,860
We've heard tonight long stretches of
music than the news bulletins than the

272
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,900
send me realistic field
reports. Here's one of them.

273
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,050
What do you got? You got walking
injuries or are a real bad,

274
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,780
you got the same vivid
descriptions of Martian.

275
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,810
Hi by God we all got it, Don.
I got it. They all got it.

276
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,920
And according to the station manager
Jeff K, he kept the same outcome.

277
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,330
People bought it.

278
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:45,891
Hello? Hello.

279
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,120
Police and telephone company reported
to Wk VW that they received more than

280
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,320
4,000 phone calls.

281
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,580
The Canadian military
authorities dispatched military
units to the peace bridge,

282
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,520
the Rainbow Bridge and the
Queenstown Bridge to repel invaders.

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,450
The story was carried the next day
by 47 newspapers in the country wide.

284
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,420
And on the night of the show and
during the show, you're not impressed.

285
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,930
Bureaus up and down the east coast of
America where a besieged by phone calls

286
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,170
asking about the Martian
invasion in buffalo. Incredible.

287
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,390
You're absolutely right. It is incredible.

288
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:21,740
[inaudible]

289
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,630
thanks to the folks at Wk BW buffalo for
that. What is this music, by the way?

290
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,230
This is the disco version
of war of the worlds 1978

291
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,750
there's a discovered, still sells a
lot of copies. You'd be surprised.

292
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,220
Here's the obvious question to ask.

293
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,470
What does this keep working? Oh,
well that's a difficult question.

294
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,260
I came across a psychology
professor. I'm Richard Gehrig.

295
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:54,261
I am a professor of psychology in the
cognitive experimental program at Stony

296
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:54,750
Brook University.

297
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,190
He has this notion Richard Gehrig does
and it route people are suckers for

298
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:02,910
stories. We just cannot help
ourselves. When a story starts,

299
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,550
you just kind of go, whoa.

300
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,490
Think the norm is to fall into the story
and that it's unusual to sort of keep

301
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:10,950
yourself from falling it
by. Favorite example is a,

302
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,700
there's a scene in gold finger. God.

303
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,700
Yeah, the all time best James Bond
movie. I think we're bond is tied down,

304
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:24,090
spread eagle on a piece of metal and
there's this laser coming toward him,

305
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,770
which really looks like
it's gonna cut him into.

306
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,380
And even as I'm saying that right now,

307
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm starting to feel a little bit of
anxiety because as a picture you get in my

308
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:34,830
head and picture that laser coming
toward him and you know, spoiler alert,

309
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,450
he doesn't actually get split
into by the laser yet. Sorry,

310
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,320
but here's the thing.

311
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,900
Go and watch the movie now and see if
you can get through that scene without

312
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:43,740
experience. Suspense.

313
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:48,741
And it really seems to say something very
powerful and strong about how immerse

314
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,250
we can become

315
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,510
in the narrative world.

316
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,783
[inaudible]

317
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,200
the thing is,

318
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,340
we do go in, Leo all fall
into these stories. He says,

319
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,140
it's just the way we are built
for hundreds of thousands
of years. Our memories,

320
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,470
our friendships, our sense
of family, our kinship.

321
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,530
We build our identities from stories,

322
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,650
stories that we tell and
stories that we hear.

323
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,940
Well, let's take a break coming
up. Terror in the toilets,

324
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,430
python in the Potty, and more scary
stories on this edition of Radiolab.

325
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
We will continue in a moment.
