1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,620
What's crazy is, uh, the whole,
this whole animal kingdom thing.

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,980
But one thing that scares me that you
were doing when I walked in his playing

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,040
these fucking shooter games.
Dude, that game is a real problem.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,540
Jamie and I have been going
to war for the last what?

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,060
Two months and this died like two months
ago. Yeah. Maybe like that sounds.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,330
I'm in full blown addiction owed now.
What is the throat like? Aye. Aye.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,050
What's the thrill? Yes. Do you see us?
We're all sweaty and adrenaline shot.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,830
Great ass time. I walked in, it looks
like a just finished working out.

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,260
It was like crazy. Me. Now we're
going to war. We go to war.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,860
We're talking a lot of shit too.
We go to war. I tried, I tried.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,650
We talk. It's fun. It's fun. When he
kills me. Talk Shit to me. It's rough.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,930
You're like, God dammit.
He got me fuckers.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,450
Is that a game where people can go
online and play with you to no, we don't.

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,130
We let the people know. We jump
online. This is the game. This is it.

15
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,950
This is the game. Yeah. Dude
is a fun ass fucking game.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,540
It's called quake champions and people
right now listening and going, God damn.

17
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:05,030
And he's talking about that
way, but me and Jamie had
been, um, and Jeff are there.

18
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:10,031
Employee had been playing this fucking
see this isn't bad because they're like

19
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:14,310
characters. Like I was playing one
where it's like human beings like,

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,810
and when you shoot somebody,

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,010
like I got scared when you get scared
to go into the next room because you're

22
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,830
really that nervous.
Like it's freaks me out.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,850
These shooter games have too realistic. I
grew up with frogger, dude. This is like,

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,410
you're always in like some
sort of a castle. Yeah.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,220
And the people that
you're shooting against,

26
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,250
they don't look anything like a person.
They look like a cartoon character.

27
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,410
But the graphics are sensational.

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,540
But more importantly like the
game play is very precise. And um,

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,290
you, you have to have like real
hand eye coordination and skills.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,100
Like you learn things like tactics,
you learn how to move around maps,

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,550
you learn how to control resources.
Controlling resources is giant.

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,930
Like that thing that guy just picked up.

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,880
That's like a 175 health and you want to
get all the armor that you possibly can.

34
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,360
Then you also want to be like clever
about weapons choices cause you're always

35
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,110
engaging at different distances,
different kinds of fights. He like,

36
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,980
sometimes you're stuck in like a car
door and sometimes you know you're,

37
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,250
you're in an area where
they can't shoot you,

38
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,040
but you can shoot them a few
of the right weapon. Man,

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,760
you need to bring back
to old school a tar.

40
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:23,761
That one red button that ran that one red
button did everything on the joystick.

41
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,350
You never killed a guy would a rail gun.
Once you kill a guy with a rail gun,

42
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,250
you'll understand. Wait, I don't want
to kill a guy with a real person.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,120
I mean I a little, yeah, he's laughing
while you do it. When I shoot a champion,

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,940
if he jumps at me and I shoot
him in there with a rail gun,

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,210
we both laugh and he shot
me in the face of the day,

46
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:46,980
would a rocket and I was like, dude,
in the Mug, I was like in the Mug,

47
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,060
like right in my face,

48
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,720
and I exploded like my whole spring just
becomes a big red splatter. I'm like,

49
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,680
fuck, it's fun. I can't handle
it, man. It's too much for me.
