00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.760
[This talk contains mature content]

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.496
My mother called this summer
to stage an intervention.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.496
She'd come across
a few snippets of my memoir,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.256
which wasn't even out yet,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.480
and she was concerned.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.736
It wasn't the sex.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.536
(Laughter)

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.680
It was the language that disturbed her.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.720
For example:

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.816
"I have been so many things

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.560
along my curious journey:

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.256
a poor boy, a nigger,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.096
a Yale man, a Harvard man,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.736
a faggot, a Christian,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.856
a crack baby, alleged,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.856
the spawn of Satan, the Second Coming,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.080
Casey."

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.296
That's just page six.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.016
(Laughter)

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.080
So you may understand my mother's worry.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.856
But she wanted only to make
one small change.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.240
So she called, and she began,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.920
"Hey, you are a man.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.576
You're not a faggot, you're not a punk,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.296
and let me tell you the difference.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.896
You are prominent. You are intelligent.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.896
You dress well. You know how to speak.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.456
People like you.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.416
You don't walk around
doing your hand like a punk.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.776
You're not a vagabond on the street.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.296
You are an upstanding person

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.120
who just happens to be gay.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.656
Don't put yourself over there

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.800
when you are over here."

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.120
She thought she'd done me a favor,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.760
and in a way, she had.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.256
Her call clarified
what I am trying to do with my life

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.896
and in my work as a writer,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.720
which is to send one simple message:

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.000
the way we're taught to live
has got to change.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.216
I learned this the hard way.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.456
I was born not on
the wrong side of the tracks,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.455
but on the wrong side of a whole river,

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.656
the Trinity, down in Oak Cliff, Texas.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.096
I was raised there
in part by my grandmother

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.416
who worked as a domestic,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.536
and by my sister,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.096
who adopted me
a few years after our mother,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.096
who struggled with mental illness,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.936
disappeared.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.976
And it was that disappearance,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.496
that began when I was 13
and lasted for five years,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.240
that shaped the person I became,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.840
the person I later had to unbecome.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.416
Before she left, my mother
had been my human hiding place.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.136
She was the only other person
who seemed as strange as me,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.416
beautifully strange,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.976
some mix of Blanche DuBois
from "A Streetcar Named Desire"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.896
and a 1980s Whitney Houston.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.176
(Laughter)

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.680
I'm not saying she was perfect,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.096
just that I sure benefited
from her imperfections.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.776
And maybe that's what magic is, after all:

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.120
a useful mistake.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.056
So when she began to disappear
for days at a time,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.056
I turned to some magic of my own.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.216
It struck me, as from above,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.416
that I could conjure up my mother
just by walking perfectly

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.576
from my elementary school
at the top of a steep hill

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.576
all the way down
to my grandmother's house,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.200
placing one foot, and one foot only,
in each sidewalk square.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.256
I couldn't let any part of any foot
touch the line between the square,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.616
I couldn't skip a square,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.816
all the way to the last square
at the last blade of grass

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.456
that separated our lawn from our driveway.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.736
And I bullshit you not, it worked --

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.960
just once though.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.896
But if my perfect walk
could not bring my mother back,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.240
I found that this approach had other uses.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.416
I found that everyone else
in charge around me

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.480
loved nothing more than perfection,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.176
obedience, submission.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.096
Or at least if I submitted,
they wouldn't bother me too much.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.856
So I took a bargain

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.216
that I'd later see in a prison,
a Stasi prison in Berlin,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.696
on a sign that read,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.720
"He who adapts can live tolerably."

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.935
It was a bargain that helped ensure

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.096
I had a place to stay and food to eat;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.416
a bargain that won me praise
of teachers and kin, strangers;

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.576
a bargain that paid off
big time, it seemed,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.216
when one day at 17, a man from Yale
showed up at my high school to recruit me

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.480
for Yale's football team.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.200
It felt as out of the blue to me then
as it may to you now.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.096
The Yale man said -- everybody said --

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.616
that this was the best thing
that could ever happen to me,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.296
the best thing that could happen
to the whole community.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.880
"Take this ticket, boy," they told me.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.040
I was not so sure.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.736
Yale seemed another world entire:

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.440
a cold, foreign, hostile place.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.296
On the first day of my recruiting visit,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.456
I texted my sister
an excuse for not going.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.240
"These people are so weird."

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.096
She replied, "You'll fit right in."

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.000
(Laughter)

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.896
I took the ticket

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.096
and worked damn hard to fit right in.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.416
When my freshman advisor warned me
not to wear my fitted hats on campus ...

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.160
"You're at Yale now. You don't have to
do that anymore," she said.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.176
I figured, this was just one
of the small prices

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.240
that must be paid to make it.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.176
I paid them all, or tried,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.936
and sure enough
they seemed to pay me back:

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.296
made me a leader
on the varsity football team;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.736
got me into a not-so-secret society

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.296
and a job on Wall Street,
and later in Washington.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.976
Things were going so well
that I figured naturally

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.376
I should be President
of the United States.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.576
(Laughter)

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.976
But since I was only 24

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.856
and since even presidents
have to start somewhere,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.216
I settled instead on a run for Congress.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.616
Now, this was in the afterglow
of that great 2008 election:

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.776
the election during which
a serious, moderate senator stressed,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.656
"The message you've got to send
more than any other message

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.680
is that Barack Obama is just like us."

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.456
They sent that message so well

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.656
that their campaign became
the gold standard of modern politics,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.136
if not modern life,
which also seems to demand

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.856
that we each do whatever it takes
to be able to say at the end of our days

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.416
with peace and satisfaction,
"I was just like everybody else."

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.120
And this would be my message, too.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.000
So one night, I made one final call
to my prospective campaign manager.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.920
We'd do the things it'd take to win,
but first he had one question:

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.880
"Is there anything I need to know?"

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.616
I held the phone and finally said,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.040
"Well, you should probably know I'm gay."

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.120
Silence.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.376
"Hmm. I see," he nearly whispered,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.136
as if he'd found a shiny penny
or a dead baby bird.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.216
(Laughter)

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.056
"I'm glad you told me," he continued.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.256
"You definitely didn't make
my job any easier.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.056
I mean, you are in Texas.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.160
But it's not impossible, not impossible.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.160
But Casey, let me ask you something:

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.600
How are you going to feel when somebody,
say, at a rally, calls you a faggot?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.960
And let's be real, OK?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.200
You do understand that somebody
might want to physically harm you.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.096
I just want to know:

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.200
Are you really ready for this?"

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.456
I wasn't.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.496
And I could not understand --

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.376
could hardly breathe

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.160
or think, or say a word.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.976
But to be clear:
the boy that I was at that time

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.616
would have leapt
at the chance to be harmed,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.560
to sacrifice everything,
even life, for a cause.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.536
There was something shocking, though --

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.296
not that there should have been,
but there was --

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.256
in the notion that he might be harmed
for nothing more than being himself,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760
which he had not even tried
to do in the first place.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.655
All that he -- all that I --

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:50.056
had tried to do and be
was what I thought was asked of me.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.616
I was prominent for a 24-year-old:

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.080
intelligent, I spoke well, dressed decent;
I was an upstanding citizen.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.840
But the bargain I had accepted
could not save me after all,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.160
nor can it save you.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.576
You may have already learned this lesson,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.040
or you will, regardless of your sexuality.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.776
The queer receives
a concentrated dose, no doubt,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.120
but repression is a bitter pill
that's offered to us all.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.296
We're taught to hide so many parts
of who we are and what we've been through:

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.160
our love, our pain, for some, our faith.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.560
So while coming out
to the world can be hard,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.176
coming in to all the raw, strange magic
of ourselves can be much harder.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.160
As Miles Davis said, "It takes a long time
to sound like yourself."

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.880
That surely was the case for me.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.816
I had my private revelation
that night at 24,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.976
but mostly went on with my life.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.216
I went on to Harvard Business School,
started a successful nonprofit,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.176
wound up on the cover of a magazine,
on the stage at TED.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.856
(Laughter)

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.456
I had achieved, by my late 20s,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.920
about everything
a kid is supposed to achieve.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.680
But I was real cracked up:

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.656
not exactly having a nervous breakdown,
but not too far off,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.200
and awful sad either way.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.056
I had never thought of being a writer,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.400
didn't even read, in earnest,
until I was nearly 23.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.896
But the book business
is about the only industry

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.816
that will pay you to investigate
your own problems, so --

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.240
(Laughter)

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.960
So I decided to give it a try,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.960
to trace those cracks with words.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.896
Now, what came out on the page was
about as strange as I felt at that time,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.776
which alarmed some people at first.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.616
A respected writer called
to stage his own intervention

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.696
after reading a few early chapters,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.456
and he began, much like my mother,

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.840
"Hey, listen.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.176
You've been hired
to write an autobiography.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.056
It's a straightforward exercise.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.896
It's got a beginning, middle and end,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.416
and is grounded in the facts of your life.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.016
And by the way, there's a great tradition
of autobiography in this country,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.096
led by people on the margins of society
who write to assert their existence.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.536
Go buy some of those books
and learn from them.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.360
You're going in the wrong direction."

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.176
But I no longer believed
what we are taught --

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.656
that the right direction
is the safe direction.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.856
I no longer believed what we are taught --

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.376
that queer lives or black lives
or poor lives are marginal lives.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.920
I believed what Kendrick Lamar
says on "Section.80.":

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.936
"I'm not on the outside looking in.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.896
I'm not on the inside looking out.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.336
I'm in the dead fucking center
looking around."

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.816
(Laughter)

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.816
That was the place

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.016
from which I hoped to work,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.496
headed in the only direction worth going,
the direction of myself,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.376
trying to help us all
refuse the awful bargains

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.680
we've been taught to take.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.856
We're taught to turn ourselves

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.936
and our work into little nuggets
that are easily digestible;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.336
taught to mutilate ourselves
so that we make sense to others,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.936
to be a stranger to ourselves
so the right people might befriend us

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.376
and the right schools might accept us,
and the right jobs might hire us,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.256
and the right parties might invite us,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.456
and, someday, the right God
might invite us to the right heaven

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.456
and close his pearly gates behind us,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.016
so we can bow down to Him
forever and ever.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.456
These are the rewards, they say,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.840
for our obedience:

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.576
to be a well-liked holy nugget,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.800
to be dead.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.360
And I say in return, "No, thank you."

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.240
To the world and to my mother.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.896
Well, to tell you the truth,

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.296
all I said was, "OK, Mom,
I'll talk to you later."

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.616
(Laughter)

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.976
But in my mind, I said, "No, thank you."

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.400
I cannot accept her bargain either.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.480
Nor should you.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.816
It would be easy
for many of us in rooms like this

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.736
to see ourselves as safe,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.280
to keep ourselves over here.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.496
We speak well, we dress decent,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.440
we're intelligent, people like us,
or act like they do.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.720
But instead, I say that we
should remember Lot's wife.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.376
Jesus of Nazareth said it
first to his disciples:

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.840
"Remember Lot's wife."

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.616
Lot, in case you haven't
read the Bible recently,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.896
was a man who set
his family down in Sodom,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.480
in the midst of a wicked society
that God decided he had to destroy.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.016
But God, being cruel,
yet still a sap in part,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.336
rushed two angels out to Sodom
to warn Lot to gather up his folks

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.560
and get out of Dodge.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.776
Lot heard the angel's warning, but delayed.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.056
They didn't have all day to wait,
so they grabbed Lot's hands

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.936
and his two daughters' hands,
and his wife's hands,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.016
and hurried them out of Sodom.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.616
And the angels shout,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.176
"Escape to the mountain.
Whatever you do, don't look back,"

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.136
just as God starts raining down fire
on Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.776
I can't figure out how Gomorrah
got dragged into this.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.776
But Lot and his folks are running,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.456
fleeing all that destruction,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.456
kicking up dust while the Lord
rains down death,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.760
and then, for some reason,
Lot's wife looks back.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.160
God turns her into a pillar of salt.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.280
"Remember Lot's wife," Jesus says.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.120
But I've got a question:

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.800
Why does she look back?

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.296
Does she look back because
she didn't want to miss the mayhem,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.720
wanted one last glimpse of a city on fire?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.176
Does she look back because she wanted
to be sure that her people

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.136
were far enough from danger
to breathe a little easy?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.816
I'm so nosy and selfish sometimes,
those likely would have been my reasons

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.080
if I'd been in her shoes.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.760
But what if something else was going on
with this woman, Lot's wife?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.536
What if she could not bear the thought
of leaving those people

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.176
all alone to burn alive,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.920
even for righteousness's sake?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.080
Isn't that possible?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.536
If it is, then this backward glance
of a disobedient woman

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.936
may not be a cautionary tale after all.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.256
It may be the bravest act
in all the Bible,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.216
even braver than the act
that holds the whole Book together,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.440
the crucifixion.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.176
We are told that up on Calvary,
on an old rugged cross,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.096
Jesus gave his life to save everybody:

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.040
billions and billions of strangers
for all time to come.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.696
It's a nice thing to do.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.456
It made him famous, that's for sure.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.296
(Laughter)

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.016
But Lot's wife was killed,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.616
turned into a pillar of salt,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.416
all because she could not
turn her back on her friends,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.336
the wicked men of Sodom,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.360
and nobody even wrote
the woman's name down.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.000
Oh, to have the courage of Lot's wife.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.656
That's the kind of courage we need today.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.096
The courage to put ourselves over there.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.376
The courage that says that either
all of us have to be faggots,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.776
or none of us can be faggots,
for any of us to be free.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.216
The courage to stand
with other vagabonds in the street,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.616
with all the wretched of the earth,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.456
to form an army of the least of these,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.816
with the faith that from
the naked crust of all we are,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.160
we can build a better world.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.136
Thank you.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.760
(Applause)
