00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.292
All right, so let's, let's do a quiz. Give you a

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:04.734
chance to kind of think about what where are these trade-offs are actually

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:08.240
going to be. So we're going to pick the degree for the housing data,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.170
and your choices are going to be the degree zero, one, two, three,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.630
or eight. So a constant, that's the first choice. Or a line

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.810
that has some slope that, you know, sort of increases with the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.786
data, that's your second choice. Or it could be we use a

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:25.930
degree two parabola. So sort of goes up and then levels off.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.810
Or you can it might be a little hard to see but here's a cubic that that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.470
goes up flattens out a little bit and then rises up again at the end. Or we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.380
could go with the full monty, the octic.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.730
You can see that might not be spelled correctly.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.750
That actually has enough degrees of freedom that it

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.850
can hit each of these points perfectly. Like that.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.105
&gt;&gt; The authority line.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:48.270
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good, you got that in.
