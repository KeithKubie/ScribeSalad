00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:08.705
Once upon a time,

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:13.036
South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:14.445
until a crack in the Earth

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.575
drove the two continents apart.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.298
This breakup began about 200 million years ago

00:00:20.298 --> 00:00:22.674
during the separation of the supercontinent

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:24.595
known as Pangaea.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.020
Their proximity back then

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.351
explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils,

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:30.768
like the Mesosaurus,

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:33.313
can be found on the South American east coast

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:35.481
and African west coast.

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.568
However, this evidence does not account

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:39.805
for how the continents moved apart.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.738
For that, we'll need to take a close look

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:43.743
at the earth below our feet.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.325
Though you may not realize it,

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:48.781
the ground below you is traveling across the Earth

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.330
at a rate of about 10 cm/year,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.337
or the speed at which your fingernails grow.

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.302
This is due to plate tectonics,

00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:59.635
or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:01.758
The motion occurs within the top two layers

00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:03.389
of the Earth's mantle,

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.104
the lithosphere and asthenosphere.

00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:07.468
The lithosphere,

00:01:07.468 --> 00:01:10.016
which includes the crust and uppermost mantle,

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:11.801
comprises the land around you.

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.051
Beneath the lithosphere

00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:14.467
is the asthenosphere

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.721
the highly viscous but solid rock portion

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.442
of the upper mantle.

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:20.633
It's between 80 and 200 km

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.653
below the Earth's surface.

00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:25.198
While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core

00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:26.824
as one connected region,

00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:28.995
the lithosphere is separated on top

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:31.036
into tectonic plates.

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:33.080
There are seven primary tectonic plates

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.051
that compose the shape of the planet we know today.

00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:37.971
Like the other smaller tectonic plates,

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:41.298
the primary plates are about 100 km thick

00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:44.093
and are composed of one or two layers:

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:47.263
continental crust and oceanic crust.

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:49.632
Continental crust forms the continents

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:52.350
and areas of shallow water close to their shores,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.232
whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins.

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:58.606
The transition from the granitic continental crust

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.984
to the basaltic oceanic crust

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.551
occurs beyond the continentel shelf,

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:05.530
in which the shore suddenly slopes down

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.572
towards the ocean floor.

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:09.399
The South American Plate is an example

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.076
of a tectonic plate made of two crusts:

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:13.884
the continent we know from today's map

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:17.635
and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it.

00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:19.882
Collectively comprising the lithosphere,

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.919
these plates are brittler and stiffer

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.925
than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:26.997
Because of this,

00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:29.550
the tectonic plates float on top of this layer,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.346
independently of one another.

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:34.076
The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:35.802
depends on the temperature and pressure

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:37.882
of the asthenosphere below.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:39.886
Scientists are still trying to nail down

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:41.857
the driving forces behind this movement,

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:44.693
with some theories pointing towards mantle convection,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:46.112
while others are examining

00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:47.778
the influence of the Earth's rotation

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:49.824
and gravitational pull.

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:51.799
Though the mechanics have not been sorted out,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.579
the scientific community agrees

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.955
that our tectonic plates are moving

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.301
and have been for billions of years.

00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.088
Because these plates move independently,

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:02.002
a fair amount of pushing and pulling

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:04.089
between the plates occurs.

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:05.465
The first type of interaction

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:07.007
is a divergent boundary,

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.800
in which two plates move away from one another.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.966
We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:14.716
between South America and Africa.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.216
The next interaction is when two plates collide,

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:19.470
known as a convergent boundary.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.883
In this instance, the land is pushed upward

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:23.217
to form large mountain ranges,

00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:24.568
like the Himalayas.

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.902
In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding

00:03:26.902 --> 00:03:28.235
with the Eurasian Plate,

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:29.634
which is why Mount Everest

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:31.490
grows one cm/year.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.910
Finally, there's the transform boundaries,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.383
where two plates scrape past one another.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.162
The grinding of the transform boundary

00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:39.582
leads to many earthquakes,

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:40.501
which is what happens

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.170
in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.966
The moving Earth is unstoppable,

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:49.177
and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot,

00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:51.844
over millions of years our planet will continue

00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:53.514
to dramatically change.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:54.719
Mountains will rise,

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.050
shorelines will recede,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.435
islands will pop up.

00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.186
In fact, one projected map shows

00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:01.221
the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco

00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:04.559
on top of each other.

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.467
Maybe South America and Africa

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:08.653
will come together again, too.

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.528
Only time will tell.
