Welcome to
Google Developers Hackademy.

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:14.231
This is the fifth and last part
of the Google Apps Script course

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.693
by Antonio Guzman
from GDG Androidtitlan.

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:18.660
If this is your first contact
with the courses,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.990
I recommend you watch them
in order and do the exercises.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.990
Welcome to the fifth
and last lesson

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.231
of the Google Apps Script
introduction course.

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.660
I'm Antonio Guzman.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.495
In this lesson
we will review

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.396
what we've achieved
in the previous sessions.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:42.495
In lesson one
we got familiarized

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.528
with the definitions
of App Script,

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:47.330
with the necessary elements
to write programs,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.264
and with the services available
in the platform.

00:00:50.264 --> 00:00:52.627
So, let's remember that GAS

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:56.033
is a way to automate tasks
in a simple way,

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:58.627
a way to manipulate information

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.528
we have in our Google Apps.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:04.198
It's JavaScript, but running
on the server's side,

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.033
on Google servers.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.330
And we also have an editor
which we can access

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.363
through a web browser.

00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:15.990
In lesson 2 we viewed
the types of scripts:

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.264
stand alone,

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:18.462
container-bound,

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:19.924
container extension,

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.033
web apps,

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.429
Google site gadgets

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.627
and spreadsheet custom function.

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:26.561
We focused the exercise we did

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:29.066
in a stand alone script

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.264
and we worked
with the manual

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:33.396
and time-trigger executions.

00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:35.792
During lesson 3,

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.528
we worked with
container-bound scripts

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:40.858
and checked the options
in Tools menu.

00:01:40.858 --> 00:01:43.924
We integrated our script
into a spreadsheet

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.693
and we automated its execution
upon an event:

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:49.462
the opening of that spreadsheet.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:52.528
This type of scripts don't work
only with Spreadsheet,

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:55.132
they can also be integrated
into Documents.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.594
In lesson 4,

00:01:57.594 --> 00:02:00.759
we worked with several
Google Apps services.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.957
We worked with Google Forms,

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:05.759
we worked with Gmail,
with Spreadsheet

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.132
and with Documents.

00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:09.396
Besides, we integrated
another type of scripts,

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.297
the container extension scripts,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.759
which allowed us
to create the menu

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.198
with which we triggered
the task.

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:19.495
Google Apps Script allows you
to customize and extend

00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:22.099
the functionality
of Google Apps.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.495
But remember,

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:27.198
what we saw in this course
are just some possibilities,

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:30.264
There are more scenarios
you will face day by day,

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:33.462
whether it's in personal
or business environments.

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:35.957
Don't forget to visit
the Google Developers site.

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:38.297
There you'll find
documentation and examples,

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:41.330
and that will allow you
to build better scripts.

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:43.429
I'm Antonio Guzman,

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.660
thank you for having followed
this introduction course.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.165
Keep on programming.
