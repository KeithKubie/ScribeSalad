00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here's the answer to our programming exercise:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We simply set up a loop over our calls,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
evaluate the calls as recorded,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
store the result in the return variable,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then print out the call, an equal sign, and the result.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's see what this does.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And you see, we actually invoke remove HTML markup

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with the recorded value and get a new result,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we invoke square root again with the recorded value

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and get a square root of 2.
