as a teenager my first real fascination

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099
as a teenager my first real fascination
 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.310
as a teenager my first real fascination
with the ocean was just by riding waves

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
with the ocean was just by riding waves
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.939

as you begin to spend a lot of time out

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
as you begin to spend a lot of time out
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.979
as you begin to spend a lot of time out
there waiting for waves you begin to

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989
there waiting for waves you begin to
 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.530
there waiting for waves you begin to
wonder what's beneath you in the

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540

following years I moved to get a PhD in
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.360
following years I moved to get a PhD in
biological oceanography I wanted to be

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
biological oceanography I wanted to be
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970
biological oceanography I wanted to be
able to photograph the ocean in the same

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
able to photograph the ocean in the same
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.440

way that the fish would be seeing it so

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450
way that the fish would be seeing it so
 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.360

we began developing lights that would

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
we began developing lights that would
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.040
we began developing lights that would
mimic the exact spectra of the seawater

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050
mimic the exact spectra of the seawater
 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.250
mimic the exact spectra of the seawater
and we began putting filters in front of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
and we began putting filters in front of
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.290
and we began putting filters in front of
the camera that are essentially similar

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
the camera that are essentially similar
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840
the camera that are essentially similar
to the filters in the fish's eyes that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
to the filters in the fish's eyes that
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789
to the filters in the fish's eyes that
would enable them to see this hidden

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
would enable them to see this hidden
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.459

universe of fluorescence there were so
many open questions that we began to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
many open questions that we began to
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:29.340
many open questions that we began to
explore

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.020
we set out just looking for this one

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030

sharks

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.030
in a way to me science is fiction

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040
in a way to me science is fiction
 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.500

learn about this fluorescence is just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900
learn about this fluorescence is just
 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.020
learn about this fluorescence is just
one example

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700
the future of exploration is kind of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710
the future of exploration is kind of
 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.730

finding out more where humans fit among

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
finding out more where humans fit among
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.070
finding out more where humans fit among
all the other species

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.700
it is my hope that by documenting

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710
it is my hope that by documenting
 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.800
it is my hope that by documenting
different life forms and then sharing

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
different life forms and then sharing
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.200
different life forms and then sharing
that with people they'll feel more

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210
that with people they'll feel more
 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.690
that with people they'll feel more
connected to life they'll want to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
connected to life they'll want to
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.450
connected to life they'll want to
protect it more
