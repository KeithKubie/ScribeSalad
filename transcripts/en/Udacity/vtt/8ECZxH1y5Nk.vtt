00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.988
How did you know how much sugar to
use in the smaller batch of cookies?

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:08.550
You probably noticed that 24 cookies
is half the number of cookies that

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.878
the recipe normally yields, 48.

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:14.316
And that means you probably knew that
you would need half as much sugar to

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.360
make half as many cookies.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.920
That means you needed to find
half of one-half of a cup.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.790
So that means you needed half as
much sugar as the original recipe,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.270
so one-half cup, and
then you just took half.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.321
And that gave us one-quarter cup.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.120
One-fourth is one-half times one-half.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.208
For both the numerator and
the denominator, please check one.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.808
Do you add the numerators,
subtract the numerators,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.868
multiply the numerators,
or don't change?

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:48.770
And for the denominators, do you add,
subtract, multiply, or don't change?
