00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.150
The same concept of a conjugate applies in this case,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.320
as it did when we were working with complex numbers.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.480
Both cases may use of this reverse property of the difference of squares. Now,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.520
similar to how we end up with a real number if we square an imaginary number.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.340
When we square a number that has a square root sign over it,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
we end up with just the number that's under the root. In other words,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.250
a rational number, instead of an irrational number.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.615
This is really usual. What we might call the conjugate of this denominator here,

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:36.000
1 minus the square root of 2, we can find by just switching the sign,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
here in the middle. So that gives us 1 plus the square root of 2.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.490
We know we don't want to change the value of this over here, so

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.390
we need to multiply it by 1 in the form of 1 plus the square root of 2 over 1

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.690
plus the square root of 2. Let's do some math and see what that gives us.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.720
We can find our new numerator, by just distributing the 6 to both terms here.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.500
So we have 6 plus 6 times square root of 2.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.890
The denominator ends up looking pretty simple too. Our first term is 1 and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.710
then since 1 times the root of 2 is cancelled out by a negative root 2,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.120
we don't have any achy middle terms. That's exactly we saw appear with

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.830
the difference of squares. They may just have negative square root of 2,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.210
times square root of 2. Which means we are just subtracting the square root of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.020
2 squared. That means our denominator is really just 1 minus 2.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.420
Now 1 minus 2 is just negative 1. Is that means that all this really is,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.190
is the numerator multiplied or divided by negative 1.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.820
That means our final answer is just -6 minus 6 times the square root of 2.
