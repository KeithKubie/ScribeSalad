00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.250
RICH: OK, and we're live.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.360
Hey there.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.680
Welcome everyone, this is
"Android Development Office

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.770
Hours" live from Devoxx
here in Antwerp.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.195
NICK BUTCHER: In Antwerp,
yeah, so hopefully

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:12.254
you can hear us.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:13.060
We're in a noisy conference.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.070
We've managed to find a little
place with some white lines

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.340
and beautiful logos behind us.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.870
RICH: Yeah, just a few hours
after the recent Android

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.930
launches, the Nexus 10 and Nexus
4 have started shipping.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.330
And we've got the new SDK out,
so we'll be talking about some

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.580
of the APIs and the new Android

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.820
developer tools as well.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.340
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.910
So we've got a whole bunch of
material to get through.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240
As always, we'll be taking
material from the Moderator,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.960
which you'll be able to find at
developers.google.com/live.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.120
And if you comment on the
Hangout thread as well, on the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.266
Google+ Android developers page,
we'll be able to see

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.270
your comments on that.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.870
And we can invite you into the
Hangout, and you can come

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.480
along and ask some questions
live at Devoxx.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.010
RICH: Or if you're at Devoxx,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.500
NICK BUTCHER: If you're
at Devoxx, somehow,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.290
RICH: --then come ask us.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.870
We're at the back of the
downstairs hall.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.810
NICK BUTCHER: So excellent.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.765
RICH: So many ways
to get in touch.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:04.660
NICK BUTCHER: And thank you very
much, Chris, again, for

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.880
joining us in the
office hours.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.920
Hopefully, you can make up some
of our deficiencies in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.740
our limited setup here today
because we can't actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.480
reach the keyboard, it's
under there somewhere.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.930
CHRIS: No boys.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.965
RICH: We'll be able to see some
of the chat questions and

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:18.060
hopefully get back to
your questions.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.578
NICK BUTCHER: I'm just trying
to load the Moderator on

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.540
roaming data.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.480
RICH: Excellent, so the first
technical hitch being, we

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.570
can't see the Moderator, but
we promise to answer your

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.886
questions on it.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:27.836
[LAUGH]

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:29.500
I'm just going to have a
look at the Moderator.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.030
[LAUGH]

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.360
NICK BUTCHER: Why don't we just
go to some of the point

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.530
4.2, first.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.870
So I think very exciting, 4.2
has got some nice new

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.350
interesting APIs which all
you developers have--

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.105
and here the SDK 9 downloading
the latest and greatest and

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:43.820
going over the API [? dif, ?]

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.460
seeing what's new
and important.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.920
So I think for me, I think one
of the main things I want to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.870
make sure people are aware
about are the changes to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.740
content providers, right?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.960
So now, by default if you're
testing your app on SDK 17,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.560
and you change your target SDK,
that's got an implication

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.460
for that default value
for content

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.300
providers exported setting--

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.700
so it's like whether or not
you're exposing your content

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.500
provider to other
applications.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.970
It used to be default
to public.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.870
It's now changed, if you change
your target SDK to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.950
default not to public.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.200
So you might-- if you're relying
on that default value,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.220
somehow, and not setting it
explicitly, then you may have

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.915
changed behavior.

00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:22.765
So just be really aware of what
that means to the house.

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:25.560
RICH: Yeah, as soon as you start
targeting API level 17,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.890
publicly enable your
content provider.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.550
For me, the new API is for
dreams, Daydreams, and locked

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.330
screen widgets, that I'm
most excited about.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.120
We'll be giving away some swag
here to any developers at

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.190
Devoxx that come to our stand
with a brand new locked screen

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.170
widget or Daydream.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.170
The Daydreams, as you may
already know, is like a screen

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.820
saver API very similar
to wallpapers.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.430
You implement them yourself,
and you can expose, in an

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.142
interactive manner, your content
onto the display of

00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:55.320
the device as it goes
to sleep, or once

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.522
its charging or docked.

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:59.050
NICK BUTCHER: And for me, it's
the presentation API.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.390
I think it's one of the most
exciting APIs in 4.2.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.440
So it lets you create different
content for

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.280
different screens.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.356
So there's been a lot of buzz
about the Miracast, which is

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:11.710
coming in the Nexus 4, this
device, to allow wireless

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.720
sharing to displays.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.965
But the same API works over HDMI
as well, so you can start

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.110
writing applications right now
that use the presentation API,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.190
and any 4.2 device [INAUDIBLE]
to use it over HDMI as well.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.500
I think it's a really nicely
thought out API.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.180
So you get a different context,
which will reload

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.510
different assets depending on
the resolution and the density

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.600
of the target display which
you're sending it too, which

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.426
is really nice.

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.660
There's some really nice
changes with the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.535
media router bars.

00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:43.650
So the media router allows you
to send content to the best

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.430
screen available, essentially,
and also the media router

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.847
provider, which will allow you
to route video and audio to

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:53.720
the best sync for it.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.075
So there's some standard
components you can put into

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:58.430
your app now to take advantage
of these things.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.262
So really exciting stuff.

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:01.640
I can't wait to see what
people build with that.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.340
RICH: Absolutely.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.140
On the stand here at Devoxx
we're demoing the Nexus 10 on

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.080
our 50 inch plasma screen.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.660
Of course, the Nexus 10, with
its 2,500 by 1600 pixel

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.150
display, has to downscale for
our 50 inch, full HD plasma.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.001
NICK BUTCHER: You're like,
oh, it doesn't look so

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:15.560
good on the 50 inch.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.970
I like it better on the 10.5.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.085
RICH: Every time I say, 2,500,
Roman tells me off because

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:22.075
it's 2,560, and those extra
60 pixels are important.

00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:25.520
Along with the extra 48
pixels on the Nexus 4.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.250
48?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.556
720 to 760--

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:30.820
48 more pixels.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.840
Your UIs, of course,
will sync to scale.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.690
The display resolution on the
Nexus 10, as Nick will

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.370
demonstrate for us, is still a
10 inch tablet, and this is

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.480
the first XHDPI 10
inch tablet.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.140
Pretty much every single
previous Android tablet has

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.100
been NDPI, so a resolution
density of one.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.400
And because this is XHDPI,
it's got a density of 2.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.490
So all your layouts that were
done in dips are just going to

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.480
scale perfectly.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.660
It's 1240 by 800 dips,
the same as

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.545
previous 10 inch tablets.

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.460
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, one thing
to watch out for is, well,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.636
we've been testing a bunch of
apps on this device before

00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:09.570
launch, and pretty much
everything scaled beautifully.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.490
One or two apps out there might
have used pixel sizing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.510
rather than dip sizing
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.040
And they find most of your
content would reflow nicely,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.340
and then one element would be
like too short, for example.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.080
Because it wasn't getting
scaled up.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.630
So one thing to watch out for.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.240
Oh, we've been joined
by Matt as well.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.810
MATT: Hey

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.300
RICH: Yes, it's the pure layout
that you saw before,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.590
but are we getting the assets
from the XHDPI folder from

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.400
your phone's layouts, if you had
phone layouts inside the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.180
Galaxy Nexus.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.550
So hopefully everything
will look perfect.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.140
Who else has joined
us down there?

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.050
I'm just ducking heads.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.550
Joe.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:47.554 --> 00:05:50.070
If people in the Hangout want
to ask questions, they're

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.560
going to have to wave a bit, and
I'm going to go near into

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.150
the laptop where I can.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.795
--Which I'll do right now.

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:56.340
NICK BUTCHER: We could just
like zoom in a bit.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.890
We could just like
move forward.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.895
AUDIENCE: What are the
things that you said

00:05:58.895 --> 00:05:59.795
about the new DPIs?

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:01.045
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.700
AUDIENCE: The new DPIs, you're
moving to the [? gradle ?]

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.120
system.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.040
It's so weird that we can have
and builds that have

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.740
[? worked ?]

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.270
poorly [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.900
XXHDPI in, so people who don't
have XXHDPI don't get them

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.728
assets as well.

00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:18.206
RICH: Interesting.

00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:19.640
The question is [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.028
CHRIS: Can't hear, Rich.

00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:29.444
NICK BUTCHER: Rich, speak up.

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:30.390
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.774
I'm talking to the laptop,
not the microphone.

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:33.600
I was trying to repeat
the question.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.770
I think the question was, can
we make APKs that don't have

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.356
the XXHDPIs assets in to
go to some devices.

00:06:40.356 --> 00:06:41.790
Yeah?

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.040
Someone nod if that
was the question.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.800
No.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.730
Not at the moment.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.320
Multiple APK doesn't.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.945
NICK BUTCHER: What
was the question?

00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:49.620
I missed it.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.030
Can you make APKs which--

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.140
so that you can do XXHPDI assets
and make a very big APK

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.475
to devices that support it, but
then for other devices--

00:06:56.475 --> 00:06:59.210
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.040
RICH: OK, Devoxx brain
fuzz right now.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.510
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.335
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:06.870
APK, you can split on--

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.022
NICK BUTCHER: Support screen.

00:07:09.022 --> 00:07:11.100
RICH: You can split
on support screen.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.480
You can do it for x-large,
but not for XHDPI.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.930
NICK BUTCHER: I think you can.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.130
RICH: You can definitely do it
on screen size, so maybe you'd

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.420
want to do the smaller screen
sizes and the bigger screen

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.817
sizes in different, but
I don't think you

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:22.880
could do it on density.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.312
Matt, Chris, someone
who's got access to

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.830
Dart compatible screens?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.640
AUDIENCE: I would've thought
there would have been a way of

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.280
saying, if it supports
screens,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.530
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.940
NICK BUTCHER: And I'll just
sit here, smiling.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.660
Can you still hear us?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.646
Somebody speak?

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:41.820
MATT: Yeah, we can.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.070
Hello?

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.210
RICH: Damn it, I
can't hear you.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.700
Are you speaking?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.340
MATT: Yeah, we are.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.750
We're talking.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.740
CHRIS: Well, Matt's talking.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.595
RICH: Oh, there you are.

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.390
OK, this is a little bit of
fail, but if we just rewind

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.953
for the last couple of minutes
I'll be able to hear what

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:59.760
people in the Hangout
are saying.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.080
So I thnk the answer was no.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.520
But hopefully [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.540
NICK BUTCHER: I have
Moderator now.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.310
RICH: And we have Moderator
now as well.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.940
Let's jump into the
first person from

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.190
the Moderator, then.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.845
Also, I should turn the camera
around, so you can see what's

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:12.220
going on here.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.640
But we're in the middle
of a hall with about

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.810
2000 people in it.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.470
So if we see somebody we know,
we'll drag them in.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.080
Hopefully, we can get some of
these Android framework

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.450
engineers to come and sit on
one of our knees here.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.750
We've only got two chairs.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.880
I'll take Roman, he's
slightly lighter.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.180
Moderator, then.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.872
NICK BUTCHER: OK, let's
get a question.

00:08:29.872 --> 00:08:32.880
"How does the Google Play
search index work?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.030
I have an app that is called--"
something I can't

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.470
pronounce in Spanish--

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:44.410
"but Hispanic search index
doesn't rank it." OK.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.940
To which Sparky-- has
Sparky joined us?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.953
Sparky's not with us
at the moment.

00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:48.917
NICK BUTCHER: He pinged us
trying to join but he hasn't

00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:49.400
done it yet?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.288
RICH: Oh, did he ping
us trying to join?

00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:53.180
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.324
He's given a pretty
good answer.

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:58.690
RICH: Go on, can you read that
amazing LG Nexus 4 screen?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.940
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.226
RICH: Whilst Nick decodes
Sparky's answer--

00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:09.790
NICK BUTCHER: I'm trying
to read it.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.040
RICH: Ah.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.710
NICK BUTCHER: How does the
Google Play search engine work

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.080
is basically the question.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.060
RICH: Yeah, generally we can't
answer that, but--

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.784
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but Sparky's
given some very good

00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:20.690
advice, so check the
Moderator out.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.330
Basically, it's saying don't use
very generic words because

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.740
they're going to be highly
competed against.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.440
Generally, it comes down to
normal stuff, like we're going

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.640
to rank apps based on a lot of
signals, much like Google

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.930
Search, which we don't
give the exact

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.350
algorithm out to, obviously.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.490
But it's the stuff
you'd expect.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.500
It's going to be things like
that the quality of your app,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.470
the ratings, how good your
listing, the number installs,

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.432
the number of people who install
the app and then

00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:47.560
uninstall it, and lots
of signals like this.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.420
So generally, the advice is
always just write a really

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.910
good app, and concentrate on the
app quality, and represent

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.002
it very fairly in
the description.

00:09:55.002 --> 00:09:57.945
If you don't try and use a
keyword section, where you

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.050
list every single keyword
you can think of in the

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.900
description because that's
actually something we think is

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.920
the sign of a bad quality app,
someone who's trying to game

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.420
the system.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.330
So you'd be penalized for
that kind of behavior.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.190
So just don't try and be too
clever, concentrate on

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.420
quality, and write a
fair description.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.210
And that'll work.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.730
The only exceptions to that rule
is if you have a name of

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.610
an app which is kind of close
to a dictionary word but a

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.950
slight play on it, then
sometimes our search does

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.910
something called query
rewriting, where it says, we

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.865
think did you mean kind of
queries, where it thinks

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:29.330
you've done a typo and it's
trying to be really helpful in

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.490
correcting it--

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.700
if there is a case of that,
where you are close to a

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.880
dictionary word, and people
are getting their query

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.120
rewritten to the dictionary word
rather than your app's

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.540
name, then that, obviously,
we need to know about.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.410
So you can use the Report
Problem on the Google Play

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.640
developer support to actually
report that to us, and we'll

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.170
try and factor that
into the ranking.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.325
Yeah, there's a great contact
form on Google Play developer

00:10:51.325 --> 00:10:54.005
support where you can
report things back

00:10:54.005 --> 00:10:56.450
to the support team.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.990
Search appears to
be one of them.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.180
And hey, Sparky.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.640
Thanks for joining us.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.790
SPARKY RHODE: Hey.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.460
Hey, were you guys talking about
the applications that--

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.035
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:06.410
SPARKY RHODE: --doesn't
show up in the store?

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.612
NICK BUTCHER: Nope.

00:11:07.612 --> 00:11:07.970
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.120
Yes we were, Sparky.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.200
SPARKY RHODE: OK, so what
happened was, actually, that

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.190
app's search result is
correctly placed.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.990
But the primary title of
the app is in English.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.870
So when you search for it
in Spanish, if your user

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.170
interface is in English,
you're not

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.372
going to see it all.

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:26.830
RICH: Fair enough.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.810
I hope the developer gets
that message then.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.430
SPARKY RHODE: I actually
reported that as a feature

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.590
request to the Store, that if
you get an exact title match

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.800
in the language that's not
the primary locale,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.032
show the exact match.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:39.710
NICK BUTCHER: What's going on?

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.130
RICH: I know, sorry dude, this
guy can't hear a word

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.260
that's going on.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.110
But what we do have is Paul
Kinlan pulling faces at us

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.592
over there.

00:11:46.592 --> 00:11:50.030
CHRIS: [LAUGH]

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.980
NICK BUTCHER: Should I go
back to the Moderator?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.510
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.820
oh just see if-- there's someone
without a picture,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.860
maybe they have a question.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.522
Also we have something in
the comments down there.

00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:05.140
OK, no, it's just Matt
adding Sparky.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.882
Yeah, Sparky, do you want
to grab the next

00:12:06.882 --> 00:12:08.300
note from the Moderator?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.060
SPARKY RHODE: I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.857
RICH: Sparky, Nick would like
to read it so he knows what

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:13.638
the hell is going on.

00:12:13.638 --> 00:12:15.440
NICK BUTCHER: OK, good question
from Andrew, the

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.320
self-named one-man Moderator
machine Kelly says, "Regarding

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.500
regarding user switching in
Android 4.2, how does that

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.910
affect Google Cloud messaging?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.280
Progressive I register a device
ID as one user on my

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.740
server, will other users have
different device IDs.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.710
If it's a single ID, how is a
notification presented to user

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:40.100
A if user B is using the
device?" [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.320
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.516
NICK BUTCHER: Oh,
you need this.

00:12:43.516 --> 00:12:45.368
[LAUGH]

00:12:45.368 --> 00:12:47.150
You're not even listening.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.900
We're single-threaded today.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.020
It's either Rich or Me.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.320
RICH: Yeah, we're slightly
distracted.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.983
I was going to show you what
the conference looks like.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:55.921
See that?

00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:57.171
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:03.325
Well, there it is.

00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:05.000
And still, I didn't answer
the question [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.850
NICK BUTCHER: So, do you know
the answer, so if you have

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.880
multiple users on a device,
do they get different

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.971
registration IDs [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:13.792
Or is the same registration
ID?

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.030
CHRIS: Tied to your Google
account, isn't it?

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.180
RICH: It's totally going to
be different ones, yeah.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.735
It's tied to your
Google account.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:20.312
So the Google account
that they logged in

00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:21.880
with, it's tied to.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.723
So it's a a device
and account pair.

00:13:24.723 --> 00:13:25.186
RICH: Yeah.

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:27.930
NICK BUTCHER: I think that's
right as well.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.540
RICH: So potentially, if you're
logged in with the same

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.371
account under different business
on the same device,

00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.080
you should have multiple
registrations.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.560
NICK BUTCHER: So what happens
if the user isn't

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.310
foreground and then--

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.014
So I think it's the exact same
behaviors as if the device was

00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.630
off, right?

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.470
So yeah, that's right.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.130
If I switch to another account,
then all the sudden

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.296
all my notifications
come through.

00:13:46.296 --> 00:13:47.000
RICH: Sounds good to me.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.870
SPARKY RHODE: I thought I'd
heard some messaging that

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.940
implied that, for example, you
would continue to get your

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.000
Gmail in the background even
when you weren't logged in.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.160
But I don't have a
source on that.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.622
It was just something I heard.

00:14:00.622 --> 00:14:04.020
RICH: OK, I'll check it out.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.720
Gmail in the background
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.435
NICK BUTCHER: Next.

00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:08.710
AUDIENCE: I think that whoever
writes documentation

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:09.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:13.620
AUDIENCE: Can't you tell
the person who writes

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.830
documentation for GCM to
put that in there?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.180
RICH: Sorry, we really
can't hear you.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.575
Hopefully Sparky can.

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:25.920
SPARKY RHODE: Are you looking
at the action bar question?

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.350
AUDIENCE: No, about the GCM.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.605
If the person who writes that
can put some information about

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:33.855
multi-users, how that works?

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.610
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.240
I can't hear it.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.765
Oh, the joys of doing things
live from a conference.

00:14:46.765 --> 00:14:48.795
At least we have new devices.

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:51.490
We did "Android Design in
Action" live from the

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.380
conference yesterday.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.420
That was really nice.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.980
RICH: Well, you were smart and
chose a room, as opposed to

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.886
the conference floor, which
is a little bit noisier.

00:14:57.886 --> 00:14:59.180
But conference floor,
you'll get signage.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.690
Signage is very important
for--

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.442
SPARKY RHODE: The signage
is beautiful.

00:15:05.442 --> 00:15:06.370
I envy you.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.070
NICK BUTCHER: Shall I
do another question?

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.280
RICH: We just went to an awesome
talk, a talk by Chet

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.730
Haas, lunchtime talk today.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.820
It's just a short,
30 minute talk on

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.346
the process of process.

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:17.743
And he came up as a process
methodologist consultant.

00:15:17.743 --> 00:15:18.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.400
new crystal methology.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.614
RICH: Crystal methology, yes.

00:15:23.614 --> 00:15:24.526
It's promising.

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:25.438
It's promising.

00:15:25.438 --> 00:15:28.014
I can't get enough of it.

00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:32.110
NICK BUTCHER: Anyway, here's a
good question because I know

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.370
the answer to it.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.016
Jan [? Suza ?], I'm probably
saying that wrong, in Brazil--

00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:39.780
watchers in Brazil--

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.445
says, "Is there any way to
use accountPicker.ne

00:15:42.445 --> 00:15:45.160
wChooseAccountIntent
on the emulator?

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.460
Whenever I'm on the emulator,
it says nothing can handle

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.850
this."

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.610
So this actually is a subject we
just did a code lab on, on

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.790
Devoxx on Monday.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.070
And if you check my Google+
stream, you will see that I

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.330
shared all the details, so if
you want to learn more about

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.910
using this new Google Play
Services and identity

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.245
framework, there's a
step-by-step code example that

00:16:06.245 --> 00:16:08.280
shows you how to get
that working.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.590
So the simple answer is no.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.550
The Google Play searches
basically relies on APK being

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.355
installed on your device.

00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:17.445
This is managed by
the Play Store.

00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:20.020
The Play Store silently updates
this Google Play

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.080
services on your device.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.490
So because the emulator doesn't
have that Play Store

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.420
or any of that infrastructure,
there's no way for it to work.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.030
If you could somehow pull the
APK off of your device and

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.930
patch install on the emulator,
or acquire it through some

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.490
other means, that could possibly
work, but I wouldn't

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.640
know anything about
how to do that.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.700
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.900
I'm just trying to get hold of
the Android engineers to bring

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.060
them in, make sure that
we do get [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.780
All the talks are running about
20 minutes late, so they

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.248
should be finishing about--

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:49.680
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.700
RICH: What's the next one?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.610
Does anyone from the Hangout
have a question?

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.630
I can see we've had a few
more people join us.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.220
SPARKY RHODE: Come on everybody,
if you have

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.380
something you want to
talk about, please

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.724
just speak right up.

00:17:06.724 --> 00:17:07.720
NICK BUTCHER: I can see
people talking.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.260
RICH: Yeah, Sparky was just
saying that if you have a

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.531
question, just ask.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:16.020
But it looks like not
so next [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.780
NICK BUTCHER: OK,
all right then.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.450
So Andrew Kerry, again says,
"I have an action bar with

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.240
several tabs.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.730
If I run my app in portrait
mode on a Nexus 7 running

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:31.200
4.1.2, and have target SDK set
to 15, the tabs are displayed

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.230
as a drop list.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.420
However, if target SDK is
greater than 15, the tabs are

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.300
displayed as the second
row underneath.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.350
Why the change?"

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.632
SPARKY RHODE: You'll notice
this is kind of like--

00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.270
NICK BUTCHER: So I think that's
picking up on some of

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.270
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.400
sizing behavior of
the action bar.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.690
The action bar will smartly say,
if you're trying to use

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.850
too many tabs, and it just isn't
enough room, they're

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.360
going to get too small
to be clickable.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.320
It'll actually automatically
turn that into [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.490
for you.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.470
I'm guessing there must be a
constant defined somewhere

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:07.770
which says, that when you have
SW6 under a DP device, over x

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.980
number of tabs, turn it
to just drop down.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.254
And it sounds like that
changed, but I

00:18:12.254 --> 00:18:13.990
wasn't aware of that.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.760
I'd have to take a look
at the action bar.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.990
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, we
introduced that in Ice Cream

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.190
Sandwich with the Galaxy
Nexus phone.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.570
I'm thinking that maybe we just,
at the time, didn't spec

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:22.610
that for tablet.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.330
And the reason it comes up in
API level 15 or above is

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.820
because the Nexus 7 was our
first small tablet.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.160
That was my guess on that one.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.032
RICH: Fair enough.

00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:36.616
He says that he thinks--

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.940
it doesn't matter.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.850
NICK BUTCHER: You can
tell me later.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.110
RICH: I can tell you later.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.680
We'll have a deep, meaningful
discussion about it

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.483
in an hour or two.

00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:43.670
NICK BUTCHER: I look
forward to it.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.890
RICH: I can't get my internet
to get hold of Chet.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.666
Can you go find Chet
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:49.270
What does he look like?

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.370
He looks like an Android
engineer.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.930
NICK BUTCHER: I'l ping him.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.795
RICH: Green, yeah green.

00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:55.160
Green with big ears.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.814
And the top of his head
up here somewhere.

00:18:57.814 --> 00:19:00.230
NICK BUTCHER: He's offline.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.680
RICH: No, just head to our
stand and see if there's

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.930
anyone that wants
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.630
It does Android.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.180
He might have an opinion
on stuff.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.360
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
have opinions?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.200
RICH: Chet [INAUDIBLE],
quite opinionated.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.000
So I've been told.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.200
NICK BUTCHER: OK,
he's French so.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.380
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.790
NICK BUTCHER: Anyway, racial
slurring aside.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.730
RICH: Yes.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.610
I'm going to pay attention
to the next question.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.180
I'm going to try and
answer it myself.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.980
NICK BUTCHER: Any
live questions?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.805
We seem to have more people.

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:33.950
RICH: Uh no, still Brian,
and Matt, and Joe.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:34.305
NICK BUTCHER: This
is very weird.

00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:36.240
I can't hear anything
back from you guys.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.020
RICH: They aren't talking.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.115
They are being really,
really quiet today.

00:19:40.115 --> 00:19:41.085
I don't know.

00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:44.620
NICK BUTCHER: OK, uh, I don't
know the answer to that one.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.700
RICH: Dare I ask-- has anyone
managed to order a Nexus 4?

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.850
Oh Chris, did you manage
to order a Nexus 4?

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.560
CHRIS: Just a few.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.198
RICH: Did any of them
arrive today?

00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:57.114
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:19:57.114 --> 00:19:58.030
RICH: Oh, that's a shame.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.040
CHRIS: The 10s have shipped,
but the 4s haven't yet--

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.171
I don't know.

00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:03.030
RICH: OK, yeah I heard some
people, saw some pictures of

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.830
10s appearing on the
Google+ streams.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.650
Hopefully we get our shipping
sorted out.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.840
Tablets have [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.460
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.480
OK, next question in the
moderator says, it's from

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.800
Shaki Amman in India, probably
saying that wrong. "I would

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.540
like to develop a plug-in for
the Google Maps app, or

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.130
perhaps a lab feature dealing
with the favorite places

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.910
people mark.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.000
Is it possible for third
party developers"

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.745
--to do this, I guess.

00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:33.660
"Does Google Maps expose some
APIs, or is it able to

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.720
interact with other apps?"

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.725
So if I'm interpreting
that correctly, the

00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:41.290
answer's pretty much no.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.830
There's no plug-in
architecture.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.300
You can't write a lab.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.550
Labs is a feature of
the application.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.730
It doesn't query the device--

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.572
other people's labs.

00:20:52.572 --> 00:20:55.720
RICH: Yeah, so the Google Maps
app on Android itself doesn't

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.070
expose that plug-in feature
or labs, or like that.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.730
Obviously, you've got the map
view, if you want edit into

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.760
your own application, or there
is a Google Maps API on the

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.040
NICK BUTCHER: So basically, it
sounds like they are trying to

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.610
work out the places people
have starred.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.575
I don't know, intimately, the
Google maps API, whether or

00:21:11.575 --> 00:21:14.150
not you can query that for
a user's accounts.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.410
I don't know.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.250
It may even be intent
rule passed.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.050
I doubt it.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.530
RICH: I somehow doubt it.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.800
I doubt you get access to where

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.285
other people's favorites.

00:21:21.285 --> 00:21:22.820
The Places API, maybe.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.430
No, it's not likely, is it?

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.100
It's quite personal, isn't it.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.390
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so I
don't think you'll be

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.970
able to do it on device.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.140
I think your best bet is to look
into the Google Maps API

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.660
and work out whether or not you
can do an authenticated

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.310
web call to find out the user's
favorites and then go

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.540
from there.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.790
That's your best
bet, I believe.

00:21:43.292 --> 00:21:44.260
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.480
Alfredo's just joined us from
behind the camera--

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.690
our fantastic Italian
counterpart.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.472
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:53.472 --> 00:21:56.030
RICH: Do you want to come
in and say hello?

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.070
Yeah, why not.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.600
Hey!

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.270
Alfredo.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.520
I did a code lab in Florence
with Alfredo recently.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:01.790
ALFREDO: Yep, hi guys.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.070
RICH: We're kind of down there,
up there, and the

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.094
microphone's over here.

00:22:05.094 --> 00:22:05.536
ALFREDO: 1, 2, 3, OK.

00:22:05.536 --> 00:22:06.910
RICH: And only I can
hear what they say.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.960
I think they're saying
you are very nice.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.830
ALFREDO: OK, thank you.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.570
Hi guys.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.594
NICK BUTCHER: Good T-shirt.

00:22:13.594 --> 00:22:21.105
ALFREDO: Yes, it's from the fest
Sicily, the communities

00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:23.115
that organized the fest.

00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:24.960
RICH: Yeah, Have you had a
chance to look at the new

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.350
Android SDK yet?

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.600
I downloaded it yesterday and
the I read some documentation

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.258
on it, yes, but tonight
I want to experiment

00:22:34.258 --> 00:22:35.890
with the new API.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:36.255
RICH: Which one?

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:39.910
ALFREDO: Particularly
the Daydream API.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.700
Yes, I want to play with a kind
of application that gets

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:49.535
photos from the quickstream of
the box, and show them on your

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:50.030
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.192
RICH: If you write that tonight,
then we can have it

00:22:52.192 --> 00:22:53.380
on our stand tomorrow all day,
and then we can just leave.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.370
ALFREDO: Yeah, yeah, in
fact I want to try.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.630
RICH: It'd be a self-maintaining
stand.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.120
ALFREDO: Yeah, have to grab a
lot of caffeine, a lot of

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.224
coffee, a lot of things to
stay up all the night.

00:23:02.224 --> 00:23:04.460
RICH: Have you checked out
the Daydream API yet?

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.570
ALFREDO: No, no still.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.610
I'm very curious.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.280
RICH: Maybe you can come back
and join us next week.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.570
ALFREDO: OK.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.465
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe we can take
the source code of the

00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:15.160
photo table Daydream, which
is like one [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.720
ALFREDO: Yes, very similar.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.325
And provide the photo
not from the gallery

00:23:19.325 --> 00:23:21.830
but from the stream.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:22.120
RICH: Awesome.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.416
NICK BUTCHER: Excellent.

00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.680
ALFREDO: Hey, you look very
nice with this hairpiece.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.560
RICH: Hairpiece?

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.530
[LAUGH]

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.250
NICK BUTCHER: Hairpiece?

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.290
RICH: It's very fine,
this head piece.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.850
I don't know if anyone else has
said anything at all, or

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.921
if it's just broken.

00:23:34.921 --> 00:23:37.356
Head piece, yes.

00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:40.280
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:40.820
NICK BUTCHER: OK, cheers.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.040
Do you want to come up?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.680
ALFREDO: Please.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.805
RICH: Yeah, come on, Paul.

00:23:44.805 --> 00:23:46.740
Paul Kinlan.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.170
NICK BUTCHER: The
man, the legend.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.150
RICH: There he is.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.860
Joining us here at Devoxx,
team Google London.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.380
ALFREDO: Microphone,
screen, camera.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.400
PAUL KINLAN: Hello.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.790
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.570
what are doing here
at Devoxx, Paul?

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.980
What the hell are you doing
here at Devoxx?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.690
PAUL KINLAN: How
did you get in?

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.040
RICH: This Java Conference.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.832
They like to know about the best
bit about the web, and

00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:11.600
where the web's going, and all
this type of stuff, so, we get

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.666
to talk about Chrome, and what
we're doing in the web, and I

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.910
will talk closer, I apologize.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.180
Yeah, we're here to talk about
HTML5, JavaScript, all the

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.561
things that modern Java
developers use for their

00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:22.008
client side technology.

00:24:22.008 --> 00:24:23.350
Excellent.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.400
Can we talk today?

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.270
PAUL KINLAN: A [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.390
talk, actually, at eight.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.760
So if anyone's watching-- yes.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.690
RICH: And if anyone knows where
that term came from,

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.716
please tell us.

00:24:32.716 --> 00:24:36.435
PAUL KINLAN: So at 8 o' clock
we're doing 8 Chrome apps.

00:24:36.435 --> 00:24:38.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.630
RICH: We should [INAUDIBLE]
what we did.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.520
We never really told anyone,
but it's online, and people

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.720
can do it now.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.030
So on Monday this week, we
have a 3-hour workshop on

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.390
integrating Google Drive into
Android applications.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.400
So we had a wonderful, exciting
notepad application.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.370
But it was just offline,
shockingly

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.990
offline, you could say.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.280
If you deleted it, you'd
lose all your data.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.160
And that's not how we roll.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.410
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
it used Roboto light

00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.610
because I made it.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.570
RICH: It used Roboto light so
that everyone in the room who

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:05.060
didn't have the API level, the
4.1 SDK is all [? compile ?]

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.640
project without [INAUDIBLE]
the style.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.325
It takes about an hour.

00:25:09.325 --> 00:25:12.540
You go through the Google
Drive setup online.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.450
You put a few libraries
in your project.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.230
And then you can synchronize
files with a

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.675
user's Google Drive.

00:25:18.675 --> 00:25:20.640
PAUL KINLAN: So how does it
work, is that intent driven?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:20.900
Or is it a--

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.890
NICK BUTCHER: Just using
the Drive API.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.820
RICH: I really like it giving
a user their own data as

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.022
opposed to it coming into my
server and then not really

00:25:30.022 --> 00:25:30.650
trusting new [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.400
I like the fact that it's
there on Google Drive.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.345
They can see it.

00:25:34.345 --> 00:25:35.620
They can edit it online.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.890
They see it.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.940
It syncs to all their devices.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.124
Giving people their own data
is definitely the future.

00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:42.483
NICK BUTCHER: And you don't
have to build your own

00:25:42.483 --> 00:25:42.950
backend, right?

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:43.640
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it's nice.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.020
That's why I like it.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.790
RICH: Yeah, there's not
server-side switch at all.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.630
Google Drive.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.220
So that went through the
G+ stream yesterday.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.445
We should repost--

00:25:50.445 --> 00:25:53.070
is there a link somewhere
to the worksheet?

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.610
NICK BUTCHER: Just
got to my stream.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.565
I think, I don't know.

00:25:56.565 --> 00:25:59.770
RICH: Yeah go on plus, Nick
Butcher, and plus him.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.030
And plus his again.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.043
And you'll find the links.

00:26:03.043 --> 00:26:03.496
NICK BUTCHER: Just
once is enough.

00:26:03.496 --> 00:26:05.310
PAUL KINLAN: If you plus him
again, it's unfollow.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.420
RICH: Well yeah, that's kind
of what I was aiming for.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.960
OK, next muffin.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.470
Next muffin?

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.300
Next muffin, all right.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.440
NICK BUTCHER: So Lars
in Amsterdam.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.538
I wonder if you're going to
DroidCon Holland next week,

00:26:20.538 --> 00:26:21.260
we'll be there, maybe
see you there?

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:21.535
Maybe?

00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:22.060
Anyway.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.724
Lars says, "I have a series of
PDF links in my app I would

00:26:25.724 --> 00:26:27.672
like to open inside my app.

00:26:27.672 --> 00:26:29.433
But almost all the PDF libraries
are licensed so that

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:31.410
I need to open source my app.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:35.965
Should I intent it to a PDF
viewer app or try to find a

00:26:35.965 --> 00:26:38.300
library and build
it into my app?"

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.206
RICH: Good question
Lars from Holland.

00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:42.625
Is there an answer down
there, or should I

00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:42.882
just rattle on off?

00:26:42.882 --> 00:26:44.820
NICK BUTCHER: Sparky says this
is a great question.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.775
Then Andrew K proposes whether
web views can open PDF, which

00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:50.288
they can't

00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:54.350
RICH: If you found an online
viewer for PDFs it could.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.270
CHRIS: Google Docs
does, or Drive.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:55.700
NICK BUTCHER: OK,
so generally--

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.760
RICH: Yeah, yeah, Chris just
said Drive can, which it can.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.300
So potentially, you could upload
it to Drive and open it

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.580
using our Drive API that
we gave a talk on.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.260
And that is at least a
free way of doing it.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.444
PDF is a platform
that's licensed.

00:27:13.444 --> 00:27:16.430
Generally, you do have to
license a product for it if

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.670
you want to include it inside
your application.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.930
PAUL KINLAN: Use PDF JS if
it's inside of web view.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.080
RICH: Apparently you can
use PDF JS if it's

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.060
inside of web view.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.550
PAUL KINLAN: It is an
open source one.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.573
But I think it might be
readily licensed and

00:27:30.573 --> 00:27:31.280
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.610
It doesn't mean your
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.510
RICH: Potentially, you could
use PDF to JS, or Google

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.570
Drive, or license a solution.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.280
NICK BUTCHER: So my answer would
be, it also comes down

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.030
to the kind of data.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.640
Like if it's something that only
makes sense within the

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.266
context of your app, so I've
seen apps that are basically

00:27:45.266 --> 00:27:47.590
like textbook apps, which, they
want to keep you within

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.690
the application and just use
PDF as the rendering

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.500
technology.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.740
Then that makes sense to
try and find a library.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.920
Whereas if it's something
where the content stands

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.850
alone, then

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.010
I think then that lends
itself more to--

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.340
the Androidy way would
probably be

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.750
to fire off an intent.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.650
And why rebuild, why reinvent
the wheel when they're apps

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.030
our there like [INAUDIBLE] is my
favorite PDF reader, which

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.790
offers tons of great
functionality, annotations and

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.990
all that good stuff.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.930
Why rebuild all that when you
can just pass it off?

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.720
So yeah, it depends
on the content.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.910
RICH: So Chris Bangs actually
chips in with "are these guys

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.153
on something?" Thanks
for that, Chris.

00:28:20.153 --> 00:28:20.920
CHRIS: [LAUGH]

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.700
RICH: Of course we are.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.220
Lack of sleep, actually.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.830
Writing a three hour
Drive presentation.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.710
NICK BUTCHER: Or a [? Leffe ?]
comedown, maybe.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.230
RICH: A [? Leffe ?]
comedown or not.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.940
Sorry about that.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.620
PAUL KINLAN: You go to
[? inn ?] last night?

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.040
RICH: Yeah.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.460
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.340
RICH: And then, Joe says, "Yeah,
you could launch your

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.510
intents from Google Drive to
open the file." Excellent

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:40.920
suggestion.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.060
And Sparky has put the
link to our code lab.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.380
Can you put that on comment
thread as well, Sparky?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.140
On the plus Android
developers.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.560
ALFREDO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.306
RICH: Yeah, but only people
inside the Hangout

00:28:53.306 --> 00:28:53.900
can see this one.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.762
Everybody to get access to it.

00:28:55.762 --> 00:28:57.100
But don't put it on YouTube.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.330
NICK BUTCHER: Shall I
go to the next, the

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.560
last Moderator one?

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.018
I'm going to skip one of them
because it links out to Stack

00:29:03.018 --> 00:29:05.440
Overflow, which I can't get to
because my internet's not.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.620
Burr Richard Thomson asks, "If
I have an app that displays a

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.620
list of places and then places
on a map, you could switch

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.260
between them with a dropdown
on the action bar.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.570
If the app offers other
features, which is the best

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.410
way to navigate to
other functions?

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.760
[INAUDIBLE] ."

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.800
So my answer would be, so that
sounds more like filtering the

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.215
same kind of data.

00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:31.500
So yeah, if you have the same
lists and you have two

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.370
representations, like a map
representation and a list

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.240
representation, you could
use a drop down.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.230
You could use overlay tabs.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:41.010
Might work quite nicely
in that situation.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.460
But then, if you had other
navigation options, then you'd

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.770
probably would want to go up a
[? speed ?] to get to those.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.690
You probably wouldn't want to
have one navigation type

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.492
affordance as well as a global
navigation affordance That

00:29:52.492 --> 00:29:53.840
sounds like it's getting
a little bit too much.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.440
You could do that with
a global drop downs,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:55.920
[? spin it, ?]

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.880
and then tabs underneath
to do the change

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.607
between map and list.

00:29:59.607 --> 00:30:00.501
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:03.370
RICH: I've seen that before.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.160
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.670
You could use a fly-in.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.510
RICH: A fly-in.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.350
NICK BUTCHER: I think fly-in
works well when you have a

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.320
list of stuff.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.685
Not so well when it's
a couple of things.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.860
It depends, again.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.110
Feel free to post some
sketches of what

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.850
you're trying to build.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:24.014
And mention that so we can chime
in with a few bits of

00:30:24.014 --> 00:30:24.880
feedback as well.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.120
It's hard to talk about
it in the abstract.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.320
RICH: Absolutely.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.120
RICH: Sparky, in the meantime,
are you following the plus

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.600
Android developer's comments,
in case there are any?

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.680
Because we can't see
them from this end.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.910
On the G+ post.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.604
We should get some questions
in there.

00:30:42.604 --> 00:30:45.576
More people asking to be
added to the Hangout.

00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:51.390
I think he's looking.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.186
Everyone's very, very quiet.

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:53.398
NICK BUTCHER: One question I
can show you, which I don't

00:30:53.398 --> 00:30:55.680
know answer to, "Does the new
Bluetooth stack in 4.2 support

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.070
BTE, Bluetooth for
Low Energy?"

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.270
RICH: Oh my god, we can have
a conversation about this.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.320
My Bluetooth knowledge
is not good enough.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.165
I know that we have
Bluetooth 4.0.

00:31:05.165 --> 00:31:06.100
The Nexus 4 has it.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.180
I know there is a new
Bluetooth stack.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.790
I don't know how all the
different profiles and into

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.490
API levels--

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.710
does Bluetooth 4 mean that has
things like low energy?

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.570
I don't know what Bluetooth
4 encompasses.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.300
Whether it means it has
a health profile--

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.560
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.785
I'm not an Android guy.

00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:27.780
No I mean, not in Android,
but just,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.150
generally, in the real world.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.920
Does anyone in the Hangout
have any knowledge on

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.490
Bluetooth, or has worked with
Bluetooth in any considerable

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.350
way before?

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.312
RICH: So I have something to
confess about Bluetooth.

00:31:38.312 --> 00:31:41.100
Because I didn't realize I could
create a personal area

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.775
network with it.

00:31:41.775 --> 00:31:44.060
And I used it.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.220
[? useful ?].

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.988
And I just worked from Android
straight away.

00:31:47.988 --> 00:31:48.900
ALFREDO: Wow it's magic.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.720
RICH: Yeah, I just [INAUDIBLE]
all my stuff to the

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.998
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:53.998 --> 00:31:55.400
NICK BUTCHER: Magic.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.700
ALFREDO: Blue magic,
not black.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.095
RICH: Nobody in the Hangout?

00:31:59.095 --> 00:32:03.550
AUDIENCE: So we've got one
question in the Google+ thread

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.695
if you wanted to tackle
that one.

00:32:04.695 --> 00:32:06.835
RICH: I was still on the
Bluetooth one, if anybody had

00:32:06.835 --> 00:32:09.662
any insights.

00:32:09.662 --> 00:32:11.650
No, I even looked this up.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.430
Sorry, Joe?

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.265
AUDIENCE: Wikipedia says
yeah, it does have

00:32:15.265 --> 00:32:16.810
that in version four.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.935
But on Wikipedia, version four
it says it has Bluetooth house

00:32:19.935 --> 00:32:23.420
feed and Bluetooth Low Energy.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.150
Wikipedia page says Bluetooth
four has low energy?

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.230
RICH: OK.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.446
Yeah, and again, I don't know if
we have APIs for that sort

00:32:32.446 --> 00:32:34.450
of thing, or if it's just
taken care of by

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.250
the Bluetooth stack.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.780
I'd imagine it's taken care of
by the Bluetooth stack from

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.060
with you can inquire if it's
in low-energy mode.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.918
[INAUDIBLE] a device that's
going to be connected the

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:42.646
whole time, like a heart
rate monitor or

00:32:42.646 --> 00:32:43.360
something, or a pulse--

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.872
I don't know.

00:32:44.872 --> 00:32:46.455
SPARKY RHODE: I didn't think
we're at that level of

00:32:46.455 --> 00:32:47.830
Bluetooth yet.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.520
Sorry?

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.670
I don't think we're at that
level of the Bluetooth API

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.230
yet, though.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.900
RICH: No, no, I don't
think we are either.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.806
But, because I've had quite a
few questions about it now,

00:32:57.806 --> 00:32:59.910
I'll try and look it
up during the week.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.790
And maybe we can talk
about it next week.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.818
Maybe we need to do an Android
developer's Bluetooth special.

00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:08.390
[LAUGH].

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.720
One person might join.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.200
And we'll be like, hey, this
all about Bluetooth.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.180
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.250
SPARKY RHODE: Also Paul
[? Hanson. ?]

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.425
RICH: Bluetooth's named
after a Viking?

00:33:16.425 --> 00:33:16.710
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.390
He managed to bring lots of
people to the table and they

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.645
all talked together.

00:33:19.645 --> 00:33:21.130
And that's what Bluetooth
is, making everyone

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.940
talk to each other.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.120
That's an epic piece
of knowledge, Nick.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.292
PAUL KINLAN: Well, I used to
live near the capital of

00:33:26.292 --> 00:33:27.395
Viking England.

00:33:27.395 --> 00:33:29.255
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:29.255 --> 00:33:31.120
RICH: Excellent.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.640
OK.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.890
RICH: Matt has a question
from the Android

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.580
developer's G+ thread.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.385
AUDIENCE: Of course, so in-app
purchasing and Google Checkout

00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:44.020
"Why can we not have a callback
functionality like a

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.030
normal Google Checkout
transaction?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.570
It should be important that we
know the status of payment,

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.800
especially for systems created
by developers that require

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.820
licensing based on a complete
and successful payment."

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.980
RICH: Yeah.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980
It's an in-app billing
question.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.696
Why can't we have a callback
for the payroll status.

00:34:03.937 --> 00:34:05.310
NICK BUTCHER: Good feedback.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.670
RICH: Yeah, good feedback.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.660
We're taking on board a lot of
in-app payments feedback at

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.480
the moment.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.620
Like the Play team took on board
a lot of feedback for

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.889
their developer console and
produced a new one, we're

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.810
taking on board feedback for
in-app billing, and we'll see

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.650
where that leads us.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.737
Personally, I would like an
updated API of some sort.

00:34:23.737 --> 00:34:24.929
NICK BUTCHER: I'd like
to get prices.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:25.510
RICH: Being able
to get prices.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.120
There's a lot of feedback
we get from conferences.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.690
Every time we stand up in front
of an audience, they

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.925
want to know how to get prices
and, similarly, the status of

00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:33.340
transactions.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.520
Things like this are
very important.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.510
So yeah.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:38.020
PAUL KINLAN: I'm going
to head off.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.110
RICH: Thanks very much
for joining us.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.790
PAUL KINLAN: No, thank you
for inviting me in.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.674
And if I've ruined
it, I'm sorry.

00:34:42.674 --> 00:34:43.340
RICH: If you want to pull
any funnier faces--

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.636
NICK BUTCHER: It was delight.

00:34:44.636 --> 00:34:46.050
PAUL KINLAN: I wasn't
pulling funny faces.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:46.580
NICK BUTCHER: That's
just his face.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.743
This is my normal face.

00:34:49.743 --> 00:34:50.920
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, anyway,
I'm going to see

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.480
the Dart talk, so--

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:51.956
RICH: All right.

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:52.790
PAUL KINLAN: Catch
you guy later.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:53.480
RICH: Seth's talking?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.911
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:56.909
PAUL KINLAN: Seth Ladd
talking about Dart.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.110
We're doing the keynote
tomorrow.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.268
NICK BUTCHER: Oh yeah, we're
going on about Devoxx, but

00:35:01.268 --> 00:35:03.580
they are all going to be
available on all parlays.com.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.800
As well, so if you hear us
talking about it, you should

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.460
check out the schedule.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.600
There's some really,
really cool talks.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.150
I'm really looking forward to
on from Chen Roman tomorrow

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.010
again, for better, for worse.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.085
Get some really technical
information about the Android

00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:18.195
rendering system.

00:35:18.195 --> 00:35:20.340
There was a really, really
good three-hour talk from

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.750
yesterday which was packed full
of tips, and tricks, and

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:26.920
how to get to the bottom
of performance issues.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.305
And I learned a lot, so we'll
try and disseminate that.

00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:31.585
RICH: Yeah, we'll have to show
those links for the parlays

00:35:31.585 --> 00:35:34.450
when we're online, on the G+,
if people can see them.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.760
Also, we were just up in
Chet Roman's What's

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.812
New in Android talk.

00:35:38.812 --> 00:35:41.802
And they said there were now 560
million activated devices.

00:35:41.802 --> 00:35:43.522
I'm not sure I'd heard
that number before.

00:35:43.522 --> 00:35:48.860
I was still running
500 million.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.330
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:51.920
should we go to another
question?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.830
RICH: Yeah, let's do it.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.130
Next muffin.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.500
NICK BUTCHER: Shall I go?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.160
A question for Chris
in the moderator--

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.030
someone says, "what?

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.180
Have you got two new Nexus 4s?

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:58.200
Can I have

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.926
one?" CHRIS: No.

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:05.710
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.310
RICH: Sorry.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.450
That was mean, evil and--

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.600
We did something similar in
Chet's talk when they said has

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.250
anyone got the 4.2 update yet?

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:12.860
NICK BUTCHER: I didn't hear.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.500
I saw Chris pop up, so I'm
guessing you answered.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.506
But I believe you sent or
canceled the orders, right?

00:36:17.506 --> 00:36:19.770
They're not up for grabs.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.498
CHRIS: Only Rich can
hear me, so.

00:36:21.498 --> 00:36:22.980
RICH: Yeah, I can hear
you fine, Chris.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.220
CHRIS: Yes, I ordered five
and canceled three.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.084
RICH: Canceled three.

00:36:29.084 --> 00:36:30.480
CHRIS: I've got two .

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.765
RICH: Two 16s?

00:36:31.765 --> 00:36:33.120
CHRIS: Two 16s.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.900
RICH: Good for you.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.640
Yeah, we had a few people who
managed to order multiple.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.258
They haven't had any trouble
uploading them.

00:36:38.258 --> 00:36:39.602
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:39.602 --> 00:36:42.330
So hopefully, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.400
SPARKY RHODE: I read that those
Nexus 4s sold out in

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.020
Germany in 15 minutes.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.550
RICH: Yeah, there were people
here at Devoxx who were

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.568
to Germany trying to
find the device.

00:36:50.568 --> 00:36:55.020
I think that the whole thing
was quite painful.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.280
NICK BUTCHER: Any
live questions?

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.015
RICH: Any live questions?

00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:58.948
Or oh, Matt's just typed
something in.

00:36:58.948 --> 00:37:00.198
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:05.920
SPARKY RHODE: Hey.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.420
RICH: I really, really don't
know anymore about the

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.200
low-energy stuff.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.981
We will, we'll try and bring
some more information to you

00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:15.070
on the Bluetooth stack
in the coming weeks.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.220
We might not be able to
get it next week.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.424
Maybe we can even get a
Bluetooth engineer from the

00:37:18.424 --> 00:37:19.964
Android team online.

00:37:19.964 --> 00:37:21.176
NICK BUTCHER: Just
read the source.

00:37:21.176 --> 00:37:24.548
RICH: Or just read the source.

00:37:24.548 --> 00:37:26.000
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.030
The API.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.400
RICH: Come on then,
next question.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.250
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, one more?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.660
So Alley in Chicago says, "Is
content provider testing

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.220
possible with multiple
authorities?" He needs to test

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.930
a batch operation, "but I cannot
do that with current

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.985
test case classes, as they
can only be mapped to one

00:37:44.985 --> 00:37:51.417
authority." Does anyone know?

00:37:51.417 --> 00:37:54.400
Because I don't.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.010
RICH: Alfredo's searching
his memory banks.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.260
ALFREDO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.330
NICK BUTCHER: Sorry man.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.090
RICH: Someone who's got a PC
might be able to have a quick

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.990
look at that, but I don't have
anything off the top of my

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.910
head to test--

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.470
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.150
Sorry, [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.740
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.180
NICK BUTCHER: OK, another one
is coming in from Rob M in

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.000
London, saying he has a path,
which is SVG vector, which

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.945
he's drawing to canvas
using draw path.

00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:26.550
"As of Jell Bean, there seems to
be a new optimization that

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.800
stops it drawing if any of the
path is below 0, 0, ie, there

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.210
are negative path points.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:33.510
Is this a new optimization?

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.856
Is there a way around?"

00:38:34.856 --> 00:38:36.770
RICH: Now that's what we need
Chet and Roman for.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:37.500
Come on.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.496
NICK BUTCHER: Roman because
he probably wrote that.

00:38:40.496 --> 00:38:40.900
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.460
Chet, or Roman, or both.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.860
They usually come as a pair.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.440
ALFREDO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.930
RICH: Yeah, have a look
upstairs, around the place.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:47.705
Maybe you can--

00:38:47.705 --> 00:38:48.840
ALFREDO: Yes, I will
be back with him.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.690
RICH: If you find him, don't
let him get away because he

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.110
could answer this question.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.110
NICK BUTCHER: So we don't
know the answer,

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.250
Roman definitely will.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.648
We will try and track him down,
and if we don't get him

00:38:56.648 --> 00:38:58.360
before the end of the show, we
will reply in the Moderator.

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:02.750
But I'm guessing yes.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.250
I believe, actually, we only
added support for draw path to

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.490
be done by the hardware
rendering

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.390
pipeline as of 4.1 right.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.780
So that sounds like it could
be exactly this.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.070
So if it was previously being
done by the software pipeline,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.780
and then we switch to the new
hardware rendering pipeline,

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.160
you might perhaps switch this
kind of change in behavior.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.160
RICH: You could always find out
by testing with hardware.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.745
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you're
talking like a [? target ?]

00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:27.440
SDK of 16 or more, you'll
automatically opt into the

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.460
hardware pipeline.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.100
You could get in a view and
say set layer type to

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.610
software, which will turn off
the hardware accelerator to

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.030
the pipline, and see if you
get the old behavior.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.950
And then you can be sure that
it is a hardware/software

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.240
rendering issue.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.510
RICH: I'd imagine it is.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.620
It sounds a lot like one.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.084
Cool.

00:39:49.084 --> 00:39:51.524
OK.

00:39:51.524 --> 00:39:55.580
Was that Matt just jumping
out and jumping in again?

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.180
MATT: Yep.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.430
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.800
NICK BUTCHER: Last question I
could see in the Moderator

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.250
here comes from Gregory
[? Mince ?] saying, he has

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.380
several pressure ports reporting
a SQL [? Light ?]

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.630
exception which says can't
upgrade, read any database in

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.865
version 0.2.3.

00:40:11.865 --> 00:40:16.480
And it only occurs on some
devices, particularly one

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.580
U8860 something device.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.642
Any ideas why this may occur?

00:40:21.642 --> 00:40:23.200
AUDIENCE: That sounds
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.220
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.292
a little bit more
context on that.

00:40:26.292 --> 00:40:26.760
NICK BUTCHER: I know.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.440
RICH: Is he trying
to update his--

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.208
what luck.

00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:32.410
Is it in his own [? name? ?]

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.508
AUDIENCE: Do you think that's
a Huawei device?

00:40:34.508 --> 00:40:37.310
Sounds like it.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.330
RICH: It was a what,
sorry joe?

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.335
AUDIENCE: A Huawei?

00:40:39.335 --> 00:40:42.090
I don't know how to
say it properly--

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.240
the Chinese one?

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.595
RICH: The [? five ?]

00:40:44.595 --> 00:40:45.660
[? dye ?] class?

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.500
AUDIENCE: A Huawei device?

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.640
RICH: Oh, a Huawei device.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.890
NICK BUTCHER: Huawei.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.160
RICH: Huawei, yeah, yeah, I
think it probably is as well.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.220
NICK BUTCHER: So if it's a
device-specific issue, like,

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.390
if it's working fine on a bunch
of other devices, then

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.710
I'd say, for now I would
blacklist the device in the

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.230
supported device section
of Play Store console.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.020
And then I would try and either
get hold of a device or

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.720
perhaps use a service like
testdroid.com to try

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.260
and debug the issue.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.170
I'm not sure we're going to be
able to do much offhand here

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.740
about more logs.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.220
RICH: Yeah, it's
a strange one.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.655
Trying to upgrade read only
database problem?

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.440
NICK BUTCHER: It's a
speculation, I think.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.480
Sparky said something about it
might be running out of space.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.490
No Andrew [? Kelley ?]
says this.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:35.140
RICH: Yeah, if you can get any
more details of the code that

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.035
you're running through the
database upgrade, any stack

00:41:38.035 --> 00:41:40.950
traces that you're seeing, put
them into the Moderator and

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:41.670
we're going to have
a look at that.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.780
Or come back next week with an
updated question with a little

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.320
bit more context so we can look
into it during the week.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.267
Yeah, with all bugs, the key is
being able to replicate, I

00:41:50.267 --> 00:41:52.130
guess, so perhaps getting hold
of the device somehow, like

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.240
virtually or physically.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.725
RICH: But you can always have
a look in your Google Play

00:41:55.725 --> 00:41:56.195
developer console.

00:41:56.195 --> 00:41:58.475
And in there, have a look at
crash reports, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:58.475 --> 00:42:00.990
stack track because I'm guessing
that's where you're

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.860
seeing it anyway.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.857
But if you can get a stack trace
out of there and send it

00:42:03.857 --> 00:42:07.320
to us, ready for next week's
office hours, hopefully we can

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.030
come up with an answer
for you.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.780
NICK BUTCHER: He's linked to
some stuff in the question.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.300
So maybe he's done that--

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.240
RICH: Oh, sorry.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.060
Hopefully it's at Stack
Overflow or something.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.000
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.420
RICH: OK

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.800
NICK BUTCHER: Are there any
comments in the plus thread?

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.970
RICH: Here's a good
hint for you guys.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:28.510
So if you get your Android 4.2
device and you want to plug it

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:33.190
in to the USB to get your USB
debugging connected up to your

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.270
Android SDK, you're going to
hit the Settings screen.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.580
You can either drag down
once from the top or

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.285
twice from the top.

00:42:39.285 --> 00:42:39.560
And hit Settings.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.930
Get through to Settings, and
you'll scroll down to the

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.290
bottom, and you won't find
developer options anymore.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.440
Oh my god!

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.630
Da-da-da-da-da.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.992
Hopefully it's been going
around on G+.

00:42:48.992 --> 00:42:53.190
But because we have 560 million
users, and only a

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.505
fraction of them are actual
Android developers, we've

00:42:55.505 --> 00:42:57.640
hidden the developer
options now.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.750
So you now go right down to the
bottom of Settings to the

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.830
advanced screen, and start
tapping on the build line.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.550
You tap it, and then it says
five, four, three, two, one.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.880
You keep tapping, and then it
says, congratulations, you are

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.530
now the developer.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:14.190
And then developer options
will reappear.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.910
If you run multi-user system on
a new Nexus 10 tablet, go

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.310
to be the primary
user to do that.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.276
Multi-user system, the first
person who logs in is the

00:43:23.276 --> 00:43:24.890
primary user, and they have
control over that.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.544
They can delete through accounts
and [? once ?] we can

00:43:27.544 --> 00:43:30.954
get access to the debugging
options.

00:43:30.954 --> 00:43:33.210
I just thought I'd throw that
in there, because we've

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.345
already had that question once,
and we're bound to get

00:43:35.345 --> 00:43:36.690
it get a couple more times.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.920
NICK BUTCHER: So I think
we exhausted

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.850
the Moderator thread.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.640
In the G+ announcement posts,
Michael [? Back ?] asks what

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.460
our favorite APIs in
Android 4.2 are.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.890
I think we've given our
favorites, so I went for

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.580
presentation API,
and [INAUDIBLE],

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.480
and stuff like that.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.410
And Rich went for Daydreams,
did you say?

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.520
RICH: Oh, I don't know.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.260
I think locked-screen
widgets for me.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.360
NICK BUTCHER: You're
Mr. Widget.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.250
RICH: I am Mr. Widget.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.560
NICK BUTCHER: Search for Widget,
and you find his app.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.200
First result, no second
result now.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.685
Beautiful Widgets
edged you out.

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:08.390
RICH: Beautiful Widgets, damn
your Beautiful Widgets.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.300
They're just so pretty.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:10.880
NICK BUTCHER: And they work
on a locked screen.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.980
And they have a Daydream.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.402
RICH: OK, OK, easy, easy.

00:44:13.402 --> 00:44:15.286
Damn you.

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:18.390
Yeah, so locked-screen widgets,
the same API as

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.286
normal widgets.

00:44:19.286 --> 00:44:19.622
NICK BUTCHER: One.

00:44:19.622 --> 00:44:19.960
One feature.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.382
Favorite feature.

00:44:21.382 --> 00:44:23.120
RICH: I was just going to tell
them what locked-screen

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:23.630
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.202
But yeah, locked-screen widgets,
favorite feature.

00:44:25.202 --> 00:44:26.850
Because I want [INAUDIBLE] and
the music [? to both ?] have

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.410
locked-screen widgets, so when
I'm running I can just see

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.710
both, and I don't need
to unlock my phone.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.674
I just want to hit the power
button-- oh yeah, I've done 12

00:44:33.674 --> 00:44:36.650
kilometers, and I'm listening
to [MICHAEL JACKSON SOUND].

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:38.050
NICK BUTCHER: But I think
it's a good question.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.190
I want to open it up to you
guys who are live in the

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.320
Hangout here.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.570
If you've had a chance to look
at the 4.2 APIs, what's the

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.525
things that you're most excited
about and can't wait

00:44:47.525 --> 00:44:49.104
to implement in your apps.

00:44:49.104 --> 00:44:50.893
And Rich is going to have to
tell me what they say.

00:44:50.893 --> 00:44:51.525
RICH: Go ahead, one by one.

00:44:51.525 --> 00:44:53.060
Starting with Chris.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.755
CHRIS: I think the
Presentation API.

00:44:54.755 --> 00:44:57.740
I haven't had a play with it
yet, but I think the power of

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.276
it and what you can do with
it is pretty massive.

00:45:01.276 --> 00:45:04.470
RICH: Yeah, if you want to see
an example of that, we've got

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.660
a device [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.190
NICK BUTCHER: Or there's the
example in the API demos.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.412
RICH: And there's an
example there.

00:45:10.412 --> 00:45:12.920
AUDIENCE: I like the the
Presentation as well because

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.220
it would be really useful being
able to just seamlessly

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.652
show some content.

00:45:17.652 --> 00:45:18.690
It would be really good.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.620
But as well, I saw Dreams in the
support package before it

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.750
launched, and I thought,
what on Earth is that?

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.595
RICH: So he did spot Dreams
in the support

00:45:28.595 --> 00:45:30.080
package for his launch.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.070
What the hell is that?

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.050
Well, that's Presentation,
Presentation, did you say

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.910
Presentation?

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.630
Three to Presentation.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.360
AUDIENCE: I think I'm going
to go for Daydreams.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.095
That one is quite an
interesting one.

00:45:42.095 --> 00:45:43.390
RICH: We've got one for
Daydreams, three for

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.200
presentation, one for
Loxby widgets.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.580
Richard Thompson, maybe you
can type in the sidebar

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.295
whilst Sparky tells us
what his favorite new

00:45:51.295 --> 00:45:53.000
API in the SDK is.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.420
SPARKY RHODE: I don't know if it
counts as an API very much,

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.970
but honestly, I think my
favorite new feature is

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.460
improved bi-directional tech
support because I'm really

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.980
excited about opening up Android
to that next couple of

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.130
billion users.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.771
RICH: Improved bi-directional
tech support.

00:46:06.771 --> 00:46:09.350
To open up Android to the extra
couple of billion users.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:09.670
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.560
RICH: That's looking
at the big picture.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.280
NICK BUTCHER: Pro-tip with
that is don't use the new

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.110
constants as well.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.570
We used to use gravity left,
gravity right in your layouts.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.890
So you'd see like gravity to
text, one side or the other.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.030
You now want to be looking at
using gravity star and gravity

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.810
n so that that will do the right
thing in right to left

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.400
languages, rather than
just left to right.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.810
And it's completely backward
compatible because it's a bit

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.790
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.934
So it will still work on
older devices as well.

00:46:33.934 --> 00:46:35.838
So take a look at the constants
when you set the

00:46:35.838 --> 00:46:36.790
gravity on text.

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:38.220
But yeah, good point.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.630
RICH: And I think we've just
been joined by Al Sutton.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.230
AL SUTTON: Hey guys.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.790
RICH: There it is, it's
definitely Al, stuck in a tiny

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.617
thumbnail in the very,
very distance.

00:46:46.617 --> 00:46:47.114
NICK BUTCHER: Ooh-yeah.

00:46:47.114 --> 00:46:48.110
RICH: Ooh-yeah.

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.262
[INAUDIBLE] making a joke.

00:46:49.262 --> 00:46:49.680
NICK BUTCHER: See what I did?

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.080
RICH: So jumping straight in
there, Al, what's your

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.465
favorite new API
in the new SDK?

00:46:53.465 --> 00:46:54.530
I bet you've checked
it out already.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.735
AL SUTTON: Oh yeah, There's
one method that

00:46:55.735 --> 00:46:56.410
I absolutely love.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.300
And that's User Manager
dot Is A Goat.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.370
RICH: User Manager
dot Is A Goat.

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:02.980
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.020
that you'd spotted that User
Manager dot Is A Goat exists.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.825
NICK BUTCHER: Always
was though.

00:47:05.825 --> 00:47:08.610
RICH: And what was the
description of the method?

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.720
AL SUTTON: It tells you whether
the user is a goat

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.620
capable of transplantation.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.070
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.165
It tells you whether the user is
capable of transportation.

00:47:16.165 --> 00:47:18.460
NICK BUTCHER: So you can now
check if the user is a monkey,

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.646
and if the user is a goat.

00:47:20.646 --> 00:47:23.205
But user is a monkey
is actually useful.

00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:24.600
AL SUTTON: [LAUGH]

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.670
RICH: It is actually, true.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:27.900
AUDIENCE: I saw something
on Google+ about

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.350
that relating to Chrome.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.390
Because Chrome has some menu--

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.302
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:35.302 --> 00:47:36.905
AUDIENCE: It's on Chrome as
well about goats being

00:47:36.905 --> 00:47:39.160
teleported.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.750
RICH: Something about how fast
[INAUDIBLE] teleporting.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:42.290
AL SUTTON: Yeah,
it's on Chrome.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.630
On Chrome, if you go into
the debug options.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.650
AL SUTTON: How many goats
have been transported.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.267
RICH: How many goats have
been transported is a

00:47:51.267 --> 00:47:52.930
debug option in Chrome?

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.370
How many goats have been
transported is a

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:56.040
debug option in Chrome?

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.230
AL SUTTON: One of the Collins.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.840
RICH: Paul's nodding.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.370
Paul Kinlan.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.350
He's never tried it himself.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.730
NICK BUTCHER: But no one
says [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:07.618
RICH: We need to go deeper.

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:10.040
AL SUTTON: [LAUGH]

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.616
RICH: Chris was asking about
that on G+ earlier today.

00:48:12.616 --> 00:48:14.770
So that was three for
presentation.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.496
Three for people who care about
just watching stuff on

00:48:16.496 --> 00:48:17.880
their own big TV.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.500
One for the rest of the world.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.456
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:20.456 --> 00:48:22.670
NICK BUTCHER: OK, I'm going to
give a few pro-tips as well,

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.810
new stuff in developer
settings.

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.010
So when you've done your tap,
tap to get your developer

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.382
options back, there's a few new
interesting settings you

00:48:29.382 --> 00:48:30.520
want to take a look at.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.555
First one, I'm going to say is
the yeah, if you want to

00:48:33.555 --> 00:48:35.930
develop these presentations
but you don't have a TV or

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:42.550
Miracast display, there's a new
option to emulate a second

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.010
display so that you can develop
for it and your device

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.830
will see a second display.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:51.490
Second one I'm going to talk
about is what was it I was

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:52.600
going to say?

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.035
RICH: Developer options.

00:48:53.035 --> 00:48:53.290
NICK BUTCHER: Over draw.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:53.970
Over draw.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.410
So there's a new option in
there so you can tell the

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.130
hardware rendering pipeline to
overlay how much over drawing

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.885
you're doing.

00:49:01.885 --> 00:49:04.160
So I think that's one of
biggest problems in

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.470
applications' performance.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.425
So if you're try to just
basically do too much.

00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:09.200
So we're all lazy, just
don't do any work.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.130
You don't have to, basically.

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.240
This is a cool tool in developer
options which will

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.786
overlay in blue, if you're
drawing twice, or green, if

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.180
you're drawing three times.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.200
Or like red, if you're drawing
the pixels five times, which

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.460
is extremely wasteful.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.270
So that's really, really cool
way to know if you're doing

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.340
too much work.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.642
And then you can use the tracer
for Open GLES tool,

00:49:30.642 --> 00:49:33.690
which is part of the SDK to
actually step through your

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.780
rendering operations and work
out, oh, I'm drawing an opaque

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.035
background.

00:49:37.035 --> 00:49:39.900
And I'm drawing a completely
opaque layer on top of that.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.810
So that's completely wasted
drawing pixels.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:43.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.240
so that's a super tool.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:45.865
RICH: Absolutely, yeah.

00:49:45.865 --> 00:49:47.320
Roman ran through some examples
yesterday where he'd

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.950
been doing this, reducing the
number of layers of drawing

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.520
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.795
NICK BUTCHER: Yes, if you want
to get buttery smooth

00:49:54.795 --> 00:49:55.728
scrolling lists, then
don't be drawing

00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:56.260
every pixel five times.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.440
RICH: We just spotted a Jake
Wharton walking by as well.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.285
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:00.285 --> 00:50:02.920
RICH: Who's now got no choice
but to come on and say hello.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.110
NICK BUTCHER: So we're doing
our regular Office Hours

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.555
Hangout, and unfortunately
there's no sound.

00:50:06.555 --> 00:50:07.250
Only Rich can hear--

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.028
RICH: I can hear all the guys
and they say [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:09.028 --> 00:50:10.390
as well.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.010
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.240
Do you want to say hello, and
what you do, and what you're

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.710
doing here at Devoxx?

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:15.200
JAKE WHARTON: Sure.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.070
So I'm--

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:20.170
My name is Jake Wharton, I work
at Square, and I do a ton

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.320
of open source stuff.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.210
Speaking about all the open
source projects that I've done

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:30.690
and Square puts out and
hopefully getting some

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:34.170
excitement for all these
projects and so that everyone

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.830
can make better apps.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.320
NICK BUTCHER: So if you don't
know, Jake writes a Action Bar

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:38.800
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:45.570
RICH: So I'm asking now, do
you have statistics on the

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.140
number of applications that
are using your libraries?

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.840
JAKE WHARTON: Uh, no.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.850
But [? apres ?]

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.910
website, they do lists, and
it's pretty high up.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:55.405
I think it was in the top 10.

00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:56.130
NICK BUTCHER: The support
library--

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:57.425
JAKE WHARTON: The support
library's way at the top.

00:50:57.425 --> 00:50:58.775
It's like 20%.

00:50:58.775 --> 00:51:00.960
I mean it's only something
like 1% of installs.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.860
RICH: 1% of installs?

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:06.050
JAKE WHARTON: Yeah, and that's
only whatever they track.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.165
NICK BUTCHER: But that's all
the best apps because they

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:10.060
care about having an
action bar across--

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:10.250
JAKE WHARTON: Right.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.940
But it's also only free apps.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.232
Because I don't think they can
get data from paid apps.

00:51:15.232 --> 00:51:16.680
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, really.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.830
AL SUTTON: Can you give him a
pat on the back in a combined

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:22.350
thanks from everyone here?

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.155
Because [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:23.155 --> 00:51:25.470
library.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:28.939
RICH: Al says, can we give you
a combined thanks from

00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:31.276
everyone here and the entire
Android developer community.

00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:32.070
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, bravo sir.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:32.506
RICH: Thanks very much, Jake.

00:51:32.506 --> 00:51:35.092
JAKE WHARTON: You're welcome.

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:35.520
RICH: Cool.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.128
How are we doing for time?

00:51:37.128 --> 00:51:39.650
My clock is minuscule
and a long way away.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:40.200
NICK BUTCHER: Five minutes to.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.720
RICH: OK, in the last five
minutes are there any more

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.220
questions coming in on the
comments thread or live from

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.240
the Hangout?

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.510
AL SUTTON: I can probably answer
the one about the SQL

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.230
database one earlier about
getting the error

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.623
about the read only?

00:51:52.623 --> 00:51:53.470
RICH: Cheers Jake,
thanks very much

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.794
JAKE WHARTON: OK, bye.

00:51:54.794 --> 00:51:55.670
RICH: Go on then.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:57.510
Go on, give a quick answer
if [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.290
AL SUTTON: I've come across the
read-only problem before.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.510
It was on early versions
of Android 2.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.370
And the best way to get around
it was to do a get writeable

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:07.280
on create and then close the
database straight afterwards.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.110
It's pretty hacky, but it seemed
to solve the issue in

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.210
almost every case.

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.022
RICH: Excellent.

00:52:12.022 --> 00:52:15.194
I think that solves the issue,
probably, as well.

00:52:15.194 --> 00:52:16.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.470
Talk about this later.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.120
All right, I think we're
finished with the Moderator.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.550
Matt, were there any
more questions on

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.518
the comments thread?

00:52:23.518 --> 00:52:26.950
MATT: Um, no, we've kind of
had a couple requests for

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.750
whether there's going to be an
official doc for the Nexus 4

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:30.820
and other devices.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.520
Daydream will work.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.240
RICH: An officialy doc
for the Nexus 4.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.330
The Nexus 4 [INAUDIBLE] while
it's charging, and Daydreams

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.920
will work when it's docked
into that, yes.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.220
NICK BUTCHER: When you set up
Daydreams, you have the choice

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.272
to tell it when to dream.

00:52:44.272 --> 00:52:45.590
So the choices are--
when docked, when

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:48.070
on power, or both.

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:49.960
So you can choose
one of those.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.649
RICH: I'm looking forward to
getting hold of the Nexus 4's

00:52:53.649 --> 00:52:54.780
official wireless charger.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.120
I haven't seen one myself yet,
but I've seen a video from it.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.908
It is a standard, the wireless
charging standard we're using.

00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:02.904
So we use a power plate of
some sort in the office.

00:53:02.904 --> 00:53:04.996
I think it's Energizer,
the one we've got?

00:53:04.996 --> 00:53:07.263
So you can get these things off
Amazon relatively cheap,

00:53:07.263 --> 00:53:08.646
for kind of $20.

00:53:08.646 --> 00:53:09.876
NICK BUTCHER: I think the Nokia
ones work as well, the

00:53:09.876 --> 00:53:10.030
little pillow.

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.470
RICH: Yeah. we're a embracing
the standards with the

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:13.490
wireless charger.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.857
But it's really nice just to
be able to drop it down on

00:53:14.857 --> 00:53:15.990
your bedside table.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.010
NICK BUTCHER: I can't
for Ikea to build it

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:19.390
into my bedside table.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:20.312
RICH: Oh, I want furniture.

[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.710
AL SUTTON: Do we know if, by
default, Android daydreams of

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.580
electric sheep?

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.040
RICH: Do we know if, by default,
if Android daydreams

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.070
of electric sheep?

like a [INAUDIBLE].

still the handy games
app recently.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.390
Maybe?

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.042

Please do that.

RICH: That would be epic.

00:53:58.338 --> 00:53:58.775
NICK BUTCHER: Do it.

00:53:58.775 --> 00:54:00.360
RICH: We'll give you a shout
out in the next office

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.360
hours if you do.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:01.670
OK.

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.230
I think we're out of time.

is thank you for joining

be on Parlays as well.

00:54:35.388 --> 00:54:35.882
Look out of that.

00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:36.705
I'm sure it will be excellent.

00:54:36.705 --> 00:54:36.870
RICH: OK

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.700
NICK BUTCHER: And yeah, you can
go to my profile, and I've

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.000
shared a link to the code out
that we gave on using Drive to

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.306
sync data between your apps, and
the web, and everywhere,

00:54:44.306 --> 00:54:45.850
so that everything
stays in sync.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.850
RICH: Again, thank you very much
for the people who joined

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:48.250
us live in the Hangout.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.700
It helps us out massively today
when we couldn't hear,

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.990
read, or speak with
any of you.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:54.130
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, conferences.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.610
RICH: Yes, cheers all of you.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.722
Thank you very much.

00:54:57.722 --> 00:54:59.200
And we'll see you next week.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:54:59.946
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.

00:54:59.946 --> 00:55:01.170
AUDIENCE: Bye guys.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:02.070
CHRIS: See you.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:03.320
AL SUTTON: Bye everyone.
