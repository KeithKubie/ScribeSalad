00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.330
- [Instructor] Duncan is
investigating if residence

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.570
of a city support the
construction of a new high school.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.090
He's curious about the
difference of opinion

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.670
between residence in the north
and south parts of the city.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.080
He obtained separate
random samples of voters

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.190
from each region, here are the results.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.540
So let's see, in the
north 54 out of the 120

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.140
said they want the school,
66 said they didn't.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.330
In the south 77 said
they wanted the school,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.300
63 said they didn't.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.810
Duncan wants to use these
results to construct

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.300
a 90% confidence interval to estimate

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.540
the difference in the
proportion of residence

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.160
in these regions who support
the construction project.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.270
P sub S minus P sub N.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.740
So these are the true
parameters for the difference

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.630
between these two populations.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.100
Assume that all of the
conditions for inference

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.610
have been met.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.710
Alright, which of the
following is a correct

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.020
90% confidence interval
based on Duncan's sample?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.870
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.700
and you will need a calculator

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.890
and depending on your calculator

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.683
you might need a Z table as well.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.510
In a previous video we introduced the idea

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.100
of a two sample Z interval
and we talked about

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440
the conditions for inference.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.890
Lucky for us here they say the conditions

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.360
for inference have been met.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.100
So we can go straight to calculating

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.220
the confidence interval.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.060
And that confidence
interval is going to be

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.088
the difference between
the sample proportions,

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:29.010
so P sub S hat, so the sample
proportion in the south

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.650
minus the sample proportion in the north,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.200
it's gonna be that
difference plus or minus

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.870
our critical value, Z
star, times our estimate

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.960
of the standard deviation
of the sampling distribution

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.510
of the difference between
the sample proportions.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.270
And that is going to be our estimate

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.270
is going to be P hat sub S times one minus

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.580
P hat sub S, all of that over
the sample size in the south

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.140
plus P hat sub N times
one minus P hat sub N,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.883
all of that over the
sample size in the north.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580
Okay, so our sample
proportion in the south,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.470
I'll later use a calculator
to get a decimal value,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.000
but this is going to be in the south

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.010
we have 77 out of 140 support it.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.110
So this is going to be 77 out of 140.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.110
In the north this is
going to be 54 out of 120,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.380
54 out of 120.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.653
What is my critical Z value?

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:41.220
Well here I'm gonna have
to either use a calculator

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.370
or a Z table.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.250
Remember, we have a 90%
confidence interval.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.060
And so, let me see, I'll
draw it right over here.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.150
If this is a normal distribution

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.410
and you wanna have a
90% confidence interval

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.659
that means you're containing 90%

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.060
of the distribution which
means each of these tails

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.980
well combined they would have 10%,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.440
but each of them would have
5% of the distribution.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.809
And so I'm gonna look at a Z table

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.160
that figures out how
many standard deviations

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.330
below the mean do I need to be

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.800
in order to get 5% right over here?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.430
And then that's going to tell me,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.630
well if I'm that far below or above

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.670
that's gonna be my critical Z value.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.713
So let me get that Z table out.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.240
So I care about 5% and
I'm using this in a bit

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.133
of a reverse direction, but let's see, 5%.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.730
So this a little over
5%, I'm getting closer

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.940
to 5%, even closer to 5%, now
we've gotten right below 5%.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.210
So we're gonna be in
between this and this.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.580
I could just split the difference

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.453
and I could just say,
1.6, let's just say 1.645

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.680
to go right in between.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
So this is going to be
approximately equal to 1.645.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.030
And then let's see, we
know what P hat sub S is,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.810
we know what P hat sub N is.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.580
In the south our sample size is 140

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.250
and in the north our sample size is 120.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.230
And so now I just have to type all of this

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.310
into the calculator, which
is gonna get a little hairy,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.530
but we will do it together.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.300
For the sake of time we'll accelerate

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.790
this typing into the calculator.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.320
But I'm gonna start with
calculating the upper bound

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.443
and then we'll calculate the lower bound.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.610
And then I think I've
closed all my parentheses

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.030
and so I think we're ready
to get the upper bound

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.030
is going to be equal to
0.218 or approximately 0.202.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.950
So we can immediately look at our choices

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.890
and see where is at the upper bound.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.680
And so this one is looking
pretty good, 0.202,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.320
but let's get the lower bound now.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.040
So I got my calculator back,
instead of retyping everything

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.290
I'm just gonna put a minus here.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.310
So I go to second, and just
so you see what I'm doing,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.610
second entry, I see the entry back

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.610
and then I can just
change, I can just change

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.610
the part where right before the radical.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:21.830
So we are going to, alright,
so this just needs to be

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.830
a minus, click enter,
and there you have it.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.850
Our lower bound is negative 0.002.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.970
And that is indeed this
choice right over here.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.543
So there we go, we have picked our choice.
