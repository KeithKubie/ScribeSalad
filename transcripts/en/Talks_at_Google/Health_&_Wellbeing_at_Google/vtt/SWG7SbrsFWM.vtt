DINA WEISBERGER:
I'm Dina Weisberger.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.700
PETER DOLCHIN: And
I'm Peter Dolchin.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.340
We're both from the Global
Partnerships group on the Telco

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.395
and Video Distributors team.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:16.020
DINA WEISBERGER: We'd
like to thank you

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.936
for taking the time out
of your busy schedules

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:19.330
to join us today.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.720
Our talk is about
destigmatizing suicide.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.920
And as someone recently
affected by it,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.150
I learned, while it might be
a hard subject to navigate,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.210
it is also crucial we bring this
topic from out of the shadows

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.189
and into the light.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.850
The goal today and for future
Talks at Google on suicide

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.370
is to raise awareness
surrounding mental illness

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.620
and help create a space
for those affected

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.390
by it to feel supported.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.500
So thank you for showing up
and demonstrating your support.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.170
We and Nicole are on
a mission to change

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.440
the public perception of
suicide by eliminating

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.019
the silence around it.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.560
We believe one of
the best ways to do

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.800
this is to connect a real
beloved person to a deeply

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.210
stigmatized word, suicide,
through stories and images.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.820
Before Nicole talks about
losing her daughter, Dominique,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.070
to suicide, she'll
share a brief montage.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.680
While this may be an emotionally
evocative experience for many

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.440
of you, we hope that it
empowers those of you who

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.840
are suffering to reach out
for help, and for those

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
who know a loved one who is
struggling to approach them.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.660
With that said, we wanted to
highlight the mental health

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.720
resources available
at Google and beyond.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.600
Because the topic of suicide
is not one to be taken lightly,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
we want to encourage anyone with
suicidal thoughts who are just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.020
looking for someone to talk
to to please reach out to one

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.000
of the resources listed here--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.660
the National Suicide Prevention
Hotline, the Crisis Text Line,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.090
and the American Foundation
for Suicide Prevention which

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.460
you can just find support.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.667
There are biological and
psychological treatments

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.750
that can help you address
underlying mental health

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.850
issues leading to suicide,
and we want everyone

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.530
to know there is a path forward.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.300
Thank you.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.530
PETER DOLCHIN: Thanks, Dina.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.110
So onto our speaker for today.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.360
We are fortunate and
I'm personally honored

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.730
to have Nicole
Browning with us today.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.669
Nicole lost her beautiful and
talented daughter, Dominique,

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.340
to suicide in 2007,
and has made it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.400
her mission to destigmatize
suicide and mental illness.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.640
I've known Nicole
since 2005 when

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.900
I joined Viacom, which was
MTV Networks at the time.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.300
Nicole led a team
of over 100 people

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.160
and was our fearless leader.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.560
In the span of my
career, I've come

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.935
across a few truly genuine
and inspirational leaders,

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:34.810
and Nicole is
absolutely one of them.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.450
She's a very special
woman and I'm

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.930
so grateful that she agreed
to speak to us today.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.930
Nicole was a 21-year veteran
at Viacom, earning her way

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.820
to President of
Content Distribution

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.430
and Partner Marketing in 2000.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.650
While there, she
increased revenue 10 times

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.630
to over $2 billion annually,
establishing her division

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.240
as the company's second
largest revenue producer

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.690
and building a portfolio
of over 20 valuable TV

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.460
networks including Nickelodeon,
MTV, Comedy Central, and VH1.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.550
Prior to joining Viacom, Nicole
held various management, sales,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.490
and marketing positions at
Rainbow Media, the Weather

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.310
Channel, Union
Carbide, and Xerox.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.250
In 2007, after
leaving Viacom Nicole

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.180
founded her consulting firm,
Browning Media Consulting,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.110
which includes such clients
as the BBC and Intel.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.060
Following her daughter
Dominique's passing,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.050
Nicole also founded Dominique's
Fund for Suicide Prevention,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.900
a nonprofit in honor of
her late daughter aimed

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.620
at destigmatizing mental
illness and suicide,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.050
and heightening awareness
of the magnitude

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.660
of suicide as a
global health crisis.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.170
Nicole, thank you for joining
us to share your story.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.324
Nicole Browning.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.720
NICOLE BROWNING: That beautiful,
happy-looking young woman

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.300
could have been anyone's friend,
cousin, sister, grandchild,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.610
colleague, roommate.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.380
A laughing, well-loved,
accomplished college student,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.490
she was my daughter, Dominique.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.020
I always have to give
myself a pat when I make it

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.290
through that screen, that
little video presentation

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.480
without bawling my eyes out.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.320
Dominique participated in
much that life offered her.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.960
She had wonderful friends
and adoring family.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.350
She was the kind of
girl that all the girls

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.930
would go to to talk
about their problems

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.380
because she was so
sensitive and empathetic.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.060
She was highly creative.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.400
She wrote moving poetry.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.020
She loved to travel.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.300
She adored her dogs.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.700
And she loved summers
in Rhode Island,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.280
jumping off the bluff at
the beach into the water

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.070
with her cousins
and her siblings.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.140
It was a favorite
pastime of hers actually,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.670
and you know, playing olly olly
oxen free well into the night.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.100
She sang like an angel.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.190
Her voice was
incredible and moving.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.210
And she was in many high school
musicals and college clubs

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.940
and bands and singing groups.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.730
She was a busy, productive,
and highly successful student,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.490
a college sophomore.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.500
But another activity also
consumed my daughter's time,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.040
and that was fighting a
terrible insidious disease,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.140
a potentially fatal
disease, a disease that

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.120
attacked one of her
central organs, her brain.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.730
It wasn't a disease that was
visible to all, or even visible

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.260
at all at times,
nor was it a disease

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.080
whose symptoms were constantly
overwhelming or always present.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.140
Though it was a
disease that was always

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.495
there in the shadow
of her being.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.110
My daughter's disease
was mental illness.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.850
She suffered from an eating
disorder and bipolar disorder.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.640
Her depression
especially was fierce.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.210
11 years ago, at age 19,
Dominique died by suicide.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.610
In the aftermath of
her suicide, I've

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.540
had to come to terms not
only with my profound

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.850
and terrible grief, but also
with all the judgments that

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.540
accompany a death by suicide.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.850
So let's be honest.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.530
Here are the kinds of things
that people think and sometimes

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.980
even say when they
hear about a suicide,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.610
and I'm sure you could
all add to the list.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.204
How could they do
that to their family?

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:51.370
Must have been another one
of those drug and alcohol

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.020
problems.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.000
That kid was crazy anyway.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.730
The whole family's nuts.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.960
There must have been something
wrong with their upbringing.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.670
Where was the family?

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.680
Weren't they paying attention?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.940
How could those parents
let that happen?

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.740
How could she have done that
when there are so many others

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.130
fighting desperately
for their lives?

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.640
Or as in the recent
celebrity suicides,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.690
how could they do that?

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.790
They had everything
going for them--

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:30.530
fame, money, family, like really
anything they ever wanted.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.830
How could they do that
to their children?

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.650
What an incredibly
selfish act, or that's

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.980
such a cowardly way out.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.010
Or, and I've been
told, there isn't much

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.740
that anyone can
do to help someone

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.350
who wants to kill
themselves, which

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.900
is just heartbreaking
resignation

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.080
by those convinced
that suicide is often

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.470
the unavoidable result
of severe depression

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.460
and that there is nothing
that we can do to change this.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.400
Suicide feels to
those left behind

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.340
like some kind of
huge accusation,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.720
an accusation made only worse
by the ignorance surrounding it.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.550
In fact, many people
are so anxious to avoid

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.810
the stigma that surrounds death
by suicide that they will only

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.980
admit that a loved one was
lost in a car accident,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.390
to an accidental overdose, to
heart failure, and so forth.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.490
The humiliation is only
intensified by these kinds

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.440
of things that people say.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.240
Now, imagine you are the
person actually suffering

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.890
with a mental disorder and
are having suicidal feelings.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.780
Imagine the shame and
sense of burden to others.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.020
That is a difficult
thing to overcome.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.370
So difficult, in fact, that it's
often hard for those suffering

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.960
to ask for help.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.270
They live instead in
silent pain and despair.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.650
And in some cases, that can feel
so isolating that the darkness

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:20.560
turns inwards, a darkness
that makes the possibility

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.110
of leading a normal life
seem like an impossibility,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.250
particularly and sadly
acute among our youth

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.910
who have to handle all
of this unnecessary shame

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.170
with far less life
experience, basically

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:43.270
far less time to understand
that what they feel

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.620
doesn't have to always
be that way, that leading

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:54.910
a productive fulfilling life
is, in fact, a real possibility.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.630
We have, as a
society, a real lack

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.520
of awareness and understanding
of mental illness.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.120
Mental illness is a
disease that knows

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.850
no socioeconomic boundaries and
touches the lives of literally

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.260
tens of millions.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.580
This is a disease that
strikes our young as well

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.150
as our adults.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:26.300
This is a disease that can be
so debilitating as to profoundly

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.700
affect productivity.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.360
This is a disease
so misunderstood,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.906
that's often viewed as
something someone can, you know,

00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:39.330
snap out of it.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.620
Self-induced, that
they could snap out

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.520
of it if they had a choice,
if they chose to do that.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.850
Most horrifying is
that this is also

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:56.250
a disease that threatens
lives and claims many.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.310
Yet shockingly, there
is a significant lack

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:05.310
of resources and research on
the potentially fatal outcome

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.070
of mental illness,
which is suicide.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.750
This is a global health
crisis and yet so many

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.600
ignore it as such.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.630
So you have to ask
yourself, well, why is that?

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:23.100
I believe that the prevention
of suicide and all the research

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:27.060
and the work needed is
greatly hindered by the shame

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.970
and fear so many feel about
mental illness and suicide.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.410
Dialogue about this subject
should not be taboo.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.350
A friend of mine shared
a tragically sad story

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.680
about a young 13-year-old
that was starting to behave

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.740
completely out of character.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.480
Her family thought
she was having

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.860
some sort of psychotic break.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.950
And as the child that this
family knew slipped away,

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.150
the doctors finally realized
that she had a rare form

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.170
of spinal meningitis.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.760
Her brain was deeply
affected by the disease.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.940
It was a tragic situation.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.560
Nobody asked how she could
do that to her family.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.370
She wasn't in control.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.560
The victims of mental
illness should no more

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.540
be judged than the victims
of cancer, diabetes,

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.840
or any other life
threatening disease.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.610
Nobody chooses to be stricken
by any of these illnesses,

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.610
and nobody is in
control, and nobody

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.945
blames them or their families.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.660
Nor is one in control
when they kill themselves,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.460
though that's very, very hard
for us to grasp because suicide

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.440
is self-inflicted, and
it seemingly requires

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.020
enormous control
because it's completely

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:11.330
contrary to every human
basic instinct of survival.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.800
But when the brain
is diseased, it often

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.170
lacks the rational filters
that influence choice.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:24.430
It's incomprehensible for those
who have never experienced

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.310
depression or other
mental illness

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:32.800
to fathom that one's brain could
ever misfire to such a point.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.270
When individuals like my
daughter are depressed

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.780
and they make choices
that are self-destructive,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.150
they are evaluating
their options

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:51.860
based on thinking that is
distorted due to the disease.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.740
The pain of depression is
so completely unimaginable

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.140
to those who have
never suffered it

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.950
that it's hard not to think that
one can't pull themselves up

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.580
by their bootstraps
and deal with it,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.870
or simply put a smile on your
face and then you'll be happy,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.590
which I have to
confess is something

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.900
that I might have
said to my daughter

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.710
early on in her illness.

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:26.550
Sadness is not the same
thing as depression,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.180
and understanding is even
more complicated by the fact

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.300
that it's an illness
that doesn't necessarily

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.850
take on physical
visible characteristics.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.350
There is no obvious
broken bone, for example,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.750
or another sign that
someone can point to.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.580
The raw and gnawing pain
that leads one to suicide

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.890
is so alien to most of
our daily experiences.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.040
And throughout the years, I
know you have all probably

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.800
read things and
listened to music

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.270
and seen art by so many of
these creative geniuses.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.490
They tried to attempt--

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.080
you know, they tried to depict
the effects of depression

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.490
in their work.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.450
Artists like Ernest
Hemingway, Virginia Woolf.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.580
This might be really
completely dating me here,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.310
but Edgar Allan Poe.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.990
Actually these were books.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:30.270
Sylvia Plath, Diane Arbus,
Vincent van Gogh, Bach,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:36.150
Schumann, Kurt Cobain, and
recently David Foster Wallace.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.510
The list just goes on and on.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.820
Even the creatives
who personally

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.820
suffered the disease
were unable to provide

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.660
a clear and compelling
description that enabled

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.950
those unscathed by depression
to fully comprehend it,

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.870
though many have tried.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.840
And I'm going to read
you some of the things

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.810
that I thought
were very powerful.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:05.640
Sylvia Plath wrote this five
years prior to her suicide.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.140
Quote, "I have been and
am battling depression.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.890
I am now flooded with
despair, almost hysteria,

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.410
as if I were smothering.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.130
As if a great muscular owl
were sitting on my chest,

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.000
its talons clenching and
constricting my heart."

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.520
Sounds pretty
painful, doesn't it?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.869
Unquote.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.110
Well, unquote before
it sounds painful.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.780
Edgar Allan Poe
wrote this shortly

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.680
after his suicide attempt.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.120
Quote, "I went to bed and wept
through a long, long hideous

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.680
night of despair.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.500
When the day broke, I
arose and endeavored

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.540
to quiet my mind by a rapid
walk in the cold, keen air,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.970
but all would not do.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.390
The demons tormented me still.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:02.460
I cannot live until I subdue
this fearful agitation,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.590
which if continued would either
destroy my life or drive me

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.400
hopelessly mad," unquote.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.970
And for me, nothing
helped me understand

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.170
what my daughter suffered
more than William Styron

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.260
when he wrote his book
"Darkness Visible--

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.770
A Memoir of Madness," and
this was the first book

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.900
that I read about the subject
after my daughter died.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.070
Quote, "For in virtually
any other serious sickness,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.690
a patient who felt
similar devastation would

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.040
be lying flat in bed,
possibly sedated,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.200
and hooked up to tubes and
wires of life support systems.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.610
But at the very least,
in a posture of repose

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.190
and in an isolating setting.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.880
His invalidism
would be necessary,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.300
unquestioned, and
honorably attained.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.220
However, the sufferer of
depression has no such option,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.950
and therefore finds himself
like a walking casualty of war,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:21.950
thrust into the most intolerable
social and family situations.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:27.660
There, he must, despite the
anguish devouring his brain,

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.080
present a face
approximating the one that

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.220
is associated with ordinary
events and companionship.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.200
He must try to utter small talk
and be responsive to questions

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.530
and knowingly nod and frown
and God help him, even smile,"

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.130
unquote.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:53.430
Thank goodness the mental health
profession and our medications

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.770
and all the things that
are available today

00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:03.630
have really come a long way
since these writers wrote.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:08.370
I believe we can all help,
and you are doing quite a bit

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.200
here at Google today by
simply opening yourselves up

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.830
to the conversation and
seeking to understand

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:22.050
something that may be so
completely unfathomable to you.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.680
I believe, as I know
my daughter would have,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.210
that silence only makes
the hopelessness of those

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.770
who suffer that much worse.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:42.840
The CDC found that over half
the people who died in 2016

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.860
had no known mental
health condition.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.860
One can only surmise
that for some

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:55.140
of these people, particularly
those that are successful

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.180
or that meet some objective
criteria of success,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.200
that the stigma surrounding
their feeling of depression

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.370
or isolation are
likely even worse.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:13.620
Depression is a disease
of hopelessness, despair,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.720
and self-loathing.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.170
We live in a culture
where successful people,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.640
like probably every single
one of you in this room today,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.150
and particularly
men can't easily

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.110
talk about their inner turmoil.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.720
And why should they when
they are potentially

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.280
met with judgment?

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.440
Or what do they have
to complain about?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.370
They have it all.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.040
They've achieved success.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.150
And if one has
made it to Google,

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:48.210
for example, where there is
boundless success everywhere,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.560
it might even be harder.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.700
And they've succeeded in
spite of their inner turmoil,

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.440
so like Styron
explained, you continue

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.530
with the many normal
aspects of your life.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.090
You get up.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.710
You go to work.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.240
You go to dinner.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.240
You read bedtime stories
to your children.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.120
You kiss your wife, your spouse.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.300
You grab a beer with
your pals, all the

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.930
while suffering and
battling your demons

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.910
and chiding yourself for not
being able to better resolve

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:33.800
it, amplifying that feeling of
hopelessness and self-loathing.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.400
It becomes a vicious cycle.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.320
Add to that relationship,
legal and financial woes,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.110
physical health
issues, all of which

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.400
can become, according to
the CDC, triggering events,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.360
and then there is a
recipe for more despair.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.840
Ultimately, suicide is
certainly a mental health issue,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.060
but it is also a
community issue.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.030
Certainly many people
with mental health issues

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:10.520
never take their own lives,
and there are countless people

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:16.790
who have managed to survive
unimaginable horrific trauma

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.980
without being suicidal.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.390
And then there are many on
the outside to seem to have it

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.970
all, and yet they're suicidal.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.440
Imagine how shameful that might
feel to that person struggling.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.430
According to many familiar
with the statistics

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.430
surrounding suicide,
the existing data

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.240
may be underrepresenting the
true extent of mental illness

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.690
in the US, but it
also speaks to why

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:51.640
eradicating the stigma around
mental health and suicide

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.140
is so necessary for
suicide prevention.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:02.530
We need, as a community, to help
lift the isolation that further

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.030
intensifies the dysfunctional
thinking of someone considering

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.100
suicide.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.110
Experts agree that teaching
people how to process loss

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.960
and how to cope with
difficult emotions

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.590
is an essential aspect
of suicide prevention,

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.010
so it's fantastic
that Google has

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.930
all of these resources
available to you.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.440
My daughter,
unfortunately, is not alone

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.690
in succumbing to the potent
nature of depression.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:41.550
How many of you here
today have in some way,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.310
indirectly or
directly, been touched

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.180
by suicide in your lives?

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.480
And that's pretty typical.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.401
It's almost consistently 100%.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.720
I mentioned to Dina this
morning that after my daughter's

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.570
funeral, we made a
very specific decision

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.350
to be open about the
nature of her death

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.230
because we thought that
was something that she

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.520
would have really wanted.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.550
And she was very
open in her community

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.400
about her eating disorder,
so we wanted to honor that.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.830
I had no idea until after the
service when people came up

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.390
to me, one young man in
particular, and said,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.100
I have to thank you.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.230
I am so grateful
because 10 years ago,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.730
my brother committed suicide
and nobody in our family

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.130
has been allowed
to talk about it.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.540
And today, you have just
opened the door for me

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.230
to actually process my grief.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.690
And that's when I
realized how so, so

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:58.170
suppressed the conversation
around this topic is.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:02.010
Let me give you some idea of
the dimension of the problem

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:08.410
and the appalling lack of
funding for the prevention

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.710
despite the magnitude
of this issue.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.820
So in 2016, which is the latest
data available, in the US

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.290
alone, the number of
deaths due to breast cancer

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.880
was about 40,000.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.240
AIDS, 7,000.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:38.370
Suicide, 45,000, more than
twice the number of homicides.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.600
I'll say that again.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.060
40,000, breast cancer.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.100
7,000, AIDS.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.860
45,000, suicide.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.670
Add to this that for
every successful suicide,

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.330
there are about 25 attempts.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:03.950
The numbers are staggering and
they have been rising sadly,

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.820
very, very rapidly rising.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.530
The National Institute of
Health spent approximately $700

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.760
million for breast cancer
research and close to $3

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:22.550
billion for HIV/AIDS, and
thank goodness for that.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:28.410
Now contrast that spent for
suicide, a mere $68 million

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.700
despite the fact that there
are more deaths than by breast

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.380
cancer and over six times
the death rate of HIV/AIDS.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.900
And these are only a few
of the many examples.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.030
Today, the number of suicides
among our youth is rising.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:51.460
Our teenagers are especially
prone to impulsive acts.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:57.320
Depression affects one out of
every five college students,

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.060
and that's the arc from
college to careers.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.980
These are alarming
statistics, and like I said,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.400
they're rising.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.670
One night, several of
Dominique's college friends

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.160
did a very brave thing.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.180
They called us.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.640
They were worried.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.900
Dominique had been talking
about ending her life.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.690
They took her
seriously, something

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.630
that often doesn't happen.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:35.270
Good friends never keep
a secret of someone

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.920
talking about suicide,
even if they are asked to.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.640
They don't assume that
things will just work out.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.680
And I later learned
from Dominique

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.740
that she was relieved
and grateful.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.990
When her friends
reached out to her,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:56.490
she felt a wall of
isolation lifted.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.420
They gave her a gift,
and they gave one to us.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.600
We had seven more
months with her.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.420
Never underestimate the power
of simply being there for those

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.990
depressed, and guiding
them to seek help

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.360
or getting it for them.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.470
Be brave, not indifferent.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.030
Care enough to intervene.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.840
And we can all make a difference
by starting the conversation,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:32.330
which you all have,
offering support and lifting

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:37.190
someone's overwhelming
sense of being alone.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:42.600
We can provide community
and a sense of belonging.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.490
Be there for people.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.760
Watch for signs,
signs like someone

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.530
expressing a desire to die or
feeling hopeless with no reason

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.370
to live, talking about
being a burden to others

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.360
or being trapped,
seeing someone's anxiety

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.580
just increase
exponentially, noticing

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:12.010
if someone is sleeping way
too much or way too little,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.800
or if they're
withdrawing from others

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.060
or talking about a
future filled with pain.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.190
Ask someone if you are
worried about if they

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.720
are considering suicide.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.590
If the answer is yes,
be there with them.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.070
Keep them safe and
connect them to support.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.060
But most importantly, follow
up and make sure they get help.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.450
Let them know they're not alone.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:45.240
Suicide is not inevitable for
those feeling suicidal, which

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.270
is evidenced by the
effectiveness of the National

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.780
Suicide Prevention Hotline.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.570
Someone being there
and helping someone

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.640
understand that
they are not alone

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.210
is often enough to save a life.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:04.290
As you can imagine, all
of this is far easier

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.500
to accomplish when there
is an open dialogue

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.490
about mental illness
and depression.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:15.210
Several years ago, I
spoke at the college

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.960
on this subject, actually
my daughter's college.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.570
Some time after,
I received a note

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.360
from a young woman who
had been in the audience.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.540
She wrote that as she sat
and listened to me speak,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.200
much of what I shared about
my daughter's depression

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.510
resonated with her.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:41.940
She realized that she too
was depressed and suicidal.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.000
Just hearing me talk
so openly about it

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.290
was enough to give her the
courage to call her parents

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.080
and tell them how
she was feeling.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.310
They withdrew her from
school, she sought help,

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:01.140
and she told me in this
note that I literally

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:07.120
saved her life, only
from a conversation,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.420
only from letting her know
she wasn't alone, only

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.990
from letting her know
that she could get help,

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.950
it could be different.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.830
I basically thought after
that I could hang up

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.550
because, you know, I
felt so good about having

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.920
that kind of an
impact, particularly

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.060
since I hadn't been successful
in saving my daughter's life.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.330
My daughter tragically
took her life

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.820
while she was hospitalized.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.760
They failed to pay
attention to the things

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.180
that she was saying
about taking her life,

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:48.310
chalking it up to her being
dramatic or attention seeking,

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.990
and even communicated
that to her.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.050
The stigma associated
with her expression

00:32:55.050 --> 00:33:01.200
of suicidal feelings, even among
some in the medical community,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.680
could have only made Dominique
feel even more hopeless

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.020
and shamed.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.710
We will never know what
she was feeling that night.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:18.400
All we know is that later that
night, she abandoned all hope.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.150
But we can't abandon hope.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.720
Remember that most
people who are suicidal

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.430
desperately want to live but
are unable to find another way

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:34.580
to cope with their intense pain.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.800
Intervening saves lives.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:45.580
Suicide is a major global health
crisis, but it is preventable.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.400
That's why I started Dominique's
Fund for Suicide Prevention,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.060
and there are a number
of fabulous organizations

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.250
out there as well.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.650
I believe, and I know
my daughter would have,

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:02.500
that silence around suicide
only worsens the hopelessness

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.330
that many feel.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.570
That's why I must stand
in front of you today

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:15.469
and share what many might
think is a private and personal

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.860
family matter.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.300
Talking about this, again,
should not be taboo.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.830
We are only perpetuating the
misconceptions, the shame,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.699
and the blame when
we remain silent.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.540
Our mission is to change the
public perception of suicide

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.750
by eradicating the
stigma associated

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.900
with it and the
underlying mental illness,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.429
and to empower those who
suffer from suicidal feelings

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:46.449
to seek help.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.190
We are on our journey
towards recovery,

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.810
though none of us who loved my
daughter will ever be the same.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:04.510
Suicide is said to
leave survivors,

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:11.600
the word used to refer to those
of us left in devastated limbo.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.880
Imagine the battle of the
parents, spouses, family

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.920
of suicides, a battle where
there is never an ending, never

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.530
an answer, always and
only terrible questions.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.850
I live with an unending
struggle to understand.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.300
I replay every moment,
every decision,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.750
everything I wish I had seen
with the benefit of hindsight.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.770
That is a lot to survive.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.230
Imagine the shame and loneliness
so many experience when they

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.670
lose loved ones to suicide.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.820
Often, it's too
difficult for people

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.990
to even say to me that
they are sorry for my loss

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.820
when they hear the word suicide.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.860
It's lonely.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.940
Imagine the shame I feel.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.850
All I ever wanted was
to be a good mother.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:19.840
My love, which Dominique knew
and trusted and felt and wanted

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.830
and needed--

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.870
and I know that in my soul--

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.570
was not enough.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.660
That is the worst
thing for a parent,

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.400
to realize that the deepest
love possible cannot save

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.400
a child's life.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.930
I must now survive my battle
with the anguish and horror

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:45.660
of having lost a
child to suicide.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.830
My deepest wish is that
Dominique could be here instead

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:53.280
to call herself a survivor.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.600
I am also possessed by the hope
that others who are suicidal

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.730
can be helped past the shoals
of this devastating disease

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.450
and often very impulsive act.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.830
I have come, though
it's taken me time,

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.270
but I have come to understand
that my daughter committed

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.350
suicide to end her
unbearable pain,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:25.320
not to create pain for
the others she loved.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.830
The day after
Dominique's death, I

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.780
began searching through every
piece of writing, of course,

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.770
trying to find answers,
desperate to know

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.090
what she was thinking.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:39.730
Why?

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:40.230
Why?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.930
Why?

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.040
And I found an essay,
and I'm not exaggerating,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.000
an essay folded into
a tiny square that

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.960
just happened to be
in my bedside table,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.560
and I had never seen it there.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.290
My daughter was a
beautiful writer.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:05.090
I felt like maybe it
was her way of trying

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:09.140
to shed some light
on it and give me

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.330
some kind of understanding.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.920
It was a piece entitled
quote, "Dedicated to Those Who

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.980
Suffer in Silence," unquote.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.010
It was mysterious as
to why it was there.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.080
I don't know if she
actually wrote it

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.380
or if she copied it
from somewhere, though I

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.940
think it sounds like her voice.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:40.670
But in any event, I know
it resonated with her.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.370
I'd like to share a
part of it with you.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.850
Quote, "It's not that
you don't want to live.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.740
You'd love to be happy.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.230
You'd kill to be
alive essentially.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.720
It's not the dying
that's appealing.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.270
I mean, you don't
really want to do it,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.860
but you feel like you have to.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.490
It's a matter-- well, a
matter of survival really,

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.610
which sounds like one
hell of an oxymoron I

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.590
guess to people who don't know.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:19.100
See, all life really is is
pain every single damn day,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.350
and it's not pain
you can look at.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.530
If I break my leg and
it hurts, I can scream

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.660
and I can point
at my twisted leg,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.780
and maybe a femur or
a tibia is poking out

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.660
to help emphasize my point.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:38.750
But when your soul, your inner
being, your mind is hurt,

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:44.190
you can't scream
and point," unquote.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.110
And then she continued.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.720
"People say to look
towards the future.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.430
It will be a better tomorrow.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.440
What they don't
realize is that you

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.720
have looked towards
the future, and it

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.510
looks like absolute
and total agony,

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.650
which just makes you want to
steer clear of the next week.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.560
People say it's selfish and
a cowardly and easy way out.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.520
Sorry, but there is
no ease involved.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.320
You don't want to die.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.760
You want to be rid of
searing hot constant pain.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.670
Nothing that you
can do to your body

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.944
will come close to the torture
that you live with every day."

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.680
I'm honored actually
to be here today.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.960
You're working in a company
that has profoundly changed

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.440
all of our lives,
largely because this

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.850
is a culture that believes
that change is possible.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.790
Otherwise, you
wouldn't even exist.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.270
And Google is now a verb,
so you've definitely

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.950
changed things.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.620
Eradicating the
stigma and helping

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.490
others out of isolated
pain is something each

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:04.650
and every one of us
can impact and change.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.640
I think about the early
days not so long ago

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.530
of mental health treatment
when those with mental illness

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:18.840
were often restrained with
iron chains and shackles

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.960
around their wrists and ankles.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.740
Today, the invisible
shackles binding

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.650
those with mental
illness are the cruelty

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:33.210
of misunderstanding, stigma,
and discrimination, which

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:38.370
our silence and passivity
only perpetuates.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:41.490
We have made enormous
progress in fighting

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:49.060
this disease, but not enough to
even remotely claim a victory.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.540
I hope that you will join
me and embrace our mission

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.560
and get involved.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.250
I hope you pass on our
message and that you

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.550
find the courage to
talk openly about

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.930
mental illness and suicide like
I have done with all of you

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:10.870
today, so that it stands among
the other causes commanding

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.650
our attention and resources.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.440
We have bracelets here
for men and women.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.080
It's our dream that
we see this bracelet

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.390
on as many wrists as the
yellow and pink cancer rubber

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:30.940
bracelets so that this too is
understood as a disease that

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.230
needs our attention.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:38.080
We want to tell the world
to pay attention to suicide.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.840
We want these bracelets to honor
those who have died by suicide

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.080
and to remember them, and to
symbolize our hope and our work

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.750
to help prevent
further suicides.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.530
We want to eradicate
the stigma and make

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.440
it OK to tackle
suicide like we've

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:05.780
tackled cancer, heart disease,
HIV/AIDS just to name a few.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.020
The bracelet looks like this.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:12.530
It's similar to the silver one
that Dominique loved to wear.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:18.100
It's etched with a French braid,
a braid with four strands.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.250
Dominique loved her
French grandmother

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.220
and loved the French language.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:29.365
She often asked me to weave her
long hair into a French braid,

00:43:29.365 --> 00:43:31.390
and her little
sister reminded me

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:35.260
that she could French braid
her own hair in as much time

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.422
as it took many of us to
put our hair in a ponytail.

00:43:38.422 --> 00:43:39.880
So I guess that's
the kind of thing

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.796
that, if you're a little
sister, you're really

00:43:41.796 --> 00:43:44.290
looking up to the big one for.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:51.110
But I can still feel my
hands on Dominique's head

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.280
where they were from
the moment she was born,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:01.760
cradling that teeny miraculous
new life, washing her hair,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.020
combing it, braiding it,
and as she got older,

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.740
stroking it, wanting
to comfort her

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.736
with all the love
of a mother's touch.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.940
I can't help but think that
the four strands representing

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.880
the four of us in her
immediate family, my husband

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.180
Steve and her twin siblings
[? Elody ?] and Hunter,

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.230
left behind to survive
this terrible loss.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.740
Dominique once had a
very bright future.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.820
She loved and she
knew she was loved.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.960
She had hope for
all she could be.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.450
All of that is gone.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.100
I keep a lock of her hair
just as I keep in my heart

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.630
the memory of her smile which
I shared with you this morning.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.290
Most of all, the
braid is a symbol

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.830
of the way in which
we need to entwine

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:06.800
our hearts, our efforts, our
learning, and our promise,

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.930
our help, and compassion
for those who need us,

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.408
for those who suffer in silence.

00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:16.890
Thank you.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:20.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:26.596
Any questions?

00:45:26.596 --> 00:45:27.138
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:27.138 --> 00:45:27.971
NICOLE BROWNING: Hi.

00:45:27.971 --> 00:45:30.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for coming today.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.850
NICOLE BROWNING: Thank
you for being here.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.140
AUDIENCE: My question is
related to death by suicide,

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.240
but also just
grieving in general.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.710
What are some
things that you wish

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.780
people had done to
better support you

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.850
or that they did do
that was really well,

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.910
that you could sort of educate
us as potential supporters?

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.980
NICOLE BROWNING: What
a great question.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:53.010
Well, first of all,
just understand

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:56.400
that it helps to give everyone
the benefit of good intention.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.330
People want to support
people who have had loss.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:04.560
They don't always know the right
thing to say, but they want to.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:10.780
So you know, if you approach
it from that point of view.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.620
So I think one of
the things that

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:19.050
has been a problem for me is
that even in my own family, not

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.470
my immediate family but
in my extended family,

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.000
they don't talk about
my daughter very much

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.150
and that really bothers me.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.430
The first time I heard my
father-- bless his heart,

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.100
he's 94 now and
completely with it--

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.960
talk about how
many grandchildren

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.590
he had to somebody after
my daughter's death,

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:41.280
he had reduced the number
by one, and that killed me.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.800
And you know, I
went to my father

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:49.080
and I told him how I felt
and he never did that again.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.510
But I think the way
that you can be there

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:55.050
for people is not shy away.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.520
I mean, honestly, I cannot
tell you how many people--

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.450
I was working at the
time and I got back

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.120
into the media
business, and people

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:08.880
who I hadn't seen since my
loss could not even say I'm

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.590
so sorry, because they
just couldn't say it,

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:19.380
because the idea of raising
suicide, thinking that it would

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.640
make me feel badly
even though, of course,

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.950
you already feel badly
so it doesn't matter.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.950
So I think just
being open and direct

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.600
and asking people
what you can do.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.680
How can I help you?

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:40.440
What can I do to help you
navigate your journey of grief?

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.800
And I don't believe personally
in the whole stages of grief.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.560
I think everybody
does it differently

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.670
and everybody has
their own experience.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.990
But I think it's important
to just be there,

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:59.190
to reach out, to check
in, and to share memories

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.410
of the person that's lost.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:09.120
Because as someone who loves
someone who died by suicide,

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.060
you want their life
to be remembered.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:16.990
You want to feel that
she had, in this case,

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:20.730
a big impact on people, even
if it was only 19 years.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.820
And many of her college
roommates and her high school

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.990
friends, I'm still in touch
with and they share stories

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.140
about Dom and things I
haven't necessarily heard,

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.870
and it makes me really happy.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.130
And I think the other thing
that is really important--

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:40.870
and someone did
this for me, just

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.310
to share a little bit of how
I navigated through this.

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.030
You know, of course
it goes in waves,

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:50.880
and there are moments,
holidays and other things

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.570
where you really feel their
absence even more acutely.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:49:00.660
But I had a friend come
over and bring watercolors.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.750
And Sandy's heard this story.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.100
Peter, I don't know if you have.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:08.140
But I'm like, I just
lost my daughter.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.220
I'm not going to do any water--
like I don't paint, nothing.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.520
And she said no,
just play with it.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.550
And for that one moment, where
I wet water and put some paint

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.760
down, I was taken away.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.620
And I realized then that
painting could be a good thing,

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.450
because part of the
grieving journey--

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.420
and this is also something I
think you can help people when

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.680
they're ready--

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.730
is to provide life
experiences and distraction

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:40.590
and you know, not
keep them sort of

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.130
out of living because you think
they may or may not be ready.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.840
But you know, these
are all great ways too

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.520
of coping with loss and
any other tough thing.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.180
So I've been painting a lot,
and in that moment when I'm

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.280
painting, I feel taken away.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.010
And I have to say, there
have been at least two times

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.350
where I can honestly
tell you that I

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:07.320
think she moved my paintbrush.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.430
So it's been an
interesting journey,

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.310
and I think that's
a great question

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.880
because people need
support and they need

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.323
to be able to talk about it.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.030
Any other questions?

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.570
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.430
Thank you so much.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:29.820
You mentioned how to
show concern for somebody

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.210
that you're worried about and
the impact of just asking them

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:35.820
very specifically
if they're thinking

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.980
about hurting themselves.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.880
During your grieving process and
your research on this subject,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.210
have you learned
any tips that you

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:47.370
could share with
the room about ways

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:51.900
to potentially approach someone
or, you know, certain verbiage

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.067
even that might be helpful if
they're worried about somebody?

00:50:55.067 --> 00:50:56.400
NICOLE BROWNING: I'll give you--

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.280
I want to just say I'm
not an expert on this.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.670
There are fabulous
resources available,

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.440
even one of your counselors.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.910
But what I do know is that
it is important to ask

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.510
if you have a question.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.650
I don't know if there is
a special way to do that,

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.170
but I think one of
the most simple ways

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:23.010
is, I know you're
feeling really blue.

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.080
Are you thinking about
killing yourself?

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.190
Have you ever
thought about that?

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.770
And if the answer
is yes, you have

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:34.650
to pay attention because
it's not something

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.920
that people easily express.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.300
And there is research, and maybe
you can speak to this more,

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.460
but there is research
that indicates that asking

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.370
the question is very important.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.130
If they know, if
they actually have

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.460
an idea of how
they want to do it,

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.320
that's really a very big
signal that the severity

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.910
of the suicidality
is pretty significant

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:04.560
and needs to be addressed.

00:52:08.488 --> 00:52:09.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:10.446
My name is Dr.
[? Angela Young. ?]

00:52:10.446 --> 00:52:12.160
I'm one of the AP
counselors on site.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.990
So I just wanted to
add to that, Yes, it's

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:17.980
true that you do want to bring
the word suicide to the picture

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.720
because it's not something
that people often talk about.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.450
So as soon as you
mention that, you also

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:25.719
give room for the
individual to share more.

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:27.760
But obviously, like you
know, if you are not sure

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.457
how to ask those questions,
it's always OK to say hey,

00:52:30.457 --> 00:52:32.290
like you know, maybe
we can find a counselor

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:33.790
and we can talk
about this together.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.010
There's a lot of resources
online where you can hook

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.650
someone up with therapists.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.070
Like Psychology Today would
be a good place to start,

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.970
or if you know a
colleague, then [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.169
AP would be a great option.

00:52:48.169 --> 00:52:50.710
But yeah, like you want to know
if they have thought about it

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.834
and if they had-- like you
know, if there's intent,

00:52:52.834 --> 00:52:56.340
like how to do about it
or when is the last time?

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.820
And I would say for
a lay person who

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.760
is not in the field,
you can always ask,

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.051
what are some of the things
that are keeping you alive?

00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.950
Like so that you know
if there is hope,

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.450
because a lot of times, they
might not be thinking about it.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.580
Or they would be talking
about maybe family,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.769
so then you know that they
are thinking about something

00:53:12.769 --> 00:53:14.060
that is positive in their life.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.476
But if they don't, if they
couldn't come up with a reason,

00:53:16.476 --> 00:53:17.440
that's very alarming.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.630
You want to bring them to
help as soon as possible.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.060
NICOLE BROWNING: And the
National Suicide Prevention

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.440
Hotline site has many links
to, I believe it's called

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.560
#BeThe1To, that addresses
that very specifically,

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.410
what are the kinds of
things you can ask.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.040
And it's a great resource.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:36.850
Thank you.

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:40.200
[APPLAUSE]
