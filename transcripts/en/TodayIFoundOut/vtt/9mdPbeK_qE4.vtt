00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:15.410
You’ll often hear it claimed that lobsters
are biologically immortal.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.170
So is it true?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.610
Not really, though this is partially an argument
in semantics as you’ll soon see.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.510
(And while we’re on the topic of lobster
myths, no: Lobsters do not mate for life.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.280
In fact, the male lobster pretty much gets
it on with every female lobster that comes

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.280
a knockin’.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.510
And they do almost literally line up and knock
on the male’s door.)

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.340
So what’s the source of the staple of social
media timelines that lobsters can’t die

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.790
of old age?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.630
Cells make up all living creatures on Earth,
from humans to lobsters.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.940
(Shocker, I know.)

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.630
However, cell replication is limited based
upon nucleotide sequences called telomeres

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.380
which are found on the ends of chromosomes.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.170
In a nutshell, telomeres prevent the strands
of DNA from coming undone and also prevent

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.009
them from accidentally fusing with neighboring
chromosomes.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.219
The issue is that these end caps get shorter
each time the cell divides owing to the fact

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.939
that the enzymes that duplicate the DNA, with
a little help from short pieces of RNA, cannot

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.450
do so all the way to the end of a chromosome.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.659
So something gets cut off every time a replication
occurs.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.469
Telomeres ensures that what is cutoff isn’t
critical information.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.579
But the result of this shortening each time
is that telomeres eventually become too short

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.310
to provide an adequate buffer.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.310
For reference, human cells can only be replicated
around forty to seventy times before the telomeres

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.920
become too short.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.200
This leads to the cell no longer being able
to correctly replicate and to cell death.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.759
Lobster cells work a little differently.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.609
A lobster’s body produces quantities of
the enzyme telomerase even into adulthood.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.209
While humans and other vertebrates also produce
telomerase, our bodies only (usually) produce

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.279
it while in embryonic form.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:03.979
What does telomerase do?

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.979
It continuously repairs the cells’ telomeres,
keeping it from becoming too short.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.060
The result is that the DNA in the cells can
continue to replicate indefinitely- hence

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.890
why it is often claimed that lobsters are
technically “immortal.”

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.860
While partially an argument in semantics,
the problem here is that when most hear “biologically

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.329
immortal,” they think it means that if a
lobster isn’t killed by some predator or

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.890
the like, lives in a suitable environment,
and has an adequate supply of nutrients to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.069
supply their biological needs, the lobster
never gets old and can live forever.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.930
But the truth is that there are many factors
that go into aging (a number of which aren’t

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.880
well understood), not just a cell’s ability
to replicate itself.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.860
DNA damage happens over time regardless of
telomere length.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.829
While much of this gets automatically repaired
via various mechanisms, genetic mutations

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.189
do occasionally occur from things such as
oxidative stress, potentially resulting in

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.940
cellular deterioration and malfunction.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.459
With regards to the lobster, evidence at hand
appears to indicate they do, in fact, die

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.599
of what we’d colloquially call “old age”
eventually.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.599
How?

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.459
Lots of ways, similar to humans.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.400
For example, beyond potential environmental
damage to their cells causing issues, we know

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.829
definitively that how the lobster grows and
the metabolic energy required to do it greatly

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.819
affects their lifespan.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.569
Humans grow through childhood and adolescence
until they reach a certain size after which

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.109
they usually do not grow any bigger (at least
not vertically…)

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.870
A lobster’s body, however, never stops growing.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.780
Lobsters grow in size during a process called
molting, in which they shed their hard exoskeleton,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.930
from claws to tail, before growing a new one
around a bigger body.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.999
A young lobster may molt several dozen times
before its first birthday as it rapidly grows.

00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:01.340
The process slows to about once a year by
around age seven and then once every two or

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.799
three years after that.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.420
The largest lobster ever caught weighed in
at a whopping forty-four pounds.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.510
For reference, a typical lobster you’ll
find in the store or restaurant usually rings

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.910
in at about 1-2 pounds and is around 5-10
years old.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.360
The bigger a lobster, (usually) the greater
its age.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.250
However, molting takes more and more energy
as a lobster increases in size and the amount

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.390
of effort it takes for even a 30-50 year old
lobster to molt kills between 10% and 15%

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.110
of the lobsters every year.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.880
But just because lobsters can potentially
continue to grow and molt up until their death,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.970
that does not mean they always do so, even
if they have sufficient food available and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.570
ideal environmental conditions.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.070
Elderly lobsters have been observed to stop
molting altogether, with the theory being

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.411
that their bodies simply no longer have the
capacity to do so, likely via a lack of the

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.290
needed metabolic energy.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.940
Much like an elderly human is often more susceptible
to things like pneumonia for various age related

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.450
reasons, this is a major problem for the lobsters
as it often leads to shell disease, a bacterial

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.320
infection in the shell that can form scar
tissue between the lobster and the shell.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.860
If they are able to molt again later, they
potentially have the problem of scar tissue

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.120
binding the inner body and the shell which
can cause the lobster to become stuck and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120
die.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.570
Shell disease can also lead to other problems
such as shell rotting, with the net effect

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.280
being the same- the lobster that no longer
molts dies.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.680
So how long do lobsters actually live before
dying of these types of so-called natural

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.920
causes?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.660
This isn’t clear at all.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.460
Estimating how old the largest lobsters ever
found are comes with a huge margin of error.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.370
As Biologist Carl Wilson of the Maine Department
of Marine Resources explains, “The problem

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.370
with lobsters is when they molt, they molt
their entire exoskeleton, including their

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.160
digestive tract and gastric mill and the like,
so there are no hard parts that are left,”

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.350
leaving little in the way of accurately measurable
physical markers.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.690
Even judging by size isn’t fool proof owing
to a variety of environmental factors greatly

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.720
influencing their rate of growth.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.450
But for reference, using several different
means of trying to judge the age of lobsters,

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.560
the overarching average lifespan in the wild
of the various types of lobsters out there

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.300
is thought to be about thirty years for males
and around fifty or sixty years for females.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.220
So if you want to use as the definition of
“biologically immortal”- “no known point

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.330
in which cells will stop replicating barring
outside influence,” then lobster are possibly

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.190
biologically immortal.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.530
But even then, it should be noted that there
has never been a definitive study (to date)

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.510
demonstrating that lobsters producing telomerase
throughout their adulthood actually increases

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.370
their natural lifespan.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.630
There is so much more that goes into real-life
biological immortality than just if the cells

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.510
have a point in which they will definitely
stop being able to replicate, and we humans

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.500
(unfortunately for all of us alive today)
don’t yet fully understand all the factors

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.570
at play nor exactly how much telomeres really
plays a causative role in aging.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.110
If body and cellular aging only had to do
with telomeres, few humans would be colloquially

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.330
labeled to die of “old age” before around
the age of 120.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.550
In the end, even with ample resources and
in an optimal environment, most lobsters’

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.580
bodies seem to cease to be able to sustain
themselves at around 1/3 to 2/3 the age an

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.490
average human lives before we succumb to our
own set of complications due to age related

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.610
factors.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.550
So while it is a semantic argument, it seems
a bit of a stretch to call lobsters biologically

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.520
immortal just because their cells don’t
see telomeres shortening like many other animals.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.810
Humans have shorter telomeres than mice, but
mice die of “old age” after only a few

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.810
years.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.680
There is even a species of bird (Oceanodroma
leucorhoa) that actually has its telomeres

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.920
increase in length as they age, but they,
too, are not immortal.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Why and how animals age, it turns out, just
like most things in life, resists such simplistic

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:29.580
explanations.
