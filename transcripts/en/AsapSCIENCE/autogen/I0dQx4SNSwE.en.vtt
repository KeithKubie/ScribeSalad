00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.210
 * Yawning * Almost all vertebrates are metabolized. Penguins do it as a mating ritual, snakes 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.760
 Do this to reset the jaw after a meal, and guinea pigs do so to show anger. so why 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.410
 Exactly human beings are mocking? Is yawning really contagious? 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.030
 If you have not already seen a video yawning-O-METER, click here, or use the link at 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.980
 Description, to see how long it will hold before yawning. If you like us, 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.550
 You may even have just read the title of this video. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.650
 The truth is, the first time you've ever been proven likely when you're an embryo. Children start yawning through 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.449
 Chapter II of pregnancy, although the cause is still unknown, it may be due 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.460
 For healthy brain growth. In adults, yawning was thought to normally attract more oxygen 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 To the lungs and makes you feel less tired, but new research has shown that it may not be 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.190
 As well. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.649
 Scientists now believe that yawning has been developed as a functional means of cooling the brain. 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.260
 Like a computer, your mind works better at a certain temperature and tries to avoid 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 "High temperature". It became clear that yawning increases heart rate and blood flow and use 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.579
 Your facial muscles are all necessary to cool the brain. Moreover, that 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.149
 Deeply inhaled cold air changes the blood temperature in our heads. 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.110
 But why does your mind heat up in the first place? Well, both fatigue and sleep deprivation 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.859
 Are known as reasons for increasing brain temperature in general, which explains why yawning occurs more in 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.999
 These cases. Research has found even participants who put hot packs on their head increases yawning 41% 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.709
 While watching the others mumble, versus 9% with a cool pack on their heads. 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.450
 If your head is already cold, you will be less depressed. But what about mass infections 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.909
 To yawn? 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.029
 Humans, monkeys and dogs even find yawning contagious, and are most likely skillfully linked 

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.740
 Sympathy. Vaginal yawning begins in children aged 4-5, and this behavior 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 Of empathy develops, along with the ability to identify emotions. In fact, children 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 People with disorders related to empathy, such as autism, wander less when watching videos for people 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.329
 Compared with other children. Research also suggests that you are more likely to copy 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.590
 Yawn from someone close to you socially or genetically. Likely to even dogs 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.840
 She yawns from her husband in exchange for the yawn of a stranger. 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.959
 Finally, symmetric neurons play a role in it. In the brain, symmetric neurons are released when 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.130
 We begin to implement specific actions, we see someone else actually doing or even just hearing someone 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.520
 Talking about the verb. They are important brain cells and are used for learning, self-awareness 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.080
 And communicate with others. When we see someone yawning, symmetric neurons in our brain 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
 Become active in a similar way, and as a result we reproduce yawning. 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 Although yawning may occur in people who literally have "hot heads", yawning infection 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.430
 Allow us to be cool with the people around us.
