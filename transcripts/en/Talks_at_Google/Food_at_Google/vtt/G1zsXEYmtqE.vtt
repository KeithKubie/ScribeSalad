00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Chef
Hugh is a father.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.280
He's a chef.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.290
He's an educating advocate.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.140
He is the owner of two amazing
restaurants in the South,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.630
in Atlanta-- the 5 &amp;
10 and the National.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.650
What was most striking
about, chef, your bio,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.580
you're self-trained--
no culinary school.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.540
So you can be this, too,
and get on "Top Chef."

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.980
What is so interesting and
wonderful about Chef Hugh

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.350
and why we wanted to work
with him is just this passion

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.060
you have about
teaching life skills

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.230
to all people and communities.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.170
So without more, I just
want to introduce Chef Hugh.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.730
Welcome.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.350
HUGH ACHESON: Well, thank you.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.266
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we're
excited to have you.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.700
And welcome to all the Googlers.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.970
HUGH ACHESON: So
I'm Hugh Acheson.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.334
I'm 522 months old.

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.160
And I have two kids.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.830
And a lot of what we're
going to talk about

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.100
is a direct reaction to what
I see my kids going through

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.650
and what I want them
to attain in the world.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.040
So, yeah, the story with
Beatrice is Beatrice was 11

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.780
and came home from school.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.020
And let me first say this.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.710
Our school district is great.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.210
A lot of school
districts are great.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.110
They're trying really hard.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.510
But sometimes we need to
inject newness into curriculums

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.070
to make them that much better.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.080
So she came home from her first
day of family and consumer

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.455
sciences, which is the
gender nonspecific term

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:39.080
for home economics because home
economics became something that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.330
was teaching very much like
"how to raise your baby" type

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.616
of skills, which we'll all learn
on our own someday in life.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:49.240
And maybe we need a
little bit of that,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
but what I wanted it to
teach was life skills.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.890
Yet it taught Beatrice how
to make red velvet cupcakes

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.060
from a box and how to pull
croissants out of a Pillsbury

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.090
tube and wrap them
in cheap bacon

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.990
and bake them in the oven--
and to take prenatal vitamins

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.640
at 11, which I don't really
ethically-- ethically I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.625
don't care about.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.500
Usually the vitamins
are like named something

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.100
like One-A-Day, which implies
the direction in the title.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.440
So I didn't think that
was really necessary.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.630
And I started to think
about life skills.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.900
So I went to the school
superintendent for our region

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.160
and started talking to him.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.710
And he said, yeah, I was about
to cancel that whole class

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.460
because it sucks.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.640
And it got me thinking,
well, if it sucks

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.710
and we yank it
out of the system,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.440
then we're still raising the
status quo, which is kids

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.080
who have no idea how to cook.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.070
So I developed a curriculum.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.440
And I went to him and said,
I think we can do this.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.110
And he said, well,
why don't you do it?

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.890
And I said because
I have five jobs.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.880
And I work 90 hours
a week already,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.990
and I try and raise my family.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.320
And so then I said,
OK, I'll do it.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.480
So we're going live in four
middle schools in grade six

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.210
next year.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.834
Following year, we'll
have grade seven.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:02.620
Following year, we'll
have grade eight.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.420
The core curriculum
is nine things.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.510
It is a look at cooking overall,
which is really about five

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.620
or six of the things.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.120
But it's life skills.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.947
It's retainable things.

00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:16.030
It's how to poach an egg,
which we're about to do.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.363
It's how to make a vinaigrette,
which we're about to do.

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.170
It's how to build a
dinner effectively

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.090
for like $8 for four people.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.240
It's things that hopefully
stick with people by the time

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.496
they get to 18, 19, 20-- the
hardest time in your life

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:30.870
when you have no money and
you're trying to figure things

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.420
out and it's just
hard to figure out

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.836
how to put dinner on the table.

00:03:36.836 --> 00:03:39.210
This is things you can hearken
back to and say at least I

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.394
know how to poach an egg.

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:41.810
Well, right now
we just don't have

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.290
that sort of life skills
being obtained by children.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.804
So this is that
way of doing that.

00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:48.470
But it's also got a
lot of home finance.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.770
It's got a lot of life hacks.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.160
It's got a lot of DIY.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.660
It's got a lot of basic
sewing because I was cool when

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.550
I was 12 because I could sew.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.380
And I was a dude.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.510
It was weird, but it
was really helpful.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.750
And I still hem my own
pants-- not this pair.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.140
So these are all life skills.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.490
And I'll go over them
specifically in a little bit.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.720
But what I think the most
telling thing about when

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.600
I explain this to people--
to doctors and lawyers

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.040
and hedge fund managers in New
York and coders and people who

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.240
work at big companies like you
all do-- is that they all say,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.500
do you have a program
that I could take?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.390
Because I'm not in
grade 6, because I need

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.220
to learn all that stuff, too.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.290
Because you guys are super
smart, amazing, amazingly

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.340
productive people,
but a lot of you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.270
have no idea how
to effectively put

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.640
dinner on the table that's
from scratch for your kids

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.930
or even just for yourself.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.410
So these are life skills.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.880
And I think that we
raise a better tomorrow

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.930
when we get all kids
knowing these basic things.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.890
So if we have every kid knowing
how to poach an egg in America,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:55.790
this is great.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.960
So that's the end
result of this,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.640
is hopefully that type of thing.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.350
What we're trying to do in
building the curriculum is

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.510
we're having a big
charrette next month

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.300
with a lot of food policy people
and lawyers and architects

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.840
and designers and painters
and artists and coders

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.090
and all these different
people coming together saying,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.110
what do we all need to learn?

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.170
What, as citizens,
do we all need

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.400
to know universally
when it applies to food,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.370
and reading a lease, and
opening up your first bank

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.900
account, and all these
things that would contribute

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.620
to our wherewithal as humans.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.746
What are those things?

00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:30.370
So that's what we're
whittling down to.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.500
And that comes in a month.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.050
But we've already
got the basic idea.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.930
So what I want to
do here is really

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.610
to hearken back to
this idea of food.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.070
Now what happened with
food in the last 50 years

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.310
is that we all fell hook,
line, and sinker for fast food,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.180
frozen food, prepackaged food.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.890
Everything became so easy.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.020
But as we stripped
away our skill sets,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.490
and as we forgot how to
cook, and we say things like,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.170
I used to make jam
with my grandmother,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.420
we don't say things like I
used to make jam with my mother

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.080
because mom fed us Smucker's.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.550
And we lost a skill
set when she did that.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.280
And we didn't pass along from
generation to generation core

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.380
ideas of what we value
and what we believe in.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.440
So this is trying
to get back to that

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.240
and trying to get to
that basic necessity.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.320
It's kind of homesteading skills
for the urban environment.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.870
So let's go over
what we're going

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.780
to cook today because it's
very, very beautifully basic.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.510
When we talk about whole food
and the ease of whole food

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.090
and defeating this
era of convenience,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.780
if this is inconvenient,
I don't know what's

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.470
really inconvenient about it.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.250
Because this, we're
going to make a salad.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.230
So first we're going
to cook some farro.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.750
Cooked farro looks like this.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.110
Farro's a whole grain.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.760
It's an emmer wheat.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.160
And it is an integral grain.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.920
Sometimes it's washed and
stripped of the outer coating.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.640
You want to find stuff that's
complete and still whole.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.710
So that's going to go
into this pot over here.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.150
And again, we're
going to show you

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.220
how to cook grains, which is not
rocket science because that's

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.880
two cups of water.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.970
And that's a cup of farro.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.470
And we're going to
put that in there

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.830
and season with a little salt.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.415
What's salt?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.564
Salt is a seasoning.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:12.980
It brings out
flavor in our palate

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.332
and brings out flavor in food.

00:07:14.332 --> 00:07:15.790
So we're going to
add that to that.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.210
And we're going to
bring it to a boil.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.250
And then we're
going to simmer it.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.310
And it's going to be done.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.893
So you can just look
away from things.

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:22.440
That's really easy.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.180
Believe in leftovers.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.910
If you're cooking for a family,
and you make roasted chicken

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.450
the night before with
farro, make extra farro

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.200
because the next day
you can take a salad,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.720
and pack a salad
for the kids that's

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.010
pretty much this with
salad dressing on the side.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.050
It makes things easier.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.330
So if you work 13 hours
a day, which you all do,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.970
I want to make sure that you
understand that the time it

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.660
takes to make a meal like
this is equivalent to going

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.000
to a Chick-fil-A drive-through.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.430
It's a confused
chicken sandwich.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.610
I admit it's good.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.010
But it's politically--
it's a little shaky.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.730
But what I want to do is
that 15 minutes that you

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.670
spend in line waiting
there, you can cook dinner

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.650
around your family
as they do homework

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.090
or as they sit and play.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.010
And you would be amazed
at how kids learn.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.480
I think we all have this
idea and inclination

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.700
that we know how kids learn.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.030
Kids learn by experience,
by watching you,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.990
by watching you be comfortable
in your environment

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.680
of a kitchen.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.930
Your kitchen is the most
important room in your house.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.810
Use it.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.330
Don't be like a New Yorker and
store clothes in your oven.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.950
That's weird.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.240
So we're going to do that.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.740
As the farro is cooking--
it's come to a boil.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.950
I'm going to reduce
that down to a simmer.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.400
So that's going to
be at around three.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.850
This thing goes to 10.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.580
It may be the spinal tap
version that goes to 11,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.768
but I don't think so.

00:08:39.768 --> 00:08:41.059
So I'm just going to stir that.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.159
And we're going to
cap it and let it sit.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.270
And that's going to take
about 20 minutes to cook.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.070
So we're going to
make a vinaigrette.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.920
It's funny the whole
aisle in the supermarket

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.920
is devoted to dressings
and salad dressings

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.660
when things like mayonnaise
and salad dressings

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.960
are really easy to effectively
make at home from scratch.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.010
They're oftentimes totally
preservative-free when

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.230
we make them that way, too,
and much healthier for you.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.380
The way I think I want
to eat in this world

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.840
is knowing what I'm
putting into my body

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.950
and training myself
to understand

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.540
that if something's
pre-prepared,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.390
I don't know exactly
what's going into it.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.900
And a lot of times, it's
packed with sugars and things

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.430
like that that we
don't necessarily need.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.770
There's a lot of food out
there that we are really

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.590
led to believe is good
for us, and it's not.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.390
This is one fascinating thing.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.780
Frosted Flakes and Raisin
Bran, which has more sugar?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.070
Raisin Bran.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.780
Isn't that insane?

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.540
I feel like we've been lied to.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.010
But OK, that's fine.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.070
We're moving on.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.090
So what's a vinaigrette?

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.860
Vinaigrette's a ratio.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.990
A lot of you do crazy math
or accounting or coding.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.009
You want to attribute
things to numbers.

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:54.800
Well, it's a ratio.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.350
It's three to one richness
in oil and one as in acids.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.280
I want to make this a
little more bracingly acidic

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.310
because in the end, it's going
to be a salad with vegetables

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.800
and lettuce and farro, but also
this puppy, which is an egg.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.340
And an egg on your palate
is much like eating fat.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.480
So I want to balance with
hyper-acidic vinaigrette

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.460
to balance the fact that this
is more oil essentially going

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.430
into my ratio of a vinaigrette.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.317
Makes sense?

00:10:25.317 --> 00:10:27.150
So I'm going to amp it
up just a little bit.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.330
So this is extra
virgin olive oil.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.940
You don't have to buy the
most expensive olive oil,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.681
but I don't think
at the pearly gates

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.180
or wherever you're
going after this,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.471
you're going to feel that
bad about buying better olive

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:38.660
oil in this world.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.230
So treat yourself.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.050
So this is going to be
about three tablespoons.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.509
And then we're going to put
a whole clove of garlic in.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:48.300
And that's just going
to flavor it through.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.610
But I'm going to cut in half
just to expose the flavor.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.600
If you buy pre-minced
garlic, you've lost in life.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.200
So you just need to learn
how to mince garlic.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.500
It's not a big deal.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.230
Do you know how
to juice a lemon?

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.752
Don't buy the plastic one.

00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:05.960
I don't know what's in there.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.790
But it's not cool.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.050
Then we're going to put a
little bit of mustard in here.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.430
Now these are all-- I'm
a big believer in food

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.110
should not be precious.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.640
These are all
things you probably

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.090
have around the house anyhow.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.910
So this is not confusing.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.390
A little bit of salt.
A little bit of pepper.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.260
And then some vinegar.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.480
Now you could use any type
of vinegar that you want.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.719
I'm using a cider
vinegar in this case.

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:34.260
But you could use
a red wine vinegar.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.370
You can make your own vinegar
really easily as well.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.250
And then this goes in.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.550
And I'll tell you a little
Beatrice story in a second

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.530
as I do this.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.450
Now this is that.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.650
We're going to make an
emulsification by this.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.950
So it's a workout as well.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.300
This is not confusing.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.869
This is food.

00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:51.160
I'm trying to make sure you're
stripping away this idea

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.130
that food needs to be made
by somebody in a chef coat

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.530
with a fancy apron on.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.410
I'm wearing a bespoke
apron right now.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.810
But it's not a fancy apron.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.274
So the vinaigrette's done.

00:12:03.274 --> 00:12:04.940
If you wanted to make
extra vinaigrette,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.610
you can make a ton of it
and store it in your fridge.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.220
It's going to stay good in the
fridge for three to four weeks

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.880
easily.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.296
The only thing that's going
to go bad in this vinaigrette,

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:14.580
really, is oil tends to
go rancid after a while.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.163
But it was probably
rancid because you

00:12:16.163 --> 00:12:19.250
bought it a year ago
anyhow in your cupboard.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.442
But the garlic in
there will go off, too.

00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:23.650
But that, really, is going
to take two to three weeks

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.304
to happen.

00:12:24.304 --> 00:12:25.970
So you can make this
with fresh shallot.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.760
You can finally dice onion.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.340
Basically, the
ratio is the ratio.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.570
And if you want to flavor
it with chopped-up kimchi,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.359
that's great.

00:12:33.359 --> 00:12:34.900
You want to flavor
it with hot sauce,

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.960
you want to use the lime
instead of some of the vinegar,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.939
you just need to understand that
it's all based on that ratio.

00:12:40.939 --> 00:12:42.980
And the flavor profile of
what you're looking for

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.410
is anything you want to make it.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.540
On top of the ratio, you
can add different flavors.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.600
So it could be soy.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.140
And it could be ground sesame.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.120
It could be whatever it is--
tahini or whatever it is.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.770
So that's there.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.420
We're going to begin to process
through some vegetables.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.771
And then we're going
to look at our farro.

00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:01.020
I've already got cooked farro.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.670
So this is not really important.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.650
It's kind of the TV switcheroo.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.970
So in the recipes,
I broke them down.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.540
And literally, they are the
simplest vegetables and things

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.500
to-- and simplest
recipes to make.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.820
So if I go home
and I'm starving,

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.247
and my kids are by my side, I
would make Beatrice make this.

00:13:22.247 --> 00:13:23.830
Because let's go
back to when Beatrice

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.913
was five years old and
going off to kindergarten--

00:13:25.913 --> 00:13:28.200
and this pulls at my
heartstrings as a dad,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.480
but also as a cook and
a chef and a proponent

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.494
of homemade food.

00:13:32.494 --> 00:13:34.160
So I could hear this
clamoring first day

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.451
of kindergarten in the kitchen.

00:13:35.451 --> 00:13:37.530
And Beatrice, I
can see looking out

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.980
my bedroom into the kitchen.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.250
And Beatrice is there
standing on a stool

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.004
with a knife in her hand cutting
vegetables to make a salad.

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.170
And she was doing pretty
much what we're doing here.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.840
And she was putting it into a
bowl that's got a sealable lid.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.300
And she was shaking then a
vinaigrette off to the side

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.090
and pouring a little bit
of that and sealing it.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.090
And that was her lunch
she was taking to school.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.700
Nobody instructed
her to do that.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.290
Nobody had taught
her to do that.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.540
She had learned that
by watching me work

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.000
in the kitchen over the years.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.840
Really perceptive kid,
and she's a sponge.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.060
But that's what kids are.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.150
They're sponges.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.350
But Beatrice, just
as an example,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.800
will have a much better life
because of the skill sets,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.810
because of these
core ideas of food,

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.400
that she understands that this
is not precious, this is easy.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.960
And that's what we need to get
across to this next generation

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.810
because there are so
many temptations in how

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.790
we feed ourselves every day.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.560
There's so much ease out
there and what we think

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.370
is convenience.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.880
But that convenience
catches up to us.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.730
And that convenience has
caught up to our society

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.540
in the form of type 2
diabetes and obesity

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.320
and just loss of skill sets.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.640
So Beatrice did that.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.470
So I would go home now.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.110
And I'll get Bea to make that.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.360
I'll get Clem to make--
Clementine;s my other daughter

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.830
who's 11-- to make farro.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.750
And she'll do it.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.660
And we'll talk about what
happened during the day.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.980
So cooking from scratch
is all about that.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.550
But it's also what I just said.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.160
We will talk about what
went on during the day.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.640
I mentioned this earlier
because it's really important.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.250
We do not have family
moments that we

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.800
remember over Pizza Pockets.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.130
We have family moments
that we remember

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.910
that mean a lot to
us in our community

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.490
and in our household over
food we make from scratch.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.330
Nobody wants to remember
a meal of a Pizza Pocket

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.640
because that's embarrassing.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.540
OK, carrying on.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.080
So I'm going to start
assembling my salad.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.080
So this is just a really
simple like Little Gem or Bibb

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.930
lettuce.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.510
Let's be abundantly clear about
what I believe about in food.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.792
I am not a zealot.

00:15:40.792 --> 00:15:43.000
If you bought this at the
grocery store, that's fine.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.930
If you bought it on a
direct-to-your-door delivery

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.375
site on the internet,
that's fine.

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:50.250
If you stole it from
the cafeteria at Google,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.380
that's fine, too.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.720
What I want you to
do is just cook.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.850
The best possible scenario
is you go out and find

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.300
the person who grew this stuff.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.770
And on a Saturday, you go to the
farmer's market with your kids.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:08.490
And your kids realize the
food doesn't just appear.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.680
The food is tended to
by somebody with hands

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.590
and cultivates that out of love
and trials and tribulations

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.130
and the difficulties of farming
in North America these days,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.520
and actually works at it.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.610
And that work ethic, if I can
get Beatrice and Clementine

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.170
to understand that the
food does not just appear,

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.380
it makes food more precious
and more appreciated.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.630
And I think that even kids have
a lot of empathy on situations

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.100
and are more prone to eat a
carrot that they know the where

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.810
it came from and
that somebody grew it

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.620
and somebody took pride in it.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.370
Because we've lost pride
in food, and that's

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.727
what we need to inject
back into the scenario.

00:16:49.727 --> 00:16:51.810
So I'm going to start
chopping up some vegetables.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.340
This could be any vegetable.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.950
If it was beautiful turnips,
Hakurei turnips and cucumber,

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.190
or it could be the
radishes or carrots,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.490
but it could be
chopped up cabbage.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.340
Basically, I'm just
saying it's whatever

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.560
you have in your fridge.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.440
It's all food.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.210
And I want you to use all
of it because the problem

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.770
with modern America is
we basically buy twice

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.119
as much food as we need.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.970
And we waste half of it.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.550
So that's up to
you to change that.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.800
But it's little steps to
a better, bigger step.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.319
So you have to start changing
the way we look at that.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.390
So a lot of people
say, well, I'm

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.069
not going to get a
five-year-old a knife.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.940
I'd give a
five-year-old a knife.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.340
I'm actually more scared of
giving middle schoolers knives.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.360
And let's talk about
middle schoolers

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.660
and how hard they
are to deal with.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.780
They are complete sponges and
want to learn life skills.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.910
They're also going
through a lot.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.440
And in the American
child these days,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.280
there's a lot of diversity in
what they're going through.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.260
We taught knife skills
to a group class.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.960
One kid cut
themselves on purpose,

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.430
which is a difficult
reality to set into.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.790
So it's hard to justify giving
a bunch of knives to kids

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.650
and telling them go at it.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.480
But most five-year-olds
actually probably cut better

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.240
than you do because you need to
learn the basic skills of it.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.840
So when we talk
about knife skills,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.530
you want to find
something that's sharp.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.620
And that's good because
the wound's cleaner.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.490
But if you see how I'm cutting,
I'm processing through.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.470
And my actual--
this finger right

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.100
here is actually
touching the blade.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.990
And my thumb is well behind.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.960
And I'm doing a
little claw thing.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.600
And slowly but
surely, I think what

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.225
you want to do with kids is just
show them what to do, and then

00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:39.440
implore them to do
it better and safely,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.524
and realize what they're
working with with knives.

00:18:41.524 --> 00:18:43.564
But eventually they're
going to work with knives.

00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:45.280
And you shouldn't be
scared about that.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.510
So we're going to
do radishes as well.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.300
And I love radishes.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.810
And people are like, how do
I get kids to eat radishes?

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.320
Well, you give them
radishes, for starters.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.340
A lot of people are like,
my kid won't eat that.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.055
It's like if you've
never tried--

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.090
you know what we
don't do at my house?

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.360
We don't talk about what's
on the plate that much.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.410
The plate is the plate.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.950
There's no demarcated point that
you have to eat the vegetables.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.090
It's just food.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.370
It's all food.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.790
It's a balanced food.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.500
If you want to get your kids
to try and try more things,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.850
eat family style.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.540
So the four of you,
or six of you--

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.260
I don't know how big your
family is-- one of you, whatever

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.260
it is, lay out the food.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.470
And if you've got a hungry
kid, they tend to go after it.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.250
If you've got a kid you fed a
saccharin sweet 5:30 snack to,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.980
your chances of success
at the 6:30 dinner

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.200
are very, very diminished.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.510
Does that makes sense?

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.910
Basically, they're not hungry.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.035
And basically, when they're
not really that hungry,

00:19:40.035 --> 00:19:42.285
they're going to become
pickier about the food they're

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:42.890
going to eat.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.460
I'm not saying
starve your child.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.630
I'm saying you want to
push them to the fact

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.250
that there is a dinnertime,
that we have demarcated meals

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.920
throughout the day.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.950
I live my life
snacking in kitchens.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.030
It's not a great existence.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.230
It makes me slim, but I
never really eat full meals.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.140
It's a weird thing.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.150
But OK.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.560
So I think the 5:30
snack is not good.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.670
You also want to
pick snack foods.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:12.830
Snack time should be
like 3:30, not at 5:30.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.890
So this is easy.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.110
We've got our basic
salad made up.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.250
If you wanted to add something
and make this a full my plate

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.590
experience of a
meal, what I would

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.020
add would be feta cheese
or chopped-up chatter

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.610
or whatever it is.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.160
And that's going to add
just a little more protein.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.500
If you want to add
tofu, you could.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.550
If you wanted to add
steak from last night,

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.890
or that roasted chicken
pieces from last night,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.070
you can do that, too.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.450
It depends on what you want.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.600
To me, this is a great meal
for a lunch just as is.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.715
A dinner, I'd probably
add some protein.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.060
Really, we're looking
at three components.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.430
And they're all in the
recipes you've got.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.070
So we've got the farro on.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.970
We've got the vinaigrette done.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.090
And then we're going to
make the poached eggs.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.970
And then we're just going to
assemble everything and get it

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.570
together.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.700
Let's go back to just
cost analysis just briefly

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.610
because I think this pulls away
from the preciousness of food,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.350
too.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.760
Look, if you want to buy
$12 a dozen eggs that

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.730
were from Martha, the egg-laying
chicken who is very pampered,

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:23.310
that's great.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.610
You can buy those.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:30.260
America still is buying
$1.50 and $1.75 a dozen eggs.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.130
So if we equate price to
that, they're probably not

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.330
the best eggs in the world.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.500
But there are eggs.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.120
And again, little
steps win this war.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.810
I'm not arguing about local and
sustainable organic right now.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.310
I'm arguing about
core cooking skills.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.817
I don't care where
people get it.

00:21:45.817 --> 00:21:47.400
I just want them to
cook from scratch.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.700
That's the first step.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.430
Better food sourcing,
that's the second step.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.220
Your ideal, which is buying
organically and locally

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.940
and sustainably, that's
a distant third step.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.070
But we're way far away
from bridging that gap

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.960
right now because
most of America

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.150
has forgotten how to cook.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.050
So this is the first step.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.610
So in that argument
is to say this egg

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.200
is worth about a quarter.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.090
The farro, a pound
of it's about $4

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.860
and will feed about 16 people.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.460
So maybe this is $1, all of it.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.100
And then the vinaigrette,
you've got about probably $0.25

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.210
a portion.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.280
Olive oil is more
expensive than you think.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.020
So that's maybe another $1.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.590
And your vegetables
are probably $3.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.340
So you're looking at kind of a
$6 meal for four people here.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.920
So this idea that the
automatic assumption in value

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.530
is that we jump
to the Happy Meal

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.250
as being the best
value available.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.050
Well, the Happy Meal is $4.50.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.560
So if you do that two times,
and the other value meal

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.110
is at $6 each, you're suddenly
at around $20, $21, $22.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.180
It's not a value.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.369
We've been lied to.

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:53.410
So we need to fight back.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.493
And the way we fight back
is we learn how to cook.

00:22:55.493 --> 00:22:58.560
We learn that this
is our modern value.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.530
So back to poaching eggs.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.670
What's poaching?

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.970
It's not boiling.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.490
It's kind of the
Jacuzzi of cooking food.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.290
It's taking something
that wants to be

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.010
in a nice warm
environment slowly,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.540
slowly cooking and sort of
nuancing it and coagulating

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.690
protein to an end result
of a beautiful thing.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.950
I like my egg yolk to
be relatively soft,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.080
but just set up.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.824
It's sort of almost like
custardy in the center.

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:30.740
So I break into it, and
there's a slight ooze.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.760
I don't want a liquid.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.700
So we're going to show
you how to do that.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.741
The first thing that's
going to go into the water

00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:40.350
is just a little bit of salt.
This water is at around 160,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.650
165.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.384
And so boiling is 212.

00:23:45.384 --> 00:23:47.050
So it's nowhere near
boiling, but you'll

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.930
see just little
traces of bubbles

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.642
on the bottom beginning to form.

00:23:50.642 --> 00:23:52.100
The other thing
I'm putting in here

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.740
is just a little bit of vinegar.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.520
And this is just a
still white vinegar

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.600
and that's just going to
help the egg whites coagulate

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.340
just a little more
closely towards the yolk

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.900
and not flutter around.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.300
So the first step is you've
got your water going.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.890
Realize you're putting four--
who universally travels here?

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.060
Or internationally travels?

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.434
If you travel in the universe,
you can tell me that, too,

00:24:15.434 --> 00:24:16.390
because that's cool.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.410
And that, we should
probably keep that hush-hush

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.805
if you guys are
really doing that.

00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:20.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.280
HUGH ACHESON: We understand.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:26.420
HUGH ACHESON: I remember going
to Spain about 10 years ago

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.170
and looking for eggs
at the grocery store.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.420
And it took me forever
because contrary

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.950
to North American culture, they
don't refrigerate their eggs.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.320
I'm not a food safety expert.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.050
I'm a chef.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.540
You don't really need to
refrigerate your eggs, either.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.690
If you put this as straight
out of the fridge times four

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.409
into 165-degree water, and
these are at 38 degrees,

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.575
you're going to plunge the
temperature of that water

00:24:50.575 --> 00:24:52.770
to way below a
poaching temperature.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.130
It's kind of like putting
ice cubes in water.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.630
You're going to
chill it down a lot.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.780
Or frying chicken
and wondering why

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.610
it's like poaching in oil after
you put it in there because it

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.050
was almost frozen chicken.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:04.925
Does that make sense?

00:25:04.925 --> 00:25:06.966
So we want to bring these
up to room temperature.

00:25:06.966 --> 00:25:08.500
And then we're
going to add it in.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.130
So room temperature is
sort of 75, 70 to 75.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.930
That's not going to affect it
as much as them being 38 to 40.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.100
So those are that.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.930
We're going to create--
you can go-- you

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.060
do this backwards in Australia.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.710
But we're going to go like that.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.930
And then that's just going to
help everything bind together.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.097
You see the white go around.

00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:32.680
And we're just going
to continue that.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.420
And that white's just going
to grab on to that as we go.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.980
And you see it
beginning to grab on.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:41.110
As it's swirling, it wants
to grab back on to that.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.370
And it's doing exactly
what it's supposed to do.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.380
Just want to make sure it's
not sticking, which it's not.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.080
Right now this is at six
out of 10, which is 60%.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.625
Math class was very good to me.

00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:56.250
So we're just going
to stir that again.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.947
And again, we're going
to drop those in.

00:25:57.947 --> 00:26:00.030
You can drop all four in,
which we're going to do.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.370
I do put them in these little
ramekins ahead of time.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.390
And that just-- ooh,
that's a big yolk.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.190
The other ones were little.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.690
Eggs.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.490
Food, the modern miracle.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.010
So we're stirring that around.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.062
And we're just going
to get that in there.

00:26:17.062 --> 00:26:20.420
And stirring it around
just a little bit.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.657
I don't want to break my yolks.

00:26:23.657 --> 00:26:24.990
Now we're going to let those go.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.948
It's going to take about
three to four minutes.

00:26:26.948 --> 00:26:30.829
But what I want you to do is
realize that you read a recipe,

00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:32.870
and you read through it
and you think you got it,

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.120
and nothing really goes right.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.590
Well, food is a nuanced thing.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.680
We love restaurants.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.560
Sometimes they're
really consistent.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.487
But that's a really
difficult thing to do.

00:26:42.487 --> 00:26:44.070
It's doing something--
I mean, there's

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.970
a lot of different
things going on

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.250
and a lot of different
people's responsibilities

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.170
in the kitchen.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.360
So you just want to
watch it and begin

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.540
to understand the
nuance of food and when

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.110
things are naturally done.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.320
So in getting this
together as a final,

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.893
I want to give a little bit of
toothsomeness-- how are you;

00:27:03.893 --> 00:27:05.740
you're good-- to this pharaoh.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.710
So it's cooked already.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.650
It's plumped out.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:13.090
It's tender, but
not really soft.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.150
But I'm going to crisp
it up by just putting

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.940
a little bit of oil in the
pan, getting this heat up

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.970
to about seven, and
then we're going to just

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.055
put a little bit of it in.

00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:26.370
And I just want to give it
a little different crunch

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.810
on the palate.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.070
And this is, again,
kids like texture.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.850
We like texture in food.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.390
I think we like big
flavors more than ever.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.690
We've internationalized
our food in North

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.300
America in the last
five years more

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.350
than it ever has in like 100.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:47.440
So our familiarity with
kimchis and fermented foods

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.400
overall is beyond where
it was five years ago.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.870
So feel free to add whatever
you want to this type of thing

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.500
to make it more fit your palate.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.180
So that oil is just shimmering.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.585
Oil obviously is thicker
at a colder temperature

00:28:02.585 --> 00:28:04.400
so it thins out as
it's warming up.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.820
And you just want to see as
it races down the pan just

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.560
how it's moving.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.690
But again-- and then we don't
want it to be smoking, though.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.699
Olive oil has got a
pretty low smoke point.

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:16.490
You could do this in
a grapeseed oil, which

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.490
is a neutral oil with a
much higher smoke point.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.300
And that would be good, too.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.540
And we're not trying to make
popcorn or popped farro, which

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.170
you can make.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.970
It's actually really good.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:32.072
And we're just going to get a
little bit of texture on this.

00:28:32.072 --> 00:28:34.110
So that's all in there.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.102
I'm going to check on my eggs.

00:28:37.102 --> 00:28:37.810
How are you guys?

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.570
I often cook and
talk to myself a lot.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.150
That's OK.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.710
So that's just going to
sizzle out and do its thing.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.300
And I'm going to
season a little bit.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.880
Now seasoning is, again, it's
different in every household.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.120
Just realize what
you want to attain.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.030
I just want to make sure
the food's fully-- has

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.390
a lot of flavor going on in it.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.450
So I'm going to
re-emulsify my vinaigrette.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.400
In the fridge, if it
separates, that's fine.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.230
Olive oil, when it's cold,
obviously, is pretty solid.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.160
So you want to take
it out, temp it.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.180
You can temp it in the
microwave if you need to.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.984
Nobody uses those
things anymore.

00:29:21.984 --> 00:29:24.400
And then we're going to toss
everything together and begin

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.910
to plate.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.570
Would my kids eat this?

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.611
Yes, if they were hungry.

00:29:31.611 --> 00:29:33.610
They still am-- I mean,
my kids are not perfect.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.310
They still jones for
the Chick-fil-As,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.430
as we've talked about.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.110
But they would eat this.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:44.670
And you could add prosciutto
to it or salumi or whatever

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.500
it may be.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.820
It's just, to me, this
is the 10-minute meal

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.390
because the farro maybe is
already cooked from last night.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.940
Basically, the
vinaigrette's already made.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.960
Basically, you're
giving yourself

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.690
building blocks, which
is exactly what I'm

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.860
trying to give to the kids in
this Seed Life Skills thing.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.920
So why does this apply to you?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.360
Because the better you eat,
the more productive you are.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.170
The better you eat,
the healthier you feel.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.100
And the better you
eat, the more closely

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.230
you have a relationship
with your kids.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.160
And the more you cook
food with your kids,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.722
the more enabled
they are to get--

00:30:18.722 --> 00:30:20.430
to have those life
skills that are really

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.770
going to pertain when they're
out on their own later in life.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:25.760
Let's see.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.070
Let's go over the
basics of the curriculum

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.740
because it's pretty interesting.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.300
So it's got nine components.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.090
One of them is life hacks.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.370
It's leadership.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.330
It's talking about
how we talk to people

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.910
and how we-- it's
basically the manners.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.950
When we look at a
dated curriculum,

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.940
there's that manners protocol.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.740
And somebody was
like, well, do you

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.820
want us to teach
them how to have

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.240
dinner at a fancy restaurant?

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.550
And I'm like, no, I don't care.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.440
I want you to teach how
to talk to the bank teller

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.890
or how to walk into a
room and feel confident.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.390
And those are the types of
things that I think they need.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.390
This is all about
just empowering kids.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:09.320
That's it.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.940
So the second one is kitchen,
home, and health fundamentals.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.610
Right now, home ec curriculum
spends about a week

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.940
talking about
different sort of risks

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.040
in cooking food and botulism
and all these things.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.450
And my mandate on
that is they need

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.420
to learn that in
about 15 minutes

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.880
because there are
risks in cooking food.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.090
And they're there.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:38.130
If you're smart about it,
they're rarely, rarely,

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.420
rarely going to happen.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.140
Botulism cases are
few and far between.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.950
If you're going a
home canning bent

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.820
and have no idea
what you're doing,

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.124
you're probably on
a dangerous path.

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:50.790
So as long as you
know what you're doing

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.380
and are following pretty
simple food safety stuff,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.440
yours should be good to go.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.250
And then health fundamentals
is how to balance a diet.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.690
What really is eating?

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.790
Right now, we've got
93% of American kids

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.410
do not eat enough vegetables.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.060
That's across the board.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.750
That is from wealthy households
and poor households--

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.760
and at 93%.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.700
So it's teaching kids
that vegetables are not

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.116
that part of the
plate that you're

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.380
going to feed to the dog.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.230
But it's that part of the
plate that you really revel in.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.730
And the only way you get
the kids to eat vegetables

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.320
these days is you start
very, very early in life.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.570
If a kid doesn't
like a beet at age 2,

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.762
they don't like sugar
because beets are 90% sugar.

00:32:30.762 --> 00:32:31.970
I mean, that's what they are.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.390
They're like nature's candy.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.820
So we just need to think
along the lines of how do we--

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.920
but teaching a
15-year-old to eat a beet?

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.920
Have fun with that.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.990
Let's look over our eggs.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.850
Our farro's pretty much done.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.560
I'm just going to spoon just a
little bit of warm liquid on.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.410
They're just about there.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.640
As you can see, the egg
white's taken shape.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.146
The egg yolk is just
beginning to come to temp.

00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:01.820
That's an [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.530
So we're getting there.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.060
It just needs a
little bit more time.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.750
These days, I love-- OK, let's
talk about vegetables overall,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.420
too, in that we're from
a generation-- well,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.270
I'm older than most of you.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.380
We're from a generation that
hated vegetables because nobody

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.150
knew how to cook them.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.850
Now we live in a society
where these people

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.920
know how to cook cabbage and
Brussels sprouts and carrots

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.567
in 25 different ways.

00:33:30.567 --> 00:33:32.150
Well, our mother
knew how to cook them

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:37.240
in one, which was cook
the hell out of it.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.790
That's not a really
great primer on how

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.460
to learn to love vegetables
and appreciate them.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.310
But now we're in a better state.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.230
So I can feed a kid
charred cabbage,

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.940
and they will eat a
whole plate of it.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.640
I'll feed them
buttered sauerkraut,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.500
and they will be like,
this is crazy good.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.570
It's like rich and nuanced,
but it has the sourness to it

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:58.430
that's wonderful.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.170
And so it's exploring
different parts of the palate.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.870
And before, we're exploring
just overcookedness.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.520
So this is the idea.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.895
So that's the
skill sets we have.

00:34:07.895 --> 00:34:09.353
So if you're not
getting vegetables

00:34:09.353 --> 00:34:11.320
in front of your kids,
you're just losing out

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.620
because we've learned so much.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.830
We've come so far.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.290
Vegetables are so good.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.400
And vegetables are the best deal
in the market in the grocery

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.520
store.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.710
So then we go to
ingrained cooking

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.960
with grains and legumes.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:31.630
In 1944, there was a
presidential mandate

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.780
to enrich rice.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.980
We have stripped nutrition
by farming in such a bad way

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.020
that rice had no
nutritional value.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.440
So that's why you
see enriched rice now

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.429
is because it was the
main diet of soldiers.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.530
And the soldiers were
basically collapsing

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:51.560
on the field of battle
because they were eating crap.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.110
So we need to get away from
this idea of enriching stuff,

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.940
of having milk filled with omega
3s and all this extra nutrients

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.750
and vitamins.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.270
I like that idea for
keeping a kid upright,

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:06.729
but I want to empower that kid
to be upright on their own,

00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:08.270
not have to think
about it, that they

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.940
get a balanced and
full died from eating

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.610
the proper things in life.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.970
And that's the way they live
their healthy lifestyle.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.070
So I don't think
that's that difficult,

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.110
but that's where
we're at in that.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:24.107
So you know, it's fun to try
and convince a kid to eat well.

00:35:24.107 --> 00:35:25.940
But when they do it and
they're on their own

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.530
and really doing
it, it's exciting.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.930
So my eggs are done.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.720
I'm just going to let
them hang out over here.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:40.310
So anybody got any
questions so far?

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.420
The eggs are-- the yolk
is just custarded out

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.990
and exactly where I want.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.200
Let's go over some of the
other ones just quickly.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.430
So grains would be whole grains.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.480
So it's wheat berries
and amaranth and farro--

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.990
things that are coming into
our popular vernacular of food

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.650
again.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.220
So it's a really exciting time.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.540
The next generation is
going to know a lot more.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.010
So we need to introduce
them to them now.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.010
So you guys just need to
learn how to cook them.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.680
But again, it's dropping them
in water and covering a pot

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.720
and seasoning.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.025
This is not rocket science.

00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:14.150
This is just really, really,
really, really, really

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.080
simple straightforward food.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.510
Then talking about agriculture
and modern food systems

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.360
in the form of making a salad.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.737
Where's all the stuff from?

00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:24.570
Why is it pertinent?

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.210
And why it matters.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.179
Then cooking an egg
and roasting a chicken.

00:36:30.179 --> 00:36:31.970
If you know how to
roast a chicken in life,

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.140
you're better than 90%
of chefs out there.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.575
So go and learn how.

00:36:35.575 --> 00:36:37.700
If you want the single best
roasted chicken recipe,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.970
it's in the Zuni cookbook,
which was written

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.060
by an amazing woman
named Judy Rodgers, who

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.650
is a chef at Zuni in San
Francisco, who passed away

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.920
about five, six years ago.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.350
And it is an amazing recipe
on how to take a great chicken

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.689
and make it ethereally good.

00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:55.480
And if you don't feed
that chicken to a kid

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.855
and they don't
like it, they just

00:36:56.855 --> 00:36:58.700
don't like food, and move on.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.970
They move out at 18.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.680
You'll be fine.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.180
But the idea of cooking
well is not over our heads.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.930
It's a really simple
recipe and really doable.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.810
And then putting up is
preservation of food

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.040
and the importance of
preservation of food

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.560
and the idea of
preservation of food.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.340
So we just need to think about
all of those things as well.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.480
And then we're going into home
finance and how to read it.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.880
So I moved out of my house
when I was 17 years old.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.680
I signed my first lease
when I was 17 and 1/2.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.040
I lived with a friend for a
couple months before that.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.880
I had no idea what I
was signing, no idea.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.190
Nobody told me.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.080
Nobody told me that this
was a legal document.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.160
Nobody told me that this
was the rent stipulation

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.842
and it would go up
next year by this.

00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:47.300
And I was signing
a two-year lease.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.630
And it was a huge jump.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.340
So nobody's teaching
these kids these things.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.660
Nobody teaches them adequately
why you don't get a 24% APR

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.800
credit card.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.340
And we have kids
going through life,

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.170
and then they make
crazy, crazy mistakes

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.700
that would have been so
avoidable if they'd been just

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.260
taught earlier in life
that maybe you shouldn't

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.680
lease your first
car as a Mercedes

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.970
if you make $23,000 a year.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.340
Because companies are
very excited to lease one

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.450
to you because they're
not going to tell you

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.660
about the ramifications
you're having on your credit

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.150
rating and your life.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.200
So that is a matter
of hedge fund

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.690
managers and financial advisors,
basically whittling down

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.660
with me and saying,
these are the core things

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.150
that we see all the time.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.180
These are the issues.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.980
And these are the
pratfalls and pitfalls.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.090
And this is how you avoid it.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:40.310
And then the rest of
it is just life hacks.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.456
It's DIY.

00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:44.212
It's how to tie knots so
things really stay down

00:38:44.212 --> 00:38:45.920
so they don't fly off
the top of your car

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.600
when you got the Christmas
tree, and then it's

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.850
not there anymore, because
that's really embarrassing.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.640
It's on the side of the 101.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.660
That's not cool.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.410
So learning how to tie knots.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.830
Again, it's life skills.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.880
I grew up sailing.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.590
I knew how to tie knots.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.090
This is kind of like Boys
Scout/Girl Scout empowerment

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.060
merit badges for everyone.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.770
So it's also how to sew on a
button and hem a pair of pants

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.940
because, as I said before, those
are really important skills.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.090
So it's all these
things-- how to fix things

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.550
before you replace it.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.450
So it's not all-- not all
of it has to do with food.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.480
But it's all applicable.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.190
I'm going to salt
this a little bit.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.830
I'm going to get
my farro into this.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.330
It's still a little bit warm,
but it doesn't have to be.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.900
Yours isn't.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:34.900
And we're going to-- you guys
have Sweet Green out here yet?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.916
So you can feed for the whole
family for the price of one

00:39:37.916 --> 00:39:40.290
trip to Sweet Green in New
York, which is like the future

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.980
of fast food, it's basically
a salad joint, in New York---

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.740
where it started in Philly--
fastest-growing thing in food.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.060
Shush, shush, shush.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.084
Hold on.

00:39:52.084 --> 00:39:53.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.040
HUGH ACHESON: It talks to me.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.330
This is an induction
burner, which

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.550
is-- they're great and
annoying at the same time.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.496
So the vinaigrette's
going to go on.

00:40:03.496 --> 00:40:05.370
You can use as much
vinaigrette or as little.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.040
Remember, it's a pretty
bracingly acidic vinaigrette.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.160
I'm going to get my garlic back.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.570
And then we're just going to
toss this lightly to season.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:18.130
Again, I'm going to put just
a little bit of salt in.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.460
Everything in moderation.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.030
If you wanted to do this and
then go out for ice cream,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.760
live large.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.380
Have fun.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.950
And then we're
going to plate it.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.170
Now this is the other
thing about America

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:34.450
right now is that we eat
too much of a lot of things

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.660
we shouldn't eat.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.180
So in this case, if I
was to have a steak,

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.100
I would have three
ounces of meat.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.630
So a pound of steak
feeds my family of four

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.980
very well even after
butchery and stuff like that.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.950
It's just we eat too
much of that stuff.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.090
And a lot of that's tied to
sustainability and how we farm,

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.540
and what's really possible
for the long term.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.580
But it's a conversation we need
to have with our kids, too.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.320
You guys are making a ton of
strides here in sustainability.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.170
Google food is really, really
amazingly forward-thinking

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.550
on these type of things.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.740
But it's something we need
to talk to Middle America

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:11.553
about as well.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.570
But Middle America is holed up
in Oregon right now with guns.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:23.800
So that's pretty much it.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.680
And you could do two eggs
if you want a heaping

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.720
amount of protein on it.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.550
You don't need that.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.510
And so why do we do this?

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.090
Why am I doing this?

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:41.710
I'm doing this because
kids, they need our help.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.160
And it's not just our kids.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.280
It's all kids.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.490
I send my kids to
public school not just

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.200
for-- my kids will be fine.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.900
They're fine.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.940
They're fine.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.910
I send them there because
the other kids' parents

00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:00.150
work three jobs and
make $20,000 a year.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.130
And their kids are floundering
because they can't be involved

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.560
in the PTO or whatever.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.520
So we're engaged.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.360
And we're lucky in this
society to have the ability

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.630
to be engaged.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.060
So I'm engaged for all
kids to make this better.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.050
And we make it better by
giving them basic ideas.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.000
So to me, this is the basic
idea that every kid-- this

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.410
is a right that they
should learn this.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.150
It is not a skill set to
go to McDonald's and get

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.110
a Happy Meal.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.990
But this is skills
that everybody can do.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.540
Like, if you guys can't do all
of this from start to finish,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.960
I'd be amazed.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.130
I'd be utterly, utterly amazed.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.961
But if you can teach
your kids to do this,

00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:43.460
you don't worry
about them then when

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.140
they're 20 because at least
they know how to do this.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.550
Does that makes sense?

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.080
So it's skill sets for everyone.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.150
And that's kind
of the whole idea.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.440
The eventual is we've got a box.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.050
And the box is a curriculum.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.170
And we can get that to
curriculum to Portland, Oregon,

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:05.290
to Portland, Maine, to Wichita--
anywhere, any private school,

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.430
charter school, or public school
that wants it free of charge.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.014
And it is a curriculum
box that you open up.

00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:13.680
And it's got teacher
training on the top

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.010
for two days,
interactive videos,

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.290
a lot of retainable
sort of videos that

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.860
go along with the course load.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.380
All the nine modules
are packed together

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.250
and fits the timeline
of your classroom.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.810
The reason I did this particular
style of fitting this in is

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.000
we've got the school gardens.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.500
We've got school
nutrition and empowerment

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.030
and redoing of school lunch.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.150
And nobody is tackling
the most important thing

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.290
in the middle, which is
we're not teaching kids

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.960
how to boil water.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.240
So we need to do this.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.810
Or we're wasting time
and we're falling

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.770
into the trappings of modern
society more and deeper

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:53.544
every day.

00:43:53.544 --> 00:43:55.210
The other reason I
did it is because I'm

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.690
the son of an economist.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.730
And this is imminently doable
because these classrooms

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.440
exist, the curriculum
is still being taught,

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.560
though a lot of schools
are jettisoning it.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.090
So before they jettison
it, I need to swoop in

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.070
and say, you can do this.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.520
You've got great teachers.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.130
I want to give them something
that makes their life easier.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.296
I want to give them something
that is really, really

00:44:15.296 --> 00:44:17.910
easily teachable and that
everybody can learn from.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.020
The other thing I want to do
is develop an adult curriculum

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.690
because as I said, the feedback
from adults that I talk to

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:28.030
is, how can I take this course?

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.140
So we all need this.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.350
But we need like a Khan
Academy of life skills.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.800
We need that sort of
modules on YouTube

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.060
that teach us how to do
the most basic things.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.320
They exist, but
occasionally you find

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.750
that really weird
guy in a Speedo

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.249
teaching you how
to roast a chicken.

00:44:43.249 --> 00:44:44.580
And that's not cool.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.830
So YouTube, it's
a weird terrain.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.310
So this is more a
place where you can go.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:52.840
And this is life skills.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.350
So that's it.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.390
But anybody got any questions?

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.950
AUDIENCE: Really quick
question about farro.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.680
So the more and more I
shop, I see quick grains,

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.220
so like five-minute farrow.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.030
HUGH ACHESON: Yep.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.660
AUDIENCE: My question is
it looks the exact same--

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.368
HUGH ACHESON: Eh.

00:45:06.368 --> 00:45:08.450
AUDIENCE: --but what
do they do to it?

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.494
And are you losing any
nutritional benefit by--

00:45:10.494 --> 00:45:11.410
HUGH ACHESON: You are.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:12.410
AUDIENCE: --using a quick grain.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.076
HUGH ACHESON: Yeah,
it's the same thing.

00:45:14.076 --> 00:45:21.320
It's like, I talk a lot about
the advent of Minute Rice.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.050
How hard do things have to
be when we minutize them?

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.590
So I mean, farrow cooks
in 15, 20 minutes.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.120
So if you buy-- basically,
that's pre-cooking it,

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.290
drying it, and then-- so it's
just you're re-hydrating it

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:35.620
in five minutes.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.260
So what I want to
do is teach people

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.180
the beauty of cooking
something from raw, the ease

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.900
of cooking something from raw.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.350
And I want to get
back to a society that

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.630
doesn't feel like spending 10
more minutes in the kitchen

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:53.680
at the stove is an inconvenient
move or a loss of time.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.560
It's also going to strip a lot
of nutrients in that process.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.070
And it's also just going through
so many more hands and machines

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.180
that I just think I can
simplify the process.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.170
So convenience through
inconvenience from convenience.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:08.240
I don't know if that
makes any sense at all.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.630
But yeah, but yeah.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.542
Anybody else?

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: We've
got one right here.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.649
HUGH ACHESON: Yes

00:46:14.649 --> 00:46:15.190
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.512
Thank you for joining us today.

00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:17.970
HUGH ACHESON: Thanks
for having me.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.447
AUDIENCE: I have a really quick
story and then a question.

00:46:20.447 --> 00:46:22.280
I have a nine-year-old
and a three-year-old.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.720
And a couple of weeks
ago, my nine-year-old

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.580
was just having a
really, just, like,

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.760
one of those
complainy boring, I'm

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.415
bored nights and just
agitated and off.

00:46:32.415 --> 00:46:35.170
And I asked him if he
wanted to cook with me.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:35.740
He did.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.772
He chopped all kinds
of things-- mushrooms,

00:46:37.772 --> 00:46:38.980
carrots, all kinds of things.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.500
And it was amazing how his
mood just changed and happy

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.500
and when can we do this again.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.290
So just thank you
for reminding us

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.780
that these are things we
should all do together and also

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.940
have those daily conversations
while we're doing it.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.860
My question is, if I recall
correctly from the last time

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.950
you were here, you're not fond
of the ingredient delivery

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:58.730
services.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.242
Is that right?

00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:01.700
I was wondering if
you could just--

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.775
HUGH ACHESON: We'll
talk about it.

00:47:02.775 --> 00:47:03.120
Yeah.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I don't know.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.940
I've been doing it a bit.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.220
And it's actually gotten me
cooking more, which I like.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.010
HUGH ACHESON: That's good.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:08.790
And not good.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:12.020
AUDIENCE: But I was wondering
if, for you, it was more of a--

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.820
because from a cost
perspective, you're

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.200
just paying way too much.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.390
Or if it's from a pride in
your cooking perspective,

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.206
that we haven't chosen
the ingredients ourselves.

00:47:21.206 --> 00:47:22.830
HUGH ACHESON: You're
on the right path.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:27.170
Look, anything, any
move you can make

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.130
to cook more from
scratch at home--

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:34.290
and basically these
companies like Blue Apron are

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.940
very smart companies in
kidding you out with mise en

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.570
place so you can cook at home.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.560
It's just you're really trapped
into their way of thinking.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.060
And it becomes very expensive.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.250
What I want to do is make
sure that you understand that

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:49.970
cooking should be your
adventure, not somebody else's.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.420
I think you should pick
up a recipe from any book

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.700
or from a magazine
and just embark on it.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.330
But you need to
be able to atomize

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.550
the skill sets that you're
learning because cooking to me

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.950
is like a LEGO set.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:03.370
Each little piece is a
skill set in the kitchen.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.330
Well, I just have a
bigger LEGO set than you.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.490
So I can build big things.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.000
But we all need those LEGO sets.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.240
And I want you
all to build them.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.410
But Blue Apron's good.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.830
And the only other problem
I have with Blue Apron is

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:20.360
I'm a really,
really big advocate

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.487
of making sure everybody in this
world has the ability to cook.

00:48:24.487 --> 00:48:26.070
And when we talk
about those services,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.540
they're really expensive.

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:32.000
So my job is to make sure
that everybody understands--

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.580
from the mother on food
stamps in Detroit--

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.410
this meal is a value.

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:40.440
This meal is a
value for everybody.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.090
And it is so easy.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.920
So there's a complexity
that some of those services

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.200
want to implore you to
cook something complex.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.440
And I like that.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.780
First step is the core
idea of food again,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.240
is the core idea of I want
you to make a salad dressing.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.420
It's so easy.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.700
And so that's the idea.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.960
I want you to make
the perfect omelette

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.803
If you want the best way,
Ludovic Lefebvre of Petit

00:49:04.803 --> 00:49:05.302
Trois.

00:49:05.302 --> 00:49:06.490
And he's on TV.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.240
He's on "The Taste."

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.880
He's got this amazing
omelette recipe.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.080
And it's so easy.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.200
But now Beatrice makes
that omelette all the time

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.780
in this little
French omelette pan.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.050
I mean, it's the perfect
tri-fold, no color on it,

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.780
just custarded eggs
with chives on top.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.960
And it's stunning,
finished with butter

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.180
and stuffed with boursin cheese.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.520
It's not expensive or precious
food, but it's technically on.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.550
And that's what I want.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:33.530
I want people to get so excited
about that type of attribute

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.540
of food that if I can cook an
egg perfectly, I'm winning.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.040
You know?

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.770
And that, that to me is a
skill set anybody can learn.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.880
And it's to me it's so exciting.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.190
And you talked about
changing your child's mood

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.230
when they actually engaged
in something in the kitchen.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.280
Well, it was because they're
doing something with you.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.270
And you were doing it together.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.566
And that, you know, that
to me is like something

00:49:58.566 --> 00:49:59.690
that you can never replace.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.260
So somebody says, well,
cooking's inconvenient?

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.030
I'll take that
inconvenience every day

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.750
of my life, that connection
I have with my kids

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.980
and watching them
bloom and watching them

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.840
be there and learn something.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.930
And I had a good time.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:13.250
And they got well fed.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.720
And they learned something.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.730
And it's just better.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:20.430
It's so-- I don't know--
lofty as a dorky goal,

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.880
but so simple as well.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks for all
the content and everything.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.680
I think it was awesome.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.460
My question is related
to what you brought up

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.020
about allowing kids to cut.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.289
I'm actually quite happy
that over the past few months

00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:36.080
I've been involving
the kids in the kitchen

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:36.913
and stuff like that.

00:50:36.913 --> 00:50:39.480
The one thing-- I have two
kids, an eight-year-old

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.600
and a five-year-old.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.100
I just had the courage to give
my eight-year-old a knife.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.789
And he's now chopping
a little bit.

00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:47.080
But I haven't been able to
do it with my five-year-old.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.670
How could you and what
would you suggest?

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:53.260
And how can I encourage him to
use a knife but do it right?

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.900
I haven't taught
them right at all.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.340
They will chop
their fingers soon.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.430
But I'll try to
do the claw thing.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.350
HUGH ACHESON: There
are starter knives

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:02.600
that you can buy at kitchen
supply stores and Williams

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.210
Sonoma and places,
Sur La Table that

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.970
are kind of smaller,
slightly duller knives,

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.077
usually brightly colored.

00:51:12.882 --> 00:51:14.590
The scariest [INAUDIBLE]
from the kitchen

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:16.910
is a big, very sharp knife.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.430
But to me, the scariest
knife is a dull knife

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.370
that's going to cut me badly.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.740
Or the really scary one
is a serrated knife.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.830
So cutting things that
are difficult to cut

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.340
with a bread knife that's
sharp, bread knives

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.720
will mangle you up.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.710
So don't do that.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.790
But just a small,
manageable knife--

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.440
I think a paring
knife-- and just, look,

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.030
if it's a five-
or a six-year-old,

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.240
you have to be there
right there with them.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.050
You can't turn around.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.290
But it's training
about, I don't really

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:47.830
cut myself cutting anymore.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:50.350
But I will cut myself
putting my knife in my bag

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:52.240
or moving around the
kitchen and swiping

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.110
my hand across the
cutting board and pfft.

00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:01.310
So it's reminding a kid
that this is a tool.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.920
And it's a dangerous tool.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.500
But it's a really important
tool to learn how to use.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.866
So we respect it.

00:52:06.866 --> 00:52:08.490
And you lose the
respect for it, you're

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.698
not allowed anywhere near it.

00:52:09.698 --> 00:52:11.080
You have utter respect for it.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.710
Even at five, kids
will understand that.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.270
And I think that's a really
important lesson to learn,

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.800
that you can burn
yourself at a stove

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.280
if you're not paying attention.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.390
You can knock a pot
of water on your foot

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.060
if you're not paying attention.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.700
That's why we pay
attention in cooking.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.050
This is serious
in a lot of ways.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.133
I want you to have a lot
of fun, but it's serious.

00:52:30.133 --> 00:52:35.350
So Clementine gets admonished a
lot, my nine-year-old-- or now

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.894
11-year-old-- for not paying
attention in the kitchen.

00:52:37.894 --> 00:52:39.310
But, you know,
slowly, but surely,

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:40.900
she understands that if
she wants to be there,

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.570
she's got to take
it pretty seriously.

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.250
So no texting.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:46.870
My kids are at that age.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.822
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:47.822 --> 00:52:48.780
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.240
And I just want
to say thank you.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.240
HUGH ACHESON: Thank you.

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.535
AUDIENCE: I really think
what you're doing is spot on.

00:52:55.535 --> 00:52:57.320
This is something
I've been looking for.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.620
I have a five-year-old.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:03.260
And the last two years-- I'll
just kind of give a story-- we

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.140
set up meals for the week.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.120
And we allow her, my
daughter, to pick a meal.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.570
And she'll pick random things.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.210
Like last week, she
picked French toast.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.600
And we had it for dinner.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.690
And we go and find a recipe.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.630
We force her to write
everything down.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.380
And we go to the grocery
store and buy it.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.110
And we make it.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.660
So that's how we kind of get
her involved in the whole meal

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.160
at home.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:30.215
And I think I was just saying
that story because that

00:53:30.215 --> 00:53:31.840
could be something
part of your program

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.197
if that makes some sense.

00:53:33.197 --> 00:53:34.280
HUGH ACHESON: Yeah, it is.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.863
AUDIENCE: For families,
I mean, that's

00:53:35.863 --> 00:53:37.929
something you could
coordinate relatively easy.

00:53:37.929 --> 00:53:38.720
HUGH ACHESON: Yeah.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.531
And I think that the idea
of finding a regularity,

00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:46.030
that she's picking a recipe
that she wants to do every week.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.100
But also, you guys realize
the best written cookbooks

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.020
and the best written
recipes are some the best

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.420
reading you'll ever read because
it's fully instructional.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.170
And instructional
writing, as you all

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.461
know because a lot of you do
it with what you're doing,

00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:01.980
is really, really difficult.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.690
We get comments still from
the first cookbook I wrote on,

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:07.430
it was good, but you
didn't tell me not

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.230
to put the egg shells in there.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:14.930
So, you know, I mean, people are
morons when it comes to food.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.177
So a recipe has to be fully
enveloping of everyone.

00:54:18.177 --> 00:54:19.010
AUDIENCE: It's true.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:20.426
HUGH ACHESON: So
it's key for kids

00:54:20.426 --> 00:54:22.740
to read those and
cadence through them.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.530
And kids are a lot smarter.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:28.410
You know, if Beatrice is reading
a recipe, you guys'll scan it.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.640
You're reading all the time.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.140
You're busy.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.880
You'll scan it over
really quickly.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.560
And it's not really sinking in.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.630
Beatrice will sit down with
it and take notes first

00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:39.770
and realize, like, sort
of plot out her timeline.

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.900
She's very methodical.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.600
You can't skim over this.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.590
We're teaching
kids how to learn.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.130
So you have to teach them
how to engage with the recipe

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:50.820
and fully understand it
before they embark on it.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.240
It's like all of us just
assume that we know how

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.170
to use the gizmos on our car.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:55:01.560
And we just don't because our
cars are so gizmoded out now.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.840
So it's that type of thing.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.090
But kids have an amazing
amount of patience

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:06.740
when you find them
in the right time.

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:10.740
So I have no problem with a
kid reading that and helping

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.840
me prep it out and showing
the sequence of it.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.089
And it's beautiful to watch them
sort of get excited about it.

00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:19.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
it was pretty successful.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:24.720
But my real question
was, I cook quite a bit.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.880
And I notice I
use too much salt.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.690
And I'm just trying
to understand

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:32.720
what alternates do I have
because eliminating it

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.250
just-- it's not good.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.720
But I do want to see
a reduction of salt.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.920
And I don't know if there's
good alternatives that give you

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.769
that flavor as a substitute?

00:55:43.769 --> 00:55:44.560
That's my question.

00:55:46.695 --> 00:55:48.320
HUGH ACHESON: Adding
salt's a hard one.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.095
I mean, you want to
season appropriately

00:55:50.095 --> 00:55:51.470
to bring stuff
out, but you don't

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:54.177
want things to taste salty.

00:55:54.177 --> 00:55:56.260
Your doctor is always going
to say you're probably

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.810
ingesting too much salt.
Usually how you're ingesting

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.620
too much salt is you're putting
together a lot of processed

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.560
ingredients that you have
no understanding of how

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.520
much salt's in there.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.390
When you're adding
the salt yourself

00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.880
in a home-cooked
environment from scratch,

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.320
it's at your control.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.000
So that's the best way of
cooking and controlling

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.290
salt amounts.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.320
But you want to make
sure-- food that's

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.090
really under-salted is dull.

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:26.140
So you can add other things
that will amp up flavors.

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.550
So hot sauces and things like
that, or fermented foods.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:31.650
But a lot of those contain
a lot of salt, too.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.330
A slice of bacon is
pretty much enough salt

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.430
as you need the entire
day because the curing

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.810
process of making bacon.

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:42.060
But then again, if I can find
a nitrate-free one that's

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.600
a little less salt that's really
good and from a local purveyor,

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.580
and I know the ingredients
that went into it

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:50.380
and I know the veracity
of it, I'm more likely.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.940
But also-- I don't know--
the last time I checked,

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.110
I just live once, at
least in my belief system.

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.790
And I want to enjoy the food.

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:01.940
I want to have fun.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.700
So everything in moderation.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.350
Look, have fun in life.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.660
But having fun is
eating good food

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.460
and enjoying it, and enjoying
it with the loved ones

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.390
you have in that amazing room
that you don't use enough

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.490
called your kitchen.

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.400
So enjoy.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.050
I wouldn't worry too much about
the salt. I'm not a doctor.

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.200
I don't even play one on TV.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:28.920
My name is Adelle.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.360
And my daughter
is 21 months old.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.180
So I've been
struggling with cooking

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:36.680
for her for the past year.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.570
So your class is very inspiring.

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:41.140
And I just have
a quick question.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.107
When should I start
giving her salad?

00:57:43.107 --> 00:57:45.315
HUGH ACHESON: When should
you start giving her salad?

00:57:45.315 --> 00:57:48.410
AUDIENCE: Because right
now, she wouldn't eat raw.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.030
She probably would
taste a little bit

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:54.690
of carrot, but definitely
not a cucumber or radish.

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:57.140
So what's the approach?

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.660
HUGH ACHESON: What
does she love?

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.760
AUDIENCE: Rice.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.250
And cheese.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.364
Yes, she loves cheese.

00:58:04.364 --> 00:58:06.780
HUGH ACHESON: I mean, I would
just start introducing stuff

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.640
slowly, but surely-- tiny,
little cubes of cucumber

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.410
and lightly cooked carrot, and
then moving towards raw stuff.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.531
Raw vegetables really are
immensely better for you

00:58:16.531 --> 00:58:17.030
overall.

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:18.530
They're just better
for your system.

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:21.430
Our bodies are really
trained to eat them well.

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:24.484
So I think just
slowly, but surely.

00:58:24.484 --> 00:58:26.150
I think you'd be
surprised at what she'd

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:29.280
eat if she was in a hungry
frame of mind and a good mood,

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.660
and you gave her some rice
and some cheese and three

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.290
other vegetables and you
didn't even talk about it.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:36.940
And don't even talk about it.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.030
It's just stuff on a plate.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:40.500
And let her go at it.

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.670
But I think as soon as we
start to question what's

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.520
on the plate, as soon as we
start to territorialize what's

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.660
on the plate as things
that have to be-- that are

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.540
healthy and good
for you, I think

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.360
we ostracize that
part of the plate

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.292
and ostracize it
mentally in their mind

00:58:53.292 --> 00:58:54.750
that they're not
going to go there.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:56.860
Or that there's going to
be a fight going there.

00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.360
When I don't talk about it,
you see this little thing

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.160
happening.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.220
You know?

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.630
And sometimes they're like,
oh, I kind of like that.

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.660
And so kids want to go
against us naturally.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.749
They like that.

00:59:08.749 --> 00:59:09.790
So don't let her do that.

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:10.600
She's only 21.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.580
You can take her.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.470
Don't be pushed around.

00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:17.880
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
help notice this is--

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.420
you made it look so simple.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.445
And yet it was so tasty,
amazingly delicious.

00:59:21.445 --> 00:59:22.320
HUGH ACHESON: Simple.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.200
Food.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.520
AUDIENCE: I had a
question about dressings.

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.830
You mentioned the ratio
as an important component

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:30.030
to dressing.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.580
But what other components
can go into a dressing

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.210
to make it appetizing for
someone to have salad?

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:37.510
I noticed that you didn't
add any sweet component

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:38.450
to the recipe.

00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.949
That's something we find a lot
more in dressings these days.

00:59:41.949 --> 00:59:42.990
HUGH ACHESON: It's weird.

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:48.310
I grew up-- I have
a strange palate.

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:49.410
My dad raised us.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:50.985
So we ate canned
yellow wax beans

00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:53.420
and burned rice and fish
sticks most of the time.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.240
So everybody's like,
oh, you must have come

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.990
from a really fancy household.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:59.680
And I'm like, no, my dad's a
tenured economics professor.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.930
He did not feed us well.

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:02.980
But we ate.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.710
And it was fine.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.310
But one thing I never
liked was sugar in food

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.720
that I thought
shouldn't be sweet.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.610
It just didn't
really work for me.

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.390
And that stuck with me.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:18.120
But now there's a big trend
of sugar in savory food.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.680
And oftentimes it's pulling from
other cultural-- other places

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.670
in the world.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.500
So Vietnamese cooking has
a lot of cane sugar in it.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.890
Thai food's got a lot
of cane sugar in it.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:33.400
Southern United States food
has a lot of honey and sorghum

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.410
and sugar added to things.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:37.120
But that's never been
good for my palate.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.900
So I keep the vinaigrette
light in that way

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.560
because I don't
want that interplay.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.570
But you could add a little bit
of-- a tiny bit of molasses

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.390
with soy.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.325
Soy and molasses go
really well together.

01:00:47.325 --> 01:00:48.783
You could add a
little bit of honey

01:00:48.783 --> 01:00:51.020
or just a really good
honey or something

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.370
like that to broaden it out.

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:57.910
But really the base ratio of
three to one of oil to vinegar,

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.460
oil to acids, that's
just a foundation.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.240
You can build up from there.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.490
So if I took the brine
from dill pickles

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:10.120
and used that as some of my
acid and made a dill pickle

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.220
vinaigrette and then pureed some
dill pickle to almost thicken

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.365
it up and add a little
contrasting flavor to it,

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:17.490
you could do that with
sweet and sour pickles, too.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.030
So you just need to think that
you can make it with anything.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.070
If you've got leftover
cooked butternut squash

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:24.900
and have a Vitamix
blender, I can

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.730
make you a butternut
squash vinaigrette

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.560
in about three seconds.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.030
So you have all this
stuff in your kitchen

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:34.560
that you never use, like
a slow cooker, a pressure

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.530
cooker, a Vitamix
blender-- all this stuff

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.420
that you've accumulated
over a while.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.790
Like, if you got married,
and filled out the registry,

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.650
and have all those
crazy, like, when

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.830
was the last time you
used that waffle maker?

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:49.020
So you just need to realize
that those tools are there

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.560
to make life easier,
but from scratch.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.262
So just use that base.

01:01:53.262 --> 01:01:54.970
And then you add
whatever you want to it.

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.464
It's whatever flavors
you want can go into it.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:58.880
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.379
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:59.379 --> 01:02:01.200
Feel free to come up
and ask us questions.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.840
And thanks for trying our pilot.
