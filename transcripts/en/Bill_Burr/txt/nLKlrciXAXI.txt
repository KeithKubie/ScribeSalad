That sounded really creepy. Um, hey, what's going on? I uh, been running around all day. Podcast is a little bit late. I was actually doing Joe Rogan's monster podcasts. Um, and uh, we had a great time. Talked a little bit about flying in the helicopter earlier this week and uh, and that he got me all sold on buying a fucking sauna. Yeah. Joe, Joe, Joe. Fuck. It tells you something. Be like, all right, this guy, you know, he's probably read up on it, whatever. He was like, people who do this four times a fucking week, you know, live a long time or some shit. And I'm just thinking like, well, I'm an old dad. Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:01:01       guys should get off. I don't care. I'm an old dad. Joe, make me Camaya too far away. Just give me me in five years. Oh yeah, you can you, oh.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       [inaudible]. Um, so I have to make sure I take care of myself. So, uh, Bill, he's got some growing up to do. All right. Abuse and alcohol for a while now I take the bottle out, I slept it around and let them know who's boss. Um, and I got to fucking grow up. You need, you need to take a little Paris back to Philly. Hey, fuck it. Say that all the time. You know what you need. You need a little bit of responsibility. Uh, I've never in my life understood that expression. You need a little bit of responsibility. They'll pick like the most immature fucking person ever and tell them you need some responsibility and you're like this fucking guy. No, this guy does not need to be in charge of anything. He's a fucking moron. Because they have that whole idea of, oh, well, once you have a kid and then you have, you know, you're, you're gonna have to, you know, change your ways. Yeah. Unless you're a fucking idiot. And everything this person is doing is demonstrating that there a fucking moron and you're telling them to go out there, procreate with somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       You know what you need is no responsibility. You need a fucking playpen is what you need there. Bucko my new year's resolution is I'm going to, um, I'm going to fix, I'm going to fix this little phone, a headphone Jack. I literally sit here with my thumb on the button like a terrorist. You know what I mean? Like I lift it off. It's, you know, my mom, my weight up fucking Evan 70 broads in my life. I know it's a hacky joke, but the more you're married, you're just like, oh God. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:03:05       anyways,

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       um, all Bebo Oh, bill Burroughs is fucking slowing down, man. In a good way. You know, I'm off the sauce. Who knows for how long, but I'm off the fucking sauce and I'm actually reading a book. Swear to God. I mean, granted, it's a sportsbook. Does that even count? It's about, uh, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell's relationship. When I did the herb, somebody over there gave it to me. I believe that's where I got it. And um, you know, one of the things that always bothered me, you know, something I always got meant to get around to was to know all the Celtics retired numbers. And now that I've read the book, I finally, I think I have them down. I swear to God I'm not looking at anything. All right. Number one is Walter Brown. He was the original owner of the Celtics. Number two is red are back. The great coach, they consider a number two, he got number two because he's the second most important person in the Celtics history I guess. Cause number one is the original owner. Then it's Dennis Johnson. Number three, Bill Russell, number six. Why do I, why do I need to know this? Jo Jo white on the great basketball names number 10 and then it's Bob Cousy at 14. Tommy Heinsohn is 15 some guys. Tom Sanders is 60 70.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       Eighteens Dave Cowens 19 is fucking Don Nelson. 21 is Bill Sharman. 22 is Ed Mccauley 20 Three's Frank Ramsey, 24 Sam Jones, 25 Casey Jones. All right now let's not eat now it's easy. 31 Cedric go and Brad Maxwell, 30 twos. Mikael, 33 is bird 35. Reggie Lewis, double zero is fucking Robert Parish. Then there's another guy just as his name, cause he also wore the number at 18 and didn't want to retire it. And then Dave Collins got it. So I don't know his fucking name. So that's not bad. That's not bad. Um, so now I know that. And what does that get me? Next time I get into an argument with my wife now, but watch Walter Brown now, but two's red are back. Can you do this?

Speaker 3:          00:05:16       No Dad,

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       I'm an old dad. I said, get off of that now I need a nap. Um, anyways, so after I did Joe's podcast, he's like, he's got like did that flotation salt tank thing in there. And I'm like, dude, I don't, I don't know. Like if I went in that fucking thing for like an hour,

Speaker 4:          00:05:40       like

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       I always wondered what those things were. Like those isolation tanks. I mean that looks fucking wild. They just close that door and you're in there floating in pitch black like you floating through space like Sandra Bullock in that movie, right where the other guy was never going to get married and then he did George Clooney. Right. May just sort of floated off into space that I could never get my shit together. You go back to the bucket spacecraft, I'm just going to float away that movie. I feel like you'd feel like that, you know, if I ever get a role where I get to play in astronauts, that that's, that's going to be how I'm going to prepare for the role. But what did you do to prepare for a role to play an astronaut? Well, I kept my Boston accent and I just went to an isolation tank and just laid there in a bathing suit.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       Do you think it helped you now? But it gave me something to say in this interview. Um, anyway, so he had a sauna there, which I'm totally sold on now. We went there, we tried to be in there for like a fucking half hour. He could do it. I couldn't, I, I made like there was eight minutes left, 10 minutes left. I made 20 minutes and I was like 200 fucking degrees in there. That's what he was saying. Like, how the fuck is it? 200 degrees in here? It doesn't water boil that like 212 degrees or some shit, hundred degrees Celsius. Um, I guess those Saunas can get harder cause it's not like it because it's a dry heat. I have no idea on all. I know. I was just like, all right, 10 minutes left. He goes, come on, tough it out. I'm like, all right. And then 10 minutes later I'm like, how much time's left?

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       And he's like, eight minutes. I'm like, fuck. And it at like five minutes I laid down and he's like, all right dude. He knew I was too stubborn so he fucking opened the door and then I was fine. He goes, you almost made it. It's like, I think I did all right. I don't think I need to go any further than that, but uh, I felt fucking great. I felt peaceful. I felt calm. I didn't feel like yelling at anybody or walking around being a fucking emotional lunatic that's just wears people out. Um, so whatever. I'll see. They makes little two person once I want, if I get fitted my fucking little ass garage, you know, that would be great.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       You know, anytime you have a disagreement with your spouse, right? You just go into the sauna. The rule is you go in there for half hour and then when you come up then you talk about it. Hey Man, like you left your shoes in the hall, man. Oh, I'm sorry man. It's okay. It's not, it doesn't really, but I didn't know why it bothered me 31 minutes ago, but it did. But that's, you know what, you can put your shoes wherever you want. Ah, thank you. I appreciate that. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. So anyways, um, I get not only do I have all my Christmas shopping done, I got them, I got it all wrapped except for when I bought my, my daughter, this book, uh, the, how the Grinch stole Christmas, I bought that on the road. And I just, I forgot I had it, I tucked it away in drawer because I know if she saw it she'd be like, book, book, read, read.

Speaker 2:          00:08:59       Um, so I'm going to, I just have to wrap that and then I think I'm done. I'm think I'm done. And I think for once my super smart wife hasn't figured out what anything that I'm going to get her, you know, I was really covert about this shit's not going around. I just, I brought everything into the garage this year. Right. Sorry. What the fuck was that? You know that shit when you open your mouth and you just make a fucking noise. Did you just hear that? Sounded like there was a ferret that was like some, something in the back of my throat while I continued to talk. Sound like a little cat. Did you hear that? You know, do you realize like back if I did that back in like the fucking 1700 state, they'd be like drowning me thinking I was a witch. I was like possessed or I had a fucking tape worm or something. Jesus Christ. Some of these fucking brides on, on social media thinking they're not being heard. How do you think it, the, the fucking people felt back then? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:09:55       Well, if you have to compare ourselves to the Salem witch trial, aren't you really proving our point?

Speaker 6:          00:10:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       that was the hedge clippers trim in the bush there. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       they broke. Anyways, I'm plowing ahead here. Uh, by the way, I've keep, um, promoted this on, on Joe Rogan to I the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit. Still promoting that is February, Tuesday, February 19th, 2019 get your ass to the fucking city. Alright, come on. Damn. Great benefit. Big J. Oh, Chris. Michelle Wealth Rich Vos. Fucking SciFest sounds myself as going, it's going to be a cavalcade, a comedy for the best data of comedian I ever saw in my life. All proceeds go to benefit all the people he was taking care of his family and all that. And it's been a very successful thing. We keep his name alive and what not. Um, all right with that, you know what? I actually got to watch a Bruins game the other night, uh, by getting watch. Most of it. I watch most of it. And then, uh, being a dad comes in, you know, I saw, uh, the first two periods of the Bruins, Ford and nothing win over the Canadians.

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       You know, we were up two to nothing and I missed the fourth period. Third period. Sorry. And uh, you know, one of my friends from Montreal Comedy Festival texting me, cause you watching this game, and I knew it was the third period and I was like, well, I go, I'm assuming you guys tied it up if you fucking called me. And to his credit, he didn't, he texted me, he, to his credit, he didn't. The man did not. He was letting me know that we played fucking great. And then I saw the highlights at last. Fuck it, Marshawn golden number for that Little Bing Bang, boom. All around the Oh and everybody, it, all those little Fred cheese with the fucking crying into their little handkerchiefs with this silly socks. Oh, I love it. Going into their building.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       Four to nothing. So they're probably playing tonight. I have no idea. But I gotta go, I gotta go on site for fucking supper. I still call it supper. Back in the day. That's what we call sit down for September. Your mother would bring the fucking dinner bell and everybody would come running in like cattle. Right? I'll fucking filthy for being outside there. It was chipped beef on toast. Uh, chicken Alex King.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       You know, I don't think a king eats like this. Um, anyways, let's plow ahead here. Uh, Liverpool, my fucking, my fucking adopted Goddamn team. I almost fucking miss this game. They're playing all my God. They're playing the wolves. Jesus fucking Christ, not the wolves. How the fuck is that a professional franchise? You've got some stupid Jersey with like a w on it. We get it. You know, you couldn't write the whole thing. They can afford to have the o l v e s on there, right? Is that he spell wolfs was it w o l f s wolf? I don't know. They'd say everything different over there. Reagan,L or a gang? No. You know, what else do they say? Tomato or a Gyno? Uh, all the spices they say differently. What's mother Rose Marie? No, that's not the one with the flex time. They see the same way. There's another one, there's another one that is just the ones Basel or Rogano Basel tomatoes. And you just want to be like, stop doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       you want to say that they're wrong. But they did it first. So they were right. Why the fuck did we switch? We switched all the accents on everything and I believe that was a fuck you right to England after we kicked their fucking red coated asses all the way back to their island, all the way back.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:59       And I just think that our little rebellion was not only are we kicking you out in the country that you first fucking occupied and took over. Not only will we continue the genocide that you started, right. We're gonna, we're gonna change the accent on the English language.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       Right.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       Do you say a automobile? We're going to say automobile. I don't know if we do that. I have no idea. Um, anyways, uh, the fuck was that. I am. Oh, goddamn. Noise is now. I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. I will tell you what's driving me fucking crazy is this year I, you know, I thought it was being a smart guy. Oh, who's this too was a tough guy. He was a smart guy, right? I went out and I bought a Christmas tree, like when it was still November, you know, so now I'm water in this thing and I got a missed it every goddamn morning to make sure it's not all brown and dead. By the time fucking Christmas comes along, our wreath is on the, on the front door is already dying, you know? And my wife went all out.

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       You know what I mean? Like great mothers do. She went all out, but I got more goddamn shit. I'm running around, you know, I'm the water boy. I got a water rate. I missed it. I'm talking to it. No, you look good. You look good. No, you're going to be one of the trees that lives after Christmas. You don't just lie into them like a fucking dirt bag. Right. So I didn't have a lot of time the other day and I'm running around the fucking kitchen table and we got the stupid fucking potted plant that literally has a concrete plant plant or whatever the fucking house that the roots are in, whatever you call it. Right. And that was on the floor because of the Christmas decorations on the table. And I ran around the table and just punted that thing, concrete fucking block with my, my pinky toe on my left foot and Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       It was like Barney the dinosaur purple within two hours. And it was like half of my foot by foot looked like I got run over by a car. Now, you know, obviously I did some damage, but most of it has to be my, most of it is my complexion, you know, being uh, a a fucking, you know, redhead, I'm borderline like transparent. Like I'm always getting marks on my body and like late at night, like I go to bed and my wife be like, what is that? What does that entail? What is, you know, fucking kilohm mark at my side. Did you get to a fight with an alley cat? Yeah, no, I took, I, uh, think I leaned up against the refrigerator. I don't know what the fuck happened. And then when, you know what's weird is if you hurt yourself and you don't remember what happened, you press down on it and then you're like, oh, and he takes you right back to that moment.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       Oh, that's right. That's fucking right. Yeah, it was, I was at the fucking poster. Oh, by the way, Jesus Christ, I went to the post office. I was trying to get all my fucking gifts out and uh, you can not fucking go there. The only way you can fucking go there is if you have everything done. I went there, I needed a box and I needed to, and then I need the fucking, the peanuts or whatever to put it in there. So what I was, whatever I was going to put in there was going to slide around and break and I need to tape the, close the box. It should just like, it's just, it's that last chopper out of Vietnam I n and I was happy that I went down there. I found somebody to help me out. You know, I got the box, I got the tape and then they said they had nothing to put in there to make sure my gifts to my nephews and nieces wouldn't fucking slide around.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       And I, I just, I just, I said, fuck it. I said, all right, thank you. I sent the tape down and put the box where it belonged. I walked out like a gentlemen while I fucking, I went a little Tourette's underneath. Goddamn fucking, well fucking fuck. Do you have fucking boxes and tape, but you don't have the, the last ingredient, most important ingredient for the last piece of the puzzle, I should say. The box is probably the most important ingredient. Well then you have to tape. I mean, they work together like a great comedy team, dare I say, right? Like Bob hope and bing Crosby through the guys who evidently created the fucking the buddy movie, you know, which has now been hijacked by all these females in all these movies acting like they're breaking ground. It's like you're just doing this shit. We already did.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       There's nothing new here ladies. You know, why don't you reinvent the buddy fucking movie before I get to listen to your call on each other. A bunch of fucking heroes. What do you think about that? Hey, uh, this is the thing that fascinated me because I was reading the Celtics Book and some of the fucking teams that they were playing, like, you know, playing Syracuse and Rochester stuff I had heard about before. But um, when they were talking, what the fuck is this? They were talking about playing like the, uh, what are now the Atlanta Hawks and I knew that they were in Saint Louis, but I didn't realize that they were in Milwaukee before that. All right, let's see here. Atlanta hawks, yet they were at this, this is their, their history. They were the buffalo bisons then for one season and then they moved or maybe a half a season.

Speaker 2:          00:19:27       Then they moved to the tri cities in Iowa, which are now the quad cities, I believe. And they became the tri city Blackhawks. Then they may move to Milwaukee in 1951 and became the Milwaukee Hawks. Then in 1955 they moved to St Louis and became the Saint Louis Hawks. And then in 1968 they moved to uh, Atlanta and became the Atlanta Hawks. And they'd been there for 50 years, but they've moved five times. And I always thought the Sacramento Kings, which I can't remember if they were the Cincinnati royals and then the Kansas City kings and then the Sacramento Kings, I couldn't remember. Hang on a second. Let me get to this, cause I got, I got this fucking website here that has all the franchises that moved. If I can get it to work here, please, please. As people listening national hockey league, what the fuck is the NBA? Ah, Jesus Christ, come on National Basketball Association, the Tri City Hawks, Blackhawks play their home games in Moline. And Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa moved to Milwaukee, became the hawks. Then in 55 they moved to St Louis. Okay. And then the Detroit Pistons where Fort Wayne Pistons until 1957 Rochester royals moved to Cincinnati. And then where the fuck did they go from there?

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:58       cause this goes year by year, so I'll, they became the Sacramento Kings. Yeah, they were the rot Rochester's Seagram's. What the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       Anyways, Rob Chester pros and they became the Rochester's royals. Then they moved to Cincinnati royals, Kansas City slash all Mohawk kings, Kansas City Kings, Sacramento Kings. And then I think the Syracuse team moved to San Diego and became the San Diego Clippers. Where the fuck is it? The Syracuse nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76 is, okay, so who became the La Clippers? The San Diego Clippers?

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       Oh, the buffalo Braves moved to San Diego and became the clippers. That's what it is. Oh No, it's the Rochester was, I don't know. I'm a fucking nerd. I love that shit. Then I go online and see if I can find a tri cities black hawks tee shirt. Like they ever fucking sold one of those. I bet it's a minor league hockey team now. Tri City. Come on, come on bill. You can write it. Black Hawks tee shirt. Here we go. Somebody makes it, you know somebody makes it. Mitchell and ness. Chicago Blackhawks, Tri city, black hawks. There it is. Everyone would like myself would think, oh, is that where the Chicago Blackhawks first played? And they'd be like, oh no, no, no. That's not, that's not the case. All dead.

Speaker 7:          00:22:30       Leave me alone.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       MMM. Yeah. They've got the, they've got the dude. He's just see them all the fucking kid. If they got it wearing, it was like 21 fucking years old. Similar designs. Look at this. They got all the old ones here anyways. Trust the process. Yeah. Boy, I didn't want to know who the fuck said that. Um Oh, there's a cool Lebron one. Will they make his beard like the State of California? Do you realize if the Lakers don't win it this year, this'll be the first decade. They haven't won a fucking championships since the fucking 1960s seventies eighties nineties two thousands they went for decades in a row. Celtics won 50 60 seventies eighties no, it went for decades, right? It was seventies eighties nineties 2004 Oh yeah. No one's ever done five. No one's ever done five. Can you see, can you tell him? I'll fucking talked out from Rogan's podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       We did like fucking two and a half hours. I'm sitting here wondering what the hell to talk about it. Cause I can read some advertising. I could read some advertising. By the way, I'm not farting continually. I'm just sitting in a leather chair. I just realized that. Yeah, that leather chair, plush leather chair. One Chair, one chair, my little fucking podcast area here finally, cause now we have the kid. I can't do it the way I used to in the fucking bedroom and shit. Screaming and yell and we can't have that bill. We keep pill. We can't have you be who you are in your own home anymore. Butcher box. Everybody butcher box delivers.

And then they had those fucking women in the background. [inaudible] Papa, boom. You're telling me you couldn't write a fucking song back dead. I mean Jesus Christ. Maybe because it's so simple.

I don't like to repeat myself, at least not on purpose. What's going on? It's bill Burke.

Speaker 8:          00:41:18       It is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, uh, December 20th. Oh my God. Only five more days till Christmas. I only have half. Shut up. You fucking all right. I'm not even this angry week. I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to situate myself on the bed. I don't want to put my laptop in my lap. You know what I mean? Why would you, why won't you put it in your lap? It's cool. The little dude. Um, this is why, because it gives off radiation and I like my balls. I think the Illuminati came up with the laptop, you know, and they know we're too stupid to stick at exactly where they want us to put it so they can fin out the fucking heard. So they go, you know, with their evil voices. Why don't we just, it the laptop, we call it, they let up days, put it in their lap and they fucking die.

Speaker 8:          00:42:09       The infidels, that was half Arab, half Italian. So make sure I get notes from both of you. Um, yes it is December 20th. I just came off of a fabulous week out in Bray, California and I want to tell you guys something. If you're ever in a situation where you have a lot of vacation time and you're just like, fuck, where the hell can I go? You know, you only go around once in this world, where can I go to vacation to summer does not what rich people say. We live in the city and we summer out in the Hamptons. I'd love to summer somewhere when that'd be awesome. Jesus Christ. How much fucking money do you have to have? They have two homes. This is where I live during the year. And then I summer, we spooned no linters done and boom. Bhutto's know doing what? Visiting the fucking money that you're not paying taxes, taxes on.

Speaker 8:          00:43:09       You know, I don't give a fuck. I didn't know what I'm talking about here. I was onto something there and then I completely lost it because I thought I wasn't recording here. Um, oh, I know. I was out in Bray California this weekend and I got to tell you, I had a miserable experience the last couple of times I went there and the only reason why I was miserable is because nobody showed up. And Lo and behold, this time I came out there and the fucking place was packed all weekend and I had one of the best weekends of, uh, of 2010. So I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows, uh, out at the Improv in Bray California. Actually had some people from La came out and a, I had like 12, uh, Mexicans, different Mexican fans coming up saying you have some Latino fence.

Speaker 8:          00:43:57       Okay, hang in there. We will spread the word out to Ontario. So I want to thank you guys. Grassy us. It's the only word I know. Mucho. Grassiness Rosetta stone. I'm a Rio. Ah, thank you very much. And yellow. That's my only Spanish words. I caramba. Yeah, Shit like that, that I've seen in like cartoons when I was a kid. Um, so anyways, I don't know what the fuck did talk about this week because a, I am technically, I'm on vacation. Like Axel Foley had Beverly Hills Cop. I'm not investigating anything. I'm out here in La with my Mumford fucking sweatshirt. You know what I realized? I just realized this podcast is going to suck. You know why I have too much other shit on my mind because a, as much as I'm mocking people who haven't started this shopping, I'm one of those people. I haven't started it yet.

Speaker 8:          00:44:52       And uh, it really fucked up because I did like six weekends in a row. So I just focused on the road work and I did not deal with the fact that I haven't done any sort of Christmas shopping yet. So now I have to go out there today. It's fucking raining. I bet in this weather since I went to Seattle right after Thanksgiving and I'm ready to blow my fucking brains out and went to Seattle and I also went to San Francisco and all those fucking assholes. We're just like, oh, you bring, you bring the bed where the with you? You know, I don't, I don't know. It was, it was great last week. So you know what, considering I bought the droid phone, does anybody know how to shut that off? Dry Aid every time you turn it on. My phone says that I brought the droid incredible and every time I turned it on, first of all it takes 10 minutes for it to turn on.

Speaker 8:          00:45:40       And then about, you know, eight minutes in it goes dried and I don't think there's a way to shut it off. That's one of those fucking advertising things, make it look nice and loud and obnoxious. So everyone around we'll hear it and be like, Ooh, I want my phone to do that. All right. I'm still waiting for that. Like I hope that phone does not take over as much as I love it cause uh, I fly too much, you know, and at the end of the flights when it's okay to turn your cell phones back on, I don't want to hear like draw, draw, draw, draw void on the fucking plane, put, you know, I'm going to, um, but anyways, yeah, I haven't, I haven't started in my Christmas shopping and uh, I don't want to be that Douche just goes out and gets the gift certificates. You know that, you know that person, you go out, you buy him something thoughtful. What are they into? A, what did I hear a mentioned that they wanted or something like that. And you put a lot of thought and you drive around now that isn't right. Drive over here that isn't right. Bam. And then you find it and they're like, aw man, thanks a lot. Right.

Speaker 8:          00:46:46       And they give you like a fucking, yeah, he waiting to see what they got you right. Do you put some thought in? Do you feel this way about me too? And what do they do? They hand you a gift certificate to the fucking olive garden. You know, it's like you fucking asshole. You know, I drove all over fucking town and you just, you just, and not even a good restaurant. That's an, that's another thing too. Um, if somebody gives you a gift certificate to a restaurant, don't fucking go. Don't even fucking go. All right. What sort of respectable restaurant gives out gift certificates? You know what I mean? That's, that's just like one step above fast food. You know what Douche bag of the week is? Anybody who goes out and does Christmas shopping, it just gets a bunch of fucking gift certificates. Hey, you go, you fucking figure out what you want is some money.

Speaker 8:          00:47:39       Why don't you just come in and take a fucking handful of cash and throw it on the floor, like have some goddamn whore and watched me crawl around on my hands and knees picking it up. You know, like I just gave you a bad lap dance, but you got enough money to not bitch to management a, you'll have the really, that's what I get is you have fucking hundred. Don't spend it all in one place. All right? You fucking cheap bastards. I'm talking to you and you and you just gotta be at least three people on this podcast that do that shit. He fucking tight Fox. Right? And then what do you do? You gather up all your nice gifts that people put thought into and you just, you know, walk out of the house. You know, you don't give a fuck, right? Fuck it.

Speaker 8:          00:48:26       Right. It's just the drinking water. We can pour the shit in there. Well that kept me the corner office. I swear to God, if somebody gets me a fucking gift certificate this weekend, I'm going to do some of the not, this is Christmas this weekend. Five days away. Yeah. Be Saturday. I'm going to take that fucking thing. Oh, thanks a lot. And I'm going to slice their juggler like James Bond level, fucking paper cut and just watch that blood right off the side of their fucking neck. All right, so you learned something about me. You already knew I was an angry son of a bitch, but I hate give certificates. I can't stand them. I would rather get an ugly sweater from an older relative than dent than a fucking gift certificate. That's just so you know he did. That's just the fucking tap out. You know shorty, man, it'd be really busy. Oh really? Oh, I've been laying in a hammock all year. You Lazy. Fuck. Now you don't give a shit.

Speaker 8:          00:49:28       Why am I such a fucking Dick? Somebody I knew every year would get me a fucking gift certificate and you know, I should have just gave it right back to him. I never did. I always gave him a nice gift thing. Can I, you're gonna you're going to notice, right? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, we shit. All right. There you go. This your first rent for the week. Did that make you feel better? I'd like to hit. Why? Why don't I have a, why don't I have a podcast where I give thanks. I give thanks to everyone who came out to my shows this year. You know, I give thanks to the universe for allowing me to fuck up enough in my personal life to bless me with an a new hour of material. I've got to tell you, man, my fucking act is right where I needed to be. And uh, my next Gig is an until, uh, the weekend, I believe of January 13th.

Speaker 8:          00:50:21       Um, I'm going to be in Atlantic city with a, this is the show. Jim Norton put this thing together. It's Norton, myself, Jim Breuer and David tell all on one show. All right. The Miami Heat, the Mount Rushmore, if you will, of a stand of a standup comedy. I can't see Mount Rushmore. That'd be all time greats. Let's go with Miami Heat. All right, let's go with that. How about we say that? So anyways, that's my next show. So they have this weird thing where I'm off for like a month, but I also have to stay sharp. So my girls all excited that I have a month off and I'm actually doing a show tonight and I was trying to tell her that I, I have to stay sharp, you know, I've got to stay on my toes. I can't just sit around fucking roasted chestnuts. Does anybody do that anymore than anybody ever had a chestnut?

Speaker 8:          00:51:14       Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your news. There's no internet or fucking cell phones, so we have to talk to one another. Um, all right. What, you know, something, something I mentioned, they're actually tied into something that somebody was talking about. Oh, they, you're talking about die hard fans. I'm talking about sports here. Somebody said a bill, just like the Yankees, the Celtics purchased the last championship with Kevin Garnett. I love, and people do half ass research. You know, didn't you forget a couple of other guys that we also bought? Um, it's not, it's not even the purchasing of Garnette that bothers me. It's the delusion Boston's fans have when they cheer for Garnette, that mother fucker kissed the Shamrock in the center of the court. Like it was his homecoming, like he was from Boston. Like he yearned for playing for that team at Boston's fans ate that shit up.

Speaker 8:          00:52:13       Totally bought into that shit. Uh, when in actuality it was just another purchase for a championship. How do you feel knowing your fellow Bostonians got duped? Uh, the bullshit fan base I see in Boston makes me want to puke in my soup. And it happens in a bunch of other cities to, uh, sorry, I, I can't read out loud and I'm also reading this at a fucking angle. Let's get some fucking stomach cancer here. Put the laptop here. Uh, where was, where was I? Uh, you have die hard fans for all your teams, but they're few and far in between few and far between servers. How you say that? Uh, then you have just a bunch of stragglers who suddenly come out of the woodwork when their teams on top. I live in New York and now in La, in the past eight years I've noticed an influx influx of pats, fans and both of those cities.

Speaker 8:          00:53:01       All of a sudden everyone is proud to be a patriots fan. Uh, where were these fucks in the 90s? Same goes for Laker fans. Where will those assholes with the flag on the car asked, uh, with the flag and the car assholes in the 90s. Explained this to me, Bill and go ahead and shit on as many front running New Yorkers, Los Angelenos in Miami, schmucks all you're like, yeah. Yeah. Dude. You're basically explaining, uh, yeah, that's how it works. Yeah. Where were all the Yankee fans in the 80s? Exactly. You can't say where were all the patriots fans in the 90s. Because once we got bill Parcells, everybody jumped on board. And then when Pete Carroll came in after parcels fucked us that fat fuck that fat fuck Egomaniac who never won a championship without bill Belicheck is his defensive coordinator who you will need to cook to do, do groceries.

Speaker 8:          00:53:55       He says that right before our Superbowl puts his fucking house up for sale. What a cunt fucking were overrated bill Parcells if you want your uniforms changed and you want to make it to the playoffs, he's your guy. But if you want to win the super bowl you got, you better have bill Belicheck on your staff. All right. Yeah, I, yeah, Your Bandwagon Fence Bandwagon fans are, are uh, the majority of the fan base. There's no reason to build stadiums as big as they are. If they're actually talking about die hard fans, you'd only need like a one level, you know, you could have those old school like high school stadiums, you know, with a wind whip through the end zones. Uh, yeah, absolutely. That everybody is guilty of that. And, um, basketball, I hate to say it has followed what the, uh, what baseball has been doing, where you just sort of try to buy the, buy the championship every year and it's really a free agency. I guess it's kind of the player's fault. You know what it was, it was an overcorrection. It was before free agency, you know, the owners were like the owner in, um, what does that call the perfect stallion? What the fuck's that? I can never mean Robert Redford movie, the natural perfect stallion. How the fuck did I get?

Speaker 8:          00:55:14       I can't remember. Shit. I can never remember the names of actors, a movie. So I just, whatever I, first thing I think of, I just fucking throw it out there. Uh, the natural, yeah, the owners were like that. They totally fucking owned you. And um, that's why the fucking white sox through the world series in 1919, that's what opened the door to that is they were getting so underpaid and they were scumbag pieces of shit. Those two fucking things. Um, so then [inaudible] free agency came around and now there's been like a total overcorrection. Um, and the players are toe seem to be completely in control and they can just all pile on one fucking team. I don't know. I don't like it. I don't like it. Yeah. The Celtics bought the championship apps a Fuckin lutely uh, but you know, it's one of those deals.

Speaker 8:          00:56:00       What are they supposed to do? That's what the Lakers were buying them too. You know, what are we supposed to do? Sit back and watch them by all these fucking championships and we're not supposed to go out and purchase one. You know, Coby, Brian's sitting out there can't win shit. So they buy him Shaq and Phil Jackson. Fucking Gary Payton, Robert Henri fucking Karl Malone. Who else? I don't watch hoop. Every time I turn it on, there's another fucking guy, the guy who beat up the crowd, Ron Artest, that guy. What a, what the fuck are the Celtics supposed to do? You know, it'd be nice if they all sat down and just said, look, this is fucking stupid. Let's go back to the way it was. But I just think that that's the way it is. So anyways, yeah, they just pile on. I think Garnette kiss the floor because he was sick of playing in Minnesota and he knew he finally had a chance to, uh, to win a championship after being the fucking guy for all those years out there in Minnesota and, and always coming up short.

Speaker 8:          00:57:03       So I dunno, I don't fucking, I don't know. I don't know shit about basketball, but yeah, you're basically, yeah. Diehard fans, diehard fans hanging in there. But uh, I even think die hard fans are full of shit. There's a couple that will actually sit there. Come on man. You gotta be honest with you. I'm a die hard fan. Your team is going to, and 14, you're actually sitting down watching that shit. You know, sometimes you're such a die hard fan. You can't go, you can't watch, you know, I didn't watch the Celtics. I went to a Celtics game the year before. We bought all those guys to win a championship. We played the Toronto Raptors. I had like court side fucking seats and I almost fell asleep and it was just sad looking at the parquet floor and looking at the shamrock and just seeing it was, it was, you know, it was hard to watch.

Speaker 8:          00:57:51       That doesn't mean I don't love the Celtics, but you know, sometimes you got to look away and you know what, you fucking cunt, you do the same thing. Stop acting like you're all high and mighty. You just hate the Patriots and you're sick of seeing them. Be honest with yourself. All you sports fans, who the fuck ever saw anybody in a sports bar with the New Orleans Saints Jersey on ever 30 years of watching football? I never fucking saw it. And then last year there's like a whole gang of them going, who dat? Who Dat? Who Dat take? They gonna beat them saints. It's like, where the fuck did you guys come from? The states were borderline. They will like an expansion franchise for like 40 years. They couldn't even afford a kicker with two whole feet. They had a kicker with one and a half fucking feet. That's, that's, that's how fucking broke those guys were, you know, then they brought that football out there with the helium in there so they could have a feel good story.

Speaker 8:          00:58:56       Oh by the way, um, did you see how the jets, when they got busted for cheating, that fucking fag on the jets go? Who to patriots are doing it to that right there is known as a pulling a Cobie. When you do that shit that's called the shack fucks around on his wife too. You know when you're down at the police dude, you don't ever do that. All right. When you get busted for some shit, you go into mister blonde mode, you shut your fucking mouth and you do your God damn time. You don't start dragging other people. And it was so passive aggressive. I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble. I'm just, you know, if you just look at the tape, I mean it's all there, which was such a stupid, there's no rule against lining up people there. You can stand on the sideline, you can all stand there doing handstands if you want.

Speaker 8:          00:59:50       That's not what he got busted for your green cunt. He got busted for sticking your fucking knee out evidently on purpose. How wrong was, I tried to be nice last week and I defended that Douche and it turns out, uh, I dunno. I like how they tried to act like that was his decision and his decision alone. That guy actually, he shut that guy. The strength and conditioning coach. That is a solid guy cause he just, he took, he took the blame for that one. The strength and conditioning coach. He the only guy, he's these the guy like as far as moneymakers, he's just above a fucking cheerleader and he's saying like, he's on the sideline. Hey listen guys, everybody fucking line up the private over there. They're blaming the private, you know, give me a fucking break. But I think sticking his knee out was definitely his decision.

Speaker 8:          01:00:43       But as far as lining up on, on, on the side, I don't give a fuck. So I love it. So the jets cheated and this week the panthers had somebody get up and drill, drill, someone coming down the sidelines. See this is what it's all coming out. I love it. After all these years of people saying the patriots are cheaters, like no one else is doing it. Like the Yankees weren't all taken fucking roids [inaudible] along with the fucking reds. Everybody cheats. Do you guys watch that? 30 for 30 on Smu and how the entire southwest conference football was played.

Speaker 8:          01:01:16       I hate to say it during the week of Christmas, but there's no Santa Claus. Everybody fucking cheats. Everybody Cheats Booboo, booboo. What song is that? Remember that from fucking sesame street. Everybody sleeps and they'd show like turtles sleeping and you sit there almost tearing up, not even knowing what the fuck you were crying about. You know, cause you're already knew it. You could sense it even as a six year old that the world was going to be full of a bunch of selfish cons. Hey, you know something? I have a video for you this week. How many fucking agonizing minutes am I into this podcast? 22 fucking minutes. Jesus Christ. I gotta be honest with you people sometimes this podcast is easy and other times I feel like I'm shoveling what? Snow. And uh, this is one of these times I feel like I'm shoveling wet fucking snow. Uh, I'm sick of talking about football.

Speaker 8:          01:02:06       I can't talk about it any fucking more. Uh, thank you to Green Bay, Wisconsin though I do want to say thank you for that Christmas gift for allowing us to win that game that we shouldn't have one yesterday and a, do you guys realize, actually bet the Patriots after telling you guys all if given 14 and a half fucking points I bought into the hype. You know what a moron all year. I've been saying, I hate our fucking difference. Our defense lifts up 24 to 30 points every fucking game. We have two good weeks in a row. I even said last week on the podcast, you think I'm buying into this shit. Like we're going to win a super bowl. You don't just play two good games in a row and fucking wipe out 11 bad ones. And after saying all of that, what do I do? I fucking bet the Patriots because they're fucking quarterback was out.

Speaker 8:          01:02:54       And I'm a fan of Lsu. I don't ever remember that guy fucking doing anything. You know what it was that guy played at Lsu right before it started watching college football. But my experience of watching Lsu is they have fucking, ah, they always have two quarterbacks, a white dude and a black dude. And they cheered. They just Sorta, I don't know what they'd do. They just a a, they just switch them off and it's not the same guys every, every fucking year. They got a new white dude, new black dude, and they just, uh, put the white guy in there, Dan. He's too fucking white. Look it up. Take a net sec sick. The black guy in there, Jesus Christ. He won't stand in a pocket. Get the white guy back in there. I'll tell you if they could somehow Amalga just stick those two guys together. Add it probably wouldn't work. I know it worked for Paul Mccartney and Michael Jackson when they sang that fucking song. Was that one of the worst songs ever? Wait a minute. Was that him? Who Sang Ebony and ivory. That was them. Right. I was thinking of Eddie Murphy and he made it Stevie wonder and Frank Sinatra. That was the sketch. Yeah. Was that one of the worst fucking songs ever? Ebony and a Boobie. Somebody looked at the piano and just came up with that corn bullshit. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, we all want everybody to get along, but do you have to try to make us throw up in the process?

Speaker 8:          01:04:24       Okay. Why is happy shit so nauseated? Can anybody explain that to me during the week of fucking Christmas, you know? Yeah. What is it about watching like a kid trip and fall and start crying and then looking for his mother? What is it about that that's so fucking funny. Yeah. You know when they get up and they're crying so bad that they're not even making any noise.

Speaker 10:         01:04:51       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:04:52       Yeah. It just fucking makes me laugh. You know, watching my dog gets so excited that it wants to go outside and it, and it goes to make it quick, you know, fucking Barry Sanders cut and its legs front legs go up from underneath them and I hear him hit his jaw off the floor.

Speaker 8:          01:05:11       Yes. Okay. Gets up and fucking does that Little Harlem shake to try to, it's just fucking funny. I don't know what it is. Maybe because I grew up watching the three stooges. I Dunno why, but watching, uh, watching people fuck up makes me smile. What is wrong with me? I really am destined to be alone. Um, all right, speaking of Christmas, um, last week I made the mistake of, I told you I bought a different kind of Christmas tree for the holiday season. Whoop de Doo be Doo. Um, I don't know, the past couple of years just to, just to, you know, for, for new listeners this week, you know, I don't know what happened. I just, I had last couple of years, I went there and I looked at these Christmas trees and they would like, they will like symmetrical and there would be like, you know, six inches of tree trunk and then they'd have like these perfectly level branches.

Speaker 8:          01:06:04       I just thought they look bad ass like that Japanese garden sort of Zen look and shit. And I loved it and I thought that, you know, I thought, you know, I knew I was going to get shit, but I thought at least a couple of people would come out of the woodwork and dare to break free fucking tradition. Let's read some of these uh, these uplifting comments here. A bill, this guy tried to write day Yom and he spelled damn yum. D a m Y U M Damn Yum bill. That is Charlie Brown's tree. Looks more like an anorexic low hand than Thurone. All Right, Nice Tree Dick. You see, this is what it's like. You guys want to get into entertainment. This is what you get all week. This is pretty much the tone every once in a while. Hey, great special. I loved it. But other than that, that tree makes the peanuts crew look like ballers.

Speaker 8:          01:07:00       I would rather decorate my coat rack then that Skank Shrub, Jesus Christ. Somebody wrote this as the soundtrack to that tree. I don't get Internet in this fucking room for some reason, so I can't click on that. Uh, it looks like a used up toilet brush. Uh, it looks like the tree, the tree, the three stooges would have thrown another picture up when you throw the lights on it. Oh, look at that. And I liked that one. That's a twofer. Made Fun of the fucking tree and made fun of my bare walls. Um, yeah. People, you've got a glimpse of how I live my life. This is why I'm debt free. I enjoy in your credit card debt. You can't, I know how to live.

Speaker 8:          01:07:44       I buy a Christmas tree. I can actually afford. All right. Uh, yeah, you probably should have got the other tree. What are you a fag? I like it. I wanted a Charlie Brown tree. I was going to buy a real tree and cut off half the branches. So it was like Charlie Brown tree. And my girl went out and bought one of herself so she could say it's hers and I can't cut it up. Okay. It's like I was kind of like kind of on my side. So what does that 20 against one for me? Looks like a cell phone tower in disguise.

Speaker 8:          01:08:17       Jesus. I'm getting killed here. All right. Uh, let me see something. Everybody's just going, Charlie Brown on me here. What do we to do? What? I was genuinely excited to see your tree. Where did you pick it out? What'd you pick it out? Champ. Fucking Afghanistan. And actually looks like something that would grow out of the soil in Hiroshima now. Seriously, I'm Grad. Glad you're going out of the ordinary with the tree this year. Good. Good for you. But I had no idea trees could get hepatitis. Merry Christmas. Oh look who's here. Nia. Everybody is agreeing with you. You want to come on the podcast? Wait a second, let me, uh, let me get your mic up here. Here you go. Hi. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Let me make sure you read. Go ahead, talk it. Merry Christmas, everybody. There you go. Talk a little more. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:09:08       Happy holidays. All right. Um, would you like to hear some of these comments? They all agree with you about the tree, about the tree of the holiday season. Boy, uh, maybe I should have known what to expect when you scribed the tree, but I didn't expect that. No offense, but that just looks awful, man. I have to admit that that one hurts more than people who, somebody said it looked like a cell phone tower. Like those ones are actually funny. This guy that, that was, that one came from the heart. That will really was, uh, well I'm a fucking termite and even I wouldn't take a shit on that fucked up tree. Jesus.

Speaker 8:          01:09:48       Wow. Sweet tree. Not Oh, lame. Yeah. No, you know what that is? That's like from a fucking anthrax fan who's like fucking 48 now and has three kids. That's from like a Wayne's world. Then they always used to say that not the first time I saw not was anthrax. That guy had it shaved into his chest. The word, not an OT. Yeah. The guy who then eventually shaved his head. You know those guys who go bald or always like Harry, like apes, the guy, uh, the guy who was on that VH one show where they had the super group. Oh, uh, yeah. And he had the long beard. Yeah, the long beard. Shaved head. But just along the long beard. Yeah, I know who you're talking about. I forget what his name is. I remember when I shaved my head because I'm losing my hair and you love me.

Speaker 8:          01:10:31       Maybe you should fucking a up that you love the shape. Love it when you had the shaved head. I say bring it back. Well, I think nature is going to bring it back for [inaudible], but well, it's good to know that you still look good. Well, you know, I can't do that. Fuck it. Rogaine, Propecia shit. I just can't, I, I just know it. I know how it works in life. You don't get your cake and eat it. Nature's going to get you. Oh, you want to keep your fucking hair. Okay. Why don't we just fucking take a shot to your goddamn liver. Those people are going to lose their livers. You know, they're full heads of hair. What did I walk into? And I were talking about the tree. The anorexic tree. Yes. So have you done any Christmas shopping? Let's do quick little interview.

Speaker 8:          01:11:11       Uh, get the people all caught up with you. Have you, uh, look at that tree. I think that tree looks fucking cool as hell. It's not the Charlie Brown tree. You have fucking asshole. Wait a minute. You had to symmetrical Charlie Brown tree was all brown. Call you guys. Well, you have to take a picture of the tree. Now that it's decorated though. What? I think there's a debate. It looks like a fucking fucking Broadway singer with aids because it's all glitter and skinny. What a lot of them died of that. They do. They do dress flashy. You need to stop with, well, I'm not saying that. I agree with that. I'm saying that that's what they would write. That's your out for everything offensive. They, I'm not saying I agree with it. It's just how it is. Fucking dirt bag. Oh, I saw that movie in the band played on, right.

Speaker 8:          01:11:59       I, I don't want [inaudible] guys, friends. I don't mind any guys drive driving garbage trucks holding their other garbage truck boyfriend rocking them slowly. It's not only gay people who can, I know it's that. It's that and truck drivers. That's not what it was. Let's move on. It's Christmas. Huh? I know it is now. Let's talk about aids and let's talk. Let's not play now. Come on. This is fucking hilarious. I never saw me. It was a long time ago. I don't know. How did the song go? I don't know. There was a song. Yeah, I got in the bed. Eat often happen. Where are you asking me about Christmas shopping? Wasn't it about San Francisco? Isn't that where they basically don't know Harvey milk came in and then that other guy shot him in the head or is that a different milk? It was milk. Oh, you want to Sean Penn.

Speaker 8:          01:12:47       Can I show you the most? I can't even, I won't even show this to you because I love you too much. Somebody sent me a youtube video. You guys have to fuck never stopped you. Huh? Showing me horrific. This is why you don't get affection. I try to be, I try to give it to you and you slap it down. Look at that. What? Let me, what do I got to replay? What just happened there? I said I'd love to show this to you and, but it hurts you to, uh, you know, I'd love you to whatever the fuck. Nice thing I just said. He don't even remember any of it's two seconds ago, but I meant it. All right. There's a movie called Feast. This is going to be on the Mlm podcast where you guys feel free to go on there and trashed my fucking Christmas tree.

Speaker 8:          01:13:26       I like it. I'm sticking by, you know what this is like, this is like the new kid who comes to school and you guys all pick on him and I prefer friend him cause I'm stronger. I can step outside the group. Look at me. I'm the hero. It's just a tree and I'll fuck you. All right. There's a movie, there's a movie called a feast. Yeah. Have you ever heard of that movie? Okay. I don't know what's going on. I can't, I don't want to, oh, that's my phone. What is your cell phone sound like? The tornado drill from the 50. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:13:59       cause you notice there's no, there's no good ring tones. You know what I've got? Go, go get the a, you know what? I'll let my podcast listeners decide them. Ringtone. Go grab my phone if you don't mind. All right. All right. Now I'm going to describe this fucking thing where you're, okay, there's this, this, this movie out there. Feast that I, I have to rent. I don't know what's going on, but there is a woman tied down and this beast that looks like a little person that was a skinned alive basically comes out of nowhere. And Fox, this woman in the mouth and finishes there. I set it, I set it and it happened so fast. I didn't even think that it was real. And uh, I don't know. That's when I have to ask. It's like, you're not really trying to scare me. You're just trying to either gross me out or make me fucking laugh, but if you really want to get grossed out, um, here's another youtube video of the week. Somebody sent one in. I only got like two minutes into this thing and I had to shut it off. Human cryogenics. All right, so if you guys, you know, isn't that funny? I told her to go pick up my phone. She goes and answers it and now he's talking to the person, you know, what would you broads be doing if you weren't running your fucking yaps? You know, I, it's like I don't understand it. They just, it just have to be talking.

Speaker 8:          01:15:25       All right, whatever. So human cryogenics, red sox fans, we're all familiar with that. You know what I mean? Ted Williams head, I believe is upside down sitting on a tuna can and they accidentally broke his nose. I'm talking about Ted Williams. They froze. Do you believe in a pick up the microphone. Oh God. You're going to be eating on the podcast. You know, I think this is good that you're on the podcast. It's, it's, you know, it's the holidays. It should. It should be family April. I don't like it. Then some people, some people don't like my Christmas tree. Look, first of all the Internet is like a, you know like when you hang up those lights to track bugs, Zap them. That's what the Internet is for. Cuts, you know what I mean? They, yeah, they just gravitate towards it. All these miserable fucks who have all the power in the world to change their life and live the wonderful life that we're living on this fucking bed without a headboard.

Speaker 8:          01:16:21       I've been trying, you know somebody's trash just because we don't have, we don't have any pictures on the wall. I'm trying to teach people how to live a minimalist debt free life. First of all, we don't need pictures on the wall. We have our picture on the wall that bill hates. We have the live of pictures just getting way too fucking intimate, but women. But we have a picture above the fucking bed of it. Looks like. I thought you've talked about this poetry. Have I talked about it? All right, well I already brought it up. Yeah. It's like every time I look up, there's another deer, can't see it, and it's staring right into the fucking Lens. It's not black and white. It's not in color. It's Sorta in that Blair witch look. It's kind of a Sepia tone. I fucking hate it. And you know something.

Speaker 8:          01:17:02       I know you hate him yet. And I, whoa. I almost fell in between the Tutsis. We need a headboard. Homeless just fell off the back of the bed. But personally I'd like to point out the fact that you went out and just bought that fucking photo. Yep, I did. And hung it. Right. Look at that. And you just hung it right over the bed. How can we didn't ask me about it? I don't know. I just thought it would be nice. Really. What if I get a poster? A fucking Larry Bird. He played for the Celtics and he used to do this thing where he would always wipe the sweat off the side of his feet. So I'm going to get that. So it looks like one of his fucking blonde balls is going to fall out shorts. And I'm going to hang that over the bed.

Speaker 8:          01:17:38       I don't want to see how fucking long that lasts. Um, I just want to say that we have a mantle and there's pictures all over the mantle of all of our annual something that, those are the pictures we have. You know what this is. This is hilarious how innocent you are with the Internet. What do you mean you don't defend your position? All you do doing now is prolonging the arguments. So now they'll do like really do, why don't you put a picture up of him if you have them? Cause they just want more material to trash you. But they haven't even seen her apartment. Who are they to say anything? Exactly. I'm, I'm not, I'm just saying what you're doing is, it's like with someone trashes you [inaudible] fucking white. You're legs are, I know. It's great. I just take them out in a job interview when I get it.

Speaker 8:          01:18:21       So he know. You just agree. Absolutely. Whatever. Yeah, I'm horrible. I look like a puppet. Absolutely. You're 100% and it kills it. That's what Madonna's done. You're a fucking whore. I know you want to see my [inaudible] check out my new book. I got it all over there. I got a close up. Didn't she take an in that book? She took a close up of her fucking hoo ha. I don't think so. Yeah, she did. I think she was fully knew but then there wasn't a closeout I that wasn't that book. No. The sex book book book was that, I don't know. I don't think there is with the little red wagon.

Speaker 8:          01:18:55       What was the last book that I read? Actually that that book was, uh, my, I think was my favorite work by Madonna and I thought it was their most honest work. You know who's standing out there on the street looking like a fucking prostitute. Exactly. Exactly. She looked good. She looked phenomenal. She looked really good. I still bang that fucking cougar. Huh? You know what I hate? You know what I love is that she's gotten all their varicose veins. Fucking that's what I was just going to talk about that, cause she's, everyone always talks about her arms are so veiny. It's so gross. But you know what? Madonna works out everyday and that's blood pumping through those veins. You can see life. That's what those veins are. Oh, it's very inspirational. Yeah. Doesn't look aesthetic though. She knows. She's like, she's like somebody who, you know, she's no, you know what she's like, she's like Clint Eastwood in that movie.

Speaker 8:          01:19:43       Gran Torino. Torino. Yeah. I'd never been named that car. The grant and that grant from Eda duty year to your impression of that. Oh, I forget to get off my lawn. Is that, was it wanted? I can't remember. I didn't like that. Yeah. But then I would say all racist ship, which people won't get that. I'm making fun of the movie and I'll think I believe it. Well that's what, that's what he did in the movie. He was racist in any way around. But anyway. Oh yeah. Cause it's a Hollywood wow. Because it's a holiday movie. Listen. Yes. Grand Torino that, that's, that's how she's treated like the way he treated that car. That's way she's treating her body. Her body is like in fucking mint condition. It is, you know, and all the rest of us. What did we do? We fucking back into a car at a worry about it. Slammed into a tree.

Speaker 8:          01:20:28       That's how we treat our bodies. Damon doesn't settle for second. Yeah, she's out there waxing it. She's the walking oil balls to the wall. Not the whole fucking old school shit this week. So, uh, yes. I did go Christmas shopping to answer your dude. Go Christmas shopping. I have a little bit. What did you get me? I'm not telling you what the surprise you'll find out on me. A shirt.

Speaker 8:          01:23:36       His head is shredded. He's in great shape. I'm pleased CVDS are no fucking jets. So she sits there and she starts telling me how his DVDs are hard and all that. I was like, fuck that guy. I can do that God damn DVD. I'll be fine. Typical man. Right. And then what happens? I go to stretch before I do it because I'm 42 years old and you're like, oh, you don't need to stretch you as this whole stretching thing. And he fucking didn't and I ended up screwing up my foot again. They're stretching in the beginning. Yeah, that's bullshit. He didn't say he didn't do any stretches for your back. Nothing. Nothing to stretch out your feet. And then the guy has the fucking fucking jumping. I got Bill Walton feed at this point. I can't do that. God Damn Video Bill Walton. Bill Walton was a big fucking redhead who smoked weed and college and hung around John Wooden and then all he does is try to, like John Wooden was, was this amazing coach who gave you all this life advice and he's trying to be John Wooden junior always giving out advice, always telling those stories and he has his awful fucking voice.

Speaker 8:          01:24:36       That's like it comes from the center of his head and goes out as fucking broken nose. [inaudible] we didn't do good. Ugh, fucking red headed Frankenstein. Well, in the midst of that workout when there was all that stuff going on with the back, I was like, why don't you stop and just kind of do an alternate version of it and you wouldn't do it because you're a typical man and you have to see like I can do anything. You know what? I just love the, you say a typical man. Yeah, I lump us all in and then give me shit when I talk about all the broads. You've always done that. I always have done that and I don't have a problem with you saying that guys are hardheaded and goes, we are. We're fucking morons and you guys aside goes, you guys are psychos. All right.

Be Good to each other. Okay, now get your oatmeal and get out. Get Out. That's it near everybody. The lovely near coming in on the podcast once every fucking six weeks. Get out of here you go. And she's leaving. All right, there you go. So that's the podcast for this week. People. I know, it kind of sucked. I know some of it was Kinda nice spot on that said, oh, you know something of what I keep meaning to fucking talk about on this God damn podcast is I started, somebody sent me something, uh, about the fucking, what the hell did I do to my damn computer? Let it go. Let go of my fucking cord. Are you fucking kidding me? Get up.

Speaker 8:          01:34:09       Hang on a second. People fucking court is stuck in there. Whatever. People keep sending me this shit about. A one person did send me about the Liverpool soccer club in the premier league and evidently these American dudes bought it and said that they were going to buy a buy, a brand new stadium. They were going to do all this type of shit and they didn't do it. And somebody sent me this great video of all these English people from their heart's telling these American guys to fucking sell the Goddamn team and to fuck off. And it was awesome. And this is the same team that the owners of the red sox then went in and bought. And I started looking at the premiere league and like three or four the teams are owned by, uh, by Americans, specifically people from the United States. All right. Because we're all from North America up here.

Speaker 8:          01:35:03       Uh, and I, I can't believe how fucking annoying that would be. You don't have a bunch of English guys came over and bought my team and said that they were going to do a bunch of stuff when they fucked it up. I would be beyond pissed. Um, so I, I don't know. Sorry about that. England. I don't know why the fuck we did that. It's nice to know we're buying something considered gyp. Japan's come over here and they, they fucking bought up everything over the last 20 years. Didn't they? Don't they own our roads? You know, what are you gonna do with them? Close them off. Do you have enough people to do that? I don't think you do. Um, so yes. Send me some more information on it. Cause I'd like to talk about the premier league and also I'm wondering in Ireland, is that a seven nation rugby league or whatever the fuck it is?

Speaker 8:          01:35:44       Is that starting up again? Cause I watched that last year in March when I went over there and uh, rugby is the shit and a unlike professional football, which they're just turning into the biggest pussy sport ever. Isn't it enough that we were, that they have to wear pink for the entire fucking month of October. You know, now you can't tackle people. The amount of quarterbacks out there that I get in like Joe Montana fucking stats because they're drive was kept alive because a defensive person had the audacity to tackle someone as, as just as fucking beyond me. And uh, I got nothing left people. I'm not going to lie to you. This podcast was fucking over before it started. I have too much shit I have to do. All right. I remember the first year I did this podcast, I actually took two weeks off. I took two weeks off, so, you know, whatever it was dressed down fucking Monday.

Speaker 8:          01:36:36       I came in, I did what I could. All right. That's it. That's it for the, uh, for the podcast for this year. Everybody right now we've got one more for this year and next weeks. I promise you, I promise you it will be just as bad as this one if not fucking worse. Cause I'm on vacation. I'm not required to make you laugh, but I want to thank everybody. Seriously. Everybody who came out to see, um, my shows this year, um, I had a great time and I actually, oh wait. Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I'm missing an underrated overrated. How the fuck could I do that? Underrated. Overrated this week real quick. Uh, overrated. Both the jets and the Patriots being a Dolphin Fan. Born and raised in Miami. I'm six at sick and tired of these two faggots. Teams dominating the AFC east for the past decade. While it's really been the patriots, it was very nice of you to throw the jets in there.

Speaker 8:          01:37:28       I think the jets have one like one, one division in the last fucking 10 years. Um, so I get it. Were overrated because your team sucks. Um, 80 you like how while the former Dolphin won the game for the jets yesterday. Have Bet you enjoyed that, huh? I hope you get a sunburn on your ass. You fucking cunt. All right. Underrated the bills. Being a dolphin fan. Born and raised in Miami, like you already said, I love the bills for always keeping the dolphins in the hunt for the playoffs every year for the past decade and a half. All right. That guy was just being a dick, so I have to respect that. Alright. Underrated. Michael Vick. He does sports announcer voice, uh, Michael Vick, Michael Vick. What are you, one of the things you have to understand about Michael Vick is Michael Vick, the MVC P of this season. Bob, because he's my MVP. He's making fun of me talking about how that's all they say.

Speaker 8:          01:38:15       Michael via. What can you say about Michael Vick? Well, well, Jim, Michael Vick, um, you know what? I have to admit I was fucking wrong about that guy. I was wrong, but I was also right. Okay. Because the same reason I fucking fell for it by the Patriots playing good defense for two weeks in a row and then actually gave up 14 and a half points ignoring the fact that they only played well for two fucking weeks in a row. You can't say that a guy's the best dude, the fucking lead. Cause he lights up the Redskins and fucking three weeks later John Chitana lights up the fucking Redskins. All right. But yesterday, what happened in that game? I mean that was unreal. I think he went back to old school, Michael Vick. He just started fucking running down the field like a God damn water bug. But uh, I was wrong about that guy.

Speaker 8:          01:39:00       Um, it's where it's been a, he can't say he's in, he's in like a League of his own as far as like what the fuck he's doing. Cause I've never seen anybody do that shit at his position. And I'd say that he's going to change the position, but I don't know that they'll any be ever be another person is talented. Is that fucking guy at that position? Um, I dunno. So anyways, he says, uh, Bill, sorry, you have to go through another week of that shit of everybody saying Michael Vick. But every time I hear them talk about fiqh after a big wing, no matter, no matter what I remember about your rant against the announcers, the announcers saying his name over and over again. Um, I say he's still underrated because he broke two NFL records in the last two weeks, but still can't get any solid respect.

Speaker 8:          01:39:44       Uh, I think he's getting his solid respect. The fact that there's, they're saying that he might be the MVP of the league and he's coming off an 18 month stint in Leavenworth for torturing dogs to death. You know what I mean? I definitely fought when someone plays the fucking race card. I always listened to it because I, you know, I traveled the road and I know what people are like having talked to them, it's just people are fucking, they're awful. The fucking awful. But this is the one time where it's like, dude, you know, you're tortured dogs to death. You drowned them, your shot him. I mean straight up, straight across the fucking board. You know, you can't expect people to 100% Embracia after you do some shit like that even though you more than paid the fucking price. But I'd rather be you than one of those fucking dogs.

Speaker 8:          01:40:36       So anyways, he said, I say underrated because he broke two NFL records in the last two weeks, but still can't get any solid respect. Honestly. As much as I hate Tom Brady, he is the real MVP so far. But people are still hesitant. I don't know who the real MVP is, but Tom Brady's having his best fucking year. Um, all right. This is a good one here. Yukon women's team, 88 win streak, overrated. The audacity of these media prints to compare the Yukon's woman's team to the UCLA team, by the way, which was cheating by the way, with how they got all their prospects. For all you people who trashed the Patriots and act like all you're fucking winning is because you're just such smart fucking human beings. It, I would, I'm not going to get involved and I'm not going to open that fucking can of worms, but John Wooden, uh, as my buddy said yesterday was the king of looking the other way when the boosters got involved.

Speaker 8:          01:41:32       Okay, let's leave it at that. All right. Of course, it's a major accomplishment, but as is typical with everything, male versus female related, people cannot put things into perspective when it comes to females. The woman's Yukon teams, 88 wins is in no way, shape or form as impressive as the UCLA teams. 88 whims wins. I'll put it to you like this. I used to play little league football and got MVP three times in a row and co MVP once, however Tom Brady has won the NFL MVP I think once or twice I have a longer MVP streaked and Tom Brady, but who's MVPs are more respectable and impressive. That's right. Mine. Just kidding. Of course his are, um, all right, I get that. But uh, do, but you're a guy and you could play in the NFL but you weren't good enough. So that's the difference I guess.

Speaker 8:          01:42:38       Um, as far as that, I would say that they're the Ucla, the Ucla of women's basketball. How about that? You got to say that because they are going up against the best females out there and they have one 88 in a row. So I would say it like that. But to compare to put it up there with Uclas. Yeah, the men's, I definitely think that's bullshit. That's just the classic, uh, you know, it's like them wearing pink in the NFL. It's just, did you just appeasing them? That's all the fuck you doing. You know? And I really just compare breast cancers to like appeasing somebody. I really should just stop talking, but I'm just going to keep going here. Um, yeah. As far as sports accomplishments go, I don't think females mean as much as men's just because we're better at it than you are.

Speaker 8:          01:43:24       You know, we just have better hand eye coordination. Just generally speaking, we're just better at, you know, the amount of guys that if you go, hey, think quick catch and you just throw them a stapler, they going to catch it. And the amount of women who would just take it off the face and have it landed in their cleavage, it's, you can't even compare it, you know, let's debate that next week. I don't think females are as good athletes as guys are. I just don't, I don't think they are. I don't think that they have that killer instinct. Yup. Unless they're there, they're chemically wired like a guy and they have as much testosterone. I don't think it's going to be a problem. I'm just saying this to Piss people off so I don't have to work hard next week. Uh, I think that's it. I do.

Speaker 8:          01:44:05       I've got some, uh, youtube videos, you know, if ever I was going to edit a fucking podcast, it should be fucking this one. This one is just Jesus, whatever. Last week's was great. This is what I am happy, you know, I mean, this is a let down week for me. All right, youtube, check this one out. This is one of the creepiest ones I've seen. And uh, it's called the liar card. This is a card you can put in your phone and for people, you know, so when you're, you're, if people are ducking your calls, that will show up as somebody else's phone call. You can disguise your voice to sound like a woman or a man. And uh, yeah, I guess you could find out where they are in case you know. I Dunno what, there's another good one. Our Danny Woodhead, you know, the fucking all pro for the fucking New England patriots.

Speaker 8:          01:44:51       Danny Woodhead as Modell's employee selling his own Reebok Jersey. He stands in a modal selling his own Jersey in New England and nobody recognizes him. Uh, now the youtube, would these all be up on the m podcasts are the cliff lease signing? Did Not make the boss happy. This is actually a total ripoff video of a video that a yes Canadiens fan made. Um, or someone who hated the Canadians a year ago. Uh, they just took this footage of somebody playing Hitler and a movie flipping out. Um, just know that it is a rip off, but it's funny, I guess. Uh, what else do I have here? I think that's it. Is that it? That is it. All right. All those videos will be up there. I apologize for the choppy podcast. They can all be great hour and five minutes. And by the way, there's some maniac out. They're transcribing my podcasts and Mark Marin's and I think Adam Carolla's. And uh, how about a round of applause for that fucking trooper actually sat down and was reading, I read like three minutes of my podcast. The guy gets like every fucking word, so, uh, God bless Ya. Okay. And uh, that is, if that's the podcast for this week, you guys all have a merry Christmas. Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Hanukkah, happy fuck the holidays. If that's how you are up

Speaker 9:          01:46:07       is all, have a good week, don't take any shit that's it and go fuck yourself. [inaudible].
