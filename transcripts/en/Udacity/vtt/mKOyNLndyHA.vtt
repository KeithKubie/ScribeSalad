00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.620
Now, you have quite a few cells in your body,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.140
several trillion to be exact. And all cells in your

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.050
body had to divide at some point in their lives,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.340
because cell division is part of the cell replication process,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.800
where one cell will actually end up dividing into two

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.710
daughter cells. And so, for us to understand how the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.870
DNA gets passed down to these daughter cells, we need

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.770
to understand a bit more about this whole process, in general.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.810
Now, we've learned already that every cell has

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.610
46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. Each chromosome

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.075
exists in a pair. And half that pair came from mom, and half that pair came from

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:41.860
dad. Let's say I'm heterozygous for the trait

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.700
of lactose metabolism. What this means is, I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.640
have one chromosome with a dominant allele for

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.890
lactase persistence and I have another chromosome with a

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.280
recessive allele for lactase non persistence. So these

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.130
means that this cell and every other cell in

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.270
my body is heterozygous. This means that every

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.140
cell has one copy of the dominant allele for

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.630
lactase persistence that has the ability to continue

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.210
lactase expression into adulthood. If we assume that there

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.270
is not any DNA duplication before cell division, how

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.030
many chromosomes would each of these daughter cells receive?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.580
And assume an even or equal division in this process, even though there's no

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.680
DNA duplication. Go ahead and put the number you think, in this box here.
