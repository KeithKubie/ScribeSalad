here to share the message around so when
I entered the workforce I in fact I was

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180
I entered the workforce I in fact I was
 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.170
I entered the workforce I in fact I was
an entrepreneur before I joined TCS so

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180
an entrepreneur before I joined TCS so
 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.300
an entrepreneur before I joined TCS so
when I entered the workforce the kind of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310
when I entered the workforce the kind of
 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.980
when I entered the workforce the kind of
things that were being talked about

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
things that were being talked about
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.030
things that were being talked about
where email having you know access to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040
where email having you know access to
 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.800
where email having you know access to
email itself was a great thing having

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
email itself was a great thing having
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.450
email itself was a great thing having
access to a computer to do something was

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
access to a computer to do something was
 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.440
access to a computer to do something was
even better and technology meant

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450
even better and technology meant
 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.030
even better and technology meant
something else in today's world

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
something else in today's world
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.800
something else in today's world
technology means something incredibly

technology means something incredibly
 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.780
technology means something incredibly
different right you think about what has

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790
different right you think about what has
 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.230
different right you think about what has
happened over the past two three decades

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240
happened over the past two three decades
 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.690
happened over the past two three decades
in terms of the proliferation of

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700
in terms of the proliferation of
 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.780
in terms of the proliferation of
Technology and also the rate at which it

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790
Technology and also the rate at which it
 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.800
Technology and also the rate at which it
has been adopted and commercialized for

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810
has been adopted and commercialized for
 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.280

the best of innovation and applied that
into social problems that they saw

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020
into social problems that they saw
 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.130
into social problems that they saw
around them but the future is here and

around them but the future is here and
 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.980
around them but the future is here and
now also because like I said these are

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
now also because like I said these are
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.750
now also because like I said these are
not buzzwords these are technologies

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760
not buzzwords these are technologies
 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.820
not buzzwords these are technologies
that are powering solutions within

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830
that are powering solutions within
 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.020
that are powering solutions within
enterprises within countries within

enterprises within countries within
 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.940
enterprises within countries within
and when I think about the resurgence of

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
and when I think about the resurgence of
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.730
and when I think about the resurgence of
a city like Pittsburgh you can certainly

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740
a city like Pittsburgh you can certainly
 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.760
a city like Pittsburgh you can certainly
say that a lot of this has to do with

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770
say that a lot of this has to do with
 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.580
say that a lot of this has to do with
the technology uplift that has happened

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590
the technology uplift that has happened
 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.030
the technology uplift that has happened
right so so the future is here and now

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040
right so so the future is here and now
 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.310
right so so the future is here and now
that's my first message to you and when

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320
that's my first message to you and when
 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.170
that's my first message to you and when
you think about the opportunities that

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180
you think about the opportunities that
 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.720
you think about the opportunities that
lie ahead there's tremendous

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730
lie ahead there's tremendous
 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.130
lie ahead there's tremendous
possibilities that are there for us to

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140
possibilities that are there for us to
 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.970
possibilities that are there for us to
really harness and utilize the potential

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980
really harness and utilize the potential
 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.210
really harness and utilize the potential
of so some of you will be familiar with

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220
of so some of you will be familiar with
 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.980
of so some of you will be familiar with
the concept of the fourth Industrial

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990
the concept of the fourth Industrial
 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.010
the concept of the fourth Industrial
Revolution and what that means and for

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020
Revolution and what that means and for
 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.190
Revolution and what that means and for
those who have heard of it but want to

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200
those who have heard of it but want to
 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.560
those who have heard of it but want to
understand more I have a short video to

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570
understand more I have a short video to
 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:51.870
understand more I have a short video to
play

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:51.880
 
 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.260
 
now okay that's fine I'll do a

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:56.270
now okay that's fine I'll do a
 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.990
now okay that's fine I'll do a
one-minute summary of that the fourth

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000
one-minute summary of that the fourth
 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.200
one-minute summary of that the fourth
Industrial Revolution is basically

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.210
Industrial Revolution is basically
 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.220
Industrial Revolution is basically
following the first three the first

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:03.230
following the first three the first
 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.960
following the first three the first
three many of you may be familiar with

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:04.970
three many of you may be familiar with
 

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.950
three many of you may be familiar with
but the use of steam to really drive a

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960
but the use of steam to really drive a
 

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.840
but the use of steam to really drive a
production and productivity was the

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:10.850
production and productivity was the
 

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.510
production and productivity was the
first Industrial Revolution the Second

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520
first Industrial Revolution the Second
 

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.340
first Industrial Revolution the Second
Industrial Revolution was the use of

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.350
Industrial Revolution was the use of
 

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.060
Industrial Revolution was the use of
electricity to commercialize and then

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.070
electricity to commercialize and then
 

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.770
electricity to commercialize and then
again increase productivity but bring in

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:20.780
again increase productivity but bring in
 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.670
again increase productivity but bring in
some mechanization and machine ization

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680
some mechanization and machine ization
 

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.680
some mechanization and machine ization
into society and the third Industrial

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:26.690
into society and the third Industrial
 

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.450
into society and the third Industrial
Revolution is all about computers and

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:28.460
Revolution is all about computers and
 

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.420
Revolution is all about computers and
information technology and the ability

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.430
information technology and the ability
 

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.100
information technology and the ability
of those technologies to then again

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.110
of those technologies to then again
 

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.520
of those technologies to then again
enhance societal growth and productivity

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:35.530
enhance societal growth and productivity
 

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.480
enhance societal growth and productivity
right what is happening today is that we

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.490
right what is happening today is that we
 

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.310
right what is happening today is that we
are in the early stages of the fourth

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320
are in the early stages of the fourth
 

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.830
are in the early stages of the fourth
Industrial Revolution and what is so

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:44.840
Industrial Revolution and what is so
 

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.980
Industrial Revolution and what is so
different between this particular

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:46.990
different between this particular
 

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.320
different between this particular
innovation cycle which is known as the

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.330
innovation cycle which is known as the
 

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.730
innovation cycle which is known as the
fourth Industrial Revolution and others

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:51.740
fourth Industrial Revolution and others
 

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.390
fourth Industrial Revolution and others
is that it is happening in a space where

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:55.400
is that it is happening in a space where
 

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.750
is that it is happening in a space where
three different areas intersecting right

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760
three different areas intersecting right
 

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.000
three different areas intersecting right
you have technology that is in the is in

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.010
you have technology that is in the is in
 

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.390
you have technology that is in the is in
does it intersecting with nature and

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:07.400
does it intersecting with nature and
 

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.970
does it intersecting with nature and
biology and also systems so you have

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:09.980
biology and also systems so you have
 

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.070
biology and also systems so you have
three different elements coming together

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080
three different elements coming together
 

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.760
three different elements coming together
and the opportunities that then become

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:15.770
and the opportunities that then become
 

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.660
and the opportunities that then become
available

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.670
available
 

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.600
available
for the kind of innovation that hi can

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:19.610
for the kind of innovation that hi can
 

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.060
for the kind of innovation that hi can
happen is completely different so that's

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.070
happen is completely different so that's
 

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.090
happen is completely different so that's
what you're seeing in rapid advances for

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.100
what you're seeing in rapid advances for
 

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.060
what you're seeing in rapid advances for

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:03.900
looking at what systems existed and
 

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.440
looking at what systems existed and
moving them and migrating them into new

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:06.450
moving them and migrating them into new
 

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.870
moving them and migrating them into new
set of systems that's what's happening

today with the move to cloud of course

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060
today with the move to cloud of course

today with the move to cloud of course
cloud has much more potential than that

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:13.950
cloud has much more potential than that
 

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.180
cloud has much more potential than that
but the early adoption of cloud is

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.190
but the early adoption of cloud is
 

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.950
but the early adoption of cloud is
happening in the space so if these are

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:18.960
happening in the space so if these are
 

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.020

Industrial Revolution it continues to

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.180
Industrial Revolution it continues to
 

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.230
Industrial Revolution it continues to
remain the same

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240
remain the same
 

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.949
remain the same
but the very interpret and use it has

but the very interpret and use it has
 

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:37.920
but the very interpret and use it has
changed over time so if you look at it

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:37.930
changed over time so if you look at it

on a cruise all of that is one of the

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:41.529
on a cruise all of that is one of the
 

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:44.250
on a cruise all of that is one of the
first few adoptions and manifestations

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:44.260
first few adoptions and manifestations
 

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.569
first few adoptions and manifestations
of mass customization the second aspect

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:48.579
of mass customization the second aspect
 

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:51.300
of mass customization the second aspect
is creating exponential value which

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.310
is creating exponential value which
 

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.150
is creating exponential value which
means that using the limited resources

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160
means that using the limited resources
 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.400
means that using the limited resources
or the resources that are available to

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:56.410
or the resources that are available to
 

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.819
or the resources that are available to
have a multiplier effect and that's what

00:15:59.819 --> 00:15:59.829
have a multiplier effect and that's what
 

00:15:59.829 --> 00:16:02.220
have a multiplier effect and that's what
is the second concept again something

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:02.230
is the second concept again something
 

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.000
is the second concept again something
very linked to productivity but in this

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.010
very linked to productivity but in this
 

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.280
very linked to productivity but in this
is not just about productivity this is

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:08.290
is not just about productivity this is
 

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.960
is not just about productivity this is
about growth and transformation and

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:09.970
about growth and transformation and
 

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.980
about growth and transformation and
that's what thinking about it from a

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:12.990
that's what thinking about it from a
 

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.900
that's what thinking about it from a
exponential value perspective brings him

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:15.910
exponential value perspective brings him
 

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.769
exponential value perspective brings him
right so the exponential value to larges

00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:19.779
right so the exponential value to larges
 

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:22.980
right so the exponential value to larges
lines of business within customers but

functions and when I when I first
learned about this and a couple of days

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:39.339
learned about this and a couple of days
 

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:43.019
learned about this and a couple of days
ago when I heard the introductory speech

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:43.029
ago when I heard the introductory speech
 

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:44.350

by your president

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360
by your president
 

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.460
by your president
he mentioned the word interdisciplinary

he mentioned the word interdisciplinary
 

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.949
he mentioned the word interdisciplinary
and I think that's where liberating

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959
and I think that's where liberating
 

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.470
and I think that's where liberating
ecosystems comes into play because you

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480
ecosystems comes into play because you
 

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.210
ecosystems comes into play because you

of what it can do right so earlier you
 

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.250
of what it can do right so earlier you
could imagine that but you couldn't

could imagine that but you couldn't
 

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.470
could imagine that but you couldn't
deliver it because the constraints that

have to understand what these changes
 

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.930
have to understand what these changes
are and make sure that these are signals

look like and believe me these kids who

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960
look like and believe me these kids who
 

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.420
look like and believe me these kids who
are participating these opportunities

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:45.430
are participating these opportunities
 

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.800

they know where to go they know how to

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:46.810
they know where to go they know how to
 

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.470
they know where to go they know how to
go but as society if we look at it in

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480
go but as society if we look at it in
 

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.230
go but as society if we look at it in
scale and the disparate systems that

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240
scale and the disparate systems that
 

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.910
scale and the disparate systems that
exist across countries and across

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:56.920
exist across countries and across
 

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.060
exist across countries and across
continents then the problem that we're

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.070
continents then the problem that we're
 

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.980
continents then the problem that we're
dealing with is totally different right

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:01.990
dealing with is totally different right
 

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.940
dealing with is totally different right
so not only do we have to envisage the

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:05.950
so not only do we have to envisage the
 

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.900
so not only do we have to envisage the
future and understand what is what what

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:09.910
future and understand what is what what
 

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.420
future and understand what is what what
that win is going to look like we then

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:12.430
that win is going to look like we then
 

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.150
that win is going to look like we then
have to translate it backwards to how

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.160
have to translate it backwards to how
 

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.250
have to translate it backwards to how
this is unfold and what can we do today

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260
this is unfold and what can we do today
 

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.930
this is unfold and what can we do today
that can prepare people for that future

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:21.940
that can prepare people for that future
 

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.620
that can prepare people for that future

field used to be what our organization

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:00.270
field used to be what our organization
 

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.570
field used to be what our organization
also was focused on but through an

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:02.580
also was focused on but through an
 

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.390
also was focused on but through an
effort where we created bridges between

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400
effort where we created bridges between
 

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.810
effort where we created bridges between
the research and the business

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:07.820
the research and the business
 

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.290
the research and the business
applicability of that we were able to

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:11.300
applicability of that we were able to
 

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.200
applicability of that we were able to
you know create a change and create a

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.210
you know create a change and create a
 

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:18.680

culture where innovation incentivizing

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:18.690
culture where innovation incentivizing
 

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:22.640
culture where innovation incentivizing
innovation became the theme so you have

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:22.650
innovation became the theme so you have
 

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.270
innovation became the theme so you have
to make big bets but you have to look at

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280
to make big bets but you have to look at
 

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.310
to make big bets but you have to look at
who your current audiences and embracing

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:28.320
who your current audiences and embracing
 

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.220
who your current audiences and embracing
risk means that you create those sort of

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:31.230
risk means that you create those sort of
 

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.100
risk means that you create those sort of
conditions that make it easy for people

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.110
conditions that make it easy for people
 

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:36.140
conditions that make it easy for people
to embrace risk if you performance

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:36.150
to embrace risk if you performance
 

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:38.900
to embrace risk if you performance
management systems or your appraisal

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:38.910
management systems or your appraisal
 

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:42.590
management systems or your appraisal
systems are going to ding you if you

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:42.600
systems are going to ding you if you
 

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.900
systems are going to ding you if you
fail then you're not going to have a

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:44.910
fail then you're not going to have a
 

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:46.600
fail then you're not going to have a
culture where people feel free to

culture where people feel free to
 

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:49.190
culture where people feel free to
embrace that risk so you have to have

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200
embrace that risk so you have to have
 

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.250
embrace that risk so you have to have
the right kind of culture right kind of

automobile sector or in the energy
 

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.550
automobile sector or in the energy
sector or in oil and gas we are doing a

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:28.560
sector or in oil and gas we are doing a
 

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.990
sector or in oil and gas we are doing a
lot of efforts that I can't talk about

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000
lot of efforts that I can't talk about
 

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.740
lot of efforts that I can't talk about
because of client confidentiality but we

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:33.750
because of client confidentiality but we
 

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.260
because of client confidentiality but we
are certainly right there so it is our

are certainly right there so it is our
 

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:40.240
are certainly right there so it is our
space will be where we can help our

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:40.250
space will be where we can help our
 

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:43.520
space will be where we can help our
customers reimagine how to move from

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:43.530
customers reimagine how to move from
 

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.260
customers reimagine how to move from
where they are today to adopt these

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:45.270
where they are today to adopt these
 

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.140
where they are today to adopt these
technologies and then bring it to their

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.150
technologies and then bring it to their
 

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.810
technologies and then bring it to their
customers there in consumer so that's

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:50.820
customers there in consumer so that's
 

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:51.950
customers there in consumer so that's
the space that we're gonna continue

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960
the space that we're gonna continue
 

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.380
the space that we're gonna continue
operating in but I wish I'm looking

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:54.390
operating in but I wish I'm looking
 

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:58.130
operating in but I wish I'm looking
forward to a day when a robo will run

01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140
forward to a day when a robo will run
 

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.100
forward to a day when a robo will run
the New York City Marathon so that's

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.110
the New York City Marathon so that's
 

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.530
the New York City Marathon so that's
that's something you know I'm looking

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540
that's something you know I'm looking
 

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.870
that's something you know I'm looking
forward to and so let's have one last

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880
forward to and so let's have one last

University students we should be
 

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.970
University students we should be
thinking about what's a number one

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980
thinking about what's a number one

so staying grounded having perspective

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940
so staying grounded having perspective
 

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.850
so staying grounded having perspective
is the starting point and then the rest

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:43.860
