00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.296
How many of us have ever seen something,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.880
thought that we should report it,
but decided not to?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.136
And not that I need
to see a show of hands,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.216
but I'm sure this has happened
to someone in this room before.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.416
In fact, when this question
was asked to a group of employees,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.936
46 percent of them responded
by saying that they had seen something

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.576
and decided not to report it.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.736
So if you raised your hand,
or quietly raised your hand,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.056
don't feel bad, you're not alone.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.456
This message of if you see something
to say something

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.256
is really all around us.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.976
Even when driving down the highway,
you see billboards like this,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.456
encouraging us to report crime
without revealing ourselves.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.216
But I still feel like a lot of us
are really uncomfortable

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.416
coming forward in the name of the truth.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.016
I'm an accounting professor,
and I do fraud research.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.216
And in my class, I encourage my students
to come forward with information

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.456
if they see it.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.216
Or in other words, encouraging
my students to become whistle-blowers.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.296
But if I'm being completely
honest with myself,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.936
I am really conflicted with this message
that I'm sending to my students.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.160
And here's why.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.800
Whistle-blowers are under attack.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.760
Headline after headline shows us this.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.336
Many people choose
not to become whistle-blowers

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.616
due to the fear of retaliation.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.336
From demotions to death threats,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.256
to job loss --

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.136
perpetual job loss.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.536
Choosing to become a whistle-blower
is an uphill battle.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.976
Their loyalty becomes into question.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.216
Their motives, their trustworthiness.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.976
So how can I, as a professor
who really cares about her students

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.096
encourage them to become whistle-blowers,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.680
when I know how the world
truly feels about them?

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.936
So, one day I was getting ready
for my annual whistle-blower lecture

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.176
with my students.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.336
And I was working
on an article for "Forbes,"

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.856
entitled "Wells Fargo
and Millennial Whistle-blowing.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.096
What Do We Tell Them?"

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.176
And as I was working on this piece
and reading about the case,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.576
I became outraged.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.736
And what made me angry
was when I came to the fact and realized

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.416
that the employees
that tried to whistle-blow

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.136
were actually fired.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.496
And it really made me think

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.256
about the message
that I was sharing with my students.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.096
And it made me think: What if my students
had been Wells Fargo employees?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.256
On the one hand, if they whistle-blew,
they would have gotten fired.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.616
But on the other hand,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.336
if they didn't report
the frauds that they knew,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.696
the way current regulation is written,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.296
employees are held responsible

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.616
if they knew something
and didn't report it.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.616
So criminal prosecution is a real option.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.816
What's a person supposed to do
with those type of odds?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.776
I of all people know
the valuable contributions

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.336
that whistle-blowers make.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.896
In fact, most frauds
are discovered by them.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.856
Forty two percent of frauds
are discovered by a whistle-blower

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.736
in comparison to other methods,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.336
like measurement review
and external audit.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.696
And when you think
about some of the more classic

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.336
or historical fraud cases,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.096
it always is around a whistle-blower.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.856
Think Watergate --
discovered by a whistle-blower.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.776
Think Enron -- discovered
by a whistle-blower.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.376
And who can forget about Bernard Madoff,
discovered by a whistle-blower?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.856
It takes a tremendous amount of courage
to come forward in the name of the truth.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.576
But when we think
about the term whistle-blower,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.256
we often think of some
very descriptive words:

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.480
rat,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.560
snake,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.816
traitor,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.216
tattletale, weasel.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.816
And those are the nice words,
the ones I can say from the stage.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.256
And so when I'm not in class,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.176
I go around the country
and I interview white-collar felons,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.216
whistle-blowers and victims of fraud.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.176
Because really I'm trying to understand
what makes them tick

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.800
and to bring those experiences
back into the classroom.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.536
But it's my interviews with
whistle-blowers that really stick with me.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.776
And they stick with me,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.096
because they make me question
my own courage.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.976
When given the opportunity,
would I actually speak up?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.976
And so, this is a couple stories
that I want to share with you.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.216
This is Mary.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.936
Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower
from the University of North Carolina

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.136
at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.616
And Mary was a learning specialist
at the university,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.656
and she worked with students,
primarily student athletes.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.375
And what she noticed,
when she was working with students,

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:34.136
is they were turning in term papers

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.256
that seemed well beyond
their reading levels.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.216
She started to ask a couple of questions

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.256
and she found out
that there was a database

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.656
where the student athletes
could retrieve papers and turn them in.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.136
And then she found out
that some of her colleagues

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.376
were funneling students into fake classes,
just to keep them eligible to play.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.136
Now, when Mary found this out,
she was outraged.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.096
And so what she tried to do
was go to her direct supervisor.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.976
But they didn't do anything.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.816
And then Mary tried to go to some
internal university administrators.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.456
And they didn't do anything.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.856
So, what happens when nobody listens?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.096
You blog.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.976
So Mary decided to develop a blog.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.656
Her blog went viral within 24 hours,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.176
and she was contacted by a reporter.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.496
Now, when she was contacted
by this reporter,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.296
her identity was known.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.656
She was exposed.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.496
And when she was exposed,
she received a demotion,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.560
death threats, over collegiate sports.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.096
Mary didn't do anything wrong.
She didn't participate in the fraud.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.336
She really thought
that she was giving voice

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.656
to students that were voiceless.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.056
But her loyalty was questioned.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.720
Her trustworthiness and her motives.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.856
Now, whistle-blowing
doesn't always have to end

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.576
in demotions or death threats.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.536
Actually, in 2002, this was
the cover of "Time" magazine,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.896
where we were actually honoring
three brave whistle-blowers

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.856
for their decision to come forward
in the name of the truth.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.536
And when you look at the research,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.136
22 percent of whistle-blowers
actually report retaliation.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.616
So there is a huge population of people
that report and are not retaliated against

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.160
and that gives me hope.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.936
So this is Kathe.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.376
Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerk
from the city of Dixon.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.056
And one day, Kathe was doing her job,
just like she always did,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.816
and she stumbled upon
a pretty interesting case.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.696
See, Kathe was at the end of the month,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.496
and she was doing
her treasures report for the city,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.576
and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell,
gave her a list of accounts and said,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.576
"Kathe, call the bank
and get these specific accounts."

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.256
And Kathe did her job.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.656
But this particular day,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.136
Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.336
She picks up the phone, she calls the bank
and says, "Fax me all of the accounts."

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.656
And when she gets the fax,
she sees that there is an account

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.816
that has some withdrawals
and deposits in it

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.296
that she did not know about.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.616
It was an account controlled only by Rita.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.616
So Kathe looked at the information,
she reported it to her direct supervisor,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.776
which was then-mayor Burke,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.560
and this led into a huge investigation,
a six-month investigation.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.216
Come to find out, Kathe's boss,
Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.456
Rita was embezzling 53 million dollars
over a 20-year period,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.960
and Kathe just happened
to stumble upon it.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.016
Kathe is a hero.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.736
And actually, I had the opportunity

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.136
of interviewing Kathe for my documentary,
"All the Queen's Horses."

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.496
And Kathe wasn't seeking fame.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.976
In fact, she really didn't want
to talk to me for a really long time,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.096
but through strategic stalking,
she ended up doing the interview.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.256
(Laughter)

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.496
But she was seeking fairness, not fame.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.136
And if it wasn't for Kathe,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.800
who's to say this fraud
would have ever been discovered?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.736
So, remember that "Forbes" article
I was talking about,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.665
that I was working on before my lecture?

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.256
Well, I posted it and something
really fantastic happened.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.976
I started receiving emails
from whistle-blowers all over the world.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.576
And as I was receiving these emails
and responding back to them,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.256
there was a common theme
in the message that I received,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.496
and this is what it was:

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.896
they all said this, "I blew the whistle,
people really hate me now.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.096
I got fired, but guess what?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.496
I would do it all over again if I could."

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.736
And so as I kept reading this message,
all these messages,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.576
I wanted to think,
what could I share with my students?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.176
And so, I pulled it all together
and this is what I learned.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.296
It's important for us to cultivate hope.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.256
Whistle-blowers are hopeful.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.696
Despite popular belief,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.016
they're not all disgruntled employees
that have a beef with the company.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.216
Their hopefulness really is
what drives them to come forward.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.655
We also have to cultivate commitment.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.535
Whistle-blowers are committed.

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:53.056
And it's that passion
to their organization

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.496
that makes them want to come forward.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.136
Whistle-blowers are humble.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.216
Again, they're not seeking fame,
but they are seeking fairness.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.096
And we need to continue
to cultivate bravery.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.696
Whistle-blowers are brave.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.416
Often, they underestimated

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.056
the impact whistle-blowing
had on their family,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.000
but what they continue to comment on
is how hard it is to withhold the truth.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.776
With that, I want to leave you
with one additional name:

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.120
Peter Buxtun.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.336
Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old
employee for the US Public Health Service.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.296
And he was hired to interview people

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.696
that had sexually transmitted diseases.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.776
And through the course of his work,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.736
he noticed a clinical study
that was going on within the organization.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.856
And it was a study that was looking
at the progression of untreated syphilis.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.656
And so, there were
600 African American males

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.896
that were in this study.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.496
They were enticed into the study

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.456
through being given
free medical exams, burial insurance.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.176
And so, what happened
through the course of this study,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.096
is penicillin was discovered
to help treat syphilis.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.056
And what Peter noticed was,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.016
the participants in this study
were not given the penicillin

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.536
to treat their syphilis.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.376
And the participants didn't know.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.576
So similar to Mary, Peter tried to report
and talk to his internal supervisors,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.336
but no one listened.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.776
And so Peter thought
this was completely unfair

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.376
and he tried to report again,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.056
and finally talked to a reporter --
very similar to Mary.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.376
And in 1972, this was the front page
of the "New York Times":

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.480
"Syphilis Victims in US Study
Went Untreated for 40 Years."

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.056
This is known to us today
as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.296
And Peter was the whistle-blower.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.376
What happened to the 600 men,
you may wonder, the 600 original men?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.376
Twenty eight men died from syphilis.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.536
One hundred died
from syphilis complications,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.416
forty wives were infected

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.296
and 10 children were born
with congenital syphilis.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.656
Who's to say what these numbers would be

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.776
if it wasn't for the brave,
courageous act of Peter?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.296
We're all connected to Peter, actually.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.896
If you know anybody
that's in a clinical trial,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.096
the reason why we have
informed consent today

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.240
is because of Peter's courageous act.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.816
So let me ask you a question.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.736
That original question,
a variation of the original question.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.856
How many of us have ever used the term

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.856
snitch, rat

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.456
tattletale,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.136
snake,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.656
weasel,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.880
leak?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.120
Anybody?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.696
Before you get the urge to do that again,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.536
I want you to think a little bit.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.440
It might be the Mary,
the Peter, the Kathes of the world.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.416
You might be the person
that could shape history,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.976
or they could be the person
that shapes yours.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.216
Thank you.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.000
(Applause)
