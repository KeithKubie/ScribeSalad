00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
one thing comes forward and he takes it

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:30.380 align:start position:0%
well in that see that's the thing and
 

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.740 align:start position:0%
well in that see that's the thing and
that's<00:12:30.530><c> what</c><00:12:31.520><c> I</c><00:12:31.580><c> was</c><00:12:31.820><c> guessing</c><00:12:32.210><c> the</c><00:12:32.450><c> probably</c>

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:32.750 align:start position:0%
that's what I was guessing the probably
 

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.450 align:start position:0%
that's what I was guessing the probably
going<00:12:32.780><c> for</c><00:12:32.990><c> is</c><00:12:33.290><c> that</c><00:12:33.500><c> even</c><00:12:33.860><c> though</c><00:12:34.010><c> you're</c><00:12:34.190><c> so</c>

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:34.460 align:start position:0%
going for is that even though you're so
 

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
