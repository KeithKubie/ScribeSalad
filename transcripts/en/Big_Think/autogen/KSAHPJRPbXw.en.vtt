well there are lots of indications that

well there are lots of indications that
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.700
well there are lots of indications that
there still racism in American society

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
there still racism in American society
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.250
there still racism in American society
if we look at overall indicators for

if we look at overall indicators for

if we look at overall indicators for
life chances life expectancy income

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380

wealth educational attainment and
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840
wealth educational attainment and
performance within schools we still see

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
performance within schools we still see
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.750
performance within schools we still see
discernible differences in performance

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760
discernible differences in performance
 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.730
discernible differences in performance
between whites and Asians and blacks and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
between whites and Asians and blacks and
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.519
between whites and Asians and blacks and
Latinos in the United States some of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
Latinos in the United States some of
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.990
Latinos in the United States some of
those differences are attributed to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
those differences are attributed to
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
those differences are attributed to
systemic or structural factors and to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
systemic or structural factors and to
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279
systemic or structural factors and to
the extent that we can explain those

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
the extent that we can explain those
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110
the extent that we can explain those
differences by systemic and structural

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
differences by systemic and structural
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.780
differences by systemic and structural
factors and we can that is evidence of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
factors and we can that is evidence of
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270
factors and we can that is evidence of
racism in American society in addition

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
racism in American society in addition
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.420

violence that we saw a century ago we
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529
violence that we saw a century ago we
still see examples of overt racial

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
still see examples of overt racial
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.900
still see examples of overt racial

has just released a report that
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869
has just released a report that
indicates that there is a lot of racial

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
indicates that there is a lot of racial
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.369
indicates that there is a lot of racial
violence in the south directed towards

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
violence in the south directed towards
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.040

and anti-immigration stances and so when
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060
and anti-immigration stances and so when
we see these things happening when we

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
we see these things happening when we
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.210
we see these things happening when we
see news incidences on the rise in 2007

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
see news incidences on the rise in 2007
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010

towards African Americans we can still

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
towards African Americans we can still
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690
towards African Americans we can still
say that there are still bigotry racism

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
say that there are still bigotry racism
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.380

demonstrates the power and influence of
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.399
demonstrates the power and influence of
the African American vote and it's

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409
the African American vote and it's
 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.510
the African American vote and it's
remarkable that African Americans have

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
remarkable that African Americans have
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520
remarkable that African Americans have
been able to exercise their political

years after the passage of the Voting
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609
years after the passage of the Voting

Rights Act it is a testament to the
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.289

increasing tolerance of non black

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
increasing tolerance of non black
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.969
increasing tolerance of non black
communities and putting their faith and

confidence in someone like Barack Obama
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.420
confidence in someone like Barack Obama
to be their President of the United

to be their President of the United
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249
to be their President of the United
States if we look at other candidacies

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
States if we look at other candidacies
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469

for the presidency for instance Jesse

Jackson's Democratic candidacies in 1984

Jackson's Democratic candidacies in 1984
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.200
Jackson's Democratic candidacies in 1984
1988 people were not prepared to elect

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
1988 people were not prepared to elect
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580
1988 people were not prepared to elect
an african-american president at that

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
an african-american president at that
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830
an african-american president at that
time so the fact that Obama was able to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
time so the fact that Obama was able to
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289
time so the fact that Obama was able to
make it past the nomination stage and to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
make it past the nomination stage and to
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.639
make it past the nomination stage and to
win the presidency shows tremendous

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
win the presidency shows tremendous
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.570
win the presidency shows tremendous
racial progress in this country

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580
 
 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.990
 
a post-racial society should we ever get

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
a post-racial society should we ever get
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180
a post-racial society should we ever get
there would be a society where when

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
there would be a society where when
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190
there would be a society where when
social scientists like me run our models

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
social scientists like me run our models
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290
social scientists like me run our models
and we include a race as a dummy

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
and we include a race as a dummy
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.420
and we include a race as a dummy
variable race is no longer statistically

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
variable race is no longer statistically
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.240
variable race is no longer statistically
significant and we're just not there yet

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250
significant and we're just not there yet
 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.830
significant and we're just not there yet
so anytime we run a model we see

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
so anytime we run a model we see
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680
so anytime we run a model we see
significant differences in some of the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
significant differences in some of the
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.790
significant differences in some of the
indicators that I mentioned before

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
indicators that I mentioned before
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.010
indicators that I mentioned before
education and calm life expectancy

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
education and calm life expectancy

of things and once those things are no
longer being predicted by race then we

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
longer being predicted by race then we
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.460
longer being predicted by race then we
can say that we're in a post-racial

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
can say that we're in a post-racial
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.550
can say that we're in a post-racial
Society but its health and people's race

their lives and as an aside for the

their lives and as an aside for the
president most people argue that his

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
president most people argue that his
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.510
president most people argue that his
race wasn't a hindrance to him and in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520
race wasn't a hindrance to him and in
 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.140
race wasn't a hindrance to him and in
fact it may have been a help to him

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
fact it may have been a help to him
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.720
fact it may have been a help to him
racism and racial stereotyping cut both

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
racism and racial stereotyping cut both
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.150
racism and racial stereotyping cut both
ways it can cut in negative ways and it

ways it can cut in negative ways and it
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.680
ways it can cut in negative ways and it
can cut in positive ways and so in many

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
can cut in positive ways and so in many
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.870
can cut in positive ways and so in many
ways President Obama represented the

ways President Obama represented the

think it does actually have the
potential to water down diversity and

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
potential to water down diversity and
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.660
potential to water down diversity and
