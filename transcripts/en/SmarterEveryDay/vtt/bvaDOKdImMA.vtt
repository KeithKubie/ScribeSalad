The following is for informational
purposes only don't be idiots like we are

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.830
Hey it's me Destin. Mechanical Engineer University of Alabama

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.540
Big loser, likes to play with rockets. This is
my buddy Stephen

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.890
Electrical engineer, not as much of a loser as I am. This is my other buddy Steve-o

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.810
wait, wait... Ok, this is my buddy Steve-o. And as you can tell from the red suspenders he's not a loser at all.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.200
This is my cute little three month old daughter Sadie.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.540
She helps out a lot ... [Louder and Deeper] because she's a pyro.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.480
Alright let's talk about stuff
you're gonna need to make

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.890
A cool bonfire. First find lots of a nice
lightweight string. You'll need a few strips of

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.880
glass tape,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.300
some refrigerator water supply line, an
unburned bonfire,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.040
an electric match, a rocket igniter,
rather large bottle rockets,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.259
and of course every twelve year old's favorite accelerant

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.470
"La Gasolina." Ok, first things
first you gotta build the devices.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.240
Take an 8-ounce bottle rocket.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.689
First, remove the stick and also remove the paper.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.399
Then, retrieve a one-quarter inch refrigerator water supply line.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.210
Then, tape it to the rocket.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.590
In the front,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.130
and in the back. Make sure to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.130
offset it so that when the rocket burns
it won't burn through the string.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.150
There, you made the rocket. Yeah, you're
a mega genius.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.510
Now there's only one other thing to do, make more... lots more.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.400
Now that your rockets are ready,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.710
prepare the target. As Steve-o demonstrates here,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.600
secure the denim string to the base of the bonfire. And then pull it back to a safe location from

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.950
which you can launch the rocket.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.090
Keep in mind that some rockets fly a
little farther before they go boom.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.970
Use the sitck that you broke off the
rocket to push the string

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.330
through the tubing. It's important that the
tubing has a chamfered edge on its inside,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.209
so that it can funnel the string through itself, rather than cutting

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.060
it as it flies down the line.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.010
Put the gas at the base of the fire, and remember [laughs] more is better.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.140
[Unknown announcer voice] Remember

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.330
kids, don't try this at home, [Destin] try it at someone else's home.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.330
Think that's enough? [Unknown] Add a little bit more. [Destin] Yeah... that's enough.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.860
Now that the target's set,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.260
here comes the hard part. Tape the electric match to the fuse on the rocket,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.330
making sure that when the fuse burns the
wires can fall freely.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.110
For this particular demonstration

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.640
We're going to use four rockets. That of course means we're gonna need four strings.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.490
You may wish to position the rockets from
different angles.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.260
For instance, here's rocket one, here's rocket two,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.900
here's rocket three, and here's rocket four. We've got them all set

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.010
and we're using, as all Alabamians do,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.820
my truck as the command center.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.560
Now, if you wanna somewhat
synchronize the rocket firings, you've gotta

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.510
run all the wires back to a central
location from which

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.950
you can fire them all at the same time. Now this isn't exactly

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.140
rocket science, now, if it were rocket science

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.200
we are rocket scientists. So that would be handy, but anyway,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.430
I digress. This is the hard part, make sure you wire

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.570
everything up safely, making sure you keep a short on the match at all times

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.170
until the moment you're ready to fire it. You can see here we've run everything back to a control

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.150
box so we can fire it at the desired time.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.950
If you have any doubts get your friendly
neighborhood electrical engineer

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.019
to wire everything up for you. Of course,

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.329
when he has trouble you can just go call a Mechanical guy to help you

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.639
since we're using the tailgate as a
staging point for the Rockets,

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.610
we here used the truck battery to power the circuit. After a few last minute electrical

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.040
checks, you're ready for one of two things, either A: fame and immortality in redneck lore, or B:

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.590
a Darwin award. 3... 2...

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.590
1... Fire!

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.479
So there you have it. I don't really know what you were expecting, but I'm sure this was

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.600
probably anticlimactic for you. But anyway,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.600
there you go, that's how you light a bonfire.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.590
Oh and by the way, this is just another
example that Christians can have fun

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.310
to, if you're interested to see how God lights bonfires,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.300
go to your Bible, read 1st Kings Chapter 18.
