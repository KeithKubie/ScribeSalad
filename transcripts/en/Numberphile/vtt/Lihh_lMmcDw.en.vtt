00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
We've been so lucky on Numberphile

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.460
of having Ron Graham talking about Graham's number.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.180
It was amazing that we could do that.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.740
And Graham's number was a famous number,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.820
that was the largest number, at that time, it was the largest number that have ever been used

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.820
in a proper mathematical proof.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.620
And then we had got Ron Graham to talk about it. It's fantastic

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820
"12 is not enough, it turns out,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.800
and this other, slightly bigger number."

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.800
But before Ron Graham, the number, the largest number that had been used in a proper mathematical proof

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.080
was a different number called "Skews" number, or "Skewes" number?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.580
It's a word that I've only ever seen written down, so I'm not quiet sure.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.700
But it's a large number, and I'll show you what that number is.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.020
10 to power 10, to power 10, to power 34.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.880
Now this is going to be a large number.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.460
This is a number that is something like trillions of trillions of trillions digits long.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.400
I mean massive, I mean googol, a googol is a hundred digits long,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.540
This is trillions and trillions and trillions of digits long.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.000
Right, so this is huuuge.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.200
So,  where did this number come from?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.380
So this number,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.460
was like the Graham's number of its time...

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.600
Such a huge number!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.520
I mean, even Issac Asimov wrote about this number.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.760
So Isaac Asimov,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.280
I've taken this from Brady, this is not mine, this is Brady's book,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.460
I took it off his shelf.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.060
Isaac Asimov, the, the, science fiction author,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.240
wrote about this number as well, wrote an article about it,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.080
in that kind of Numberphile-y kinda way.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.080
If there was a Numberphile in the 1970s,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.980
we would have had Isaac Asimov on, talking about Skewes number,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.460
which would have been amazing.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.180
Cameraman: That would be cool.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.460
I know, 1970s Numberphile would've been awesome.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.160
We would've had massive ties and sideburns,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.240
and we'd be constantly smoking.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.780
I wanna see that!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.360
Compared to Graham's number, this is tiny.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.060
But at that time, that this could-

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.040
I mean, I'm talking, this is before...

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520
we've had computers and things,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.100
this is a massively large number.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.100
What was the problem they were solving with this number?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.500
It was to do with primes and counting primes.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.560
So the classic problem which goes way back, to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.380
how many primes are there,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.940
let's say, less than a given number, right?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.560
So this goes back to Gauss.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.440
I've talked about this before, the prime number theorem, which is fantastic stuff.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.980
Primes less than x, which we write as pi of x.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.840
So this is not pi. This is pi as in p for prime, rather than p for perimeter

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.320
which I think is what the, maybe what pi comes from.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.300
So, if we do pi of 10, how many primes are there less than 10?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.760
Two and three and five and seven. Tell me if I'm wrong, all right?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.360
So there's four, so that would be four.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.180
And if we did, how many primes less than 100?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.400
I know this. There's 25 less than 100

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.820
And if I did how many primes are there less than, I don't know, a billion, then, less than a billiion?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.420
That number is 50 847 534 primes less than that.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.920
Now, Gauss, this, incredible, when he was fifteen years old,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.660
and you think he'd have better things to do, hanging 'round the shops or something,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.500
but when he was fifteen years old

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.640
he came up with a formula to approximate what this value might be.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:48.260
His formula, originally, was, this number is round about x over the log of x.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.900
That's the natural log of x. You might write that as ln of x.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.860
Some of you may have seen that. So this would have been like this.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.420
So this is an approximation, now, so, you know, it's a bit askew, it's not quite right.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.620
They did come up with a better approximation. I want to show you the better approximation.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.060
It was Dirichlet who came up with this, and his approximation

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.600
that the prime counting function is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.620
something called, we'll call it Li of x,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.060
it's called the logarithmic integral.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.960
It's a function. Some of you will not be familiar with what I'm going to do,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.620
which is fine, it's just a function, just say, you know, a clever maths formula for this.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.960
If you are familiar with what I'm doing, then you'll understand what this is.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.940
This is defined as the integral between two and x of one over the natural log of t dt.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.140
But yes, a formula, so there's a formula for it.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.680
So let's apply it, let's see what it does, let's do the same numbers, let's do 10.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.060
So let's change that to a 10, okay?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.980
If I do it for 10, I think the number you get is 5.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.480
Which is not bad, okay? So it's not right, it's not correct, but it's, hey, it's not bad, 5, and it's 4.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.440
If you do it for 100, you get 29.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.960
It was actually 25, so you're 4 off. It's pretty good actually. It's pretty accurate.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.080
And if we do it for the big number, and it gets more accurate the bigger the numbers are,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.420
so let's do it for a billion, if we do it for a billion, how close are we going to get to the true value?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.800
Which was 50 847 534, you get

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.760
50 849 234

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.260
You're so close, considering how big these numbers are,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.820
that is 1700 off, which is not much when you're talking about the size of numbers.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.140
So this is really quite accurate, it's really good.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.860
But it does appear, and you can see there, that this estimation always seems to be bigger.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.200
So always over-estimating. It's always bigger.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.320
And Gauss had a look at this as well, he said, Gauss thought, it always seems to be bigger.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.520
And he checked it, too. He checked it up to, like, three million, and it was always bigger.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.840
So, people thought your prime counting function was always going to be less than

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
this estimation thing we're doing.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.800
This is what they thought. Okay, that would be great.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.280
Until.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.260
Until

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.720
Littlewood, that's another mathematician. A Cambridge mathematician at the beginning of the 20th century.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.720
We're talking about a hundred years ago, 1914

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.380
Littlewood realized that it's not always true.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:49.480
That your logarithmic integral approximation sometimes isn't bigger. That and the quantity sign flips.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.740
It flips, and in fact it does that infinitely many times

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.540
throughout the numbers, but he couldn't tell you the first time it flipped.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.480
It must be something big, but he couldn't tell you the first time it did it.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.920
So this mathematician Skewes found a approximation or a bound

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.220
for when the first time this inequality finally flips.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.600
This number is his bound.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.960
He said, he's seeing, it must be less than this.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.240
It flips, and it flips at a value less than that number.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.340
He doesn't know what it is yet, but he knows it's less than that.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.980
Cameraman: "It could be a lot less."

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.880
It could be a lot less, exactly. It could be a lot less than that.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.540
But he knows it's not bigger than that. So the first time it flips.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:47.540
Now, we've improved this estimate since then. We now think that it might flip somewhere around

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:55.480
1.398 times ten to the power 316.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.720
And actually it made me think this is actually quite a good estimate for Skewes Number,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.400
the first time this flips.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.300
So, we're talking a number that is a googol googol googol,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.820
big number,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.220
we don't know exactly where that flip is, we still haven't found where that flip is.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.040
We're pretty sure it's somewhere around that area, though. We're pretty confident of that.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.540
We have found a run of integers where the inequality is the other way round.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.220
There is a run of integers between these numbers

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.660
1.53 times ten to the 1165

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.340
and 1.65 times ten to the power of 1165.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:49.000
There is a run of consecutive integers where this inequality is the other way round, by which I mean,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.260
your prime counting function is greater than the estimate.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:03.260
This is a example of thinking that because a pattern holds for a very long time,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.560
it's going to hold forever.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.600
And it turns out, no.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.980
So this is a pattern that holds, which we think for numbers going bigger and bigger and bigger

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.840
until they get into huge sizes of googols of googols of googols,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.480
and it appears that this inequality holds and then it flips.
