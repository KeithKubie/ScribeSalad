00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: I'm conducting
an oral history on behalf

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.250
of the American Folklife Center

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.890
of two North Indian or
Hindustani musicians.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:45.170
Sarod master Soumya Chakraverty
and tabla master Debu Nayak.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.640
Previously, they played at the
Library of Congress as part

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.420
of the Homegrown concert series

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.210
in May during Asian-American
heritage month and [inaudible]

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.350
of the American Folklife Center,
co-sponsored by the Library

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.560
of Congress Asian-American
Association.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.480
And now, we'll turn
to the questions.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.400
And I'd like them to tell me a
little bit about their early life

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.420
and how they got to the point
of becoming master musicians.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.180
And we'll start with you Soumya.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.060
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Thank you Yasmeen.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.230
And thank you for the introduction.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.370
So, I-- And I could talk a lot
about how I got into music,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.680
but the simple answer that comes
to my mind, and I think that echoes

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.730
with a lot of people of my
generation from South Asia,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.150
is they were kind of forced
into getting to music.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.850
And I used the word
forced into, because that--

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.160
it seems like a coercion
technique at that point in time.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.380
But then, that coercion
unbeknownstly became a matter

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.690
of love and falling in
love with the art form.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.160
Just like people are sent to
schools and, you know, apparently,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.450
I was brought into music.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.450
But for me, it's a little bit of
coercion plus also enticement.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.490
So, I come from a family

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.150
where I didn't have a
musical heritage with me.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.580
But, my parents were
both interested in music.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.460
They used to attend concerts,
festivals, et cetera.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.840
And I have two siblings,
both older than me,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.940
and also had other extended
family members living with us.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.270
And everybody was doing some
sort of music, playing some sort

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.760
of instrument or the other.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.250
And mostly, it was
string instruments

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.060
like violin, sitar, sarod, vocal.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.360
And they were missing
a tabla player.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.750
So, I sat-- And I was
enticed by the concept

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.380
of rhythm having heard live
concerts and as well as recordings.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.160
So, I started jumping in and
started keeping the beat.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.460
And how would I keep the beat,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.680
because I didn't have
tablas with me.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.070
So, I had two metal containers
of cereal boxes and baby food.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.980
So, those are my--
the dayan and bayan.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.630
And I use to sit and
play tabla with them.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.690
So, that was my initiation
into music.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.770
Seeing my level of
interest, my parents decided

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.990
that maybe I should have a tabla.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.220
And so, I was-- I started learning
tabla at the age of eight, I think.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.200 position:56%
And also have a brief stint learning
western violin at school because,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.340
you know, I thought it was cool
to, you know, go to chapel.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.560
I actually studied in a Episcopal
Methodist school in India.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.300 position:56%
And we had chapel service every
Monday and there was music along it.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.380 position:56%
So, I was very interested in the
chorale singing and the violin play.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.650 position:56%
So, my exploration into western
music also started at the same time.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.990
And I learned tabla for
about a year and a half.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.050
And, I can't say if I was very
good at it, but the concept

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.820
of rhythm came to my mind.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.940
And, around 11, I actually
switched over to the sarod.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.240
How that happened?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.540
I don't, again, know.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.230
That may have been
an act of coercion.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.700
It's been so many years, I
can't quite remember vividly.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.310
But, it took me a little bit of
time switching from the tabla

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.040
to the-- to a string instrument.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.180
But when it did happened
over a course of maybe three,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.730
four years of just readapting
to learning another instrument.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.660
And because of playing the sarod,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.750
and I'll say why a little bit
later during the interview,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.170
I had to give up on the
tabla and the violin.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.230
Because I, you know,
[inaudible] to go play the sarod.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.890
But, so, ultimately, the tabla
and the violin both diminished

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.830
and sarod became my
primary instrument.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.790
So, that, in short, is my journey.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.720
And how the journey began
almost, I would say,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.210 position:56%
37 years ago and it still continues.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.510
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: That's great.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.710
And how-- What's it about the
sarod that really attracted you?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.520
I mean, what made you give up
the other two and choose this?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.980
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Again, at
that point, when you're a boy of 10

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.510
or 11 years old, you just do
what your parents tell you.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.810
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.130
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And,
one day it's like, hey,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.840
you know, you learn sarod.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.050
And then, the other day it is the--
or maybe you start with the tabla,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.960
and then you learn the sarod.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.210
But that being said,
there were certain aspects

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.610 position:56%
of the instrument that attracted me.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.130
I think the sarod and the sitar
are probably the most common string

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.750
instruments in India, or
at least in Northern India.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:13.770
And I always felt that there was
a-- the gender gap between the--

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.690
those two instruments, the sarod
with its very deep sound kind

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.280
of sounded like a male, very
macho kind of an instrument.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.640
And what-- the ability to do a
lot of fast runs and, you know,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.020
the patterns like the
tabla was very masculine.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.040
On the other hand, I heard
the sitar beautiful as it is,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.280
I just felt more bias
towards the sarod.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.990
And that may have, you know,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.280
propelled me in that direction
plus some gentle cajoling

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.660
from my parents.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.960
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.260
Always helps.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.430
And you Devapriya?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.150
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
Where do I start?

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.300
My mom says that I started
playing when I was two

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.580
and a half, three years old.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.720
So, I did purposely
asked her this question,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.080
but when did you noticed me play?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.130
She said that, you
know, when you're two,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.110
two and a half you've
been always hitting

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.290 position:56%
against one thing against the other.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.410
And then, anything you get
you just start drumming on it.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.320
So, those days, it used to
be sort of like customary

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.580
that when the summer vacation
comes-- I grew up in Kolkata.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.200
And my parents-- my father,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.580
was in the West Bengal
Civil Service in Bengal.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.580
And so, when the summer time
comes, the holiday will start

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.260 position:56%
and we will go to my ancestral home,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.350
which is 76 to 80 kilometers
from Kolkata.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.730
It's a place called Punjab gharana
and it's a small principality,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:03.760
where my grandfather and
his ancestry came from there

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.160
and it's nothing but music.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.460
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Really.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.330
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: So, my
mom came from this family

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:16.600
and as she put it many times
that music to me is in my blood.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:23.660
So but, I don't know how this
particular instrument got ingrained

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.610
or I got sort of like,
drawn towards it.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.390
And then there are so many other
instruments which I was exposed to.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.350
My mother, she is a fantastic
sitar player when she was young.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.520
And, she played until, you
know, she was in her late 60's.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.820
But, coming back to when we used
to visit the ancestral home,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.660
I used to see my grandfather
practice,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:59.600
his brothers are practicing, either
sitar, vocal, surbahar, jaltarang,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.420
tablas, pakhavaj and flute.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.680
So, all these instruments were
being, you know, I was exposed to.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.050
And, I have seen my grandfather
was teaching three things.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:17.190
One, he used to first start the
morning with the vocal, and then,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.090
as he's playing vocal
he would play tabla,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.800
but I was always drawn
towards tabla.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.190
So, he saw this interest
in me and he said--

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.770
and while he was playing and
singing, other students gathered

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.700
around him, and they
were all just singing.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.290
And some of them are either doing
it on their leg or they're doing it

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.630
like this or they're
just doing this.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.930
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.110
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
Just to keep the beat.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.710
I got-- I don't know how, but
I somehow got drawn into this.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.090
And sooner or later, I
can't put my finger on it.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.730
But sooner or later,
a set of drums came

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.130
into the picture and
I started playing.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.840
So nobody really taught me, "OK,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.200
this is what you do to
play-- do this sound.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.890
Or this is what you do to do
this sound, or this sound."

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.310
It was just-- I mean,
naturally came to me.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.860
So before you know it, I was
already playing with them.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.900
And this continued for years.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.760
I don't know when it stopped.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.740
But eventually, they
saw the interest

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.190
in me, my-- both my parents.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:36.560
More-- so my-- From my mother side
and then, my father was very busy.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:43.980 position:56%
So she, at some point, when we moved
to Kolkata from one summer vacation,

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:50.760
she introduced me to a maestro
who was teaching close to my home.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.860
His name is Radhakanta Nandi.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.250
And he was coming close
to my home to teach.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:07.700
And I got into that class and,
you know, we started learning

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.730
and there-- so, there are a lot

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.820
of neighborhood kids
too learning tabla.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.360
But I somehow started excelling
in tabla and I would play

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.770
with different instruments.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.110
Probably, because I was playing
in my ancestral home and bringing

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.200
that knowledge, playing with other
instruments as well as vocal,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.610
as well as, you know, the
intricacies that goes with it,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.050
I'll bring all of that
and then put in practice.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.370
So that's pretty much
how it happened.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:47.070
And, you know, eventually I've--
as I aged, slowly, slowly,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.450
I was exposed to different
conferences, concerts and so on.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.340
So, that also has a lot of,
you know, influence on me.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.760
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Do you continue--
How does that work into music?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.730
Do you follow the school
of your first tabla teacher

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.610
or how do you decide what
style your tabla play or is--

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.110
I mean, when you talk about your
musical pedigree, how do you--

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.410
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.710
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- how
do you talk about that?

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.010
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.830
When you're learning it initially,
you don't worry about any of that.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.620
You just blindly follow
your teacher, OK,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.320
whatever the teacher
is singing or playing.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.130
We learned two things
simultaneously,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.950
the vocal part and the rhythm part.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.180
So, how does-- in may case at
least, how does, with a song

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:51.560
or how does with-- how does rhythm
fit into a vocal piece so to speak.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.860
We call it Bandish.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.160
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.590
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: In a Bandish,
how does the vocal part goes?

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.120
What is the rhythmic pattern in it?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.450
What is the-- they call it-- in
the tabla term, it's called theka.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.950
How does the theka takes
shape in a Bandish?

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.050
So, that's how I learned.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.900
Now, coming back to the question
of schooling, I mean, later on,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.630
I came to know that there
are six schools in tabla.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:26.510
But the school that I was learning
with my grandfather was Punjab.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.810
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.110
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: The school
that I came to learn later

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.250
on in Kolkata was Benares.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.940
So, I did not notice the
style-- stylistic difference,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.460
except when certain syllables,
much later I realized it,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.910
that there are some
differences in finger techniques.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.920
And we-- Initially,
when we're learning

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.690
in my ancestral home following it
blindly, when I came to Kolkata

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.540
after the holidays, we
will follow that blindly.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:07.980
So somehow, a style of my own got
created and I just ran with it.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.280
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.580
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.880
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And what--

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.250
How would you answer that
question about, you know,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.110
your musical lineage
in terms of style?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.410
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.710
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And
how you, you know,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.700
at this point, get to this point?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.320
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: So, I--
My creating has differed slightly

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.790
from Debu's that because
I pretty much learned

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.840
from one person belonging
to one school.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.560
We also have at least three
different musical lineages

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.180
for sarod, our schools.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:50.230
But because my training, even
to this day that if I've picked

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:56.940
up nuances, it has stayed
within our school of--

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.640
and our school comes
from a small village

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.040
in northern India called
Shahjahanpur,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.830
named after the Emperor Shah Jahan.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:11.420
And the Shahjahanpur technique
is very different from some

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:18.160 position:56%
of the other techniques, one being
Gwalior, again, named after a place,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.240
which the famous maestro of
Sarod, Amjad Ali Khan belongs to.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.700
And also, Maihar, which was a
much later school but founded

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.690
by the father of, again, the
legendary Ustad Allaudin Khan.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.410
So, these schools have different
playing techniques, but--

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.560
and I've heard them and
like he said, as we grow up,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.920
when you are learning you just
follow what is taught to you,

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.480
but as you grow up and as you
listen to different forms of music

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.810
and different playing techniques,

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.810
you start to discern
those differences

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:01.690
and either you can invite
them or you can choose

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.450
to retain your own specific flavor.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:11.890
I think, with the advent
of electronic music,

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.380
what has happened is the knowledge
sharing has become more profound.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.610
It used to be pretty much, you
know, based on the formal training

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.960
that one has from a teacher, and
say, if I learn a composition

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.140
or a particular raag, I would have
learned it from my guru or teacher.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.490
Now, I can just go on to an
electronic medium like YouTube

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.470
and can hear some compositions.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.240
And if I like it and I have the
capability of picking it up,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.080
I do pick it up and I can play it.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.670
Personally, I still believe

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.950
in somewhat keeping the
formal school lines just

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.920
because these differences that--
the lines would get blurred,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.050
but those differences, I
think, existed for a reason.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:05.600
And somewhere deep down I
believe in preserving that lineage

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.340
and being homaged to
the great maestros

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.770
that founded those
techniques and kept those.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.790
Now, as-- if I want to play
something outside of my school,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:24.320
I can but I should recognize and
acknowledge it that this comes

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.200
from a different school rather
than what I formally trained.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.500
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: That's true.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.450
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: So, that's a
long-winded answer, but hopefully,

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.520
that kind of explains how we kind

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.550
of respect each other's
boundary in terms of the schools.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.170
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah, and
it's kind of difficult to do

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.020
that nowadays because
there's such a--

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.320
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.020
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- the word
for it in Hindi is [inaudible].

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.320
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.620
It's a-- it is a

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.920
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: It's sort
of a mashup that is always--

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.220
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
A mismatch, yeah.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.520
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- possible.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.820
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: With the
way Zakir Hussain described

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.120
when I was learning from him--

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: From Zakir Hussain?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.720
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
From Zakir Hussain,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.070
and this is again different
style from Punjab.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.370
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.120
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: I came back
to Punjab much later again.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.210
In between, I went to
Farukhabad also and still do.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.080
But Zakir Hussain explained
this as cocktail gharana.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.380
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Cocktail gharana.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.680
Cocktail lineage.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.370
So now, it would be nice to
sort of segue into having each

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.840
of you talk a little bit about
your instruments and sort

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:25.850
of situate them in, you know,
the history of this particular--

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.670
and how it-- musical instrument
and how it is changing.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.420
If it's changing or if you adapt
it on an individual level if it,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.250
you know, how versatile these
are to change and in adaptation.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.550
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: So,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:47.980
the history of the sarod probably
goes back about 200 to 300 years.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.310
You know, when you consider how old
Indian music is, it doesn't seem

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:57.440
that old, probably just, you
know, somewhere on the middle

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.230
of the British era in India that
the sarod formally took its place.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:08.120
And there are many theories of
how the instrument came to being.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.160
Some said it was adapted from
other Indian instruments,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.710
some say it has its roots
in Persia and Afghanistan

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.630
and even, you know, Middle East.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.390
And the fact is that, I think,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.240
everybody is true to
a certain extent.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.780
There are certain aspects
of the instrument

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.720
that when you hear the instrument
or you look at its shape,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.910
you find similarities with
other string instruments

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.120
like the tar, the rubab, the oud--

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.090
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Could you be
specific about that in terms of--

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.390
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.380 position:56%
In terms of the fact that there's a
hollow air chamber, that there's a--

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.980
you know, ultimately
at the end of the day,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:55.060
any kind of plucked instrument is
a piece of string or some pieces

00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.040
of string that are one
between two knotted areas.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.630
So, you've got a peg, you've
got a, you know, eye here.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:11.110
But most of these instruments, the
tar, the rubab have a similar type

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.600 position:56%
of shape, a very rounded or somewhat
elliptical, in certain cases,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.240
a drum which has an air chamber

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.920
that amplifies the music
and then a finger plate.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.630
And they tend to be
fretless instruments.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.240
The instruments that were
traditionally developed

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.350
in India were fretted instrument.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.740
Most notably was the a
whole family of veenas.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:45.680
The veena is a instrument that's
made from two large pieces of gourd

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.550
which grows abundantly in India
and that's attached to a bamboo

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.100
or wooden finger board and
they have frets in between

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.910
and with the strings tightened
on both sides or by pegs.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.190
Now, because of these two
large gourds, it's kind of held

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.900
in an upright position and played.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.650
Now, there are obviously,
variances of these

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.380
but the veena produces
a very deep sound

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.470
that is amplified by the gourds.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:23.180
When there were some Afghan
musicians who were the rubabias,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.000
the rubab players,
they came to India.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.200
The rubab, if you look at a picture
of it and I wish I had a photo

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.850
to show you, it is actually
almost like a miniature version

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.150
of the sarod, looks very similar.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.840
The only difference is the drum
is elliptical and doesn't have

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.240
as many strings, does
have a few strings

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.470
and the strings are made
of either gut or silk.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:52.560 position:56%
And the-- Because the air chamber is
much shallow and also much smaller,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:59.450
the instrument have a very
dull, kind of a blunt sound.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.490
But I would also say it's a
little bit more earthy in nature.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.870
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Wasn't it
also an accompany on a--

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.170
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: It is.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.470
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- a
vocal accompaniment?

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.270
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: It is
a vocal accompaniment mainly

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.700
as a folk instrument.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.000
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And because
of there was not a lot of sustenance

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:20.460
in the note, it had this
kind of dull clangy sound.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.220
It was used to-- as almost like to
keep the beat and in some cases,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.730
acted like a percussion, although
not a percussion instrument.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.310
So, if you listen to a lot
of Middle Eastern music,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.620
you'll hear their rubab being
extensively played even today.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.410
So, these were the
rubabias that were like--

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.460
they were marching band
instrumentalists that came to India

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.840
and they settled down
somewhere in northern India.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.580
And they heard cork musicians

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.390
in northern India playing the
veena and also local music.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:58.070
And they got this idea of
experimenting with the instrument

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:05.160
to make it sound more like a voice
and to have build more sustenance.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.710
So in order to do so,
they start to experiment,

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.180 position:56%
make it a slightly bigger instrument

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.060
with the expansion
of the air chamber.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:21.920
So, you can see this camel hump, as
we call it, to expand this in a way

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.410
that it hollows out and
connects with the broader drum.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.670
Now, what that does, it
creates more resonance

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.860
and also the strings got replaced
with the advent of metal strings

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.440
when the metal drawing techniques
and metal strings being available

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.890 position:56%
for piano and for other instruments.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.130
Metal strings became
popular somewhere, I think,

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.760
I'm thinking 18th century and
even maybe later at 19th century,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.470
and they started to use them on the
sarod as well as other instruments.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:24:01.110
Now-- And the cover on the
drum, it's a sheep-skin color.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.410
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.130
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Because the size

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.260
of the air chamber being increased

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.940
and also another additional
air chamber-- this is all--

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.260 position:56%
serves both as the rest as well as
a kind of an additional air chamber.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.500
The sound of the sustenance

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.070
of the string [music]
increased significantly.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.220
And that allowed a lot of
melodic work to be performed

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.500
which we could not do
if you played in a--

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.420
with an instrument that didn't
have as much sustenance.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.510
So, what started to happen--

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.680
and then, the addition
of these little strings

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.320
that go underneath the
bridge, the main bridge,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.000
which are called the sympathetic
strings and they are for resonance.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.150
They're not actually plucked but
when you play a note by, you know,

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.650
this-- being in the same
frequency, it starts to vibrate.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.590
And by the vibration it
accentuates the melody.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.690
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And were those
adopted from sitar or veena?

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.600
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: They were
used in the veena, the surbahar

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:10.230
and also some of the other
types of rubabs that existed.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.340
The precursor to the sarod
was another instrument called

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.810
the sursringar.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:23.070
And if you look at it today, it
still is played in some provinces

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.940
in northern India, mainly the
Sikh religion, they use it.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.820
The rubab and the sursringar are
used for Sikh religious chanting

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.840
and they have sympathetic
strings, and they--

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.840
that's where the sarodias
or the rubabias originally,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.760
they started to get this idea.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.870
So, after a few rounds
of metamorphosis,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.490
they created an instrument, which
is very different by the way

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.850
from the sarod that you see today.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:02.900
And the-- So, initial sarods had a
very elliptical drum and the depth

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.770
of the air chamber was not as much.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:10.210
But over course of time,
with more experimentation,

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.670
there was more resonance
added to it.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.470
And it continue-- To
answer your question,

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.390
yes, it continues to evolve.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.550
There have been many
different variations added,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.850
like this rounded drum finally
came through the Maihar gharana.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.840
Although, I belong to
the Shahjahanpur gharana,

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:37.830
I play this round drum instrument,
which is an experimentation

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.080
that was [inaudible] and
made this drum more round,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.020
thereby having a more
rounded and deep sound.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.350
And, you know, these days with
the advent of electronic music,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.900
there's also, you know,
experimentation going

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.770
on with making electronic
versions of the sarod, which again,

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.550
I would call out back
if there's difference

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.730
between an acoustic guitar
and a classical guitar.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.310
Their sound is very different
instruments, they are both guitars

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.470
but they are very different
instruments.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.820
And likewise, the electric sarod

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.940
and the regular classical sarod
are very different instruments.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.570
So, that's a bit about my--
well this instrument, obviously,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.760
there's a lot of technical
details I can go into.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.690
But I'll see if you have
any other questions.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.400
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: We'll move on to
Debu for now and then come back.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.700
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: OK.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:35.950
So regarding tabla, tabla is
relatively in the annals of history

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.500
with other Indian percussive
instruments,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.520
a relatively young instrument.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:48.380
It happened-- In other words,
a tabla came to India as part

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.790
of probably the Muslim
invasion that took place

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.450 position:56%
in many times in the Indian history.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:04.650 position:56%
But it came around-- and there are
again, different school of thoughts,

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.310
it came around between
13th and 14th century.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:15.950
And during these invasions
from Persia to India,

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:20.970
a lot of learned men and
philosophers and musicians,

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:27.660
they also came and they remained in
India, never went back with them.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:34.690
One of these, I call
it saint or musicians

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.330
so to speak was Amir Khusrow.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.630
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: All right.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.930
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
And he was a poet also.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.230
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
And he was a poet also.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.530
And he wrote many--

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.830
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Many music, yeah.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.130
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: -- many--

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.430
he created many musical
instruments as well.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.730
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.030
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
So, and there are--

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.330
Anyway, there are different
school of thoughts

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.550
about Amir Khusrow being
the creator of tabla or not.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.490 position:56%
So, Amir Khusrow, one thing
they're, you know, and they do agree

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:04.820
on that here is a guy who came from
Persia and studied Indian music.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.770
And how did he do that?

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.990
By going to different places.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:15.080
And one of the areas that he
went was he used to listen

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.700
to the Hindu chants in the temples.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.740
And with the chants came a lot

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.050
of the musical chants
that he used to observe.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.860
And he used to observe,
not only the chants,

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.440
the way the melodic
structure was coming through,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.390
he also used to observe the musical
instruments that are being played

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:43.060
with these melodies and chants.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.830
One such instrument
is called pakhawaj.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.130
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yes.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.440
I heard this apocryphal
story of that.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.740
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.960
And pakhawaj is known
as the mother of tabla.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.260
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.560
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Why?

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.000
Because pakhawaj used to be
part of the particular type

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.040
of genre called dhrupad sangeet.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.270
And dhrupad used to be called
the original classical form

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.570
of vocal music.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.370
And pakhawaj used to
be played, still does,

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.700
and the people play
pakhawaj with it.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.310
But Amir Khusrow looked
at that instrument

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.220
and he had a different idea.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.520
He thought that--

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.920
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Maybe you
should describe what the pakhawaj

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.220
looks like.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.520
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah,
what it looks like?

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.820
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Well,

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.120
the pakhawaj is a cylindrical
instrument, OK.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.130
So, if I put it bluntly,
it will look like this.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:34.380
So, if you put it sidewise, it
will have a bigger head to play it

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.090
like this in a sidewise
way and played like this.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.390
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And
it's played with a slap.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.520
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And
the slap, et cetera.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.480
But, you know, I will come
to that when I will explain

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.980
to you the way the
finger techniques evolved.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.960
So, what happened was--
his idea was,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.010
this instrument could
be played better

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.520
if we sit in an upright position.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.480
Now, the geographical location

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.630
of Amir Khusrow at
this point was Delhi.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.660
And because he came up with
this instrument in Delhi,

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.760
the Delhi gharana started.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.770
So, Delhi school of tabla
playing started and the first guy

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.080
in recorded history that we know
of, his name is Siddhar Khan.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.100
And Siddhar Khan belong to
Delhi and he was living close

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.010
to where Amir Khusrow's dargah
was, where he used to live.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:37.000
And Siddhar Khan picked it up and
he started playing it and sooner

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.370
or later, a school was formed.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.310
Delhi gharana started.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:48.430
And as he was, you know, as the
school was getting older and older,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:53.580
different students came to learn
from him and then they would learn

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.020
from him and they would
find their own way

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.390
to tweak the instrument and so on.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.200
Speaking of the instrument
itself, the first instrument

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.190
in recorded history as I know it
is made of wood as pakhawaj was.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.660
He just cuts it into half,
put it in an upright position

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.780
and made it a bassy sort
of sound on the left hand

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.590
and on the right hand,
a sharper sound.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:27.370
The instrument is made
out of rawhide from goat

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.470
or sheep from-- the same for here.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:35.300
And these straps are
also from the same--

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.600
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Material.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.330
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: -- material.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.220
However, the chamber
in the left-hand drum

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.480
to create the bassy sound
at that point was wood.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.340
And then later on, as we--

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.740
as it evolved, it became clay

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.840
because the clay pot was
being played in the south.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.850
Somebody had this idea that
if we change that to clay,

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.990
the bassy sound would
be even more bassier.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:06.400
So, that was experimented
with, it went on for a while.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.030
If you look at the pictures
of old like 18th century

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.490
or 17th century tabla player,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.970
you will see they're
either wood or clay.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:27.870
It is around 1900 something,
1902, 1903, around that time,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:32.490
this experimentation
reached in the brass era.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:38.440
So, the brass came to replace
the clay for concert purposes.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.930
It makes them look good.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.230
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:42.530
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: It shines.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.990
It shines and the sound
gets heavier and heavier.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.580
And as-- If you notice the old
pictures, you will see that these--

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.020
the drums itself was a lot smaller.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.320
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.280
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And
so, as the metal enter--

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.590
as metal entered the picture, you
will notice that it became fuller

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:13.600 position:56%
and more rounder in shape and the
sound also improved along with that.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.530
However, in this case, it's still
is wood but they experimented

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.250
with different types of
wood and they found the teak

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:29.320
or neem wood gives the better
sound when you put the hide on top.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:35.320
And the one other thing, there
are lots of experimentation went

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.940
to get the clearer sound.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.470
[Background sound] There
are actually three sound.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.610
This keenar sound, which is the
shadj sound and the middle sound

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:49.130
which is called the maidan
sound, the swara of the tabla.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:53.210
And then the black ball sound,
which is the flat sound.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.920
And then, there's a resonating
sound, the conch shell sound.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:04.010
So these four sounds, also
they're in pakhawaj except

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.420
that it's played differently.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.240
Here, we rely most of
the time on the finger.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.030
We don't use the entire
hand for the tabla

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.510
and it's difficult in
an upright position.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.090
However, when you're playing
it like this, you're playing it

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.600
like this, this technique is used.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.900
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.200
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: So--

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.500
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Slap.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.800
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: -- this slap--

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.100
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: That's
start with the pakhawaj.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.400
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah,
that's the pakhawaj style.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.700
And they've come up with
the same sound [music].

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.310
This sound [music]
and tabla replaced

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.950
that with this sound
[music] and as you can tell

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.300
that this sound is sweeter
than the pakhawaj sound.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.670 position:56%
So, in terms of the sound technique,

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.500
a lot of experiments
are still being made.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.180
The Zakir Hussain has come

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.580
up with the fourth finger
sound, he's in tabla.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.320
And just a little bit
of detail, in tabla,

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.370
this is what we call the workhorse,
this finger, the index finger.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.440
The middle finger is
called the flat finger,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.990
which is used for flat sound
also for the swara sound.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:17.760 position:56%
The third finger is also used not in
some gharanas, not like in Benares

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.940 position:56%
for example, they don't use the
third finger, they use three finger.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:28.180
But in Farrukhabad and
Lucknow, these fingers are used,

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.710
so that the middle and the third.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.570 position:56%
So, Zakir Hussain has
experimented with this a lot and so,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.340
he now uses this one also.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:44.960
So, there are certain syllables
for playing fast speed syllable.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.650
He used this many times

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.940
and he showed us the
technique how to use it.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.310
For example, when there
is a super fast speed

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.370
of teental or 16 beats cycle going.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.670
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yup.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.130
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
And he is using it

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.990
and it's creating the
same amount of resonance.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.420
Of course, it requires
a lot of practice too.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:17.680 position:56%
But it's producing the same kind of
tone and the sound for playing that.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:25.040
And coming back to your question
on the technique part of it

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.780
that evolved from the
pakhawaj to tabla,

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:35.460
a lot of changes had been
made in terms of compositions.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.160
So, the composition that
originated in Delhi that is played

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:47.440
with two finger has now moved
east which we call purab.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:53.110
Purab baj means the style of the
purab, the style of the east.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.920
Composition has evolved.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.250 position:56%
Some are used for dance, for dancing
feet, of the court of the maharajas

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:07.460
and the, you know, different
principality later on.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.300
Some evolved just for
playing solo purposes.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.360
There is an entire
repertoire on play--

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.840
for playing tabla solo
which is called peshkar.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:25.050
Peshkar came from the same thing
as we understand, you know,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.950
the rhythmic format
follow a vocal format.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.020
So in vocal, there is-- when
the instrument is being played,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.470
there is something called alap,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.500
there is no rhythmic
expression there.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:41.340
So in tabla, peshkar is a
very meditative type movement

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.690
in the finger of drumming.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:48.780
And slowly, slowly it
builds it up to kaydas,

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.030
which is a fixed composition
and then to relas

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.020
which is fast composition and
then there are guts which is

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:02.900
like a composition that is divided
into three cyclical patterns.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.720
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And
these are just musical--

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.500
these are solely for tabla?

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.800
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: The tablas.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.100
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And
they have a history.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.400
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.770
And the history goes from place
to place to place and as you know

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.620
that those days, there
were no internet,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.210
there was no trains
or anything like that.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.680
So, the gharanas grew around Delhi.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.620 position:56%
So, from Delhi to UP, Uttar Pradesh,
which is the next state adjacent

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.580
to Delhi, these are
where the maharajas

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.400
and their courts were settled
and all the gharanas are

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.150
around like Delhi is the first
then came the Farrukhabad

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.710
and Lucknow, which is the next two.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.090
And then, a small village next

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.610
to Lucknow is called
Ajrara, which is number four.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.160
And they all have their
special type of techniques.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.470
And they specialize
on finger techniques

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:03.070
and then they teach their students
how to go about performing those.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:08.670
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So, it leads-- you
know, it makes me want to ask you

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.430
to play some of that for us.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.730
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Sure.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.150
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: But we're
not going to lose that.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:21.520
I'm going to go back to Soumya
and Debu mentioned a lot and so,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:28.300
I'd like you, if possible,
to talk about how, you know,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.250
a bit about the raga structure.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:37.170
As a musician, how do you approach
it, when you're going to play it?

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.510
The amount of, you
know, everyday talks

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.610
about how much improvisation
there is in indian music

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:52.930
but clearly during the concert
that you gave, you know,

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.110
you weren't improvising during
the performance, I would think,

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.800
because it was a short performance.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.520
You have to-- so, can you discuss--

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.820
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
I was improvising.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.120
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: During
the performance?

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.420
Such a short performance?

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.720
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.020
Yeah.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.320
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So, I mean--
I'd like you to talk about that--

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.620
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Everything about it is--

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.920
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And
how do you communicate

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.220
that between the two of you.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.520
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.800
So, I would say, in that
whole performance that we had

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.960
for about an hour, there
are these fixed, you know,

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.280
compositions that are almost
like used as motifs both

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.280
for tabla and for the instrument.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.780
And they have a certain cyclical
pattern, like if you would go back

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.210
to the pieces that I played,
the first composition was based

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.080
to a seven beat cycle
called rupak tal.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:46.080
And then the second one was,
you know, more faster, 16 beat.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.260
But the point is the embellishment
of those compositions as well

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.240
as the alap piece which is,
you know, I am [inaudible] kind

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.190
of from rhythmic pattern.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:02.400 position:56%
That's all, you know, improvisation.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.800
And if you ask me to
play it now again

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.570
like exactly the way I played
it, I would not be able

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.870
to play that, repeat that.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.960
Because it was, at
that point in time,

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.440
how I was thinking and
expressing already.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.790
The melody might sound familiar
because there's obviously the raag.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:24.240
Every raag has a different
way of movement.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:29.130
But it's-- This is where, you
know, I've worked extensively

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:34.300
with western musicians, Indian
music tends to differ a lot.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:39.240
Maybe somewhat closer to jazz
but the other thing I was going

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.170
to say at-- too, when Debu was
talking about the various schools

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:49.960
of music, is our musical tradition
has been mostly an oral tradition.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.990
And all of these things that--

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.400
He talked about the various
syllables and, you know,

00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:00.330
whether it's various melodies
or melodic compositions,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:07.830 position:56%
up until about 70 years ago there
was no written history of any music.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.690
It was all passed orally from
one master to their students then

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.210 position:56%
to their students to their students.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.800
It's amazing if you think about it.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:23.310 position:56%
And for a person to retain that
kind of music, whether it be melodic

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:28.540 position:56%
or rhythmic or whatever have you,
in their minds and heads and to able

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:32.410
to pass that from generation to
generation without losing it,

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.590
it's an amazing accomplishment,
human accomplishment.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:40.850
But then, you know, when music
was more formalized and especially

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.620
after independence of India when
it was being taught more openly

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.980
in schools, there was a
need to document that.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.240
And so, annotation
system came by but it--

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.670
again, so, because it was
an oral tradition, there's--

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:05.450
there was a lot of freedom
given to both the precautionist,

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.320
the instrumentalist or
the vocalist to express.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.020
It's a way of self expressing,
of course, there are boundaries,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.120
there's definitely grammatical
nuances of how you move

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.800
around whether it's a
raag or a taal scale.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:26.610
But then, it is all up to the
artist or artists to find ways

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.370
of expression within
those boundaries.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:36.090
And so, if I play a certain
raag that has a certain scale,

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.810
I liken that to a scale
in western music.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.180
But it is not like as formal
scale like you know it

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.270 position:56%
like you're playing a C minor scale.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:50.750 position:56%
Because even within the same scale,
there could be three different raags

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:58.120
and just the nuances created by
the rest notes and certain ways

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.010
that you move around creates a
whole different experience for--

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.890
from an audience perspective.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:12.810
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Could you-- Do
you have an example of like some--

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.350
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yup.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.000
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Speaking of
a couple of different raags

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.640
that use the same notes but
are played in a different--

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.240
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah I'm--

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.940
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Within a different
order to create a different--

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.680
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Absolutely.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.060 position:56%
I can play a few-- and these scales,
the basis of Indian classical music.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.740
So there are these 10 basic scales.

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.380
We, at least in north Indian
music, we call them thaats.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.660
And then the thaats are--

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.900
they're composed of like all
seven notes in the scale.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.690
And the raags when--
the ragas as created

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.960
by picking certain notes
among the seven note scale

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.660
and then creating some
patterns of movement so you--

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.250
the ascending and descending
pattern differ.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.510
So, a very common.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.040
[ Music ]

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.210
[Background Music] Sorry.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:15.940
I'm just too-- This is like the,
actually, electronic version

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:21.040
of a tanpura, which is a drone
which keeps my basic key.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.990
So, I'm in the key of C and
that's where I'm going to--

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:29.970
this matches my Sa and his swar.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.630
So, we're all in sync together.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.190
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:37.800
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: So, what
I'm going to do is play something

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:46.750
that is in the key of or
the thaat called khamaj.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:53.510
And I'm going to play what the
khamaj that, the notes are.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:47:02.040
[ Music ]

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.790
So, plain, do, re, mi,
fa, so, la, ti, do.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.110
The only difference is that
when I came back down the scale,

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.510
I used the flatter seventh note.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:20.040
[ Music ]

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:29.730
Now, using that and just by
removing certain things from--

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.850
as I go up certain notes
from the ascending--

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:36.700
from I ascend and then
positioning certain other notes,

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.180
I can create a raag.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:44.370
For example, if I omit
the second note in--

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:48.510
on my way up, which is
the [music] and just play.

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:55.040
[ Music ]

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.780
I've create-- this is raag
khamaj, which is very close

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.940
to thaat khamaj but
it's very different.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:05.330
So, I'm just going
to play a little--

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.510
a few bars then you can get
the essence of this raga.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:40.040
[ Music ]

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.290
So, that's khamaj.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:48.040
Now, what if I use-- instead of
the-- omitting the second note,

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.150
I actually going to use the second.

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:52.940
I'm going to omit the third note

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.510
and the sixth note
and let it sound like.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:30.040
[ Music ]

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.280
That's a very different
melodic picture

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:38.180
as you can well appreciate
to a khamaj.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.190
And it's called Rag Desh.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:45.150
So, using the same scale, I can go
from rag to rag to rag and then,

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:49.270
in some cases, you
know, there are notes--

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:55.180 position:56%
additional notes that are introduced
that are not natural to the scale,

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.350
they're called [inaudible]
swars or conflicting notes.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:03.510
So, for example, again, sticking
to the same thaat of khamaj.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:17.040
[ Music ]

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.150
Now, I've gone into another raag

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.280
that again has a different
melodic appeal,

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.870
it's called raag jaijaiwanti.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.800
And this goes on and on and on.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.100
So--

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.400
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So,
the thaat is the scale?

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.700
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
The thaat is the scale.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.030
So, it's seven notes.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.050
[ Music ]

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:39.680
And within that, I can
layer in different notes

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.470
and also the way I am
playing those notes

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.060
and accentuating certain notes.

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:52.810
Like for example, the
khamaj raag was based

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.220
where there was more accent

00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.510
on the third note [music]
and the seventh note.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:17.040
[ Music ]

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.630 position:56%
Whereas, in raag desh, the accent is
on the re which is the second note

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:27.510
and the mi which is
the seventh note.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:36.040
[ Music ]

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.950
So, there you can see that that--

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:44.000
and the two sentiments
of the two raags

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.390
in the melodies are very different.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:52.740
And that's how the
raags get developed.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:57.170
And it's-- These are
traditional raags and of course,

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.990
people tend to blend
different things

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:04.170
and create their own
raags in certain cases.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.750
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: How do
you decide what kind of--

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:20.450
what drum cycle or thaat is
going to be played with--

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:32.300
how do you guys decide that
with the raag if, you know,

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.490
if you're going to perform?

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:41.230
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: That depends on
the composition that it's set to.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:47.000
And that comes from the
person who has composed it.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.300
It could be him.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.600
It could be his guru--

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.900
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.200
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: -- or it
could be his guru but some raags

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:57.070
that are like-- it's always been
like that that came for ages.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.310
And that--

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:04.550
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: That it always
has a specific beat cycle.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.000
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
Yeah, a specific set.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.300
Yeah.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.600
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.390
But I mean, technically, you
could play any raag in any cycle.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:16.280
And, often, there used to
be a healthy competition

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.170
in the olden days when
the instrumentalist

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:24.610
or vocalist would start playing
and would look at the percussionist

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:25.910
to catch up and figure out.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.650
Like--

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:28.950
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:33.890
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: --
you need to figure out where.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:38.640
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And that
it's like a hide and seek game.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.910
You know, the tabla player, the
rhythm person is trying to figure

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:46.630
out what taal or what
structure it is set to.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:48.070
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:59.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And sometimes,
it takes almost three, four cycles--

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.930
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
To figure that out.

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:08.140
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Naya: --
to figure that out.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:16.320
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And does that
create sort of a healthy tension

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.080
within the-- between
the two players?

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.400
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: It is.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.700
It is.

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.000
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: It is.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.720
It's all playful--

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.020
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.320
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: --

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.930
but the idea is that if
you're worth your training

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.670
that you should be able
to figure that out.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:40.260
Nowadays of course, people
discuss it and play, you know,

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:46.890
beforehand when they were warming
up for that-- before the concert,

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.420
they'll have a discussion.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:54.170
And so, I would tell him, "Hey,
I'm going to play sevens,"

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:58.110
or "I'm going to play 16th."

00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:59.410
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: But would--

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:03.460
So, the instrumentalist would
always have a good grounding

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.450
in the percussion?

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:07.900
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Yeah and I think--

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.920
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: But are you
unusual and that you have had--

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.220
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: No, no.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.230
I think it's part of our training,
and it goes the same way with the--

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.630
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Could
you turn that off?

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:20.930
Yeah.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.290
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
It goes the same way

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.610
with the percussionist also.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:27.910
He talked about learning
vocal music.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:32.390
I think, the total training
of Indian music consists

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:36.120 position:56%
of the vocal component, the
percussion of the rhythmic component

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.750
and then if you are
playing an instrument,

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.120
you learn some other instrument.

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.420
In some cases--

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Actually, what I
was going to say is that, you know,

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.830
internally, when I'm
performing with somebody,

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.670
I'm actually singing inside.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.970
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Oh really?

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.270
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.570
And, you know, and I'm also playing
it through my hand but internally,

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.080
I'm actually doing-- going
through the singing part and sort

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.850
of layering the rhythm on top of
it, which I could hear internally.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.300
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Of
course, you have.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.600
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.900
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.800
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And
the melody is very important

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.920 position:56%
because not two melody is the same
and the type of theka that he talked

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:26.640
about earlier, you know, it varies
based on the type of melody.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.150
So, in case we have rehearsed it

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:40.100
and he has heard the melody then he
would probably have figured it out.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.960
But if we hadn't met each other
and we're meeting first time

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:51.830
on stage then it is really up
to the percussionist to listen

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:57.580
and that's why it is
so important to listen

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.000
to each other and figure it out.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.940
Again, I say this going
back to what I said earlier.

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.490
It's and old tradition.

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.790
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.090
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
It is based on--

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.740
and you asked a question as
to how do you keep in sync?

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.460
It's by hearing.

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.760
We are not looking--

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.650
Well, sometimes, we make eye
contact but mostly we're-- I'm--

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.950
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
You're listening.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:20.050
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: -- listening
to where he's coming in terms

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:24.120
of his rhythmic cycle and where
I'm at and we're communicating.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.520
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And basically,
what the music is saying.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.820
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So, could we--
would it be possible for you to play

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:34.640
and you to figure out what the--

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.940
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Sure.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.240
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- cycle is?

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.540
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.840
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.140
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Can
we-- and see that?

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.050
&gt;&gt; And you can turn the drum back.

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:45.540
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And you can turn--

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:46.840
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yes.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.930
Yeah, of course, I will.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.490
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And I just--

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:54.480
I was just going to
say one funny incident

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.400
that happened two weeks ago.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:02.450
There is a vocalist, I think, I
send you guys the invite to that.

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.750
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.050
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: The
vocalist came from Kolkata

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:07.550
and she is a young vocalist and
I have never heard her before.

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.520
I've heard over the
internet and stuff

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.650
but I've never heard
her real concert.

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:15.150 position:56%
And she started singing a
particular bandish, a particular gut

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.910
in 12 beats, but it's
faster 12 beats.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:22.370
But the 12 beats sounded
like 16 beats.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.090
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Because
she was singing fast?

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:26.560
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
She was singing fast.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.600
To me, it was more like 16 than 12.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.090
And she was singing it in
such a way that it was sort

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:35.600
of to play with me, I guess.

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.900
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.200
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
That was the idea.

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.310
And a lot of time, it's accepted,
that we don't know each other.

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:43.240
We are playing for the first time,
coming here for the first time

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:50.610
and then we perform and we
haven't had a rehearsal.

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:54.070 position:56%
So, that happened and I picked up 16

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.790
and then she said,
"No, no, it's 12."

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:58.090
So then--

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.380
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And how did she
say that while she's singing?

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.680
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Well--

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.980
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
No, she just whispered.

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.280
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Whispered.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.580
OK.

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.880
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.180
But it's all part and
parcel of the game.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.480
I mean, you're not
supposed to know everything.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.780
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.080
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.380
That's good.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.680
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: So yeah.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.980
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So let--

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.280
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And there's
another funny story I would tell

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.580
if we have the time.

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.880
This is in many, many years ago,

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.180
when Pandit Ravi Shankar
was a very young man.

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.480 position:56%
He and then, there was a very famous
tabla player Pandit Samta Prasad.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.780
They were playing in
a concert in Kolkata.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.080 position:56%
And they were in the living room and
Pandit Ravi Shankar had practiced

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.380
with him something
in 16 beats cycle.

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.680
When he went on stage--

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.980
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: He changed.

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.280
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
-- he changed it

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.580
to a 15 beat cycle called pancham
sawari, the same composition.

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.880 position:56%
He played with the same composition,
he just pick away one note and,

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.180
you know, that made it
to a 15 composition.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.480
Now, Samta Prasad had being heard
this thing-- and this was just,

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.780
you know, Ravi Shankar
playing with Samta Prasad.

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.080
He took off on a run
and without realizing

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.380
that Ravi Shankar is
playing pancham sawari.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.680
It's the same composition, and
just think of the brilliance

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.980
of the man that-- and of course he
lands on some place and, you know,

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.280
Ravi Shankar some-- and
this happened a few times

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.580
and in front of a live audience.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.880
So then, Samta Prasad just,
you know, stopped playing.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.180
And then-- And almost Ravi Shankar
would, you know, smile at him

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.480
and said, this is pancham
sawari and then they continued.

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.780
But the-- it emphasizes the point
of listening and the concept

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:51.080
of listening to each other.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.380
Yeah.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.680
&gt;&gt; I just had a question about--

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.980
but then, you can ask
and they can edit it,

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.280
about the vocalization you said
that you sing while you play along.

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.580
Are you vocalizing?

00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.880
Are you singing words?

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.180
Are you?

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.480
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: I'm
just singing the melody.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.780
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Which is--

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; You're singing the--

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: You-- he--

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: I'm
just singing internally.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.980
I'm not, you know, letting it out.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.280
&gt;&gt; But--

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.580
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: But on
the tabla, I am layering it

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.880
on that part that I'm
singing inside.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.180
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Are
you singing syllables?

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.480
Are you singing--

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.780
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
Just the melody itself.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.080
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Just the melody.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.680
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Just--

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.980
&gt;&gt; And when you would listen to
your grandfather and his students,

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.280
were they vocalizing--
they were vocalizing loud--

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.580
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.880
&gt;&gt; Is that right?

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.180
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.480
Yes, and during the rehearsal or
during the-- and it happens a lot.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.780
I mean, let's say for example,

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.080
he's going to play a raag
that is set to 7 beats.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.380
And the seven is not always clear
or accented, the seventh note,

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.680
you know, where it's
hitting the very first note.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.980
In tabla language, it's called sum.

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.280
And the sum is not
very clear where the--

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.130
in the gut or the bandish
is starting.

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.110
And it's purposely done that way.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:46.300
The composer have that in mind
that I want to keep it that way,

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.940
I want to create it that way.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.990
And that's the beauty
of the history.

01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:51.290
That's the mystery.

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:55.920
And so, when that was being done it
is creating confusion in the mind

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.300
of the tabla player so we
clear that up either the end

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.950
of the learning process
or during the rehearsal.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:08.880
But imagine if it is not
cleared up in either way,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.730
so we clear it up on stage.

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.860
So that there's no confusion

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.890
&gt;&gt; And does-- When
your vocalist came,

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:20.300
was she vocalizing with syllables?

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.600
Or was she singing chords?

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.900
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah
that's the question --

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: She was
singing-- vocalizing with the words.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.840
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.140
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.440
&gt;&gt; So you were-- with
some compositions,

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.740
there are words, poetry--

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.040
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.340
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.640
Vocal music has a, you know,
obviously has a language.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.310
Instrumental music does not have
a language and, you know, again,

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:45.310
there are two syllables in
sarod and you can create a lot

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.010
of different patterns with it.

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:49.740
But there's no language per se.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.560
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: But you do
say [inaudible] for singing?

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.860
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And then, for tabla
you have different vocalization?

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.360
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Phrases.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.660
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Phrases and for --

01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.960
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
But vocal music also--

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.260
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And for a sarod,

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.560
do you have different
phrases or different--

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.860
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.160
So, we have two syllables.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.980 position:56%
So, as I said, the down stroke which
is the [music] and the up stroke

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.060
which is the [music] and then,
with that, you can create--

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.100
[ Music ]

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.210
-- various types of pattern.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.400
[ Humming ]

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.080
But the point is that you can
layer it into any kind of music.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.380
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.100
And your vocalizations would be--

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.700
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: My vocalization
in terms of melodic part--

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.000
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: For the tabla.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.530
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: --
for the tabla is going

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:39.280
to see how it is matching
the melodic part that,

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.810
the tabla language is different.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.110
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah which is?

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.860
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: For
example, if I'm playing a na

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:50.140
which is this [music] or na tin tin
na [music] or na ton ton na [music]

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:57.290
or na te de [music], all of these
is matching the melodic part.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.590
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:02:59.890
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: OK.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:01.190
So, the melodic part
has Sa Re Ga Ma.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.490
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Right,
which is the voice.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:04.910
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And like he
said, there's seven notes, right?

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.210
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:09.240
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: I can match
those seven notes and come

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.490
up with a particular
rhythmic structure, right?

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:18.490 position:56%
But I am humming it internally to
match my rhythmic structure to that.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:19.820
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
But also, I think,

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.360
part of Yasmeen's question was
that you do have like a ball--

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.660
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes, yes.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.960
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.260
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: That the
ball is the rhythmic pattern.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.560
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Right.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.860
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
And that's also recited.

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.160
So, there is an oral
tradition of that.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.460
So, it is said in tabla and I
know this because I learned it

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.900
for a few years that you can only
play it if you can recite it.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.450
And you can only play it fast
if you can recite it fast.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.750
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.330
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: But as a tabla
player, you have to know your balls

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:53.060
as well as the melodic balls
and-- so, that's a lot of--

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.910
and if you got a down set and
the down set has different --

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:57.210
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Right.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:58.510
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: melodic balls --

01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:59.810
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes, yeah.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:01.110
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- and so, you
got to know what all of that means

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.410
and how it relates to everything.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:03.710
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Aboslutely.

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:05.010
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: --
which is pretty complex.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.570
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: --
make, sort of workout.

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.790
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Because the
one is the beat that is--

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:34.090

that, that's the beat you hear.

You may know everything
else might just sort of--

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.850
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And the
compositions in instrumental

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:46.030
or vocal music are also normally to
emphasize main note is that one--

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.230
it's the starting point
of the beat cycle.

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:51.890
Now, the composition may not
begin from the one but you--

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:57.010 position:56%
it's always the main emphasis note
and that's where the instrumentalist

01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:00.310
and the percussionist
hand off each other.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:03.740

that occurs throughout the--

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.040

just the beginning where the--

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.390
that note is emphasized
but throughout.

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:14.690
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.650
So, you may have something
that starts from the--

01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:19.500
maybe the ninth note
or the 12th note.

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.230
But the composition
may start from there,

01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:25.260
but the main note it
will always hit is the--

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.710
and I'm going to start
to demonstrate

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:32.030
that by playing something
so that you can see that.

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:36.790
So this composition that I'm
going to play in a different raag,

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:39.760
it starts from-- and I'm
going to give it away

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.470 position:56%
and it starts from the seventh beat.

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:46.810
But you can see that the emphasis
of the composition is going

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:49.510
to be on that first beat.

this case, that emphasize

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:48.640
of that composition was at [music]
that kind of that slow drawn

highlight of that whole--

my landing point and that's

it's the tabla player's language,

you're syncing both.

&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Well,
that would be great.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.190
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And
also, the fact that, you know,

01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:16.910
I think I made this point during
the concert of how we can start

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:21.390
from a very slow tempo and then
it builds up to the, you know,

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.510
the very fast tempo and
you can go on there.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:28.120
So, there's so many different
rhythmic patterns we talked about.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.420
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.130
There was 100 to 165 taals.

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:34.170
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So, this
one question I have though

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:37.150
about rhythmic pattern
and maybe especially,

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:39.420
I think, in the 16 beats.

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.530
They talked about the
empty beat, the khali?

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:42.830

you talk a little bit about that?

&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Sure.

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:48.030
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And see if
that is in the other beats

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.330
that you're going to talk about.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:50.630
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:52.100 position:56%
And you should talked about not only
in 16 beat but talk about rupak tal.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:53.400
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.700
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Because it starts from a khali.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.000
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.300
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.600
So, introduce the concept of khali.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.900
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:03.780
So the concept of khali or
emptiness are no-clap, so to speak.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:06.790
So, the way the 16 beats--

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:09.170
and one of the reasons it's
called the mother of all taals

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:13.590
because this is the first thing
we learn when we start tabla.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:14.890
Why do we learn that?

01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:18.380
Because within 16 beats,
all the other taals,

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:22.220
all the other major
taals are hidden.

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:26.770
So, it's sort of like a clue
to learn other taals also.

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:29.860
And that's where the
tali-khali concept comes.

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:34.110
And the way the-- the way
we keep tali-khali or clap

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:40.770
or no-clap is the very
first beat is clapped

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:45.540
and the fifth beat is clapped and
then the ninth beat is not clapped.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:51.460
And then the 12the, 13th beat
is not-- is clapped again.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:58.310 position:56%
So, the way we keep count of that
is one, two, three, four, five, six,

01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:05.890
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and one.

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:07.190

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:08.990

I use the tabla language,

the other taals are hidden in it.

the 16 beat alive,

there are rupak tal, seven beats,

nine beats and it gets
more and more complicated.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.840
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: But one
thing I'd like to clarify just to--

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.470
you feel-- I mean, he showed that
those other beat cycles can exist

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:49.510
within the 16 strike-- cycle.

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:52.350
But if you just want to recite

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:56.770
like he recited dadra,
which is six beats.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:23:00.270
And then, you want to show
that same counting, it's one,

two, three, four, five, six.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.300

blank technique comes

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.670
into other forms as well.

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:09.330

other beat cycles as well.

&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yes,
because if they're your major--

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:14.910
the reason why I didn't
go into that is

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:20.100
because here are my--
tintal is my major.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.940

major and then tintal within the--

does that work out on--

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.460
But the idea of the tali-kali
came from where there is emphasis

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:04.520
on certain beats and whether
it's softer or draw back on--

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.820
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Right.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: -- obviously.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.750
you still have to keep the beat
but, you know, since you mentioned,

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:14.730
there is also-- there
are certain beat cycles

where there is a blank
note, truly a blank note.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:23.180 position:56%
For example, there's a taal pattern
called dhamar, it's a 14 beat cycle.

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:28.000
The legend goes that it came-- it
was drawn from an elephant's walk.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.830
Now, so, why don't
you recite dhamar?

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:33.030
So, the dhamar tal is 14.

[ Humming ]

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:03.840

actually came from [inaudible].

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.640

particular taal used to be,

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.660
still is, sung with dhrupad, but
a lot of the instrumentalist--

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.160
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Let
him play and then I'm--

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.880
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: And
then he will do the melody.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.280

that is set with dhamar tal.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.510

As you can see the significance
with the elephant walk.

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:40.910

does definitely sounds.

01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:42.210

01:26:42.210 --> 01:26:43.510
Just like this kind
of poddling elephant.

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:49.140
And the idea is that because
of those two blank notes

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.580 position:56%
or blank rhythms, it can throw the
instrumentalist or the vocalist off.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.960
So, this is the--

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.260

So, I'm going to play a little
composition set to raag kedar

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:14.160

my teacher's contemporary,

Pandit Budhadev Dasgupta.

And this, again, this starts from
the eighth beat but we can again see

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:31.370
where the emphasis
of the melody points

01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:34.510
to that sound or the starting beat.

&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
No, but this is--

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:11.050
this actually gave you a
flavor of the ancient tradition

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:14.140
that they will talk about
which is the dhrupad style.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.440
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.740

there's a vocal aspect of this type

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:23.800
of composition that evolved
into modern day singing.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:27.040
But these are very, very
traditional and the composition

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.400
that I played is not
very old, obviously,--

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.700

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:32.000

it was made in probably
last 15, 20 years ago.

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:37.100 position:56%
But the fact is that that
composition reflects the traditional

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.230
style of the dhrupad.

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:46.550
And dhamar is a taal cycle that
was very extensively use in dhrupad

01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:51.010
as long-- as well as with another
12 beat cycle called cautal.

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:52.310

is dhrupad slower?

01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:53.750
Is it more-- I mean, what is it?

more meditative.

It's more meditative.

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:02.230
Actually dhrupad has a
very big component of alap.

01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:06.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: And even
before the percussion start playing,

01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:11.020 position:56%
there was almost like an hour to two
hours sometimes of just the vocalist

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.950 position:56%
or the instrument just playing alap.

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:17.240
And the alap section, you had
asked me earlier, I did not answer.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.760
There is a component of the
alap section, which is--

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.320
there are actually
four stages of an alap.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.930
At least, in sarod vocabulary.

01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:31.270
So there, the first phase which
is the most commonly heard,

01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:34.710 position:56%
which is without any kind of rhythm,

01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:37.440
just purely the bars
being introduced

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.450
and as far as being introduced.

01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:44.460
Then comes a part which
where there is a rhythm part

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.290
to it and it's called jhur.

01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:50.120
And this also came from the
dhrupad, the vocals music.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:57.790
Then, you start to, you know, use
some of that aspect of the rhythm,

01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:00.620
it's not set to the beat
cycle but, you know,

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.130
you can hear that there's
a rhythm part to it.

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:07.380
Or no, a mellow-- a
rhythmic aspect of it.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.680
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: To
the melody of it?

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:09.980

in a few seconds to
show or demonstrate.

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.290 position:56%
And then, it goes into, you know,
full embellishments like [inaudible]

01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:22.310
like you do the, you know,

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:26.230
rhythm except that it's
still at 20 beat cycle.

01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:28.670
And then finally the
very fast portion

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:31.570
of the jhala, that's also played.

01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:37.110 position:56%
So, I'm just going to again, play a
little bit of alap in the same round

01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:39.510
that I was playing kedar.

01:32:39.510 --> 01:33:32.040

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:38.180

brief alap, but you could--

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:43.560
you could see how this could be
elaborated to a significant extent.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.860
Then comes the jor portion.

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.160
How does that work?

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.960

&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And so
that has a greater beat.

01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:49.660

I'm actually keeping the beat

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:56.210
or the tempo more to
say not olny beat.

01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:59.010

up as I'm going along.

gets to a point that.

01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:57.060
[ Music ]

01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:02.470

there's a lot of [inaudible]

that is being [inaudible] but
again, I'm just keeping my own beat.

Not just [inaudible].

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:10.670

is the third phase of alap,

goes into fourth scales alap.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.680
And finally, there
would be a-- so this--

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:20.050
this whole tradition that is now
played today in instrumental music,

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:25.530
actually came from
dhrupad, so they do this

01:37:25.530 --> 01:37:28.590
through vocalization techniques.

01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:29.890
And they would recite both.

01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:31.190

[ Humming ]

01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:38.730
And then later on, this
actually walk into another form

01:37:38.730 --> 01:37:42.920
of singing called perana, which is
also taken from instrumental music,

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.430

a lot to-- back to--

have branched into different forms

the same thing with tabla,

when they are like-- the
whole concept of alap,

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.180
I raised it when I was
saying that when you--

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:20.480
when a tabla soloist is playing
table, he starts off with peshkar.

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.800
And peshkar is the alap of tabla.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:29.290
If, for example, he played
that four stages of alap,

01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:37.010
we also do the same thing when
we play solo and that happens

01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:40.760

of the peshkar is,

it sticks to the school
that it comes from.

01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:50.510
For example Delhi peshkar
uses more finger techniques

does it-- is it.

peshkar could be in any taal.

a little bit of --

&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
And, while he's doing--

01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:55.650
while they're doing the peshkar,
the instrumentalists or at least,

01:42:55.650 --> 01:42:59.660
I'm also trying to adapt
and play something similar.

01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:00.960
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.260
&gt;&gt; Yeasmeen Khan: OK.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.560
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
That resembles the peshkar.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.860
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.160
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: So, it's the
time where he's calling the shots.

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.460
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:08.760
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
Yeah, just the reverse.

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.060
Reversal of rules.

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:13.510 position:56%
And then the third stages which is a
little bit faster just like he does.

01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:38.320
[ Music ]

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.770
So, this is this the third stages,

01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:46.510
and the last stages
is the fourth stage.

01:43:46.510 --> 01:44:27.050
[ Music ]

01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:31.290
And we can develop this
also or in a bigger style,

01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:38.680 position:56%
but in order to develop this, you
need to play longer in a solo event.

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:39.980
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And, in-- OK.

01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:45.660
And in-- When you perform
together, say like in May, do you--

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:49.140
in the middle of your performance--

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:51.720
in the middle of the
performance do you--

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.870
when the tabla player starts
to showcase his playing--

01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:58.170
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Absolutely.

01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:00.220
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan:-- do you
then go sort of recreate --

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:01.520
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Lay low.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.820
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: --
lay low and sort of--

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.120
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah, you.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.420
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: --
to a semi peshkar?

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:06.720
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.020
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Yeah.

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.320
So, I'm actually repeating almost
playing over and over the same gat

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.030
or the composition,
the fixed composition

01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:12.560
and that's just to keep going.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.860
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Yeah.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:15.160
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
Just like when he--

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.460
when I'm playing, he's
keeping going,

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.760
we do the reverse along the rolls.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.950
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: And is this
sort of a modern development?

01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:23.250
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
No, it's been there.

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.550
That way forever.

01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:25.850
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak:
It's traditional.

01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:27.150
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty: Now, again,

01:45:27.150 --> 01:45:28.460
there has been some
healthy competition.

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:34.480 position:56%
So there's a concept of [inaudible],
where you can both go and improvise

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.780
without knowing where
each will say it,

01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:40.850
but in your head you
have the beat cycle,

01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:43.010
so you know where exactly
to come together.

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:44.310
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: OK.

01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:45.610
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:49.010 position:56%
And then, there's another thing, you
know, the reason why I said earlier,

01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:55.300
it's traditional, is because a
lot of schools for example there--

01:45:55.300 --> 01:46:01.040
for example Lucknow, if
you're playing a Lucknow badge

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.640
or Lucknow style tabla
player, and you know that a lot

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.080
of times the syllables
are harder, and it sound--

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.300
it's got a ringing sound to it.

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.670
Because they're used to
playing with dancing feet.

01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:18.020
And so, those-- the same tabla
players are going to play

01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.580
with instruments or vocal.

01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.750
In those cases, the vocalist

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:26.030
or the instrumentalist
they just let them go.

01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:28.510
And they just play free flow.

01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:34.180
And you can see those
images coming in their hand.

01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.480
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: That's fantastic.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.780
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Yeah.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:38.380
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: Well, I think
we're coming to the end--

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.680
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: OK.

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.980
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- on tape.

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:42.280
And I'd like to thank you both--

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.580
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Thank you.

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.880
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: -- very much.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:46.180
&gt;&gt; Soumya Chakraverty:
It's a pleasure.

01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:47.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: It's a Pleasure.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.780
&gt;&gt; Yasmeen Khan: There's no stress.

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.080
Maestros Soumya Chakraverty
and Debu Nayak.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.380
Thank you so much.

01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.680
&gt;&gt; Devapriya Nayak: Thank you.

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.480

Thank you Yasmeen.
