00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.050
One of the most important rules in
security is the rule of least privilege.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.080
Put simply, this means a user or

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.390
an application only has enough
permission to do its job, nothing extra.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.170
You've already experienced this
within your virtual machine,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.300
although you may not be aware of it yet.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.370
When we access our virtual machine,
using vagrant ssh.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.570
We're logged in as a standard
user named, vagrant.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.845
Let's try running a command only
an administrative user would be

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.180
allowed to run.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.230
Let's list all of the files with
in the ubuntu users ssh directory.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.720
You see, we get this error here,
permission denied.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.650
Only the ubuntu user or

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.360
the root user can read the files
within this directory.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.940
You may be thinking, but I am the
administrator of this virtual machine.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.120
I am root.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.650
So how do I actually log in as root?

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.590
It's time to learn about super user.
