00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:09.596
(BIRDS CHIRPING) MALE SPEAKER: THE TODAY
SHOW IS INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:13.406
THAT JANE AND TABER ARE WORKING ON.

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.046
JANE, OF COURSE, A BIOSPHERIAN.

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:16.836
AND TABER, A BIOSPHERIAN, TOO.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.786
THEY WERE IN WITH A TWO-YEAR GROUP.

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:23.466
UH, JANE AND TABER HAVE A COMPANY
THAT THEY'VE CREATED IN TUCSON

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:26.386
WHICH TO ME IS AN INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY.

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:29.556
THEY WANT TO BRING IN PEOPLE TO
A HUNDRED THOUSAND FEET ELEVATION

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.686
ON A BALLOON INSIDE OF A CAPSULE.

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:37.076
AND THEN DROP THE CAPSULE ON A GLIDER SO
THAT THEY CAN SEE THE EARTH FOR A BIT.

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:42.066
MALE SPEAKER: IT WAS REALLY A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
FOR THEM TO USE THE BACKDROP OF BIOSPHERE 2

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:46.676
TO EXPLAIN AND TALK ABOUT THEIR
ORIGINAL INTENTS WITH THIS FACILITY;

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:50.426
HOW ONE OF ITS KEY POINTS WAS
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AIR SYSTEMS

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:51.636
FOR POTENTIAL SPACE TRAVEL.

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:56.296
BUT ALSO TO HAVE THE FOLKS WITH THE TODAY
SHOW -- YOU KNOW, A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED,

00:00:56.636 --> 00:01:00.576
SYNDICATED SHOW -- UH, FEATURING
THEIR NEW COMPANY WORLD VIEW;

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.016
BUT ALSO FEATURING BIOSPHERE 2.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:05.706
MALE SPEAKER: WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE COLLEGE OF SCIENCE IN GENERAL,

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:10.456
IT HAS RESEARCH THAT IS JUST UNIQUE
AND INCREDIBLE, FROM THE TREE RING LAB,

00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:16.616
WHICH WE INVENTED, TO THE MIRROR LAB, WHICH
IS AMAZING, TO THE LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE,

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.466
WHICH IS THE BIGGEST TELESCOPE AROUND.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:24.426
AND THE BIOSPHERE JUST FITS THAT KIND
OF RESEARCH BEING THE BIGGEST APPARATUS

00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:27.296
IN THE WORLD THAT CAN DO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:30.836
MALE SPEAKER: MOST OF THE LABORATORY
OR FIELD SITES THAT THE FACULTY

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:34.846
AT THE UNIVERSITY ARE INVOLVED WITH OR
WORKING IN ARE NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:38.406
BUT, WE'RE OPEN EVERY DAY, WHERE THE
FOLKS CAN COME THROUGH AND LEARN,

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:39.846
OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:42.816
BUT, THEY'LL LEARN ABOUT THE SCIENCE
THAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW IT'S INTEGRATED

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.396
AND HOW IT AFFECTS THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:49.006
MALE SPEAKER: ALL OUR RESEARCH HAS TO
DO WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH,

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:53.396
GRANT CHALLENGES IN SCIENCE
THAT DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:57.046
WE -- WE NEVER SETTLE IN
THE KIND OF RESEARCH WE DO.

00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.236
AND FURTHERMORE, IT ALLOWS
FOR THE INTERDISCIPLINARITY

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:07.776
THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA
IS SO WELL KNOWN FOR.
