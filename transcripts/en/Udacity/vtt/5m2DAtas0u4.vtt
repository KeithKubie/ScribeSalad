Now, if you chose that you have to reload a

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.220
lot, you must not be used to developing on the web,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.060
you always have to hit reload a lot. But if

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.320
you chose the second option, you missed a subtlety of what

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.190
I said, you can't just touch the manifest file, you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.940
actually have to change the bits in the manifest file, with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.610
every resource update. The challenge becomes, that every time you update

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.790
any of the files in your system, you have to update

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.410
the manifest file as well. So ,even if you're just tweaking a bit of CSS,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.970
you have to change the manifest file as well in order for it to reload.
