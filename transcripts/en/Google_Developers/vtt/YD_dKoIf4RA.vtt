ERIC KOLEDA: Hello
and welcome.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.340
I'm Eric Koleda, and today,
we're going to be doing an

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.840
Apps Script tutorial walk
through for the tutorial

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.510
Building a Charts Dashboard.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.400
If you want to follow along
and you're watching on

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090
YouTube, click the link below
and you can go at your own

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.680
pace along with us.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.070
So charts dashboards are a way
to have multiple charts tied

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.010
together on the same
data source.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.170
And Google Apps Script allows
you to build and serve these

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.150
quite easily.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.549
So let's get started.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.820
The first thing we're going
to need to do is

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.150
create a new script.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.650
To do that, we'll visit
script.google.com.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.340
And if it's your first time
visiting this URL, you're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.780
going to be presented
with a little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.120
interstitial welcome page.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.640
Just click through to
start scripting and

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.790
you'll be right here.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.960
So the tutorial breaks
the script out in

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.660
the different pieces.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.140
And we're just going to compile
those together.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.820
Or if you want, you can take the
whole script, which is at

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.490
the end of the tutorial.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.640
So the first bit here is about
creating the data source.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640
Any chart is going to need
to have some data.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.680
And in a charts dashboard, all
of the charts share the same

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.860
data source.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.010
In this case, we're just hand
building this data out of an

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.360
array of names and genders
and some other data.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.270
But we can also get this data
from a spreadsheet or any

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.780
other data source you have.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.010
Next up, it's around creating
the actual charts

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.710
and controls objects.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.020
Controls are the little widgets
that allow you to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.930
adjust the dashboard.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.290
And then there's the chart
itself, which, in this case,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.940
is a pie chart and
a table chart.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.280
The next little bit of code
here, if we move on, is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.080
actually binding it
all together.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.050
So we're going to copy
and paste this.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.980
Charts in a dashboard all need
to be bound together to the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.950
same data source.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.610
And there's just a little bit
of configuration to do that.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.340
Lastly, we need to actually
create the UI app that's going

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.100
to serve this charts dashboard
and then return that as a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.080
result of this doGet method,
which is how you build a web

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.640
app in Apps Script.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.740
So with all of this code
pasted in, we're

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.820
now ready to go.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.110
So I'm going to save my code.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.710
And I need to give my
project a name.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.960
So I'm going to call
it Dashboard.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.830
And now, we need to publish
this as a web app.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.920
So in the documentation here for
this tutorial, we link you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.880
off to the guide on how to do
publishing of a web app.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.700
But we can just follow along
and do it right now.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.870
Before you actually publish your
web app, you need to give

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.290
a version to your script.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.930
This helps you ensure that
whoever uses your script is

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.830
using the stable version that
you meant for them to use.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.820
So I'll just create--

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.590
First version is the
label I'm going to

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.030
give to this new version.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.320
Now that that's done, we can
actually deploy this web app.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.940
We pick the version 1.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.760
We choose who it runs as, which
in this case, is going

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940
to be me, and then who has
access to it, and I'll say,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.260
for right now, just myself.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.560
And here's the URL of your
published web app.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.660
If we paste that into a new
window, we'll see that here is

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.980
our finished charts dashboard.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.330
So we have the same data set
being displayed in both the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.750
pie chart and the table chart.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.130
And using the controls
above, we can

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.020
actually do some filtering.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.800
So for instance, if we want to
take out the people who are

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.580
older in age, we can
drag this down.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.730
And you'll see that both
of the charts updated

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.460
automatically.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.670
Likewise, we can filter by
gender using this gender

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.560
toggle for just the female--

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.760
and we can X that out--

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.450
or just the male viewers.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210
We hope you enjoyed
this tutorial.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.120
If you want to learn more
about charts dashboards,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.430
there's more information on our
developer documentation.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.890
And come back for
other tutorial

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.030
walkthroughs in the future.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.280
Thank you and goodbye.
