00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:02.260
- When we first learned about glycolysis,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.255
we saw that if you start
with a molecule of glucose,

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.125
and you carry forward with glycolysis,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.904
that glucose, which is a six carbon sugar,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.592
it's got oxygens and hydrogens as well,

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.110
but it's a six carbon sugar,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.643
it gets split into two pyruvate molecules,

00:00:16.643 --> 00:00:19.713
and each pyruvate has three carbons.

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:22.679
And in the process of doing
so, we're able to produce

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.584
a net of two ATPs.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.816
We use two ATPs in the investment phase,

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.777
then we produce four
ATPs in the payoff phase

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:34.166
for a net of two ATPs.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.186
But that's not all that happens.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.679
You also have two NAD molecules,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.831
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.872
getting reduced to NADH.

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:47.081
And why is it getting reduced?

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:50.167
Well we see it's a positive,
it's a positive molecule here,

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.116
it becomes a neutral
molecule, it gains electrons.

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:57.300
So this over here becomes reduced.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.079
Now, the next question you might have is,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.009
"Well what happens next?"

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.374
Well if you're me or you,
you might continue on

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.910
and if you have enough
oxygen you'll continue on

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.742
with cellular respiration.

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:10.454
Things move on to the mitochondria

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:13.594
because the pyruvates and the NADHs can be

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.243
can also be used to produce more ATP.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.656
The pyruvate gets more broken down

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:22.140
in the Krebs cycle, also known
as the citric acid cycle.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.984
And also and that produces ATPs and NADHs

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.745
and the NADHs can participate

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.947
in the electron transport
chain which eventually leads

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.751
to even more ATPs being produced.

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.019
But what if you're in a situation

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:35.412
that maybe we don't have oxygen,

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.615
or maybe you're just like,
you're just the type of organism

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.980
that doesn't like to use
oxygen or doesn't know

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.034
how to use oxygen, what happens next?

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:45.844
Well what we're gonna
talk about in this video

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.736
is one potential pathway,

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:50.816
and that's lactic acid fermentation,

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.177
which is one of the two
major forms of fermentation.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:57.128
Lactic acid fermentation.

00:01:57.128 --> 00:02:00.158
Fermen,

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:02.363
lactic acid fermenation.

00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:06.241
And lactic acid fermentation
isn't so much about producing

00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.044
more ATPs, it's more about recycling

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:10.857
the pyruvate and the NADH.

00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:13.140
Even though the pyruvate and NADH can,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.533
it has free energy to give
that could be converted to ATP,

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.711
if we're gonna be doing
lactic acid fermentation,

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.713
we kind of give up on that,

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:23.940
and then we actually use the pyruvate

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.374
to oxidize the NADH

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:28.704
to become NAD+

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.654
so that we have more NAD+ for
glycolysis to occur again.

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.201
So organisms that do fermentation,

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:38.171
their main energy source
is the glycolysis,

00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:41.246
and then the fermentation
is all about recycling

00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:44.670
what it views as waste
materials, pyruvate and NADH,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.483
so that you can have more NAD

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.979
to have glycolysis occurring again.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.950
Now, you might say, "Oh
is this some strange thing

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.676
"that we don't encounter much in life?"

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:57.110
Probably everyday or
maybe at least every week,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.717
you probably consume some organisms

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.330
that perform lactic acid fermentation.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.400
This right over here, this
is a picture of yogurt.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.377
Yogurt is what we get when you have

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:12.745
species of lactobacillus
digesting the sugars in the milk

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:15.177
and then they're performing glycolysis

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:18.097
and then they perform
lactic acid fermentation,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.512
converting the pyruvate into lactate.

00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:25.002
Or if you view the conjugate
acid version of it,

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:28.451
lactic acid, you could say
pyruvic acid, lactic acid.

00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.047
Pyruvate is the conjugate
base for pyruvic acid.

00:03:32.047 --> 00:03:35.666
Lactate is the conjugate
base for lactic acid.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.418
But that's what's giving it

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.311
its uniquely yogurt taste,

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:43.747
it's this bacteria here,

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:44.612
the lactobacillus,

00:03:44.612 --> 00:03:46.886
this is just one variation of it,

00:03:46.886 --> 00:03:49.597
and there's slightly different
variations of lactobacillus

00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:51.457
that do each of these foods.

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:53.346
But this is yogurt, this right over here,

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.582
if you're into Korean
food, this is kimchi,

00:03:55.582 --> 00:03:58.107
this uses a variation of lactobacillus

00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:01.493
to once again perform
lactic acid fermentation

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:03.356
on the sugars in the vegetables.

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:05.480
This is sauerkraut, once again,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.067
a variation of lactobacillus,
a species of lactobacillus

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:12.144
performing lactic acid fermentation

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:13.660
on the sugars in the cabbage.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.037
Sauerkraut literally
means, "sour cabbage."

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:17.819
That's what it is.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.752
So let's think a little bit
more about what's going on.

00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:24.445
So as I mentioned, it's
all about taking your

00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:26.619
pyruvate or pyruvic acid,

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.712
the way I've drawn it right
over here, this is pyruvic acid.

00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:34.311
Pyruvic, pyruvic acid,

00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:35.687
right over here.

00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:38.133
Because we have our hydrogen proton,

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.515
if we lose our hydrogen proton,

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.648
this is the same thing drawn again,

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.708
but now we don't have
the hydrogen proton here,

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:45.852
this oxygen kept that electron,

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.443
and all of the other hydrogens,
all the hydrogens here,

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:49.510
they are implicit.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.919
So the three hydrogens here,

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.771
they're implicit on this carbon.

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:54.673
I'm just drawing it with
a different notation.

00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:57.282
And so this one, where
we've lost the proton,

00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:59.321
we would call this pyruvate.

00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.062
Pyruvate.

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:04.696
And what we have happening is

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:07.222
that the pyruvic acid, or the pyruvate

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:10.907
is used to oxidize the NADH,

00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:14.886
take away a hydride, take
away an electron from,

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:18.707
actually more than just electron but net,

00:05:18.707 --> 00:05:21.634
you have the NADH losing electrons.

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:25.138
And so if it's losing electrons,
it's getting oxidized.

00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:27.522
So it's oxidized.

00:05:28.581 --> 00:05:32.392
So that the NAD+ can be
reused in glycolysis.

00:05:32.392 --> 00:05:35.608
And when pyruvic acid
does this to the NADH,

00:05:35.608 --> 00:05:38.041
it gets reduced,

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.696
it gets reduced,

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.483
it gets reduced, it gains electrons

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:46.724
and, if we're thinking
about the acid forms,

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:50.060
it would turn into this right
over here is lactic acid.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.595
Lactic,

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.686
lactic,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.177
lactic acid.

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:57.952
And that's why we call it
lactic acid fermentation,

00:05:57.952 --> 00:05:59.377
'cause you're taking that pyruvate,

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:01.230
if you had oxygen around,
or if you knew how to do it,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.507
use the oxygen, you might continue on

00:06:03.507 --> 00:06:05.756
with cellular respiration
and use that for energy.

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.485
But lactic acid fermentation,

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.693
we use it to oxidize the NADH

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:12.908
so we get more NAD+.

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.820
And let's just now get
a better appreciation

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.070
for all of this happens.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.609
So the first thing that I want to show you

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.267
because a lot of times in biology classes,

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.725
you just learn NAD, NADH,

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:25.140
and it just seems like this
somewhat abstract molecule.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.252
But this is a picture of it.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.250
This is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.416
And it's kind of a mouthful,

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:33.608
but when you break it down,
you see these patterns

00:06:33.608 --> 00:06:35.200
that you see repeatedly in biology.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.895
This is, this right over here is

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.039
what gives us the nicotinamide.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.550
This right over here is
our good friend adenine.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.016
We see that in ATP, we see that also

00:06:45.016 --> 00:06:48.389
as one of the nitrogenous
bases in DNA and RNA.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.684
You have ribose right over here,

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:52.074
this is derived from ribose.

00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:54.867
You have a phosphate group,
you have a phosphate group.

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:57.651
So, nicotinamide, adenine,

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.581
you have a nucleotide right over there,

00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:03.640
you have another nucleotide
right over there,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.036
so it's nicotine adenine dinucleotide.

00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:08.336
So the name makes a lot of sense.

00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.514
But I wanted to show this to you

00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:10.962
to get an appreciation that it's

00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:15.518
a fairly involved molecule over here.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.683
You know sometimes when you
just see the letters, NAD,

00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:19.544
you don't get a full appreciation for it.

00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.275
And it's a coenzyme, and we learned

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.281
about coenzymes in other videos.

00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:27.058
Where the enzyme that catalyzes this

00:07:27.058 --> 00:07:29.403
is lactic acid dehydrogenase.

00:07:29.403 --> 00:07:31.924
And remember enzymes

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:36.610
are for the most part just
these big protein structures,

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.938
so all folded up in all different ways.

00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:43.445
And then you have the NAD,

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:46.010
the NAD,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.168
or in the case of lactic acid
fermentation right over here,

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:54.540
you have the NADH, so this
is the NADH right over here,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.664
and I'm just kind of drawing
what it could look like.

00:07:56.664 --> 00:07:58.425
This isn't actually what it looks like.

00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:02.352
It's going to react with the pyruvate.

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:04.032
And let me do that in a...

00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:09.203
It's going to react with the pyruvate

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:11.618
and by doing so, even though the pyruvate

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:12.848
you might formally consider

00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:14.579
to be the substrate of the enzyme,

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:19.315
the whole purpose is to get
your NADH to be oxidized,

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:22.381
to lose a hydrogen and an extra electron.

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.375
So a hydrogen proton, a hydrogen electron,

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:25.644
and another electron.

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.557
So really lose a hydride.

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:29.088
So how does that happen?

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.652
Well it happens because you
have this nitrogen here,

00:08:32.652 --> 00:08:34.978
it has an extra lone pair of electrons,

00:08:34.978 --> 00:08:38.743
so it can form, that lone
pair can form a double bond

00:08:38.743 --> 00:08:40.073
right over there.

00:08:40.073 --> 00:08:42.942
Well if that carbon, if
this now has a double bond,

00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:45.176
this carbon has to let
go of this double bond,

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.651
so that goes over there.

00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:51.182
That goes over there.

00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:54.044
And then if there's now
a double bond over here,

00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:55.548
is which we see in the end product,

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:57.409
this carbon's gonna have
to let go of a bond.

00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:00.318
And it lets go of the entire covalent bond

00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:02.917
with this hydrogen, so
both of the electrons.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:06.884
So it's gonna let go of
both of these electrons,

00:09:06.884 --> 00:09:08.211
right over here.

00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:10.221
And then both of those electrons

00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:14.812
can attach to this
carbon right over there.

00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:17.748
Now that carbon forms a new covalent bond,

00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:20.004
it has to let go of one
of its covalent bonds

00:09:20.004 --> 00:09:23.315
and so it could let of one of these

00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:25.060
double bonds with this oxygen.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.402
And those could either
go back to that oxygen,

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:30.283
or more likely, they can be
used to grab a hydrogen proton

00:09:30.283 --> 00:09:34.341
maybe from a passing water
molecule or hydronium molecule.

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.179
And so, I can draw it like this.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.950
Could grab a hydrogen, a hydrogen proton.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.843
And so what do we end up with?

00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:47.344
Well, that lone pair of
electrons is now there,

00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:49.695
we now have a double
bond right over there,

00:09:49.695 --> 00:09:51.247
now we've lost one of these hydrogens,

00:09:51.247 --> 00:09:52.785
I obviously haven't drawn
all of the hydrogens

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:54.042
in these molecules.

00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:57.716
So now we have, now we are back to NAD.

00:09:57.716 --> 00:10:01.336
And since this nitrogen has essentially,

00:10:01.336 --> 00:10:03.768
it was neutral before, but now it is

00:10:03.768 --> 00:10:05.377
instead of keeping these two electrons,

00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:06.908
it's sharing these two electrons,

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:09.644
so now it's going to
have a positive charge.

00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:13.370
So this is why we call it NAD+.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.144
It lost a hydrogen and an electron.

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:19.146
A hydrogen, the hydrogen's
electron, and another electron

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:23.064
so now it has a positive charge.

00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:27.207
And the pyruvate is now the conjugate,

00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:29.086
with the way I've drawn
it here, since we've,

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.964
I show it deprotonated,

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:33.852
I would say that this is now lactate.

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:35.074
This is now lactate.

00:10:35.074 --> 00:10:37.006
If we had our proton over here,

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:40.847
we would call it lactic acid.

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:43.777
So anyway, hopefully you
get a kick out of this,

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.908
I know I do, it's kind of interesting

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:47.142
that all of this can happen.

00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.603
Lactobacillus isn't the only
organism that does this,

00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:53.009
but this is a fairly useful
organism for all sorts

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:56.105
of delicious food that we have.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.350
I just get an appreciation,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.338
my mind's always blown that these

00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:01.824
fairly complex processes
are constantly occurring

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:02.891
in nature all around us,

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:04.582
sometimes even in our own bodies.

00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.641
And these organisms that we
would consider quite small,

00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:10.053
for example, this
lactobacillus right over here,

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:13.244
this is on the order of

00:11:13.244 --> 00:11:15.349
five to 10 micrometers.

00:11:15.349 --> 00:11:20.258
Five micrometers, so five
millionths of a meter.
