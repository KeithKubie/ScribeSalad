00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.240
Sometimes the worst nightmares are the ones
you don’t have.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.139
There are numerous conditions, disorders,
and illnesses that either limit or prevents

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.980
the amount of sleep an individual is able
to get.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.490
Many of them are quite dangerous, but none
of them are as frightening or rare as fatal

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.680
familial insomnia.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.300
Prion diseases are a category of rare fatal
brain diseases that can strike both humans

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.390
and animals.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.060
The disease hits the nervous system and impairs
essential brain functions, which can cause

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.480
memory loss, decrease in intelligence, personality
and behavioral changes, and insomnia.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.680
It is caused by an altered and mutated PRNP
gene, inherited from a parent, that manifests

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
itself in misshapen protein cells that can
pop up in brain tissue.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.710
In humans, there are five known prion diseases:
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.970
Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome,
Kuru, and Fatal Familial Insomnia.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.010
There are six known animal prion diseases,
including bovine spongiform encephalopathy,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.689
or more commonly known as “Mad Cow Disease.”

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.270
The first prion disease to be identified was
in the 1730s when sheep and goats in Great

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.530
Britain started to come down with a mysterious
illness that caused them to be irritable,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.100
lose weight, and become uncoordinated.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.780
The illness, which became known as “Scrapie,”
could kill off whole flocks at a time.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.749
Scrapie was only found in Western Europe for
the first two hundred years of its known existence,

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.070
but in the mid-20th century, a Michigan farmer
imported sheep from England and his entire

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.299
flock was killed off by the disease.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.969
Today, only Australia and New Zealand are
known to be free from scrapie.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.350
Like all prion diseases, Fatal Familial Insomnia
(FFI) is caused by a change or mutation of

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.899
the PRNP gene, which allows it to clump together
in the thalamus region of the brain, eventually

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.170
destroying the cells there.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.069
The thalamus region controls sensory and motor
skills, as well as regulation of consciousness

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.069
and sleep.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.429
The mutated PRNP gene “eats” holes in
the brain, giving it a “sponge-like” appearance.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.380
This can lead to the inability to sleep (progressively
getting worse overtime) and when sleep is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.070
achieved, very vivid dreams.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.239
It has been observed from EEG readings taken
while the victim is awake show signs associated

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.239
with REM sleep.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.209
Essentially, they are so sleep deprived, they
enter a dream-like state when awake.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.849
Other symptoms associated with FFI include
lack of controlled movement or coordination,

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.549
as well as personality changes.

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.000
Depending on the severity of the symptoms,
it is fatal within months or could persist

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.959
(and get worse) for a few years.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.750
The normal life span once diagnosed is 12
to 18 months, but it always leads to death.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.030
Oddly, the first signs and symptoms of FFI
don’t tend to develop until our 40s and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.030
50s.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.420
While no one knows for sure why the gene sits
dormant and does not mutate until then, doctors

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.970
have theorized that perhaps it is spurred
on or activated by the vulnerability of the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.560
brain during middle age.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.000
While no one knew it at the time, the first
recorded case of Fatal Familial Insomnia (though,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.170
possibly not the actual first case of it)
was that of a Venetian doctor in 1765.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.980
Originally thought to have died from “an
organic defect of the heart’s sack,” he

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.470
suffered from “paralysis” and long bouts
of not sleeping, symptoms that are consistent

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.640
with FFI.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.500
Not only that, as documented in the book The
Family That Couldn’t Sleep, he may not have

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.689
been the first member of his family to die
this way.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.220
The book goes on to detail the 200 year history
of this Italian family and their battles with

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.670
this rare genetic disorder.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.079
There have been other profiled cases of FFI.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.200
In 1991, a Chicago music teacher named Michael
Corke, shortly after his 40th birthday, began

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.620
to experience insomnia.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.620
As it got worse and worse, his physical and
mental health began to deteriorate.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.299
He was sent to the University of Chicago hospital
and was wrongly diagnosed with severe depression.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.120
The symptoms got worse and Corke became unable
to sleep at all.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.049
Eventually, doctors induced a coma.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.719
In the end, Corke died six months after the
symptoms began.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.879
Some years later, his case was featured in
the BBC documentary “The Man Who Never Slept.”

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.269
It is also unclear if there were others in
Corke’s family who suffered from this disease.

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.430
Another interesting story is the one of Vietnam
man Thai Ngoc.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.659
In 2004, he claimed that he hadn’t slept
for 31 years (since 1973) after being stricken

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.769
with a bad fever.

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.340
Despite over 11,000 sleepless nights, he claimed
that he suffered very little ill physical

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.440
or mental effects.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.940
Some have claimed that Ngoc is proof that
Fatal Familial Insomnia isn’t always fatal.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.561
Others, primarily doctors and experts, have
claimed that Ngoc is actually sleeping, he

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.140
just doesn’t know it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.420
According to Dr. Wadhwa, some insomniacs can’t
tell the difference between sleeping and being

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.280
awake and engage in very brief “micro-naps”
throughout the day.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.150
While many people fear flying, nobody seems
to fear sleeping in a bed.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.450
Yet in 2013, according to The Aviation Safety
Network, only 265 people around the world

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.030
who traveled via a commercial airplane holding
14 or more passengers lost their lives because

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.870
of a plane crash (out of about 31 million
flights).

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.690
In contrast, in the United States alone, according
to the Center for Disease Control, falling

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.780
out of bed accounts for about 450 deaths,
400,000 hospital admissions, and 1.8 million

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:55.910
emergency room visits each year.
