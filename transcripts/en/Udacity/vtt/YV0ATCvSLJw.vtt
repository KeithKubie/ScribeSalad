00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to homework assignment number 3.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is all about particle filters. All ask you three questions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Then we have a fairly involved programming assignment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here is my first question.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Consider the following world with 4 states--A, B, C, and D.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Suppose we wish to initialize our estimate with uniformly drawn particles.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My question is what is the probability that cell A is empty?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm asking this for different values of N--

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
N equals 1, 4, and 10.
