hey Bill this is Amy from Minnesota I

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
hey Bill this is Amy from Minnesota I
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.560
hey Bill this is Amy from Minnesota I
was wondering if when I was five years

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570
was wondering if when I was five years
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839
was wondering if when I was five years
old I did this science experiment where

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
old I did this science experiment where
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.539
old I did this science experiment where
we stuck a stick in salt water and it

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
we stuck a stick in salt water and it
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.210
we stuck a stick in salt water and it
made a crystal I was wondering if there

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
made a crystal I was wondering if there
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.040

that is a fabulous question

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
that is a fabulous question
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100

question and so you use the word

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
question and so you use the word
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.420
question and so you use the word
catalyst this would be a chemical that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
catalyst this would be a chemical that
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.850
catalyst this would be a chemical that
would enable another chemical reaction

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
would enable another chemical reaction
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920
would enable another chemical reaction

example is to take an egg take the shell

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
example is to take an egg take the shell
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160
example is to take an egg take the shell
off with vinegar and then put the the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

membrane contained egg in salt water
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790
membrane contained egg in salt water
and the water will go into the egg and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
and the water will go into the egg and
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980
and the water will go into the egg and
the egg will swell if it's in salt water

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
the egg will swell if it's in salt water
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.640

industrial scale and if we can do that
 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.629
industrial scale and if we can do that
Amy it would change the world we could

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639
Amy it would change the world we could
 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.150
Amy it would change the world we could
have all the clean water we wanted for

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160
have all the clean water we wanted for
 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.850
have all the clean water we wanted for
everybody over the world and we would

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
everybody over the world and we would
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.309
everybody over the world and we would
power the pumps with solar power barrel

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319
power the pumps with solar power barrel
 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:50.089
power the pumps with solar power barrel
photovoltaics solar cells and when the

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099
photovoltaics solar cells and when the
 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.980
photovoltaics solar cells and when the
sun's not shining you don't pump the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
sun's not shining you don't pump the
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.200
sun's not shining you don't pump the
water so you pump the water when the sun

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210
water so you pump the water when the sun
 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.809
water so you pump the water when the sun
shining and you fill up reservoirs all

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819
shining and you fill up reservoirs all
 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.469
shining and you fill up reservoirs all
over the world and so humankind could if

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479
over the world and so humankind could if
 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.080
over the world and so humankind could if
we if this stuff works out could have

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090
we if this stuff works out could have
 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.180
we if this stuff works out could have
access to clean water for the billions

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190
access to clean water for the billions
 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.760
access to clean water for the billions
of us that need it it's an exciting time

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
of us that need it it's an exciting time
 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.589
of us that need it it's an exciting time
Amy go get them become a chemical

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599
Amy go get them become a chemical
 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.439
Amy go get them become a chemical
engineer or material scientist and solve

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449
engineer or material scientist and solve
 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.750
engineer or material scientist and solve
this problem
