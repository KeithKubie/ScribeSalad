00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:04.966
&gt;&gt;Jeff Finch: Not only do we integrate
technology to the best of our ability,

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:08.336
but also we integrate the idea
of instructional coaching.

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.376
And we've found that
this pays dividends.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:20.646
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: It is important
that the idea comes before the tools.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.596
You need to have a good solid
instructional idea and then find

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:27.216
out how you can enhance
it with technology.

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:29.846
&gt;&gt;Jeff Finch: As a coach we
asked them to meet with teachers

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.116
and understand the big ideas.

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:33.616
What are your instructional goals?

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.746
What competencies do you want
to see these students perform?

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.796
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: How do you hope the
technology would enhance the relevance?

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:44.506
Does the technology allow students to
collaborate beyond the classroom walls?

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.686
Does the technology allow for
a certain kind of transparency

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:53.936
so a teacher can see more individually
how a student is perceiving a concept.

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:58.756
When you start to look at all of
these new technological approaches

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:03.036
and you can't wrap your mind them, when
you have someone else who can lead you

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:05.516
through the process,
show you some examples

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:08.116
that other teachers have
created that were successful,

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.666
it helps people kind of
bridge that resistance.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:15.576
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: When the school it
was already into utilizing technology

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.196
in a classroom, I was a
little behind everybody.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:20.496
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: Yeah, so you
could use the Flubaroo to grade it.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:20.866
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: Right.

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.706
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: Obviously, it could
uncomfortable situation for students

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.846
to talk about certain topics
in our wellness class.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.246
This is an STD project.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.876
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: We had the
students design their own websites

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:34.426
to teach peers about a specific STD.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.976
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Doing multimedia with
pictures and good statistics can really,

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.476
I think, make people listen more.

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:46.646
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: On our project tips
page we have "How to create videos",

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:49.946
different ways that they can
actually create a cartoon character.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:53.246
They do pressies, which
are kinda Powerpoints.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.686
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: If you're using a
graphic that has a lot of text on it,

00:01:56.776 --> 00:02:00.516
Animoto brings it up so fast that if
it's a graphic that somebody needs time

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.136
to think about and interpret, put it
on the wiki instead of on the Animoto.

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:07.546
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: They're pulling in
from various sources and they have

00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:12.126
to transform that content into
something that is visually engaging

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:15.266
and is presented in a way
that will reach students.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:20.416
&gt;&gt;Andrew: We just have to create a wiki
space that explains it and we present it

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:24.826
to our class and then they have to
fill out a quiz based on our research.

00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:28.626
Well, for me, at least this is our first
time creating a quiz for our peers.

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:29.926
So it's kinda cool.

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:30.566
It's intriguing.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:34.326
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: And this has gone
from kids being timid and not wanting

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:37.266
to even raise their head in
class and make eye contact

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.586
because of the things
we're talking about to

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:43.966
where you see them take ownership
in it and have fun with it.

00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:46.886
As far as technology, you
know, it got to the point

00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:48.676
where I became more comfortable with it.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:50.836
It's had an effect that
I want it to have.

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:51.766
So it was worth it.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:56.146
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: There's no definite
mandate of who I'm going to work with.

00:02:56.556 --> 00:02:58.366
It's really based on teacher need.

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:02.466
Sometimes I'm just there to help
support them, give them ideas

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:04.116
and let them run with it themselves.

00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:07.026
A lot of times it'll
be to map out a lesson

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:08.606
that we will be teaching together.

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.656
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: The whole point
of the lesson is to introduce them

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:15.386
to themes and the history on "The Great
Gatsby" so they can look at the pictures

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:16.826
and interpret them as a warm-up.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:19.076
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: Maybe we could
do three-two-one with them--

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:22.376
three observations you have, two
questions you have about what you see

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:26.216
in this photo, and one
connection you can make with today.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:30.126
Putting this in an EarPod will be easy
once we have all the images collected,

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.876
which will let them zoom in on them

00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:33.916
and they can really examine
the group of pictures.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:37.426
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: In the novel
there's the three different sections

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:40.396
of New York that are based on wealth.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:40.686
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: Okay.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:42.156
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: So that
could be the transition

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:44.026
into the distribution of wealth.

00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:46.406
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: Do you want
to do a survey with them, then?

00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:48.506
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: It
would be interesting

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:51.836
to get a graphic of their beliefs.

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:54.976
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: As soon as they
respond you get a nice pie chart--

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:55.056
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: Yeah.

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:56.606
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: And you can
shoot that back out to them,

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.896
which really gives good discussion, but
you can do it one question at a time.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:00.486
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mihalik: That's great.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:01.486
I say yes.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:04.936
&gt;&gt;Andrew Halter: I kind of act
as a conduit of best practices.

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:08.206
I take one idea from one teacher,
bring it to another teacher.

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:11.246
I help them with relevance
ideas as well.

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:16.656
Teachers don't have to know themselves
all the ins and out of how things work,

00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:19.806
but they need to understand
the collaborative tools

00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:21.066
that are available to students.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:25.136
There're ways that they can create a
lesson to engage these different types

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.736
of learners who've grown
up with technology.

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You can all pull
up everyone's work as they go.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:32.766
You're sharing your work with the group,

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.776
you're asking questions
and you're discussing.

00:04:35.586 --> 00:04:39.446
&gt;&gt;Trace: Teachers don't try to push
some kind of technology project

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.496
on you just to say they did.

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:42.806
And whenever they use
it, it makes sense,

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.606
it's beneficial to what we're learning.

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:47.946
&gt;&gt;Jeff Finch: I took a teacher
who was very creative and put him

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:50.486
in a coaching position where
he was freed of the bell.

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:56.826
He could continually explore the use of
technology and then co-plan all the way

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:58.206
through to teaching and reflection.

00:04:58.956 --> 00:05:01.596
It is building our capacity
for collaboration.

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:05.046
It is building our capacity to
integrate things thematically

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:06.966
and we're seeing the threads
that connect us as educators.
